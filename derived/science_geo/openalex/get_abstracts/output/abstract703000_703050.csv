https://openalex.org/W4307114720,"The recent development of spatial omics methods has enabled single-cell profiling of the transcriptome and 3D genome organization with high spatial resolution. Expanding the repertoire of spatial omics tools, a spatially resolved single-cell epigenomics method will accelerate understanding of the spatial regulation of cell and tissue functions. Here, we report a method for spatially resolved epigenomic profiling of single cells using in situ tagmentation and transcription followed by multiplexed imaging. We demonstrated the ability to profile histone modifications marking active promoters, putative enhancers, and silent promoters in individual cells, and generated high-resolution spatial atlas of hundreds of active promoters and putative enhancers in embryonic and adult mouse brains. Our results suggested putative promoter-enhancer pairs and enhancer hubs regulating developmentally important genes. We envision this approach will be generally applicable to spatial profiling of epigenetic modifications and DNA-binding proteins, advancing our understanding of how gene expression is spatiotemporally regulated by the epigenome."
https://openalex.org/W4307115802,"A fundamental question in bone biology concerns the contributions of skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSCs) in the bone marrow versus the periosteum to bone repair. We found that SSCs in adult bone marrow can be identified based on Leprcre and Adiponectin-cre/creER expression while SSCs in adult periosteum can be identified based on Gli1creERT2 expression. Under steady-state conditions, new bone arose primarily from bone marrow SSCs. After bone injuries, both SSC populations began proliferating but made very different contributions to bone repair. Drill injuries were primarily repaired by LepR+/Adiponectin+ bone marrow SSCs. Conversely, bicortical fractures were primarily repaired by Gli1+ periosteal SSCs, though LepR+/Adiponectin+ bone marrow cells transiently formed trabecular bone at the fracture site. Gli1+ periosteal cells also regenerated LepR+ bone marrow stromal cells that expressed hematopoietic niche factors at fracture sites. Different bone injuries are thus repaired by different SSCs, with periosteal cells regenerating bone and marrow stroma after non-stabilized fractures."

Although great efforts are put in developing novel therapeutic targets, the effective targeting drugs are still limited. Recent studies reveal the abnormality of Hippo/YAP axis play critical role in the oncogenic process of gastric cancer. It is of great importance to demonstrate the regulation of Hippo signaling activity and YAP protein turnover in gastric cancer. Besides, the phosphorylation cascade on YAP function, which has been thoroughly investigated, the ubiquitination of YAP is also important in Hippo signaling status. Here, We utilized the DUB (Deubiquitinase) siRNA library to identify critical DUB for Hippo signaling. We discovered OTUB1 as a critical factor to facilitate gastric cancer cell stemness and progression, which deubiquitinated and stabilized YAP protein. The clinical data analysis implicated OTUB1 was higher expressed in gastric cancer, which correlated with YAP activity and poor survival. OUTB1 interacted with YAP protein via its OTU domain (Ovarian tumor domain) and deubiquitinated YAP at several lysine sites (K90, K280, K343, K494 and K497), which subsequently inhibited YAP degradation. Our study revealed a novel deubiquitinase of Hippo/YAP axis and one possible therapeutic target for YAP-driven gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4307116042,"The hippocampal CA2 region plays a key role in social memory. The encoding of such memory involves afferent activity from the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to CA2. However, the neuronal circuits required for consolidation of freshly encoded social memory remain unknown. Here, we used circuit-specific optical and single-cell electrophysiological recordings in mice to explore the role of sleep in social memory consolidation and its underlying circuit mechanism. We found that SuM neurons projecting to CA2 were highly active during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep but not during non-REM sleep or quiet wakefulness. REM-sleep-selective optogenetic silencing of these neurons impaired social memory. By contrast, the silencing of another group of REM sleep-active SuM neurons that projects to the dentate gyrus had no effect on social memory. Therefore, we provide causal evidence that the REM sleep-active hypothalamic neurons that project to CA2 are specifically required for the consolidation of social memory."
https://openalex.org/W4307036036,"Infection, trauma, and autoimmunity trigger tissue inflammation, often leading to pain and loss of function. Therefore, approaches to control inflammation based on nanotechnology principles are being developed in addition to available methods. The metal-based nanoparticles are particularly attractive due to the ease of synthesis, control over physicochemical properties, and facile surface modification with different types of molecules. Here, we report curcumin conjugated silver (Cur-Ag) nanoparticles synthesis, followed by their surface functionalization with isoniazid, tyrosine, and quercetin, leading to Cur-AgINH, Cur-AgTyr, and Cur-AgQrc nanoparticles, respectively. These nanoparticles possess radical scavenging capacity, haemocompatibility, and minimal cytotoxicity to macrophages. Furthermore, the nanoparticles inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β from macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The findings reveal that the careful design of surface corona of nanoparticles could be critical to increasing their efficacy in biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4306931889,"Cav3 T-type calcium channels from great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis have a selectivity-filter ring of five acidic residues, EE(D)DD. Splice variants with exons 12b or 12a spanning the extracellular loop between the outer helix IIS5 and membrane-descending pore helix IIP1 (IIS5-P1) in Domain II of the pore module possess calcium selectivity or dominant sodium permeability, respectively. Here, we use AlphaFold2 neural network software to predict that a lysine residue in exon 12a is salt-bridged to the aspartate residue immediately C terminal to the second-domain glutamate in the selectivity filter. Exon 12b has a similar folding but with an alanine residue in place of lysine in exon 12a. We express LCav3 channels with mutated exons Ala-12b-Lys and Lys-12a-Ala and demonstrate that they switch the ion preference to high sodium permeability and calcium selectivity, respectively. We propose that in the calcium-selective variants, a calcium ion chelated between Domain II selectivity-filter glutamate and aspartate is knocked-out by the incoming calcium ion in the process of calcium permeation, whereas sodium ions are repelled. The aspartate is neutralized by the lysine residue in the sodium-permeant variants, allowing for sodium permeation through the selectivity-filter ring of four negatively charged residues akin to the prokaryotic sodium channels with four glutamates in the selectivity filter. The evolutionary adaptation in invertebrate LCav3 channels highlight the involvement of a key, ubiquitous aspartate, ""a calcium beacon"" of sorts in the outer pore of Domain II, as determinative for the calcium ion preference over sodium ions through eukaryotic Cav1, Cav2, and Cav3 channels."
https://openalex.org/W4307002278,"Breast cancer is the second most frequent cancer worldwide, following lung cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death and a major cause of cancer death among women. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied for the diagnosis of breast cancer using different imaging modalities. Pooling is a main data processing step in CNN that decreases the feature maps' dimensionality without losing major patterns. However, the effect of pooling layer was not studied efficiently in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel design for the pooling layer called vector pooling block (VPB) for the CCN algorithm. The proposed VPB consists of two data pathways, which focus on extracting features along horizontal and vertical orientations. The VPB makes the CNNs able to collect both global and local features by including long and narrow pooling kernels, which is different from the traditional pooling layer, that gathers features from a fixed square kernel. Based on the novel VPB, we proposed a new pooling module called AVG-MAX VPB. It can collect informative features by using two types of pooling techniques, maximum and average pooling. The VPB and the AVG-MAX VPB are plugged into the backbone CNNs networks, such as U-Net, AlexNet, ResNet18 and GoogleNet, to show the advantages in segmentation and classification tasks associated with breast cancer diagnosis from thermograms. The proposed pooling layer was evaluated using a benchmark thermogram database (DMR-IR) and its results compared with U-Net results which was used as base results. The U-Net results were as follows: global accuracy = 96.6%, mean accuracy = 96.5%, mean IoU = 92.07%, and mean BF score = 78.34%. The VBP-based results were as follows: global accuracy = 98.3%, mean accuracy = 97.9%, mean IoU = 95.87%, and mean BF score = 88.68% while the AVG-MAX VPB-based results were as follows: global accuracy = 99.2%, mean accuracy = 98.97%, mean IoU = 98.03%, and mean BF score = 94.29%. Other network architectures also demonstrate superior improvement considering the use of VPB and AVG-MAX VPB."
https://openalex.org/W4307009090,"Excessive neutrophil infiltration and dysfunction contribute to the progression and severity of hyper-inflammatory syndrome, such as in severe COVID19. In the current study, we re-analysed published scRNA-seq datasets of mouse and human neutrophils to classify and compare the transcriptional regulatory networks underlying neutrophil differentiation and inflammatory responses. Distinct sets of TF modules regulate neutrophil maturation, function, and inflammatory responses under the steady state and inflammatory conditions. In COVID19 patients, neutrophil activation was associated with the selective activation of inflammation-specific TF modules. SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive neutrophils showed a higher expression of type I interferon response TF IRF7. Furthermore, IRF7 expression was abundant in neutrophils from severe patients in progression stage. Neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses positively correlate with the expressional level of IRF7. Based on these results, we suggest that differential activation of activation-related TFs, such as IRF7 mediate neutrophil inflammatory responses during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4306803847,"The dual-specificity phosphatases responsible for the inactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are designated as the MAPK phosphatases (MKPs). We demonstrated previously that MKP5 is regulated through a novel allosteric site suggesting additional regulatory mechanisms of catalysis exist amongst the MKPs. Here, we sought to determine whether the equivalent site within the phosphatase domain of a highly similar MKP family member, MKP7, is also important for phosphatase function. We found that mutation of tyrosine 271 (Y271) in MKP7, which represents the comparable Y435 within the MKP5 allosteric pocket, inhibited MKP7 catalytic activity. Consistent with this, when MKP7 Y271 mutants were overexpressed in cells, the substrates of MKP7, p38 MAPK or JNK, failed to undergo dephosphorylation. The binding efficiency of MKP7 to p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 was also reduced when MKP7 Y271 is mutated. Consistent with reduced MAPK binding, we observed a greater accumulation of nuclear p38 MAPK and JNK when the MKP7 Y271 mutants are expressed in cells as compared with WT MKP7, which sequesters p38 MAPK/JNK in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we propose that Y271 is critical for effective MAPK dephosphorylation through a mechanism whereby binding to this residue precedes engagement of the catalytic site and upon overexpression, MKP7 allosteric site mutants potentiate MAPK signaling. These results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of MKP7 catalysis and interactions with the MAPKs. Furthermore, these data support the generality of the MKP allosteric site and provide a basis for small molecule targeting of MKP7."
https://openalex.org/W4306857359,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies have huge potential as novel antiviral therapeutics due to their ability to recognize highly conserved epitopes that are seldom mutated in viral variants. A subset of bovine antibodies possess an ultralong complementarity-determining region (CDR)H3 that is highly adept at recognizing such conserved epitopes, but their reactivity against Sarbecovirus Spike proteins has not been explored previously. Here, we use a SARS-naïve library to isolate a broadly reactive bovine CDRH3 that binds the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and all SARS-CoV-2 variants. We show further that it neutralizes viruses pseudo-typed with SARS-CoV Spike, but this is not by competition with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding. Instead, using differential hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that it recognizes the major site of vulnerability of Sarbecoviruses. This glycan-shielded cryptic epitope becomes available only transiently via interdomain movements of the Spike protein such that antibody binding triggers destruction of the prefusion complex. This proof of principle study demonstrates the power of in vitro expressed bovine antibodies with ultralong CDRH3s for the isolation of novel, broadly reactive tools to combat emerging pathogens and to identify key epitopes for vaccine development.

Our societies live with the constant threat that a deadly, highly transmissible new pathogen emerges and spreads rapidly due to extensive global travel, high population densities, and negligible pre-existing immunity. Although none of the three recently transferred coronaviruses was both highly transmissible and highly fatal, should such a virus emerge, the socioeconomic consequences would be devastating. The fact that huge reservoirs of coronaviruses are present in species, such as bats, implies that the threat of new coronavirus spill-over events is significant. Perhaps more worryingly, zoonotic transfer of other pathogens has also been occurring at an accelerated rate in recent years. Likewise, viruses such as West Nile Fever, for which no specific treatments exist, are spreading more widely due to global warming. Whilst vaccines proved remarkably successful at slowing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preventing severe disease (1Baden L.R. El Sahly H.M. Essink B. Kotloff K. Frey S.

Moreover, not all individuals mount an effective immune response to vaccines. It is therefore vital to develop complementary therapeutics that can be rapidly deployed in response to new pathogenic threats. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proved to be effective alternative treatments, particularly for individuals with weakened immune systems (4Saultier P. Ninove L. Szepetowski S. Veneziano M. Visentin S. Barlogis V. et al.Monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in a patient with high-risk acute leukaemia.Br. J. Haematol. 2022; 196: e1-e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) but they too suffer from the fact that new virus variants can emerge to escape the protection that they previously conferred. Indeed, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the Omicron variant, with 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), was resistant to neutralization by almost all of the original mAb therapeutics (5Cao Y. Wang J. Jian F. Xiao T. Song W.

By contrast, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target conserved epitopes that are often of functional importance to the virus and therefore are much less vulnerable to escape mutations. Given that such epitopes are also likely to be found on related, emerging pathogens, considerable effort is being expended to identify such antibodies (7Starr T.N. Czudnochowski N. Liu Z. Zatta F.

Around 10% of bovine antibodies possess an ultralong CDRH3 of 40 to 71 aa that extends up to 40 Å away from the main immunoglobulin fold to reach otherwise occluded epitopes, including those obscured by large glycan moieties. This CDRH3 forms an extended β-strand stalk supporting a disulfide-bonded ‘knob’ domain (13Saini S.S. Allore B. Jacobs R.M. Kaushik A.

By sitting on top of a long β-stranded stalk, it can reach epitopes that are normally occluded within deep clefts or crevices (16Sok D. Le K.M. Vadnais M. Saye-Francisco K.L. Jardine J.G.

The bovine system has been used to great effect to isolate bNAbs against HIV-1 from a cow immunized with a stabilized HIV-1 Env (16Sok D. Le K.M. Vadnais M. Saye-Francisco K.L. Jardine J.G. Torres J.L. et al.Rapid elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV by immunization in cows.Nature. 2017; 548: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The highest affinity antibody (NC-Cow-1) engages with the CD4 binding site of Env and potently neutralizes a large panel of HIV-1 variants (16Sok D. Le K.M. Vadnais M. Saye-Francisco K.L. Jardine J.G. Torres J.L. et al.Rapid elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV by immunization in cows.Nature. 2017; 548: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The remarkable breadth of this nAb can be attributed to its unconventional paratope structure that allows it to target a small footprint on Env and reduce its vulnerability to escape mutations (17Stanfield R.L. Berndsen Z.T. Huang R. Sok D. Warner G. Torres J.L. et al.Structural basis of broad HIV neutralization by a vaccine-induced cow antibody.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6: 1-11Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, broad and potent nAbs with an ultralong CDRH3 have been isolated against Foot-and-mouth disease virus from infected cattle (18Li K. Wang S. Cao Y. Bao H. Li P. Sun P. et al.Development of foot-and-mouth disease virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from plasmablasts of infected cattle and their germline gene usage.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10: 2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Crucially, the paratope from NC-Cow-1 was successfully transferred to a human antibody scaffold with minimal loss of activity, establishing the feasibility of using humanized antibodies with an ultralong bovine CDRH3 as therapeutic tools (19Svilenov H.L. Sacherl J. Protzer U. Zacharias M. Buchner J. Mechanistic principles of an ultra-long bovine CDR reveal strategies for antibody design.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Immunization of cattle, however, results in high titers of potent bNAbs only after multiple booster immunizations and a period of several months (16Sok D. Le K.M. Vadnais M. Saye-Francisco K.L. Jardine J.G. Torres J.L. et al.Rapid elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV by immunization in cows.Nature. 2017; 548: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a timeframe that may be too lengthy to prevent significant mortality from a deadly new pathogen. By contrast, the entire repertoire of bovine ultralong CDRH3-containing antibodies is encoded by recombination of the same three gene segments: VH1-7, DH8-2, and JH2-4, where DH8-2 is primarily responsible for encoding the disulfide-bonded knob domain (15Wang F. Ekiert D.C. Ahmad I. Yu W. Zhang Y. Bazirgan O. et al.Reshaping antibody diversity.Cell. 2013; 153: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Dong J. Finn J.A.

Conservation and diversity in the ultralong third heavy-chain complementarity-determining region of bovine antibodies.Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1: 1-12Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This exclusive use of gene segments lends itself well to the specific isolation of ultralong CDRH3 sequences (Fig. 1A) and the generation of libraries that can be screened for binding to antigens from emerging pathogens. Here, we sought to isolate ultralong bovine heavy chains that bind to SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses in a proof of principle study. We capitalized on previous findings that ultralong CDRH3s pair with a relatively invariable Vλ light chain (15Wang F. Ekiert D.C. Ahmad I. Yu W. Zhang Y. Bazirgan O. et al.Reshaping antibody diversity.Cell. 2013; 153: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Dong J. Finn J.A. Larsen P.A. Smith T.P.L. Crowe Jr., J.E. Structural diversity of ultralong CDRH3s in seven bovine antibody heavy chains.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10: 558Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), to generate a single chain variable fragment (scFv) scaffold into which ultralong heavy chain–only libraries can be cloned and expressed. Using mammalian cell surface display and His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, we isolated an ultralong scFv (B9-scFv) from a SARS-CoV-2-naïve heavy chain library that binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, all current SARS-CoV-2 variants, and notably, also to SARS-CoV RBD. B9-scFv does not compete with Spike binding to its cell surface receptor, ACE2, but instead neutralizes SARS-CoV pseudotyped lentiviruses (LVs), likely by destabilizing the prefusion complex. Consistent with this, the epitope localizes to a cryptic cleft on the inner face of the RBD that is thought to be only transiently accessible. This site overlaps with the footprints of some of the broadest anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies identified to date (7D6/6D6 (22Li T. Xue W. Zheng Q. Song S. Yang C. Xiong H. et al.Cross-neutralizing antibodies bind a SARS-CoV-2 cryptic site and resist circulating variants.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), FD20 (23Li T.

Med. 2021; 13e14544Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and S2H97 (7Starr T.N. Czudnochowski N. Liu Z. Zatta F. Park Y.J. Addetia A. et al.SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies that maximize breadth and resistance to escape.Nature. 2021; 597: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)) and corresponds to the main site of vulnerability of Sarbecoviruses (24Starr T.N. Greaney A.J. Hilton S.K. Ellis D. Crawford K.H.D. Dingens A.S. et al.Deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain reveals constraints on folding and ACE2 binding.Cell. 2020; 182: 1295-1310.e1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this broadly reactive bovine CDRH3 was isolated from a library of only modest sequence diversity. This attests to the huge potential of the bovine system as a source of broadly active antibodies that can protect against emerging pathogens and their variants. To establish a cell surface display platform to screen ultralong CDRH3 libraries, we first amplified the variable exons from the leukocyte genomic DNA (gDNA) of two adult cows to generate a library of ultralong bovine paratopes. The ultralong CDRH3s were then enriched by nested PCR and size selection, to produce an initial heavy chain library with >96% ultralong CDRH3s (Fig. S1A). These purified amplicons were inserted into the pBovShow expression cassette (Fig. 1B), resulting in them being joined to an invariant Vλ light chain variable domain (Vλ-LC) via a flexible linker. Following transient transfection into 293T cells and screening by flow cytometry, over 70% of the ultralong scFv clones were found to be expressed on the cell surface (Figs. 1C and S1B). This suggests that the invariant Vλ variable domain pairs with most ultralong heavy chains, even in an scFv format and further implies that this is an effective scaffold for the expression of libraries of ultralong bovine CDRH3 for affinity-based panning. Next, we screened our ultralong scFv library for binding to the recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, with two stabilizing proline mutations (S-2P; (25Watanabe Y. Allen J.D. Wrapp D. McLellan J.S. Crispin M. Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike.Science. 2020; 369: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar)) by transient transfection of the library into 293T cells and subsequent flow cytometry. Initially, a small population of cells expressing scFvs that bind Spike protein was isolated (0.02%; Fig. 1C); these were enriched by two further rounds of plasmid recovery, retransfection, and flow cytometry (Fig. 1D), resulting in a sharp increase in the proportion of Spike-binding scFvs (Fig. 1D). Sequencing the scFv library at different stages of enrichment allowed the original library diversity to be estimated at <1 × 104 unique sequences (Fig. S1C). While the number of unique ultralong CDRH3 sequences recovered here is low, it is comparable to the numbers isolated previously from two cows (15Wang F. Ekiert D.C. Ahmad I. Yu W. Zhang Y. Bazirgan O. et al.Reshaping antibody diversity.Cell. 2013; 153: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Despite the small size of the present library, the marked enrichment of Spike-binding scFvs encouraged further investigation. Therefore, to more efficiently isolate the Spike-binding scFv(s), we cloned our enriched library into LV vectors (Fig. S2A) and generated LV particles pseudotyped with VSV-G. These were transduced into 293T cells at a low titer to achieve few integrated scFv sequences per cell. After puromycin selection and expansion, only 0.42% of the transduced cells bound Spike protein (Fig. S2B), and from this population, we isolated 15 single cell clones that interacted with 40 nM Spike protein. Three of these single cell clones harbored a single scFv, and remarkably, the nucleotide sequence of all three scFvs was identical. This sequence, termed B9-scFv (Fig. 1E), encodes a 53 aa ultralong CDRH3 that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Fig. S2B, lower). B9-scFv accounted for 53% of all scFvs from the LV-transduced cells after a single selection for Spike binding, and this increased to 83% upon a further round of enrichment by flow cytometry, suggesting that the ultralong B9-scFv accounts for much the anti-Spike activity in our library. To begin to locate B9-scFv’s epitope, we purified the SARS-CoV-2 Spike subdomains (Fig. 2A), S1 (aa 2–682), S2 (aa 686–1211), and RBD-SD1 (aa 319–591) via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC; Fig. S3A). Cells transiently expressing B9-scFv display clear binding to Spike (Fig. S3B), the RBD, and to a lesser extent, the S1 domain (Figs. 2, B, C and S3B). Importantly, B9-scFv did not interact with equivalent concentrations of the S2 domain (Fig. 2, B and C). These data therefore localize the binding site of B9-scFv to RBD residues 319 to 591. Bovine ultralong CDRH3s typically recognize conserved epitopes. If this is the case for B9-scFv, we would expect its binding will be unaffected by mutations in any of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). To investigate this, we established an assay to monitor B9-scFv binding to cell surface–expressed Spike protein variants, and to this end, His-tagged B9-scFv was firstly expressed and purified from 293T cells (Fig. S4A). An expression vector for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Wu-Hu-1 + D614G) was then transiently transfected into 293T cells and cell surface Spike expression was confirmed by staining with a positive control scFv (CR3022-scFv), which binds to an RBD epitope that is conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (26Yuan M. Wu N.C. Zhu X. Lee C.D. So R.T.Y. Lv H. et al.A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.Science. 2020; 368: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4B, upper). Further control experiments verified concentration-dependent binding of purified B9-scFv to Spike-transfected cells and demonstrated that this is enriched compared to a negative control bovine ultralong scFv (137-scFv; Fig. S4B). Notably, purified B9-scFv demonstrated no reactivity with nontransfected cells, even when incubated at high concentrations (5 μM) for prolonged periods (1 h), strongly suggesting that its interaction with the Spike protein is specific. Using this assay, we next examined B9-scFv binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants. Crucially, binding is maintained to all of the mutations in the commonly circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, Y453F, L452R, and K417N from the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants (Fig. 3, A and B). Not only does this imply B9-scFv recognizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein in its native state but also suggests B9-scFv is broadly reactive. To further confirm B9-scFv binding to the SARS-CoV-2 VOC, we purified SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (aa 319–591) harboring various mutations and incubated these with 293T cells expressing B9-scFv on the cell surface. Consistent with the data in Figure 3B, B9-scFv binds to RBDs carrying the mutations associated with the Alpha lineage as well as to the RBD of the hypermutated Omicron variant, that encompasses mutations found in the Beta and Gamma variants, with no significant loss of affinity compared to WT Spike (Fig. 3C). These data therefore strengthen the idea that B9-scFv binds to a conserved epitope. Given its potential broad reactivity, we next sought to determine if B9-scFv binds to other beta-coronavirus RBDs. The corresponding sequences of SARS-CoV RBD (aa 319–591) and MERS-CoV RBD (aa 368–586) were therefore cloned upstream of 8xHis tag and the proteins purified from 293T cells by IMAC (Fig. S4C). Surprisingly, the interaction between cell surface expressed B9-scFv and SARS-CoV RBD was markedly stronger than that observed with equivalent amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Maximal detectable binding by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was observed at 2 μM SARS-CoV RBD and this was only partially reduced at 200 nM. By contrast, the interaction with SARS CoV-2 RBD was modest at 2 μM RBD (Fig. 3D). Both B9-scFv and the SARS-specific human CR3022-scFv were relatively unreactive with the MERS-CoV RBD at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3D), suggesting B9-scFv has specificity for SARS-CoVs. The small difference in binding of B9-scFv to 2 μM and 200 nM SARS-CoV RBD indicates a nanomolar affinity. To further investigate this, binding of cell surface–expressed B9-scFv to a range of RBD concentrations (10 nM – 4 μM) was measured (Fig. 3E), which allowed an approximate KD of 181 nM to be calculated. Using this same method, we approximated the KD for CR3022-scFv interactions with SARS-CoV (0.7 nM) and SARS-CoV-2 (33 nM) RBD (Figs. 3E and S4D) values that are comparable to those reported in the literature (27Wu N.C. Yuan M. Bangaru S. Huang D. Zhu X. Lee C.D. et al.A natural mutation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV determines neutralization by a cross-reactive antibody.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16: e1009089Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In order to estimate the KD for B9-scFv binding to SARS-CoV-RBD using an orthogonal technique, we carried out surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A 1:1 fit of the SPR data yielded a KD of 169 ± 22 nM, which is very close to that determined by flow cytometry. The binding of B9-scFv to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, however, is weaker and the affinity of the interaction could not be estimated by either method (Fig. S4D). This weaker binding is, however, consistent with previous studies that showed increased breadth of binding correlates with lower affinity (28Pinto D. Park Y.J. Beltramello M. Walls A.C. Tortorici M.A. Bianchi S. et al.Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody.Nature. 2020; 583: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 29Tong P. Gautam A. Windsor I.W. Travers M. Chen Y.

We next tested if purified B9-scFv recognizes the SARS-CoV RBD in the context of the Spike trimer. Consistent with our previous results, B9-scFv binds more strongly to cells expressing the SARS-CoV Spike than SARS-CoV-2 Spike, as lower concentrations of B9-scFv (<200 nM) are needed to label cells expressing this glycoprotein (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data suggest that the bovine ultralong CDRH3 in B9-scFv crossreacts with viruses in the Sarbecovirus subgenus and binds SARS-CoV with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV-2. Given that B9-scFv appears to be broadly reactive, based on its resistance to all current SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding motif mutations and its cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 3, B–F), we next sought to determine if it also neutralizes virus infectivity. We therefore capitalized on the higher affinity of B9-scFv for SARS-CoV Spike to ask whether B9-scFv neutralizes pseudotyped LV particles. As can be seen in Figure 4A, B9-scFv almost completely neutralizes lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV Spike (Urbani variant) when tested at 70 μg/ml (97.9% ± 1.9% neutralization) but has no consistent effect on an equivalent titer of SARS-CoV-2 (Wu-1-D614G) pseudotyped virus, correlating with previously observed differences in estimated affinity (Fig. 3D). Control experiments show that B9-scFv does not reduce the infectivity of VSV-G pseudotyped LV at 70 μg/ml (Fig. 4A), whereas titration of B9-scFv demonstrates that it neutralizes SARS-CoV pseudotyped LVs with an IC50 of 468 nM (Fig. 4B). In complementary experiments, we used B9-scFv in a competition-binding assay to test if it prevents purified SARS-CoV RBD from binding to hACE2-expressing cells. Although there is significant competition between soluble hACE2-Fc (300 nM) and cell surface ACE2 for RBD binding (Fig. 4C), high concentrations of B9-scFv (5 μM) or CR3022-scFv (5 μM) did not prevent SARS-CoV RBD from binding to cell surface ACE2. This distinct lack of competition suggests that the mechanism of B9-scFv neutralization is unlikely to involve direct interference with ACE2 binding. To better localize the epitope recognized by this bovine CDRH3, we took advantage of the higher affinity of B9-scFv for SARS-CoV RBD and the fact that the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 76% identical (30Walls A.C. Park Y.J. Tortorici M.A. Wall A. McGuire A.T. Veesler D. Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.Cell. 2020; 181: 281-292.e286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5214) Google Scholar). We therefore performed differential hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of SARS-CoV RBD in the absence (SARS-CoV RBD only) or presence of B9-scFv (SARS-CoV RBD + B9-scFv). HDX-MS is an established methodology for epitope mapping in antibody–antigen complexes (31Masson G.R. Burke J.E. Ahn N.G. Anand G.S. Borchers C. Brier S. et al.Recommendations for performing, interpreting and reporting hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments.Nat. Met. 2019; 16: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 32Liu X.R. Huang R.Y.C. Zhao F. Chen G. Tao L. Advances in mass spectrometry-based epitope mapping of protein therapeutics.J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2022; 215114754Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In a typical HDX-MS experiment, the exchange of labile amide protons for deuterium is monitored as a function of time. The extent of deuterium incorporation is determined by hydrogen bonding and/or solvent accessibility of the amide protons and is typically measured by MS at the peptide level following proteolysis. The site(s) of difference in deuterium incorporation in the antigen in the absence and presence of the antibody can then be localized, with the regions of protection from deuterium incorporation comprising candidate epitope regions. Here, after a 2 and 30 min exposures to deuterium, we identified two main regions of the SARS-CoV RBD with significantly reduced deuterium uptake in the presence of B9-scFv (Figs. 5A and S5). Protected region 1 includes three peptides involving RBD residues 449 to 467 and spans from β7 near the ACE2-interacting region, through the β7-β8 loop to an inner face of the RBD (Fig. S6B). Region 1 can be further resolved to just residues 456 to 467 due to the identification of a shorter protected peptide (Fig. S6A). In contrast, region 2 comprises only a single peptide of residues 551 to 565 within subdomain 1 and appears to be markedly less protected than region 1 (Fig. 5A). Indeed, protection at region 2 was not observed after a 0.5 min incubation with deuterium in the presence of B9-scFv but protection was significant at region 1 at this timepoint (Fig. S5). Given that residues 542 to 591 can be removed with only a small reduction in B9 binding to SARS-CoV RBD (F"
https://openalex.org/W4306931589,"Fission protein 1 (FIS1) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) were initially described as being evolutionarily conserved for mitochondrial fission, yet in humans the role of FIS1 in this process is unclear and disputed by many. In budding yeast where Fis1p helps to recruit the DRP1 ortholog from the cytoplasm to mitochondria for fission, an N-terminal ""arm"" of Fis1p is required for function. The yeast Fis1p arm interacts intramolecularly with a conserved tetratricopeptide repeat core and governs in vitro interactions with yeast DRP1. In human FIS1, NMR and X-ray structures show different arm conformations, but its importance for human DRP1 recruitment is unknown. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and comparisons to experimental NMR chemical shifts to show the human FIS1 arm can adopt an intramolecular conformation akin to that observed with yeast Fis1p. This finding is further supported through intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and NMR experiments on human FIS1 with and without the arm. Using NMR, we observed the human FIS1 arm is also sensitive to environmental changes. We reveal the importance of these findings in cellular studies where removal of the FIS1 arm reduces DRP1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission similar to the yeast system. Moreover, we determined that expression of mitophagy adapter TBC1D15 can partially rescue arm-less FIS1 in a manner reminiscent of expression of the adapter Mdv1p in yeast. These findings point to conserved features of FIS1 important for its activity in mitochondrial morphology. More generally, other tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins are flanked by disordered arms/tails, suggesting possible common regulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4306958621,"In higher plants, long-distance RNA transport via the phloem is crucial for communication between distant plant tissues to align development with stress responses and reproduction. Several recent studies suggest that specific RNAs are among the potential long-distance information transmitters. However, it is yet not well understood how these RNAs enter the phloem stream, how they are transported, and how they are released at their destination. It was proposed that phloem RNA-binding proteins facilitate RNA translocation. In the present study, we characterized two orthologs of the phloem-associated RNA chaperone-like (PARCL) protein from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus at functional and structural levels. Microscale thermophoresis showed that these phloem-abundant proteins can bind a broad spectrum of RNAs and show RNA chaperone activity in FRET-based in vitro assays. Our SAXS experiments revealed a high degree of disorder, typical for RNA-binding proteins. In agroinfiltrated tobacco plants, eYFP-PARCL proteins mainly accumulated in nuclei and nucleoli and formed cytosolic and nuclear condensates. We found that formation of these condensates was impaired by tyrosine-to-glutamate mutations in the predicted prion-like domain (PLD), while C-terminal serine-to-glutamate mutations did not affect condensation but reduced RNA binding and chaperone activity. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments confirmed phase separation of PARCL and colocalization of RNA with the condensates, while mutation as well as phosphorylation of the PLD reduced phase separation. Together, our results suggest that RNA binding and condensate formation of PARCL can be regulated independently by modification of the C-terminus and/or the PLD."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the range of cell damage following the cryopreservation process and possible activation of cryocapacitation in bovine spermatozoa. For the experiments semen samples were obtained from 30 sexually mature Holstein bulls. Within the analysed parameters, we focused on the functional activity, structural integrity, capacitation status and oxidative profile. The samples were divided into three experimental groups, control (CTRL), in vitro capacitated (CAP) and cryopreserved (CRYO). Based on the collected data, there was a significant decrease in the sperm motility, mitochondrial membrane potential and concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the CRYO group when compared to CAP and CTRL (P<0.0001). A significant decrease (P<0.01; P<0.0001) in the membrane and acrosome integrity as well as DNA fragmentation index and a significant increase (P<0.0001) of necrotic cells were observed in the CRYO group. Following capacitation, a significant increase (P<0.01; P<0.0001) was recorded in the number of cells which underwent the acrosome reaction in the CRYO group against CAP and CTRL. Changes in the oxidative profile of the CRYO group indicates an increase (P<0.0001) in the reactive oxygen species generation, except for the superoxide radical, which was significantly higher (P<0.0001; P<0.001) in the CAP group in comparison with CRYO and CTRL. In summary, premature capacitation may be considered a consequence of cryopreservation and the assessed parameters could serve as physical markers of cryogenic damage to bovine spermatozoa in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4307002765,"Purpose It has been reported that bone is the primary organ for manganese (Mn) accumulation, but the association between manganese and bone loss remains debatable. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between blood manganese and bone mineral density/bone mineral content (BMD/BMC) by using a representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods A total of 9732 subjects over the age of 18 with available data were enrolled in this study. The relationship between blood manganese and BMD/BMC of the total body, spine and femoral regions was evaluated using multivariate linear regression models. Subgroup analyses were also performed. Results We observed a negative association between blood manganese and BMD/BMC in the femoral neck and total body in the fully adjusted model, especially femoral neck BMD in women aged 50–70 years. Conclusion In brief, people exposed to manganese should be aware of the increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Besides, due to the lack of available data, there are no definite values for the tolerable upper intake level (UL), average requirement (AR) and population reference intake (PRI) of manganese. The results of our study may provide some references for the establishment of AR, PRI and UL of Mn."

However, the effects of androgens, which show higher levels in males, on adrenergic receptor-mediated thermogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that androgen-androgen receptor (AR) signaling suppresses the β-adrenergic agonist-induced rise of core body temperature using castrated and AR knockout (ARKO) male mice. Furthermore, in vitro mechanistic studies show that activated AR inhibits cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated transcription by suppressing cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. The elevation of body temperature induced by the β-adrenergic agonist CL316243 was higher in ARKO and castrated mice than in the control mice. Similarly, CL316243 induced a greater increase in Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) expression and CREB phosphorylation in the brown adipose tissue of ARKO mice than in that of controls. We determined that activation of AR by dihydrotestosterone suppressed β3-agonist- or forskolin-induced CRE-mediated transcription, which was prevented by AR antagonist. AR activation also suppressed CREB phosphorylation induced by forskolin. Moreover, we found AR nuclear localization, but not transcriptional activity, was necessary for the suppression of CRE-mediated transcription. Finally, modified mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses suggest nuclear AR and CREB form a protein complex both in the presence and absence of dihydrotestosterone and forskolin. These results suggest androgen-AR signaling suppresses β-adrenoceptor-induced UCP1-mediated brown adipose tissue thermogenesis by suppressing CREB phosphorylation, presumably owing to a protein complex with AR and CREB. This mechanism explains sexual differences in body temperature, at least partially."

Recent studies have suggested that heterogeneity is a result of the hierarchical organization of tumor cells by a subset of cells with stem/progenitor cell features known as cancer stem cells (CSCs) (7Easwaran H.

It has gradually been confirmed that the reason why breast cancer is so difficult to cure is due to the existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which mediate tumor development, chemotherapy resistance, and cancer recurrence (8Pece S.

Growing evidence has also shown that different signaling pathways play important roles in the initiation and maintenance of BCSCs. For example, Pygo2 stimulated MDR1 expression in the resistant cells via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the downregulation of Pygo2 restored the chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of the resistant cells and decreased the BCSC population in these cells in response to chemotherapy (10Zhang Z.M.

Furthermore, HOTAIR has also been associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stage in cancers (22Min S.N. Wei T. Wang X.T. Wu L.L. Yu G.Y.

Its prometastatic function is attributed to HOTAIR-induced epigenetic silencing of metastasis-suppressor–genes and reorientation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (15Gupta R.A. Shah N.

However, the role of HOTAIR in CSCs, especially in BCSCs, are not well understood. In this study, we found that HOTAIR was more highly expressed in BCSCs than in non-CSCs. HOTAIR was required for the self-renewal maintenance of BCSCs, and tumorigenic capacity of BCSCs was enhanced while HOTAIR was overexpressed. Mechanically, HOTAIR recruited the PRC2 to inhibit IκBα expression, leading to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling for priming breast CSC self-renewal. Although HOTAIR has been found to play the role of proto-oncogene in different types of cancer, the function of HOTAIR in stem cells has not been effectively studied, especially in BCSCs. In order to study the function of HOTAIR in BCSCs, we first prepared to isolate the corresponding cancer stem cells from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453. ALDH1 was selected as a target for the isolation of BCSCs by FACS. 1.6% and 1.2% of MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells in the side population were sorted as ALDH1-positive cells, respectively (Fig. S1, A and B), which was then cultured in the stem cell medium. The results showed that ALDH1+ cells could grow in suspension and have the ability of forming oncosphere while the ALDH- cells could not grow in the same culture medium which was probably due to the lack of stemness in ALDH- cells (Fig. 1A). The detection of CD44/CD24 in sorted cells showed that the level of CD44 was significantly upregulated, while CD24 was dramatically downregulated in ALDH1+ cells (Fig. 1B), which was in line with the expression profiles of CD44+/CD24- in CSCs. The growth rate of ALDH1+ cells was also significantly lower than that of control cells (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the induction of apoptosis in ALDH+ cells was also lower than that of ALDH- cells (Fig. 1D) while treated with paclitaxel. The transplantation of 102 cells of ALDH+ cells or ALDH- cells into the subcutaneous area of the left or right limb of the nude mouse resulted in the formation of tumor only in the area where ALDH+ cells were injected (Fig. 1E). Based on these results, we identified ALDH+ cells from MCF7 and MDA-MB-435 as BCSCs. Meanwhile, MDA-MB-231CSC was obtained as a gift. Then, we first examined the expression of HOTAIR in the sorted CSCs immediately from FACS as well as in the cultured oncosphere CSCs. Both the results showed that ALDH+ cells or cultured CSCs had significantly higher expression of HOTAIR than that of ALDH- cells (Fig. 1, F and G). We then analyzed the distribution of HOTAIR in these stem cells and found that HOTAIR was mainly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1H), indicating that HOTAIR might play its role in the nucleus. In summary, these data indicate that HOTAIR was highly expressed in BCSCs. To determine the function of HOTAIR in self-renewal of BCSCs, two shRNAs expressed by lentivirus against HOTAIR were employed and shHOTAIR-1 achieved more effective knockdown efficiency (Fig. 2A). The result showed that HOTAIR knockdown remarkably impaired generation of the fraction of ALDH+ cells (CSCs) (Fig. 2B). Importantly, HOTAIR depletion also dramatically reduced oncosphere formation of MCF7 CSC (Fig. 2C). The role of HOTAIR in tumor-initiating formation was next explored. We performed subcutaneous injection of NOD/SCID nude mice with CSCs stably knockdown of HOTAIR or the control cells. The results showed HOTAIR depletion resulted in a much weaker tumor presence compared with control cells as assessed by a limiting dilution xenograft analysis (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that HOTAIR knockdown reduced tumor-initiating capacity. Moreover, HOTAIR depletion significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth as examined by tumor volume for 4 months (Fig. 2, F and G). We next aimed to get a preliminary understanding of how HOTAIR participated in the stem cell signaling pathway, so the levels of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, and c-Myc were examined upon knockdown of HOTAIR. Notably, HOTAIR depletion significantly reduced the expression of pluripotent transcription factors c-Myc compared with scrambled control (Fig. 2H). By contrast, HOTAIR knockdown did not dramatically affect OCT4, Nanog expression, which was further confirmed by the detection of protein levels (Fig. 2I). Unexpectedly, we observed there was an OCT4 reduction in MDA-MB-453 but not in MCF7 after HOTIAR knockdown for the reasons we did not quite understand yet. Overall, these data indicate HOTAIR silencing abrogates the tumorigenic capacity of BCSCs. We next overexpressed HOTAIR in MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines and established HOTAIR stably overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 3A), which were then used for the sorting of ALDH+ cells. Notably, HOTAIR overexpression significantly raised the percentage of ALDH+ cells, indicating that HOTAIR overexpression increased the portion of CSCs in MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 (Fig. 3B). HOTAIR overexpression also significantly enhanced oncosphere formation of the CSCs (Fig. 3C). Tumor-initiating formation was then determined by a limiting dilution injection of these CSCs into NOD/SCID nude mice, and the result showed that HOTAIR overexpression resulted in a much stronger tumor presence (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, HOTAIR overexpression dramatically enhanced xenograft tumor growth (Fig. 3, F and G). Furthermore, we also determined the expression of pluripotent transcription factors Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, and c-Myc in HOTAIR-overexpressed cells and found that only c-Myc but not other three factor was upregulated on both mRNA and protein level (Fig. 3, H and I). Taken together, these data indicate that HOTAIR plays a critical role in the self-renewal maintenance of BCSCs. In order to study the signaling pathways that HOTAIR may participate in, we first extracted RNA from nontreated, HOTAIR knockdown and HOTAIR-overexpressed stem cells respectively, which were then used for real-time PCR detection in 96-well plate containing 90 key proteins in the stem cell–related pathways. The results showed that 13 RNA transcripts were aberrantly expressed in HOTAIR knockdown cells compared with HOTAIR-overexpressed cells (Fig. 4A). We then further verified the expression profiles of ALDH1A, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2 by real-time PCR and found that their levels decreased significantly after HOTAIR knockdown while HOTAIR overexpression resulted in elevated expression of these genes (Fig. 4B), especially the expression of ALDH1A and c-Myc were consistent with the results we obtained earlier. Moreover, the expression of the four genes was further confirmed at the protein level (Fig. 4C). Based on literature search and GO/KEGG analysis, it was found c-Myc and Cyclin D1 are targets of the NF-κB signaling pathway (26Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X.

NF-κB pathway inhibitors preferentially inhibit breast cancer stem-like cells.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 111: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms that how HOTAIR is involved in this pathway still needs to be further elucidated. To study whether HOTAIR is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway to regulate stem cell self-renewal, we knocked down HOTAIR or inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway by PDTC and then examined the target protein expression. We found that the proteins c-Myc and Cyclin D1 were both decreased upon HOTAIR knockdown or PDTC treatment (Fig. 4D). Similarly, when p65 was depleted by shRNA, c-Myc and Cyclin D1 also decreased, the expression of which were also consistent with HOTAIR knockdown (Fig. 4E). Additionally, we also found HOTAIR knockdown or NF-κB interruption by shp65 or PDTC could abrogate oncosphere formation ability of these CSCs (Fig. 4F). These results indicated that HOTAIR and NF-κb signaling pathways could regulate c-Myc and Cyclin D1 expression respectively and were involved in the regulation of the stemness of breast cancer cells. In order to demonstrate whether HOTAIR correlated with NF-κb signaling pathway, we examined c-Myc and Cyclin D1 expression with or without NF-κB inhibition. The results showed that the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 increased as expected upon HOTAIR overexpression; however, c-myc and Cyclin D1 level was antagonized by p65 knockdown or PDTC treatment upon HOTAIR overexpression (Fig. 4G). These results demonstrated that HOTAIR regulated the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, we also found NF-κB inhibition by PDTC abrogated sphere formation ability increased by HOTAIR overexpression (Fig. 4H). In summary, the results indicate that both HOTAIR and NF-κB pathway are necessary for c-Myc and Cyclin D1 expression and maintenance of the stemness.Figure 4HOTAIR regulates the stemness of breast cancer cells through NF-κB signaling pathway.

Interestingly, when HOTAIR was overexpressed, IκBα decreased at both the mRNA and the protein levels (Fig. 5, A and B). On the contrary, upon HOTAIR knockdown, the expression of IκBα increased (Fig. 5, A and B). However, p65, p50, and IKK had not changed significantly regardless of HOTAIR knockdown or overexpression (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, the results showed that the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 decreased upon knockdown of HOTAIR alone; however, while shIκBα was simultaneously transfected with shHOTAIR, the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 recovered (Fig. 5C). The result preliminarily indicated that HOTAIR might participate in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the expression of IκBα. There has been reports that HOTAIR could recruit the PRC2 complex to regulate the expression of target genes (15Gupta R.A. Shah N. Wang K.C. Kim J. Horlings H.M.

In order to study whether HOTAIR could also interact with PRC2 in BCSCs, we carried out RNA pulldown and found that the components enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) of the PRC2 could be detected (Fig. 5D). Similarly, the interaction was further confirmed by EZH2 RIP assay (Fig. 5E). Therefore, we conducted ChIP assay to study whether HOTAIR could recruit PRC2 complex to regulate the expression of the IκBα and found that the EZH2 protein could bind to the promoter region of IκBα (Fig. 5F) and the main binding site was located in the 500bp-1000 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Upon knockdown of HOTAIR, EZH2 binding to the promoter region of IκBα was less efficiency while the promoter occupancy was increased by HOTAIR overexpression (Fig. 5G). Next, truncation or deletion of IκBα promoter were fused to luciferase reporters respectively to examine which region might be targeted by PRC2 complex. The results showed that luciferase activity significantly decreased as the truncation contained upstream sequences from −600 bp, however, as the deletion of −600 to −700 sequences in the promoter rescued luciferase activity (Fig. 5H). In order to determine which HOTAIR fragment was responsible to downregulate the IκB alpha expression, IκB alpha luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected into cells with WT HOTAIR or truncated HOTAIR respectively and luciferase activity was measured. The result showed that two fragments 1 to 600 and 1800 to 2148 were responsible for inhibition of IκB alpha as deletion of which would reduce the luciferase activity (Fig. 5I). In summary of the above data, HOTAIR could guide the PRC2 complex to the promoter region of IκBα, resulting in the regulation of this gene.Figure 5HOTAIR recruits PRC2 complex onto IκBα promoter to inhibit the gene expression.

Additionally, H3K27me3 was decreased while IκBα was increased after EZH2 or HOTAIR knockdown, resulting in the reduction of both Cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression (Fig. 6B). A luciferase reporter assay also established that transcriptional activity of IκBα increased significantly in siEZH2- or siHOTAIR-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6C). We then transfected NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid into cells upon knockdown of EZH2 or HOTAIR and luciferase activity was measured. The result showed that upon knockdown of EZH2 or HOTAIR, NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited (Fig. 6D). Moreover, we transiently cotransfected either WT or mutants (H694A, a SET domain mutant) EZH2 complementary DNA. Western blot assays showed that IκBα expression was reduced in EZH2-WT cells compared with empty vector-transfected cells. In contrast, overexpression of the methyl-transferase mutant EZH2-H694A increased IκBα expression while reducing H3K27me3 levels compared with EZH2-WT and vector control (Fig. 6E).

Many studies have analyzed the impact of globalization on employment creation resulting in positive and negative findings. However, an area of literature still needs to be explored studying how human capital affects the impact of globalization on employment creation. The current study contributes to the literature by analyzing the moderating role of human capital in the globalization-employment nexus in 26 Asian countries. For this, annual panel data were collected from 1996 to 2019. The estimations have been done using 12 model specifications, 6 for direct and 6 for indirect impact association between globalization and employment through the human capital channel. The study uses generalized least square (GLS) method and generalized method of moments (GMM) for empirical analysis. The static and dynamic analysis shows that globalization's direct and indirect impact on employment through the channel of human capital is positive. Industrial value added and economic growth leads to more employment creation, whereas population growth dampens it. Human capital plays a positive role in getting the advantage of globalization in terms of employment creation. This study confirms the literature recommendations of promoting human capital development to achieve globalization's benefits for more employment creation."
https://openalex.org/W4307036180,"Zinc plays a critical role in many physiological processes, and disruption of zinc homeostasis induces various disorders, such as growth retardation, osteopenia, immune deficiency, and inflammation. However, how the imbalance in zinc homeostasis leads to heart disease is not yet fully understood. Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death worldwide, and the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat it is urgently needed. We report that a zinc transporter, ZIP13, regulates cardiovascular homeostasis. We found that the expression level of Zip13 mRNA was diminished in both primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissues treated with the cardiotoxic agent doxycycline. Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes from Zip13 gene-knockout (KO) mice exhibited abnormal irregular arrhythmic beating. RNA-seq analysis identified 606 differentially expressed genes in Zip13-KO mouse-derived primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that both inflammation- and cell adhesion-related genes were significantly enriched. In addition, telemetry echocardiography analysis suggested that arrhythmias were likely to occur in Zip13-KO mice, in which elevated levels of the cardiac fibrosis marker Col1a1, vascular inflammation-related gene eNOS, and Golgi-related molecule GM130 were observed. These results indicate the physiological importance of ZIP13-it maintains cardiovascular homeostasis by resolving inflammation and stress response. Our findings suggest that optimizing ZIP13 expression and/or function may improve cardiovascular disease management."
https://openalex.org/W4307141313,"Lignin, an abundant aromatic heteropolymer in secondary plant cell walls, is the single largest source of renewable aromatics in the biosphere. Leveraging this resource for renewable bioproducts through targeted microbial action depends on lignin fragment uptake by microbial hosts and subsequent enzymatic action to obtain the desired product. Recent computational work has emphasized that bacterial inner membranes are permeable to many aromatic compounds expected from lignin depolymerization processes. In this study, we expand on these findings through simulations for 42 lignin-related compounds across a gram-negative bacterial outer membrane model. Unbiased simulation trajectories indicate that spontaneous crossing for the full outer membrane is relatively rare at molecular simulation timescales, primarily due to preferential membrane partitioning and slow diffusion within the lipopolysaccharide layer within the outer membrane. Membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients were determined through replica exchange umbrella sampling simulations to overcome sampling limitations. We find that the glycosylated lipopolysaccharides found in the outer membrane increase the permeation barrier to many lignin-related compounds, particularly the most hydrophobic compounds. However, the effect is relatively modest; at industrially relevant concentrations, uncharged lignin-related compounds will readily diffuse across the outer membrane without the need for specific porins. Together, our results provide insight into the permeability of the bacterial outer membrane for assessing lignin fragment uptake and the future production of renewable bioproducts."
https://openalex.org/W4306957840,"In the vertebrate retina, phosphorylation of photoactivated visual pigments in rods and cones by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is essential for sustained visual function. Previous in vitro analysis demonstrated that GRK1 and GRK7 are phosphorylated by PKA, resulting in a reduced capacity to phosphorylate rhodopsin. In vivo observations revealed that GRK phosphorylation occurs in the dark and is cAMP dependent. In many vertebrates, including humans and zebrafish, GRK1 is expressed in both rods and cones while GRK7 is expressed only in cones. However, mice express only GRK1 in both rods and cones and lack GRK7. We recently generated a mutation in Grk1 that deletes the phosphorylation site, Ser21. This mutant demonstrated delayed dark adaptation in mouse rods but not in cones in vivo, suggesting GRK1 may serve a different role depending upon the photoreceptor cell type in which it is expressed. Here, zebrafish were selected to evaluate the role of cAMP-dependent GRK phosphorylation in cone photoreceptor recovery. Electroretinogram analyses of larvae treated with forskolin show that elevated intracellular cAMP significantly decreases recovery of the cone photoresponse, which is mediated by Grk7a rather than Grk1b. Using a cone-specific dominant negative PKA transgene, we show for the first time that PKA is required for Grk7a phosphorylation in vivo. Lastly, immunoblot analyses of rod grk1a-/- and cone grk1b-/- zebrafish and Nrl-/- mouse show that cone-expressed Grk1 does not undergo cAMP-dependent phosphorylation in vivo. These results provide a better understanding of the function of Grk phosphorylation relative to cone adaptation and recovery."

However, the full cellular response to hypoxia has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that expression of SMYD3, a methyltransferase, augments hypoxia signaling independent of its enzymatic activity. We demonstrated SMYD3 binds to and stabilizes HIF1α via co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays, leading to the enhancement of HIF1α transcriptional activity under hypoxia conditions. In addition, the stabilization of HIF1α by SMYD3 is independent of HIF1α hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylases and the intactness of the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we showed SMYD3 induces reactive oxygen species accumulation and promotes hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. Consistent with these results, we found smyd3-null zebrafish exhibit higher hypoxia tolerance compared to their wildtype siblings.

It is well-known that oxygen profoundly affects physiology of aerobic organisms through multiple mechanisms. Molecular oxygen not only acts as the terminal electron acceptor at complex IV of the respiratory chain that yields energy during aerobic respiration and builds metabolites but also promotes to change the configuration and function of nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Inadequate oxygen availability can lead to cellular dysfunction and even cell death. Under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions, aerobic organisms utilize their cardiovascular system and respiratory system to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to cells and tissues. In addition, cells undergo adaptive changes to initiate gene expression that either enhance oxygen delivery or promote survival (1Lee P. Chandel N.S. Simon M.C. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia through hypoxia inducible factors and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 268-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxic conditions can also trigger oxidative stress by generating uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which may pose a threat to cell survival. ROS, a generic term for a large family of oxidants derived from molecular oxygen, can be neutralized by catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. However, under hypoxic conditions, disturbances in electron transport are associated with electron leakage from the respiratory chain, giving rise to increased ROS, which may be toxic to cells if ROS levels are not attenuated (2Kim J.W.

As a key modulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxic stress, HIF is a heterodimer of bHLH-PAS proteins consisting of an O2-labile alpha subunit (HIFα) and a stable beta subunit (HIF1β)/(ARNT) that binds hypoxia response elements. Aerobic organisms possess three HIFα proteins, of which HIF1α and HIF2α are the most structurally similar containing two transactivation domain (N-terminal transactivation domain and C-terminal transactivation domain) (6Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Pathol. 2014; 9: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Under well oxygenated (normoxic) conditions, HIFα subunit is hydroxylated at two highly conserved prolyl residues by the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) (also called EglNs), whose activity is regulated by O2 availability (6Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Hydroxylated HIFα generates a binding site for being recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor protein complex, which is an ubiquitin ligase complex. As a result, HIFα is polyubiquitinated and subjected to proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, PHDs activity is diminished, leading to stabilization and accumulation of HIFα proteins. Stabilized HIFα proteins dimerize with HIF1β, translocate to the nucleus, and induce transcription of genes involved in hypoxia adaptation or tolerance (6Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J.

In addition to oxygen-dependent hydroxylation, HIFα is also regulated by other posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination/deubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation/deacetylation, SUMOylation, methylation, S-Nitrosylation, glycosylation, and neddylation (16Kubaichuk K.

SMYD3 is a member of the SMYD lysine methylase family containing two conserved structural domains: the catalytic Su (var) 3–9, Enhancer-of-zeste, and N-terminal Trithorax (SET) domain, which is split by a Myeloid-Nervy-DEAF1 domain (33Tracy C.

The SET domain of SMYD3 is comprised of two sections: the S-sequence, which may function as a cofactor binder as well as for protein–protein interactions, and the core SET domain, which functions as the primary catalytic location domain, and the C-terminal domain (33Tracy C.

In addition, it was reported previously that the oncogenic function of SMYD3 is partially independent on its methyltransferase activity (43Sarris M.E. Moulos P. Haroniti A. Giakountis A.

Whether or not SMYD3 involved in hypoxia signaling is still not understood. In this study, we show that SMYD3 interacts with HIF1α and stabilizes HIF1α independent of its methyltransferase activity, leading to the augment of the hypoxia signaling, the accumulation of ROS, and the enhancement of hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. By zebrafish model, we found that disruption of smyd3 facilities zebrafish hypoxia tolerance, which might be resulted from the impact of smyd3 on hypoxia signaling. We have previously identified that the monomethyltransferase, SET7, represses hypoxia signaling by catalyzing HIF-α methylation (30Liu X. Chen Z. Xu C. Leng X. Cao H. Ouyang G. et al.Repression of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha signaling by Set7-mediated methylation.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 5081-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether other methyltransferases also involved in hypoxia signaling, initially, we examined expression of a series of methyltransferases in HEK293T cells under hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1A, the typical hypoxia responsive genes, including GLUT1, BNIP3, PDK, PGK1, and VEGF (30Liu X. Chen Z. Xu C. Leng X. Cao H.

Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were greatly induced under hypoxia, suggesting the hypoxic condition was achieved expectedly. Among the methyltransferase genes tested, SMYD2, SMYD4, SETD1A, EZH1, EZH2, and SUV420H1 were upregulated under hypoxia, but only SMYD3 was significantly suppressed (Fig. 1A), which provoked us to further test the impact of SMYD3 in affecting hypoxia signaling. Subsequently, we examined whether the effect of hypoxia on SMYD3 expression is dependent of HIF signaling. In H1299 cells, the expression of SMYD3 was significantly suppressed under hypoxia (Fig. S1A). However, in ARNT-deficient H1299 cells (ARNT−/−) (Fig. S1B), hypoxia failed to induce expression of PGK1, a typical HIF1α target gene (Fig. S1C) but could still suppress expression of SMYD3 (Fig. S1D). In addition, we added PX478 to inhibit HIF1α activity and then checked the effect of hypoxia on SMYD3 expression (46Xu C. Liu X. Zha H. Fan S. Zhang D. Li S. et al.A pathogen-derived effector modulates host glucose metabolism by arginine GlcNAcylation of HIF-1alpha protein.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14e1007259Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When PX478 (100 μM) was added, hypoxia failed to induce expression of PGK1 (Fig. S1E) but could still suppress expression of SMYD3 (Fig. S1F). These results suggest that the effect of hypoxia on SMYD3 is independent of HIF signaling. To determine the effect of SMYD3 on hypoxia signaling, we overexpressed SMYD3 in HEK293T cells and examined expression of hypoxia responsive genes under normoxia or hypoxia. Ectopic expression of SMYD3 promoted expression of typical hypoxia responsive genes, including GLUT1, PGK1, and VEGF, under hypoxia (Fig. 1, B–D). To further confirm these observations, we changed direct-hypoxia treatment to the addition of deferoxamine mesylate salt (DFX) or CoCl2, two widely used hypoxia-mimic conditions (47Wang G.L. Semenza G.L.

A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar) and then examined the effect of SMYD3 on hypoxia responsive gene expression. Consistently, overexpression of SMYD3 also enhanced expression of GLUT1, PDK1, PGK1, and BNIP3 (Fig. 1, E–J). SMYD3 is reported to downregulate the protein level of p53 (49Zhang L. Jin Y. Yang H. Li Y. Wang C. Shi Y. et al.SMYD3 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis by downregulating p53 protein stability and promoting p53 ubiquitination.Carcinogenesis. 2019; 40: 1492-1503PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 plays vital roles in hypoxia signaling (50Zhang C. Liu J. Wang J. Zhang T. Xu D. Hu W. et al.The interplay between tumor suppressor p53 and hypoxia signaling pathways in cancer.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2021; 9648808Google Scholar). To exclude whether the effect of SMYD3 on hypoxia signaling was mediated by p53, we examined the effect of SMYD3 on hypoxia signaling in p53-deficient H1299 cells. Similar results were obtained by H1299 cells (Fig. S1, G–I). In contrast, knockout of SMYD3 in HEK293T cell resulted in a reduction of expression of GLUT1, PGK1, PDK1, or BNIP3 under hypoxia or CoCl2 treatment (Fig. 2, A–F). Moreover, expression of Glut1 and Pgk1 was also reduced in Smyd3-deficient (Smyd3−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells compared to the wildtype MEF cells (Smyd3+/+) (Fig. 2, G–I). However, reconstitution of Smyd3 by lentivirus infection in Smyd3-/- MEF cells recovered the induction of expression of Pgk1 and Vegf compared to the empty virus control (pHAGE) (Fig. 2, J–L). HIF1α expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. S2, A–D). In addition, knockdown of SMYD3 by shRNAs in HEK293T cell resulted in a reduction of expression of GLUT1, PDK1, or PGK1 under hypoxia (Fig. S2, E–H). Moreover, SMYD3 had similar effect on HIF2α as that on HIF1α in HEK293T cells (Fig. S3, A–F). These data suggest that SMYD3 augments hypoxia signaling. Given that HIF1α is one of the master regulators of hypoxia signaling, the enhancement of SMYD3 on hypoxia responsive gene expression promoted us to test whether this effect is mediated by HIF1α. Co-expression of SMYD3 together with HIF1α caused an induction of expression of GLUT1, PGK1, and VEGF mediated by ectopic expression of HIF1α in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, A–C). HIF1α expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. S4A). We next examined whether SMYD3 interacted with HIF1α. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that ectopic-expressed HA-SMYD3 interacted with ectopic-expressed Myc-HIF1α (Fig. 3D). Semiendogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that ectopic-expressed HA-SMYD3 interacted with endogenous HIF1α under hypoxia (Fig. S4B). Endogenous interaction between SMYD3 and HIF1α was further confirmed in HEK293T cells under hypoxia (Fig. S4C). In Smyd3+/+ MEF cells, but not in Smyd3−/− MEF cells, endogenous Smyd3 interacted with endogenous HIF1α (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, we examined whether the protein stability of HIF1α is affected by SMYD3. Co-expression of SMYD3 together with HIF1α caused HIF1α protein level was increased steadily (Fig. 3F). Overexpression of SMYD3 upregulated endogenous HIF1α protein level under hypoxia (Fig. S4D). By contrast, the endogenous Hif1α protein level was lower in Smyd3-null MEF cells (Smyd3−/−) compared to that in Smyd3-intact MEF cells (Smyd3+/+) under hypoxia (Fig. 3G). Consistently, reconstitution of Smyd3 in Smyd3−/− MEF cells caused an increase of Hif1α protein under hypoxia (Fig. 3H). Since stabilized HIF1α needs to translocate into the nucleus to function as a transcription factor; therefore, we investigated the effect of SMYD3 on the nuclear HIF1α levels. Notably, overexpression of SMYD3 enhanced HIF1α protein in the nuclei of HEK293T cells (Fig. S4E). In agreement, Hif1α protein level was higher in the nuclei of Smyd3+/+ MEF cells compared to the nuclei of Smyd3−/− MEF cells, which was further confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3, I and J). Consistently, in cycloheximide pulse chase assay, overexpression of SMYD3 attenuated degradation of co-expressed HIF1α in HEK293T cells (Fig. S4F). These data suggest that SMYD3 interacts with and stabilizes HIF1α, leading to an increase of nuclear HIF1α and enhanced HIF1α-mediated expression of target genes. Hydroxylation of HIF1α and subsequent proteasomal degradation mediated by pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays a central role in HIF1α regulation. We further investigated whether regulation of HIF1α by SMYD3 relies on this way. Ectopic expression of SMYD3 enhanced HIF1α protein level (Fig. S5A) and expression of GLUT1, PGK1, and PDK1 induced by addition of FG4592, a specific inhibitor of PHDs (Fig. 4, A–C) (51Rabinowitz M.H. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain oxygen sensors: tricking the body into mounting orchestrated survival and repair responses.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 9369-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the induction of HIF1α target genes expression by SMYD3 might not be dependent of HIF1α hydroxylation. Furthermore, we knocked out VHL in HEK293T cells and then examined the effect of SMYD3 on hypoxia signaling (Fig. S5B). As expected, in VHL-/- HEK293T cells, the hypoxia responsive genes, including GLUT1, PGK1, PDK1, LDHA, BNIP3, PHD3, and PKM2, were increased compared to those in VHL+/+ HEK293T cells (Fig. S5C), indicating that VHL was disrupted in HEK293T cells efficiently. Ectopic expression of SMYD3 in VHL-/- HEK293T cells enhanced HIF1α protein level (Fig. S5D) and hypoxia responsive gene expression (Fig. 4, D–F) in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that the induction of HIF1α target genes expression by SMYD3 is independent of pVHL intactness. In addition, co-expression of SMYD3 together with HIF1α caused HIF1α protein level to increase steadily, which was not affected when the two prolyl residues (P402/P564) were mutated (HA-HIF1α-DM) (P402A/P564A) (Fig. S5, E–F). Furthermore, when FG4592 was added either in an increase of dose or in an extended time course, the protein level of endogenous Hif1α in Smyd3+/+ MEF cells kept higher than that in Smyd3-/- MEF cells (Fig. 4, G–J). Taken together, these data suggest that the induction of HIF1α target gene expression and stabilization of HIF1α by SMYD3 is independent of HIF1α hydroxylation and pVHL intactness. Given that SMYD3 serves as a methyltransferase, we sought to determine whether the modulation of HIF1α by SMYD3 was mediated by the enzymatic activity of SMYD3. Under hypoxia, ectopic expression of enzymatic-inactive mutant of SMYD3 (SMYD3-F183A) still enhanced expression of PGK1 and PDK1 in HEK293T cells, similar to its wildtype form (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, the enzymatic-inactive mutant of SMYD3 (SMYD3-F183A) still interacted with co-expressed HIF1α under normoxia (Fig. 5C) and endogenous HIF1α under hypoxia (Fig. S6A). Consistently, overexpression of SMYD3-F183A had similar effect on co-expressed HIF1α protein stability as that of wildtype SMYD3 in either HEK293T cells or H1299 cells (Fig. 5, D and E). In addition, overexpression of SMYD3-F183A still enhanced HIF1α protein stability in H1299 cells under hypoxia (Fig. S6B). Taken together, these data suggest that SMYD3 stabilizes and activates HIF1α independent of its methyltransferase activity. Many studies have reported that reduction of the cytotoxic ROS level is associated with cell survival during hypoxia adaptation (52Kim T.H. Hur E.G. Kang S.J. Kim J.A. Thapa D.

Materials and methods Stretch strength of the device was optimized by applying 5% and 15% MSS loads for 24, 48, and 72 h. A cytotoxicity assay of human ligamentum flavum cells was performed and the results were compared to control (0% stress). Inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and extracellular matrix (ECM)-regulating cytokines (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase [TIMP]-1 and TIMP-2) were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Using our multi-torsional mechanical stretch stress loading device, 5% stress for 24 hour was optimal for ligamentum flavum cells. Under this condition, the IL-6 and IL-8 levels, VEGF level, and MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-2 were significantly increased, compared to the control.

Deletion of Muc16 with activating mutations KrasG12D/+ and Trp53R172H/+ in mice significantly decreased progression and prolonged overall survival in KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre; Muc16-/- (KPCM) and KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1-Cre; Muc16-/- (KCM), as compared to KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) and KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KC) mice, respectively. Muc16 knockout pancreatic tumor (KPCM) displays decreased tumor microenvironment factors and significantly reduced incidence of liver and lung metastasis compared to KPC. Furthermore, in silico data analysis showed a positive correlation of MUC16 with activated stroma and metastasis-associated genes. KPCM mouse syngeneic cells had significantly lower metastatic and endothelial cell binding abilities than KPC cells. Similarly, KPCM organoids significantly decreased the growth rate compared to KPC organoids. Interestingly, RNA-seq data revealed that the cytoskeletal proteins Actg2, Myh11, and Pdlim3 were downregulated in KPCM tumors. Further knockdown of these genes showed reduced metastatic potential. Overall, our results demonstrate that Muc16 alters the tumor microenvironment factors during pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis by changing the expression of Actg2, Myh11, and Pdlim3 genes."
https://openalex.org/W4307032548,"Role of leadership in managing organizational behaviour of employees is of key essence. However, at times unconventional behaviour of employees can pose a challenge for the leaders, which in this case is organizational dissent. This study has examined the relationship between level 5 leadership and organizational citizenship behaviour (individual level-OCB-I) in presence of organizational dissent at employing a quantitative approach and a survey design. All managerial cadre employees of telecommunication sector were chosen as a population of the study. Data from 450 respondents from all four telecom companies was analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings of the study revealed that there is direct significant relationship between level 5 leadership and OCB-I of employees i.e., L5L~ OCB-I. Furthermore, the results showed an indirect relationship between level 5 leadership and OCB-I of employees through organizational dissent i.e., L5L~OD~OCB-I is significant. Telecom is a rapidly growing sector that plays a significant role in the economic growth of Pakistan. The study shows that OCB-I in telecom sector of Pakistan can be leveraged through level 5 leadership."
https://openalex.org/W4307188503,"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virion host shut-off ( vhs ) protein cleaves both cellular and viral mRNAs by a translation-initiation-dependent mechanism, which should spare circular RNAs (circRNAs). Here, we show that vhs -mediated degradation of linear mRNAs leads to an enrichment of circRNAs relative to linear mRNAs during HSV-1 infection. This was also observed in influenza A virus (IAV) infection, likely due to degradation of linear host mRNAs mediated by the IAV PA-X protein and cap-snatching RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For most circRNAs, enrichment was not due to increased circRNA synthesis but due to a general loss of linear RNAs. In contrast, biogenesis of a circRNA originating from the long isoform (NEAT1_2) of the nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) was induced both in HSV-1 infection–in a vhs -independent manner–and in IAV infection. This was associated with induction of novel linear splicing of NEAT1_2 both within and downstream of the circRNA. NEAT1_2 forms a scaffold for paraspeckles, nuclear bodies located in the interchromatin space, must likely remain unspliced for paraspeckle assembly and is up-regulated in HSV-1 and IAV infection. We show that NEAT1_2 splicing and up-regulation can be induced by ectopic co-expression of the HSV-1 immediate-early proteins ICP22 and ICP27, potentially linking increased expression and splicing of NEAT1_2. To identify other conditions with NEAT1_2 splicing, we performed a large-scale screen of published RNA-seq data. This uncovered both induction of NEAT1_2 splicing and poly(A) read-through similar to HSV-1 and IAV infection in cancer cells upon inhibition or knockdown of CDK7 or the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex phosphorylated by CDK7. In summary, our study reveals induction of novel circular and linear NEAT1_2 splicing isoforms as a common characteristic of HSV-1 and IAV infection and highlights a potential role of CDK7 in HSV-1 or IAV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4306957828,"The riboflavin derivatives FMN and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are critical cofactors for wide-ranging biological processes across all kingdoms of life. Although it is well established that these flavins can be readily interconverted, in plants, the responsible catalysts and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of an FAD synthetase encoded by the gene At5g03430, which we have designated AtFADS1 (A. thaliana FADS1). The catalytic properties of the FAD synthetase activity are similar to those reported for other FAD synthetases, except that we observed maximum activity with Zn2+ as the associated divalent metal cation. Like human FAD synthetase, AtFADS1 exists as an apparent fusion with an ancestral FAD pyrophosphatase, a feature that is conserved across plants. However, we detected no pyrophosphatase activity with AtFADS1, consistent with an observed loss of a key catalytic residue in higher plant evolutionary history. In contrast, we determined that algal FADS1 retains both FAD synthetase and pyrophosphatase activity. We discuss the implications, including the potential for yet-unstudied biologically relevant noncatalytic functions, and possible evolutionary pressures that have led to the loss of FAD pyrophosphatase activity, yet universal retention of an apparently nonfunctional domain in FADS of land plants."
https://openalex.org/W4306958448,"Cancer cells intrinsically proliferate in an autonomous manner; however, the expansion of cancer cell areas in a tissue is known to be regulated by surrounding nontransformed cells. Whether these nontransformed cells can be targeted to control the spread of cancer cells is not understood. In this study, we established a system to evaluate the cancer-inhibitory activity of surrounding nontransformed cells and screened chemical compounds that could induce this activity. Our findings revealed that lonidamine (LND) and domperidone (DPD) inhibited expansion of oncogenic foci of KRASG12D-expressing transformed cells, whereas they did not inhibit the proliferation of monocultured KRASG12D-expressing cells. Live imaging revealed that LND and DPD suppressed the movement of nontransformed cells away from the attaching cancer cells. Moreover, we determined that LND and DPD promoted stress fiber formation, and the dominant-negative mutant of a small GTPase RhoA relieved the suppression of focus expansion, suggesting that RhoA-mediated stress fiber formation is involved in the inhibition of the movement of nontransformed cells and focus expansion. In conclusion, we suggest that elucidation of the mechanism of action of LND and DPD may lead to the development of a new type of drug that could induce the anticancer activity of surrounding nontransformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W4306990472,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a rapidly fatal blood cancer that is characterised by the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the blood and bone marrow as a result of blocked differentiation. Methods which identify master transcriptional regulators of AML subtype-specific leukaemia cell states and their combinations could be critical for discovering novel differentiation-inducing therapies. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate a novel utility of the Mogrify® algorithm in identifying combinations of transcription factors (TFs) and drugs, which recapitulate granulocytic differentiation of the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cell line, using two different approaches. In the first approach, Connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis of these TFs and their target networks outperformed standard approaches, retrieving ATRA as the top hit. We identify dimaprit and mebendazole as a drug combination which induces myeloid differentiation. In the second approach, we show that genetic manipulation of specific Mogrify®-identified TFs (MYC and IRF1) leads to co-operative induction of APL differentiation, as does pharmacological targeting of these TFs using currently available compounds. We also show that loss of IRF1 blunts ATRA-mediated differentiation, and that MYC represses IRF1 expression through recruitment of PML-RARα, the driver fusion oncoprotein in APL, to the IRF1 promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that these drug combinations can also induce differentiation of primary patient-derived APL cells, and highlight the potential of targeting MYC and IRF1 in high-risk APL. Thus, these results suggest that Mogrify® could be used for drug discovery or repositioning in leukaemia differentiation therapy for other subtypes of leukaemia or cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4307002292,"Bystander intervention in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a key factor in bridging the gap between the event and the arrival of emergency health services at the site. This study investigated the implementation rate of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) and 1-month survival after OHCA in Miyazaki prefecture and Miyazaki city district as well as compared them with those of eight prefectures in the Kyushu-Okinawa region in Japan. In addition, we analyzed prehospital factors associated with survival outcomes in Miyazaki city district.We used data from an annual report released by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency of Japan (n = 627,982) and the Utstein reporting database in Miyazaki city district (n = 1,686) from 2015 to 2019.Despite having the highest rate of bystander CPR (20.8%), the 1-month survival rate (15.7%) of witnessed OHCA cases of cardiac causes in Miyazaki city district was comparable with that in the eight prefectures between 2015 and 2019. However, rates of survival (10.7%) in Miyazaki prefecture were lower than those in other prefectures. In 1,686 patients with OHCA (74 ± 18 years old, 59% male) from the Utstein reporting database identical to the 5-year study period in Miyazaki city district, binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age of the recipient [odds ratio (OR) 0.979, 95% confidential interval (CI) 0.964-0.993, p = 0.004)], witness of the arrest event (OR 7.501, 95% CI 3.229-17.428, p < 0.001), AED implementation (OR 14.852, 95% CI 4.226-52.201, p < 0.001), and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before transport (OR 31.070, 95% CI 16.585-58.208, p < 0.001) predicted the 1-month survival with favorable neurological outcomes. In addition, chest compression at a public place (p < 0.001) and by nonfamily members (p < 0.001) were associated with favorable outcomes (p = 0.015).We found differences in 1-month survival rates after OHCA in the Kyushu-Okinawa region of Japan. Our results suggest that on-field ROSC with defibrillation performed by nonfamily bystanders who witnessed the event determines 1-month neurological outcomes after OHCA in Miyazaki city district. Continued education of citizens on CPR techniques and better access to AED devices may improve outcomes."

Despite considerable steps in medical education, the teaching of management, health economics and research skills for medical doctors are often neglected in medical curricula. This study explored the opinions and experiences of medical doctors and academic educationalists on the inclusion of management, health economics and research in the medical curriculum. A qualitative study was undertaken at four medical schools in Southern Africa (February to April 2021). The study population was medical doctors and academic educationalists. Semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled participants were conducted. All interviews were recorded and professionally transcribed. Constructivist grounded theory guided the analysis with the use of ATLAS.ti version 9.1.7.0 software. In total, 21 academic educationalists and 28 medical doctors were interviewed. In the first theme We know, participants acknowledged the constraints of medical schools but were adamant that management needed to be taught intentionally and explicitly. The teaching and assessment of management and health economics was generally reported to be ad hoc and unstructured. There was a desire that graduates are able to use, but not necessarily do research. In comparison to management and research, support for the inclusion of health economics in the curriculum was insignificant. Under We hope, educationalists hoped that the formal clinical teaching will somehow instil values and best practices of management and that medical doctors would become health advocates. Most participants wished that research training could be optimised, especially in relation to the duration of allocated time; the timing in the curriculum and the learning outcomes. Despite acknowledgement that management and research are topics that need to be taught, educationalists appeared to rely on chance to teach and assess management in particular. These qualitative study findings will be used to develop a discrete choice experiment to inform optimal curricula design."
https://openalex.org/W4307002308,"Sparse labeling of individual cells is an important approach in neuroscience and many other fields of research. Various methods have been developed to sparsely label only a small population of cells; however, there is no simple and reproducible strategy for managing the probability of sparse labeling at desired levels. Here, we aimed to develop a novel methodology based on the Cre-lox system to regulate sparseness at desired levels, and we purely analyzed cleavage efficiencies of loxP mutants by Cre. We hypothesized that mutations in the loxP sequence reduce the recognition efficiency by Cre, which enables the regulation of the sparseness level of gene expression. In this research, we mutagenized the loxP sequence and analyzed a library of loxP variants. We evaluated more than 1000 mutant loxP sequences, including mutants with reduced excision efficiencies by Cre ranging from 0.51% to 59%. This result suggests that these mutant loxP sequences can be useful in regulating the sparseness of genetic labeling at desired levels."
https://openalex.org/W4307002698,"Understanding the properties associated with the vertical force-velocity (F-v) profiles is important for maximizing jump performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations of maximum and reactive strength indicators with the F-v profiles obtained from squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ). On the first day, 20 resistance-trained men underwent measurements for half squat (HSQ) one-repetition maximum (1RM). On the second day, jump performances were measured to calculate the drop jump (DJ) reactive strength index (RSI) and the parameters of F-v profiles (theoretical maximum force [F0], velocity [V0], power [Pmax], and slope of the linear F-v relationship [SFv]) obtained from SJ and CMJ. The DJ RSI was not significantly correlated with any parameter of the vertical F-v profiles, whereas the relative HSQ 1RM was significantly correlated with the SJ F0 (r = 0.508, p = 0.022), CMJ F0 (r = 0.499, p = 0.025), SJ SFv (r = -0.457, p = 0.043), and CMJ Pmax (r = 0.493, p = 0.027). These results suggest that maximum strength is a more important indicator than reactive strength in improving vertical F-v profiles. Furthermore, the importance of maximum strength may vary depending on whether the practitioner wants to maximize the performance of SJ or CMJ."
https://openalex.org/W4307003099,"Metabolic reprogramming is now considered a hallmark of cancer cells. KRas-driven cancer cells use glutaminolysis to generate the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate via a transamination reaction between glutamate and oxaloacetate. We reported previously that exogenously supplied unsaturated fatty acids could be used to synthesize phosphatidic acid–a lipid second messenger that activates both mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). A key target of mTORC2 is Akt–a kinase that promotes survival and regulates cell metabolism. We report here that mono-unsaturated oleic acid stimulates the phosphorylation of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) at the Akt phosphorylation site at S455 in an mTORC2 dependent manner. Inhibition of ACLY in KRas-driven cancer cells in the absence of serum resulted in loss of cell viability. We examined the impact of glutamine (Gln) deprivation in combination with inhibition of ACLY on the viability of KRas-driven cancer cells. While Gln deprivation was somewhat toxic to KRas-driven cancer cells by itself, addition of the ACLY inhibitor SB-204990 increased the loss of cell viability. However, the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate was minimally toxic and the combination of SB-204990 and aminooxtacetate led to significant loss of cell viability and strong cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase–indicating apoptotic cell death. This effect was not observed in MCF7 breast cancer cells that do not have a KRas mutation or in BJ-hTERT human fibroblasts which have no oncogenic mutation. These data reveal a synthetic lethality between inhibition of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and ACLY inhibition that is specific for KRas-driven cancer cells and the apparent metabolic reprogramming induced by activating mutations to KRas."

Dry eye can be challenging to diagnose because of the possible discrepancy between patients' symptoms and clinical signs, and its overlap with other ocular surface diseases. Literature-wise, dry eye is usually associated with age and therefore investigated within older populations. Recently, studies focusing on young adult and student populations have demonstrated a higher prevalence of dry eye than previously expected.The study aims to determine the frequency of dry eye symptoms in the student population, and the impact of students' activities and habits as potential risk factors.Our study involved 397 students from the medical school at the University of Belgrade, Serbia. Students were asked to complete an online survey that addressed general information, health, habits, and routine in everyday use of electronic devices. In addition, students completed a standard Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire.The prevalence of dry eye was 60.5% (240/397) in our study population. Contact lens wear (p<0.001), allergies (p = 0.049) and increased number of hours per day using VD devices for studying purposes (p = 0.014) were associtated with a higher risk of dry eye disease. Risk factors that did not significantly impact dry eye were the use of oral contraceptives, smoking, systemic diseases, year of study and sex.In our study, the prevalence of dry eye disease was similar or slightly higher than in previous studies among young adults. In addition, contact lenses, allergies and visual display devices were associated with the development of the dry eye."
https://openalex.org/W4306884995,"mTORC1 and GCN2 are serine/threonine kinases that control how cells adapt to amino acid availability. mTORC1 responds to amino acids to promote translation and cell growth while GCN2 senses limiting amino acids to hinder translation via eIF2α phosphorylation. GCN2 is an appealing target for cancer therapies because malignant cells can harness the GCN2 pathway to temper the rate of translation during rapid amino acid consumption. To isolate new GCN2 inhibitors, we created cell-based, amino acid limitation reporters via genetic manipulation of Ddit3 (encoding the transcription factor CHOP). CHOP is strongly induced by limiting amino acids and in this context, GCN2-dependent. Using leucine starvation as a model for essential amino acid sensing, we unexpectedly discovered ATP-competitive PI3 kinase-related kinase inhibitors, including ATR and mTOR inhibitors like torins, completely reversed GCN2 activation in a time-dependent way. Mechanistically, via inhibiting mTORC1-dependent translation, torins increased intracellular leucine, which was sufficient to reverse GCN2 activation and the downstream integrated stress response including stress-induced transcriptional factor ATF4 expression. Strikingly, we found that general translation inhibitors mirrored the effects of torins. Therefore, we propose that mTOR kinase inhibitors concurrently inhibit different branches of amino acid sensing by a dual mechanism involving direct inhibition of mTOR and indirect suppression of GCN2 that are connected by effects on the translation machinery. Collectively, our results highlight distinct ways of regulating GCN2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W4306958619,"Myosin B (MyoB) is a class 14 myosin expressed in all invasive stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. It is not associated with the glideosome complex that drives motility and invasion of host cells. During red blood cell invasion, MyoB remains at the apical tip of the merozoite but is no longer observed once invasion is completed. MyoB is not essential for parasite survival, but when it is knocked out, merozoites are delayed in the initial stages of red blood cell invasion, giving rise to a growth defect that correlates with reduced invasion success. Therefore, further characterization is needed to understand how MyoB contributes to parasite invasion. Here, we have expressed and purified functional MyoB with the help of parasite-specific chaperones Hsp90 and Unc45, characterized its binding to actin and its known light chain MLC-B using biochemical and biophysical methods and determined its low-resolution structure in solution using small angle X-ray scattering. In addition to MLC-B, we found that four other putative regulatory light chains bind to the MyoB IQ2 motif in vitro. The purified recombinant MyoB adopted the overall shape of a myosin, exhibited actin-activated ATPase activity, and moved actin filaments in vitro. Additionally, we determined that the ADP release rate was faster than the ATP turnover number, and thus, does not appear to be rate limiting. This, together with the observed high affinity to actin and the specific localization of MyoB, may point toward a role in tethering and/or force sensing during early stages of invasion."

The aim of this study was to compare the completion rate of new patient telemedicine visits to in-person office visits for patients with preeclampsia referred for postpartum hypertension management and CV risk assessment at a single center. There were 236 unique new patient visits scheduled during the study period. The average age was 30.3 years, 73.7% patients were Black, and 56.7% had Medicaid insurance. The completion rate was 32% for in-person clinic visits and 70% for telemedicine visits. Women who did not complete an office visit were more likely to be Black (87% vs. 56%, p &lt; 0.01) and younger (29.1 vs. 31.4 years, p = 0.04) compared to those who completed a visit. Notably, this difference was not seen with telemedicine visits. Telemedicine may provide a novel opportunity to improve the care for blood pressure management and CV risk reduction in a vulnerable population at risk of premature CV disease."

Eighty-four individuals with shoulder pain with positive (n = 47, average age 38.4 years) and negative (n = 37, average age 37.8 years) Scapular Assistance Test completed the study. Demographic data, affected shoulder, pain duration, pain at rest, angular onset of pain, scapular dyskinesis, serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle strength, Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and Pain Catastrophizing Scale were assessed in all participants. The Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to determine which factors would predict the occurrence of a positive or negative Scapular Assistance Test and possible interactions among them. The resulting tree presented seven levels that combine the following variables: angular onset of pain, presence of scapular dyskinesis, pain catastrophizing, serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle strength. The angular onset of pain during arm elevation was the main predictor of a positive Scapular Assistance Test selected by the Classification and Regression Tree. This study indicates that the Scapular Assistance Test result may be explained not only by biomechanical variables, but also by psychological factors. Disability of the upper limbs does not seem to contribute to the Scapular Assistance Test result."

We observed that aphids continuously proliferated in the smart farm facility in winter without dormancy. The average number of aphids was greater under the 1:1 red:blue light irradiation time ratio, where the photosynthetic rate of the host plant was lower than under the 5:1 and 10:1 red:blue light irradiation time ratios. These results show that it is important to maintain a low net photosynthetic rate of the host plant, E . japonicum , in order to effectively proliferate aphids under artificial light such as in the case of smart farm facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4307002334,"This study demonstrates the vertical and horizontal distribution of nutrients and the seasonal response of nutrients to upwelling in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Thus, monthly data on nitrate, phosphate, and silicate are obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA), as well as estimates of coastal and curl driven upwelling in both regions. The results of the study indicate that the Sea of Oman's surface and deep waters contained higher concentrations of nutrients than the Arabian Gulf by 80%. In addition, both regions have exhibited a general increase in the vertical distribution of nutrients as the depth increases. Among the aforementioned nutrients, nitrate is found to be a more limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth than phosphate as the nitrate-to-phosphate ratios (N:P) in surface waters are lower (≤ 4.6:1) than the Redfield ratio (16:1). As for the upwelling, curl-driven upwelling accounts for more than half of the total upwelling in both regions, and both play an important role in nutrient transport. Thus, nutrients are upwelled from the subsurface to the mixed layer at a rate of 50% in the Oman Sea from 140 m to 20 m during the summer and to 40 m during the winter. Similarly, the Arabian Gulf shows 50% transport for nitrates, but 32% for phosphates, from 20 m to 5-10 m. However, due to the abundance of diatoms at the surface of the Arabian Gulf, the surface silicate content is 30% higher than that of the deeper waters."

To ensure the fair distribution of a high-quality health workforce and the availability of health services, there is a need to assess the background barriers that explain why healthcare providers are not interested to work in rural areas, thereby setting strategies to achieve universal health coverage. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess the willingness to work in rural areas and associated factors among health students at the University of Gondar.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar from August 15 to 25, 2021. A total of 422 study participants were selected using a stratified random sampling technique. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the data. Data were entered into EPI DATA 4.6 and exported to SPSS 25 for further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with students' willingness to work in rural areas. The level of significance was decided based on the 95% confidence interval at a p-value of ≤ 0.05.In this study, it was found that health students' willingness to work in rural areas was 78.4% (95% CI: 74.3, 82.4). Being male (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.94), having intention to continue with their profession (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.28, 4.86), having a favorable attitude towards working in rural areas (AOR = 7.32; 95% CI: 5.71, 18.65), and having a mother with no formal education (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 4.85) and completed primary education (AOR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.1, 6.61) were significantly associated with willingness to work in rural areas.The willingness of students to work in rural areas was optimal. This calls for concerned bodies to create a conducive environment for male and female students to engage in rural areas without hesitation. It is also important to ensure that students are willing to work in the rural areas voluntarily, instead of working in rural areas due to a lack of employment."

To ensure adequate outpatient care for cancer patients, extensive safety and hygiene measures must be taken. This interview-based study examines the effects–both personal and professional–of the pandemic on the work routine of outpatient hematology/oncology nurses and medical assistants. Patients, materials and methods Half a year after the outbreak of Covid-19 and the introduction of infection control regulations in three outpatient hematological/oncological centers, the affected medical staff (n = 15) were surveyed about the consequences for patient care and clinical work using audio-recorded telephone interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis. Results The Covid-19 pandemic has complicated the medical care of cancer patients, but only a slight deterioration of medical and psycho-oncological care was observed. The level of stress experienced by medical staff is moderate, with hygiene and safety measures at the workplace helping to reduce stress. Conclusion From the point of view of medical staff, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a moderate impact on the outpatient care of cancer patients.

The fault signals belong to α stable distribution, and the characteristic index 1 &lt; α &lt; 2, even the noises are α stable distribution in extreme cases. The existing linear chirplet transform (LCT) degenerates, even fails under α stable distribution environment. A fractional low order linear chirplet transform (FLOLCT) which takes advantage of fractional p order moment is presented for α stable distribution noise environment, and the corresponding FLOLCT time-frequency representation (FLOLCTTFR) is developed in this paper. By employing a series of polynomial chirp rate parameters instead of a single chirp rate of the FLOLCT method, a fractional low order polynomial linear chirplet transform (FLOPLCT) is developed to improve time frequency concentration of the signals. The improved FLOLCT and FLOPLCT methods are used to compare with the existing LCT and PLCT methods based on second order statistics, the results reveal performance advantages of the proposed methods. Finally, the FLOLCT and FLOPLCT methods are applied to analyze the fault signature of the bearing ball fault data in the position of DE (Drive end accelerometer) and extract their fault signature, the result illustrates their performances."
https://openalex.org/W4307052518,"We recently reported the identification of a de novo single nucleotide variant in exon 9 of CACNA1C associated with prolonged repolarization interval. Recombinant expression of the glycine to arginine variant at position 419 produced a gain in the function of the L-type CaV1.2 channel with increased peak current density and activation gating but without significant decrease in the inactivation kinetics. We herein reveal that these properties are replicated by overexpressing calmodulin (CaM) with CaV1.2 WT and are reversed by exposure to the CaM antagonist W-13. Phosphomimetic (T79D or S81D), but not phosphoresistant (T79A or S81A), CaM surrogates reproduced the impact of CaM WT on the function of CaV1.2 WT. The increased channel activity of CaV1.2 WT following overexpression of CaM was found to arise in part from enhanced cell surface expression. In contrast, the properties of the variant remained unaffected by any of these treatments. CaV1.2 substituted with the α-helix breaking proline residue were more reluctant to open than CaV1.2 WT but were upregulated by phosphomimetic CaM surrogates. Our results indicate that (1) CaM and its phosphomimetic analogs promote a gain in the function of CaV1.2 and (2) the structural properties of the first intracellular linker of CaV1.2 contribute to its CaM-induced modulation. We conclude that the CACNA1C clinical variant mimics the increased activity associated with the upregulation of CaV1.2 by Ca2+-CaM, thus maintaining a majority of channels in a constitutively active mode that could ultimately promote ventricular arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W4307171240,"Satisfaction with hallux valgus repair is often poor, despite good surgical outcomes. Many tools have been developed to assess the outcome of the procedure; however none evaluate the association between the initial motive for repair and the reasons for post-surgical dissatisfaction. The aim of this study was to develop a new tool to analyse the subjective and objective expectations of individuals during a pre-operative consultation for hallux valgus repair in order to improve post-surgical satisfaction.We first collected the reasons for dissatisfaction with repair from the medical files of dissatisfied individuals. Then, a steering committee of 4 French experts in the management of hallux valgus designed a questionnaire based on the reasons for dissatisfaction. We then used the DELPHI method to validate the questionnaire: we submitted the questionnaire to a panel of 34 francophone experts in hallux valgus repair for rating in 4 rounds.The medical files of 853 individuals were reviewed and a 52-item questionnaire relating to expectations from hallux valgus surgery was drafted. After the 4 rounds, a final 44 item questionnaire reached consensus. Thirteen items related to clinical and psychological profile, 5 to pain, 9 to physical activity, 4 to aesthetics and 13 to footwear.This tool should facilitate gathering of individuals' expectations from hallux valgus repair to ensure realistic goals and reduce post-surgical dissatisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4307231129,"Schistosomiasis is an important, neglected tropical disease. Schistosoma japonicum can evade host attacks by regulating the host's immunity, causing continuous infection. However, interactions between the host's immune system and S. japonicum are unclear. Our previous research found that the Sj16 protein isolated from S. japonicum has an anti-inflammatory effect in the host. However, the role of Sj16 in the regulation of host immunity in S. japonicum infection is not clear. Here, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to knockout Sj16 in S. japonicum eggs and investigated the effect of Sj16 in regulating host immunity. We found egg viability decreased after Sj16 knockout. In addition, we found granulomatous inflammation increased, the T-cell immune response enhanced and the immune microenvironment changed in mice model injected with Sj16-knockout eggs by tail vein. These findings suggested that S. japonicum could regulate host immunity through Sj16 to evade the host immune attack and cause continuous infection. In addition, we confirmed the application of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene reprogramming for functional genomics in S. japonicum."
