https://openalex.org/W2886876583,"This present study aims to estimate the structural validity, internal consistency reliability of the LSNS-6 and examine the associations between the LSNS-6 and suicidal outcomes among mainland Chinese older adults.This validation study used a big representative sample (N = 2819) of older adults in Beijing from the Sample Survey on Aged Population in Urban/Rural China. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were applied to examine the factor structures of the Chinese version of LSNS-6. Internal consistency reliability of the LSNS-6 was examined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the corrected item-total correlation. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between the LSNS-6 and late-life death wishes, suicidal ideation in mainland Chinese.This present study showed good internal consistency and consistent factor structure of the LSNS-6 as well as its subscales. The present data demonstrated the LSNS-6 could be a useful tool for assessing social networks among older mainland Chinese. Interestingly, among the mainland Chinese, late-life suicidality was highly associated with the LSNS-6 family subscale, rather than the friends subscale.The LSNS-6 could be a useful tool for assessing social networks among older mainland Chinese. In addition, suggestion is made to improve social networks, especially in family bonds and support, as a promising strategy in reducing late-life suicide risks in mainland China."
https://openalex.org/W2885106292,"Concentrations of eight heavy metals (i.e., Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in the seawater, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments of the Zhanjiang Bay were investigated in 2014. The concentrations of metals were generally low in the seawater and sediments of the Zhanjiang Bay in winter and summer, indicating good environmental quality in the bay. The distribution patterns of Fe and Mn in three phases indicated the influence of terrestrial inputs. The partition coefficients log(Kd) between the dissolved and particulate phases showed a general decrease in the order of Pb≈Cd>Fe≈Mn>Ni≈Cr>Zn>Cu. The concentrations of some metals in the dissolved and particulate phases showed seasonal variations. Phytoplankton production and complexation reactions may contribute to this phenomenon. The relationships among metals in different phases were different, and there were few close relationships among metals in the dissolved phase, many close relationships in the particulate phase, and more close relationships in the sedimentary phase. This finding may be related to the different mobility levels of metals in different phases."
https://openalex.org/W2885652098,"There is a significant interest in the neuroscience community in the development of large-scale network models that would integrate diverse sets of experimental data to help elucidate mechanisms underlying neuronal activity and computations. Although powerful numerical simulators (e.g., NEURON, NEST) exist, data-driven large-scale modeling remains challenging due to difficulties involved in setting up and running network simulations. We developed a high-level application programming interface (API) in Python that facilitates building large-scale biophysically detailed networks and simulating them with NEURON on parallel computer architecture. This tool, termed “BioNet”, is designed to support a modular workflow whereby the description of a constructed model is saved as files that could be subsequently loaded for further refinement and/or simulation. The API supports both NEURON’s built-in as well as user-defined models of cells and synapses. It is capable of simulating a variety of observables directly supported by NEURON (e.g., spikes, membrane voltage, intracellular [Ca++]), as well as plugging in modules for computing additional observables (e.g. extracellular potential). The high-level API platform obviates the time-consuming development of custom code for implementing individual models, and enables easy model sharing via standardized files. This tool will help refocus neuroscientists on addressing outstanding scientific questions rather than developing narrow-purpose modeling code."
https://openalex.org/W2886476046,"Gir is one of the main cattle breeds raised in tropical South American countries. Strong artificial selection through its domestication resulted in increased genetic differentiation among the countries in recent years. Over the years, genomic studies in Gir have become more common. However, studies of population structure and signatures of selection in divergent Gir populations are scarce and need more attention to better understand genetic differentiation, gene flow, and genetic distance. Genotypes of 173 animals selected for growth traits and 273 animals selected for milk production were used in this study. Clear genetic differentiation between beef and dairy populations was observed. Different criteria led to genetic divergence and genetic differences in allele frequencies between the two populations. Gene segregation in each population was forced by artificial selection, promoting isolation, and increasing genetic variation between them. Results showed evidence of selective forces in different regions of the genome. A total of 282 genes were detected under selection in the test population based on the fixation index (Fst), integrated haplotype score (iHS), and cross-population extend haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) approaches. The QTL mapping identified 35 genes associated with reproduction, milk composition, growth, meat and carcass, health, or body conformation traits. The investigation of genes and pathways showed that quantitative traits associated to fertility, milk production, beef quality, and growth were involved in the process of differentiation of these populations. These results would support further investigations of population structure and differentiation in the Gir breed."
https://openalex.org/W2885040384,"Background For many years, long-acting intramuscular (LAI) antipsychotics have been prescribed predominantly to chronic and severe patients, as a last resort when other treatments failed. Recently, a broader and earlier use of LAIs, particularly second-generation LAIs, has been emphasized. To date, few studies attempted to frame how this change in prescribing took place in real-world practice. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical features of patients prescribed with LAIs, and to explore possible prescribing differences between first- and second-generations LAIs under ordinary clinical practice in Italy. Methods The STAR Network “Depot” Study is an observational, longitudinal, multicenter study involving 35 centers in Italy. In the cross-sectional phase, patients prescribed with LAIs were consecutively recruited and assessed over a period of 12 months. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed. Results Of the 451 recruited patients, 61% were males. The level of social and working functioning was heterogeneous, as was the severity of disease. Seventy-two per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of the schizophrenia spectrum. Seventy per cent were prescribed with second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) LAIs (mostly paliperidone, aripiprazole and risperidone). Compared to first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) LAIs, patients prescribed with SGA LAIs were more often younger; employed; with a diagnosis of the schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder; with higher levels of affective symptoms; with fewer LAI prescriptions in the past. Discussion LAIs’ prescribing practices appear to be more flexible as compared to the past, although this change is mostly restricted to SGA LAIs."
https://openalex.org/W2886283296,"Ridinilazole, a novel targeted antibacterial being developed for the treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI) and prevention of recurrence, was shown in a recent Phase 2 study to be superior to vancomycin with regard to the primary efficacy measure, sustained clinical response (SCR), with the superiority being driven primarily by marked reductions in the rates of CDI recurrence within 30 days. Tolerability of ridinilazole was comparable to that of vancomycin. The current nested cohort study compared the effects of ridinilazole and vancomycin on fecal microbiota during and after treatment among participants in the Phase 2 study. Changes in the microbiota were assessed using qPCR and high-throughput sequencing on participants’ stools collected at multiple time-points (baseline [Day 1], Day 5, end-of-treatment [EOT; Day 10], Day 25, end-of-study [EOS; Day 40], and at CDI recurrence). qPCR analyses showed profound losses of Bacteroides, C. coccoides, C. leptum, and Prevotella groups at EOT with vancomycin treatment, while ridinilazole-treated participants had a modest decrease in C. leptum group levels at EOT, with levels recovering by Day 25. Vancomycin-treated participants had a significant increase in the Enterobacteriaceae group, with this increase persisting beyond EOT. At EOT, alpha diversity decreased with both antibiotics, though to a significantly lesser extent with ridinilazole (p <0.0001). Beta diversity analysis showed a significantly larger weighted Unifrac distance from baseline-to-EOT with vancomycin. Taxonomically, ridinilazole had a markedly narrower impact, with modest reductions in relative abundance in Firmicutes taxa. Microbiota composition returned to baseline sooner with ridinilazole than with vancomycin. Vancomycin treatment resulted in microbiome-wide changes, with significant reductions in relative abundances of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and a profound increase in abundance of Proteobacteria. These findings demonstrate that ridinilazole is significantly less disruptive to microbiota than vancomycin, which may contribute to the reduced CDI recurrence observed in the Phase 2 study."
https://openalex.org/W2887760876,"Pregnancy poses specific challenges for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection due to parasite sequestration in the placenta, which translates in low circulation levels in peripheral blood. The aim of this study is to assess the performance of a new highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (HS-RDT) for the detection of malaria in peripheral and placental blood samples from pregnant women in Colombia.This is a retrospective study using 737 peripheral and placental specimens collected from pregnant women in Colombian malaria-endemic regions. Light microscopy (LM), conventional rapid diagnostic tests (Pf/Pv RDT and Pf RDT), and HS-RDT testing were performed. Diagnostic accuracy endpoints of LM, HS-RDT and RDTs were compared with nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) as the reference test.In comparison with nPCR, the sensitivity of HS-RDT, Pf RDT, Pf/Pv RDT and LM to detect infection in peripheral samples was 85.7% (95% CI = 70.6-93.7), 82.8% (95% CI = 67.3-91.9), 77.1% (95% CI = 61.0-87.9) and 77.1% (95% CI = 61.0-87.9) respectively. The sensitivity to detect malaria in asymptomatic women, was higher with HS-RDT, where LM and Pf/Pv RDT missed half of infections detected by nPCR, but differences were not significant. Overall, specificity was similar for all tests (>99.0%). In placental blood, the prevalence of infection by P. falciparum by nPCR was 2.8% (8/286), by HS-RDT was 1% and by conventional RDTs (Pf RDT and Pf/Pv RDT) and LM was 0.7%. The HS-RDT detected placental infections in peripheral blood that were negative by LM and Pf/Pv RDT, however the number of positive placentas was low.The sensitivity of HS-RDT to detect P. falciparum infections in peripheral and placental samples from pregnant women was slightly better compared to routinely used tests during ANC visits and at delivery. Although further studies are needed to guide recommendations on the use of the HS-RDT for malaria case management in pregnancy, this study shows the potential value of this test to diagnose malaria in pregnancy in low-transmission settings."
https://openalex.org/W2887722293,"The relationship between subjective cognitive decline and frailty, two components of the so-called reversible cognitive frailty, in the elderly remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate whether this association exists, independent of confounding factors such as nutritional status, kidney function, inflammation, and insulin resistance.2386 participants (≥ 65 years of age) selected from the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) study. Fried frailty phenotype was adopted to quantify frailty status. We classified cognitive status into two categories-subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and normal cognition-and used polytomous logistic regressions to investigate the associations between SCD and frailty.There were 188 (7.88%), 1228 (51.47%), and 970 (40.65%) participants with frailty, pre-frailty, and robustness, respectively. Compared to those with normal cognition, elders with SCD were more likely to have pre-frailty (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.67, p = 0.004) or frailty (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.23-2.58, p = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender, education level, comorbidity, nutritional status, kidney function, and biochemical-related factors.A significant association between subjective cognitive decline and frailty was revealed in this study. Subjective cognitive decline was positively associated with pre-frailty or frailty even after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Our results can provide useful references in understanding mechanisms and developing suitable preventive strategies for the elderly with reversible cognitive frailty."
https://openalex.org/W2886726441,"Dietary exposure of cadmium (Cd) has not been studied in Southwest China. The objective of the study was to determine the pollution characteristics and contamination levels in various agriculture products in Southwest China and to conduct a comparison of dietary exposure assessment of Cd in polluted and non-polluted areas. Results showed that the mean Cd contents in rice were 0.53 and 0.52 mg/kg in the high-polluted and low-polluted areas, respectively, with the average value was 0.03 mg/kg in the control area. The mean dietary Cd exposure from rice and vegetables of the selected non-occupational residents in Southwest China was 113.10 μg/kg bodyweight (bw)/month, 88.80 μg/kg bw/month, and 16.50 μg/kg bw/month in the high-polluted, low-polluted, and control areas, respectively, which correspond to 4.5 times, 3.6 times, and 0.66 times of the provisional tolerable monthly intake (25 μg/kg bw/month) established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. The findings indicated that the risk for Cd exposure of residents was high due to home-grown food (most especially rice) being near polluted areas and is of great concern."
https://openalex.org/W2887143512,"Background According to studies by the National Kidney Foundation and Food and Drug Administration, 30% and 40% declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) could be used as surrogate endpoints of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the benefits of using these endpoints in diabetic patients remain unclear. Methods This cohort study comprised Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes; those with repeated serum creatinine measurements during a baseline period of 2 years (n = 1868) or 3 years (n = 2001) were enrolled. Subsequent risks of ESRD following eGFR declines were assessed. Results In the 2-year baseline analysis, the cumulative prevalence of −20%, −30%, −40%, and −53% changes in eGFR were 23.9%, 11.1%, 6.8%, and 3.7%, respectively. There were 133 cases (7.1%) of subsequent ESRD during a median follow-up period of 6.5 years. In the 3-year baseline analysis, the corresponding proportions were 28.1%, 14.0%, 7.7%, and 3.9%, respectively, with 110 participants (5.5%) reaching ESRD during a median follow-up period of 5.5 years. The adjusted hazard ratios of subsequent ESRD following −53%, −40%, −30%, and −20% changes in eGFR during the 2-year baseline period were 22.9 (11.1–47.3), 12.8 (6.9–23.7), 8.2 (4.3–15.5), and 3.9 (2.2–7.0), respectively when compared with the no changes in eGFR. In the 3-year baseline analysis, the corresponding risks were 29.7 (10.8–81.9), 18.4 (7.6–44.7), 12.8 (5.2–32.2), and 5.4 (2.3–12.8), respectively. In the subgroup analysis, similar trends were observed in patients with macroalbuminuria at baseline. Conclusions Declines in eGFR were strongly associated with subsequent risk of ESRD in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. In addition to 30% and 40% declines, a 20% decline in eGFR over 2 years could be considered as a candidate surrogate endpoint of ESRD in diabetic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2885472807,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a potentially deadly opportunistic fungal pathogen. Molecular studies have shaped our understanding of the genes, proteins, and molecules that contribute to A. fumigatus pathogenicity, but few studies have characterized genome-wide patterns of genetic variation at the population level. Of A. fumigatus genomic studies to-date, most focus mainly on single nucleotide polymorphisms and large structural variants, while overlooking the contribution of copy number variation (CNV). CNV is a class of small structural variation defined as loci that vary in their number of copies between individuals due to duplication, gain, or deletion. CNV can influence phenotype, including fungal virulence. In the present study, we characterized the population genomic patterns of CNV in a diverse collection of 71 A. fumigatus isolates using publicly available sequencing data. We used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to infer the population structure of these isolates and identified three populations consisting of at least 8 isolates. We then computationally predicted genome-wide CNV profiles for each isolate and conducted analyses at the species-, population-, and individual levels. Our results suggest that CNV contributes to genetic variation in A. fumigatus, with ~10% of the genome being CN variable. Our analysis indicates that CNV is non-randomly distributed across the A. fumigatus genome, and is overrepresented in subtelomeric regions. Analysis of gene ontology categories in genes that overlapped CN variants revealed an enrichment of genes related to transposable element and secondary metabolism functions. We further identified 72 loci containing 33 genes that showed divergent copy number profiles between the three A. fumigatus populations. Many of these genes encode proteins that interact with the cell surface or are involved in pathogenicity. Our results suggest that CNV is an important source of genetic variation that could account for some of the phenotypic differences between A. fumigatus populations and isolates."

However, the concentration of such contaminants/pollutants can be minimized with the help of microorganisms that has the ability to degrade the toxic pollutants into non-toxic metabolites. In the current study, 23 bacterial isolates were purified from the rhizospheric soil of Sysimbrium irio, growing as a wild plant in the vicinity of gas filling stations in Peshawar city. The isolated strains were initially screened on solid nutrient agar and further purified by culturing it on anthracene amended mineral media (PNR). The bacterial growth and anthracene disappearance were observed by calculating optical density (OD). The isolates showed a concentration-dependent growth on anthracene amended PNR media at 30°C and pH7. Also, an increase in bacterial OD from 0.351 to 1.80 with increased shaking speed was noticed. On the contrary, alternate carbon sources (glucose, fructose, sucrose) or nitrogen sources (KNO3, NaNO3, NH4NO3 and CaNO3) posed inhibitory effect on bacterial growth during anthracene degradation. The recorded efficiency of anthracene degradation by the selected bacterial isolate (1.4×1023 CFUmL-1 and 1.80 OD) was 82.29%, after 120 h of incubation. The anthracene was degraded to 9, 10, dihydroxy-anthracene and anthraquinone, detected through GC-MS. The efficient bacterial isolate was identified as S13, a new strain of Bacillus cereus, using 16S rRNA analysis, showing 98% homology. The isolated bacterial strain S13 may be used as a potential tool for bioremediation of toxic hydrocarbons and to keep the environment free from PAH pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W2887135816,"It is widely known that sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is age-related diseases with higher incidence rate among men. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major immune regulatory cytokine with a great impact and dual role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. In this context, the aim of the study was to explore the role of circulating TGF-β1 and the -509C/T functional promoter polymorphism (rs1800469) within the TGF-β1 gene (TGFB1) in the susceptibility, progression, and prognosis of CRC among Bulgarian male and female patients. Patients with sporadic CRC and healthy controls were genotyped by polymerase-chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum TGF-β1 levels before and after curative surgery were determined by ELISA. Total RNA was extracted from paired tumor, normal mucosa and distant metastasis samples and was used for quantitative detection of TGFB1 mRNA by TaqMan qPCR.We observed that TGF-β1 serum levels depend on the -509C/T genotype in combination with gender. TGF-β1 serum levels in CRC patients were decreased compared to controls, but statistical significance was reached only for men. In the stratified analysis by gender and genotype, a significant association was found for the CC genotype. Overall, our results indicate that the -509C allele increased the cancer risk, particularly for advanced stages (OR = 1.477; p = 0.029). The results from the relative mRNA quantification showed a significant upregulation of TGFB1 in distant metastases compared to primary tumor tissues and higher TGFB1 mRNA levels in men (RQ = 4.959; p = 0.022). In conclusion, we present data that diminished circulating TGF-β1 due to the CC genotype could be a possible risk factor for tumor susceptibility and progression. This association is more pronounced in males than in females. Colorectal cancer tissue expression of TGFB1 gene mRNA correlates with tumor progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2885139995,"Despite remarkable advances made to ameliorate how cochlear implants process the acoustic environment, many improvements can still be made. One of most fundamental questions concerns a strategy to simulate an increase in sound intensity. Psychoacoustic studies indicated that acting on either the current, or the duration of the stimulating pulses leads to perception of changes in how loud the sound is. The present study compared the growth function of electrically evoked Compound Action Potentials (eCAP) of the 8th nerve using these two strategies to increase electrical charges (and potentially to increase the sound intensity). Both with chronically (experiment 1) or acutely (experiment 2) implanted guinea pigs, only a few differences were observed between the mean eCAP amplitude growth functions obtained with the two strategies. However, both in chronic and acute experiments, many animals showed larger increases of eCAP amplitude with current increase, whereas some animals showed larger of eCAP amplitude with duration increase, and other animals show no difference between either approaches. This indicates that the parameters allowing the largest increase in eCAP amplitude considerably differ between subjects. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the strength of neuronal firing rate in auditory cortex and the effect of these two strategies on the eCAP amplitude. This suggests that pre-selecting only one strategy for recruiting auditory nerve fibers in a given subject might not be appropriate for all human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2885972545,"Cyclophosphamide (CTX) has immunosuppressive effects and has been wildly used as one anti-cancer drug in clinical. Significant toxicity has been noticed particularly in the reproductive system. CTX promotes the maturation of ovarian follicles, decreases follicular reserve, and ultimately lead to ovarian failure or even premature ovarian failure (POF). The placental extract (HPE) has been shown to have some beneficial impact on reproductive system; however, little is known regarding to the effect of HPE on protecting CTX-induced ovarian injury and the mechanism involved. Whether human placental extracts (HPE) has a protective effect on CTX-induced toxicity on ovarian was studied by using a CTX-induced ovarian injury animal model. The effects of HEP on histopathology, the number of atretic follicles, the weight of the ovary, serum hormone levels, and apoptosis in granulosa cells were studied in mice with CTX or control vehicle. Our results have demonstrated that HPE inhibited p-Rictor, reduced the expression of Bad, Bax and PPAR, and activated Akt and Foxo3a (increased their phosphorylation). Mice treated with HPE showed higher ovarian weight, lower number of atretic follicles, higher serum levels of the hormones E2 and progesterone, and lower apoptosis and serum levels of LH and FSH in granulosa cells, than that in the control animal group. Our data show that ovarian injury can be attenuated by HPE. HPE likely protects follicular granulosa cells from undergoing significant apoptosis and reduce atresia follicle formation, therefore, alleviates CTX-induced ovarian injury."
https://openalex.org/W2886663394,"Interactions between hyperthermophilic archaea and minerals occur in hydrothermal deep-sea vents, one of the most extreme environments for life on Earth. These interactions occur in the internal pores and at surfaces of active hydrothermal chimneys. In this study, we show that, at 85°C, Thermococcales, the predominant hyperthermophilic microorganisms inhabiting hot parts of hydrothermal deep-sea vents, produce greigite nanocrystals (Fe3S4) on extracellular polymeric substances, and that an amorphous iron phosphate acts as a precursor phase. Greigite, although a minor component of chimneys, is a recognized catalyst for CO2 reduction thus implying that Thermococcales may influence the balance of CO2 in hydrothermal ecosystems. We propose that observation of greigite nanocrystals on extracellular polymeric substances could provide a signature of hyperthermophilic life in hydrothermal deep-sea vents."
https://openalex.org/W2951570670,"The production of envelope glycoproteins (Envs) for use as HIV vaccines is challenging. The yield of Envs expressed in stable Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines is typically 10-100 fold lower than other glycoproteins of pharmaceutical interest. Moreover, Envs produced in CHO cells are typically enriched for sialic acid containing glycans compared to virus associated Envs that possess mainly high-mannose carbohydrates. This difference alters the net charge and biophysical properties of Envs and impacts their antigenic structure. Here we employ a novel robotic cell line selection strategy to address the problems of low expression. Additionally, we employed a novel gene-edited CHO cell line (MGAT1- CHO) to address the problems of high sialic acid content, and poor antigenic structure. We demonstrate that stable cell lines expressing high levels of gp120, potentially suitable for biopharmaceutical production can be created using the MGAT1- CHO cell line. Finally, we describe a MGAT1- CHO cell line expressing A244-rgp120 that exhibits improved binding of three major families of bN-mAbs compared to Envs produced in normal CHO cells. The new strategy described has the potential to eliminate the bottleneck in HIV vaccine development that has limited the field for more than 25 years."
https://openalex.org/W2885580287,"Tremendous volumes of messages on social media platforms provide supplementary traffic information and encapsulate crowd wisdom for solving transportation problems. However, social media messages manifested in human languages are usually characterized with redundant, fuzzy and subjective features. Here, we develop a data fusion framework to identify social media messages reporting non-recurring traffic events by connecting the traffic events with traffic states inferred from taxi global positioning system (GPS) data. Temporal-spatial information of traffic anomalies caused by the traffic events are then retrieved from anomalous traffic states. The proposed framework successfully identified accidental traffic events with various scales and exhibited strong performance in event descriptions. Even though social media messages are generally posted after the occurrence of anomalous traffic states, resourceful event descriptions in the messages are helpful in explaining traffic anomalies and for deploying suitable countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2885681523,"Epicardial fat located adjacent to the heart and coronary arteries is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Irisin is a myokine produced by skeletal muscle after physical exercise, and originally described as a molecule able to promote the browning of white adipose tissue and energy expenditure. In order to decrease cardiovascular risk, it has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated the relationships between serum concentrations of irisin and the adipokines adiponectin and leptin and body fat including epicardial fat in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We obtained serum samples from 93 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery (age 69.6 (SD 12.8) years, BMI 24.1 ± 4.8 kg/m2). Computed tomography (CT) and echocardiographic data were obtained from the routine preoperative examination. Subcutaneous fat area (SFA, cm2) and visceral fat area (VFA, cm2) near the umbilicus were automatically measured using the standard fat attenuation range. Epicardial fat area (EFA, cm2) was measured at the position where the heart became a long axis image with respect to the apex of the heart in the coronal section image. Total body fat mass, body fat percentage, and skeletal muscle volume (SMV) were estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Serum irisin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and compared with adiponectin and leptin concentrations. The data were also compared with the clinical biochemical data. EFA was strongly correlated with BMI (P = 0.0001), non-HDL-C (P = 0.029), TG (P = 0.004), body fat mass (P = 0.0001), and body fat percentage (P = 0.0001). Serum leptin concentration showed a significant positive correlation with BMI (P = 0.0001) and TG (P = 0.001). Adiponectin, but not irisin, showed a significant negative correlation with BMI (P = 0.006) and TG (P = 0.001). Serum leptin level had a significant positive correlation with EFA, VFA, and SFA. In contrast, the serum adiponectin level was significantly negatively correlated with EFA, VFA, and SFA. The serum irisin level was also negatively correlated with EFA (r = -0.249, P = 0.015), and SFA (r = -0.223, P = 0.039), and tended to correlate with VFA (r = -0.198, P = 0.067). The serum level of adiponectin was negatively correlated with that of leptin (r = -0.296, P = 0.012), but there were no significant correlations between irisin and either adiponectin or leptin. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that EFA showed a positive association with serum leptin level (β = 0.438, P = 0.0001) and a negative correlation with serum irisin level (β = -0.204, P = 0.038) and serum adiponectin level (β = -0.260, P = 0.015) after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. The present study provided the first evidence of associations of the serum irisin and adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) concentrations with epicardial fat in cardiovascular surgery patients. Irisin may play a role in preventing excess adiposity including epicardial fat, and consequently cardiovascular risk in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2886064501,"Population growth models are integral to ecological studies by providing estimates of population performance across space and time. Several models have been developed that estimate population growth through correlates of demographic traits, as measuring each parameter of the model can be prohibitive in experimental studies. Since differences in female size can accurately reflect changes in fecundity for many taxa, Livdahl and Sugihara developed a population growth index that incorporates size-fecundity relationships as a proxy for fecundity. To investigate the extent to which this model is robust to variation of this proxy, we tested if genetic (source population), temperature and resource treatments affect the size-fecundity relationship in Aedes albopictus (Skuse), the Asian tiger mosquito. We then determined if variation in the size-fecundity relationship alters the population growth estimates, lambda (λ'), when applied to Livdahl and Sugihara's model. We performed 2 laboratory experiments in which we reared cohorts of four different geographic populations of A. albopictus across 5 temperature treatments (18, 21, 25, 18, 31°C) and three resource treatments (low, medium, high larval resources). We determined if the slope of the size-fecundity relationship varied by source population, temperature, or resource; and if variation in this relationship affects lambda (λ') estimates in a competition study between A. albopictus and Culex pipiens (Linnaeus), the northern house mosquito. Temperature treatments significantly affected the size-fecundity relationship, resource level marginally affected the relationship, while source population had no effect. We found positive relationships between size and fecundity when mosquito larvae were reared at high temperatures and low resource levels but the relationship disappeared when mosquitoes were reared at a low temperature or with high levels of resources. The variation in the size-fecundity relationship produced from different temperatures resulted in statistically different lambda (λ') estimates. However, these changes in lambda (λ') did not alter the trends in the population performance across treatments or conclusions of the competition study. This study provides evidence that the population growth model is sensitive to variation in size-fecundity relationships and we recommend biologists apply the most compatible size-fecundity relationship to the models to obtain the most accurate estimates of population performance."

A sensitivity analysis of genetic variants known to be associated with late stage AMD showed that rs1061170 (p.Y402H) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene influences the association of Cer d18:1/16:0 with GA. To understand the possible influence of this genetic variant on ceramide levels, we established a cell-based assay to test the modulation of genes in the ceramide metabolism by factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), an alternative splicing variant of CFH that also harbors the 402 residue. We first showed that malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts, an oxidation product commonly found in AMD retinas, induces an increase in ceramide levels in WERI-Rb1 cells in accordance with an increased expression of ceramide synthesis genes. Then, we observed that cells exposed to the non-risk FHL-1:Y402, but not the risk associated variant FHL-1:H402 or full-length CFH, downregulated ceramide synthase 2 and ceramide glucosyltransferase gene expression. Together, our findings show that serum ceramide and hexosylceramide species are altered in AMD patients and that ceramide levels may be influenced by AMD associated risk variants."
https://openalex.org/W2887469408,"Home-based records (HBRs), which take many forms, serve as an important tool for frontline health workers by providing a standardized patient history vital to making informed decisions about the need for immunization services. There are increasing concerns around HBRs with recording areas that are functionally irrelevant because records are incomplete or not up-to-date. The aim of this report was to describe HBR ownership and report on the utilization of selected recording areas in HBRs across selected study communities in Kenya.The Kenya Missed Opportunities for Vaccination Assessment utilized a mixed-methods approach that included exit interviews, using a standardized questionnaire, among a convenience sample of caregivers of children aged <24 months attending a health facility during November 2016 as well as interviews of health staff and facility administrators. In addition to the exit interview data, we analysed data obtained from a review of available HBRs from the children.A total of 677 children were identified with a valid date of birth and who were aged <24 months. A HBR was in hand and reviewed for three-quarters of the children. Nearly one-third (n = 41) of those without a HBR in hand at the visit noted that they did not know the importance of bringing the document with them. Roughly two-thirds (n = 443) of caregivers noted they were asked by clinic staff to see the HBR during the clinic visit. Across the 516 reviewed HBRs, recording areas were most commonly identified for the child's demographic information (80% of HBRs) and vaccination history (82%) with information marked in >90% of records. Recording areas were less frequently available for child early eye / vision problems (61%), growth monitoring (74%) and vitamin A (76%); with information marked in 33%, 88% and 60% of records, respectively.Critical to the reduction of missed opportunities for vaccination, the HBR's importance must be emphasized and the document must be requested by health workers at every health encounter. Health workers must not only ensure that all children receive a HBR and counsel caregivers of its importance, but they must also ensure that all sections of the record are legibly completed to ensure continuity of care. Programmes are encouraged to periodically review and critically assess the HBR to determine whether the document's design and content areas are optimal to end user needs."
https://openalex.org/W2799451270,"Introduction In recent years, the traditional treatments for thrombotic diseases, heparin and warfarin, are increasingly being replaced by novel oral anticoagulants offering convenient dosing regimens, more predictable anticoagulant responses, and less frequent monitoring. However, these drugs can be contraindicated for some patients and, in particular, their bleeding liability remains high. Methods We have developed a new class of direct thrombin inhibitors (VE-DTIs) and have utilized kinetics, biochemical, and X-ray structural studies to characterize the mechanism of action and in vitro pharmacology of an exemplary compound from this class, Compound 1. Results We demonstrate that Compound 1, an exemplary VE-DTI, acts through reversible covalent inhibition. Compound 1 inhibits thrombin by transiently acylating the active site S195 with high potency and significant selectivity over other trypsin-like serine proteases. The compound inhibits the binding of a peptide substrate with both clot-bound and free thrombin with nanomolar potency. Compound 1 is a low micromolar inhibitor of thrombin activity against endogenous substrates such as fibrinogen and a nanomolar inhibitor of the activation of protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. In the thrombin generation assay, Compound 1 inhibits thrombin generation with low micromolar potency but does not increase the lag time for thrombin formation. In addition, Compound 1 showed weak inhibition of clotting in PT and aPTT assays consistent with its distinctive profile in the thrombin generation assay. Conclusion Compound 1, while maintaining strong potency comparable to the current DTIs, has a distinct mechanism of action which produces a differentiating pharmacological profile. Acting through reversible covalent inhibition, these direct thrombin inhibitors could lead to new anticoagulants with better combined efficacy and bleeding profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2885531130,"The Pyrenees represent a natural laboratory for biogeographic, evolutionary and ecological research of mountain fauna as a result of the high variety of habitats and the profound effect of the glacial and interglacial periods. There is a paucity of studies providing a detailed insight into genetic processes and better knowledge on the patterns of genetic diversity and how they are maintained under high altitude conditions. This is of particular interest when considering the course of past climate conditions and glaciations in a species which is considered site tenacious, with long generation times. Here we analyzed the genetic patterns of diversity and structure of the endemic Pyrenean brook newt (Calotriton asper) along its distribution range, with special emphasis on the distinct habitat types (caves, streams, and lakes), and the altitudinal and geographical ranges, using a total set of 900 individuals from 44 different localities across the Pyrenean mountain range genotyped for 19 microsatellite loci. We found evidence for a negative longitudinal and positive altitudinal gradient of genetic diversity in C. asper populations. The fact that genetic diversity was markedly higher westwards is in accordance with other Pyrenean species. However, the impact of altitudinal gradient on the genetic diversity seems to differ from other species, and mostly from other amphibians. We found that lower altitudes can act as a barrier probably because the lowlands do not provide a suitable habitat for C. asper. Regarding the distinct habitat types, caves had significantly lower values of genetic diversity compared to streams or lakes. The mean FST value was relatively high (0.304) with maximum values as high as 0.771, suggesting a highly structured total population. Indeed, populations were grouped into five subclusters, the eastern populations (cluster 1) remained grouped into two subclusters and the central-western Pyrenees (cluster 2) into three subclusters. The increase of isolation with geographical distance is consistent with the population structure detected. In conclusion, C. asper seems to be adapted to high altitude mountain habitats, and its genetic diversity is higher in the western Pyrenees. In terms of conservation priority, we consider more relevant the populations that represent a reservoir of genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2886365453,"Microcin E492 is a pore-forming bacteriocin with toxic activity against Enterobacteriaceae, which undergoes amyloid aggregation as a mechanism to regulate its toxicity. To be active, it requires the posttranslational attachment to the C-terminus of a glycosylated enterochelin derivative (salmochelin), a process carried out by the proteins MceC, MceI and MceJ encoded in the MccE492 gene cluster. Both microcin E492 and salmochelin have a proposed role in the virulence of the bacterial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. Besides, enterochelin is produced as a response to low iron availability and its synthesis is controlled by the global iron regulator Fur. Since the production of active microcin E492 depends on enterochelin biosynthesis, both processes could be coordinately regulated. In this work, we investigated the role of Fur in the expression of the microcin E492 maturation genes mceCJI. mceC was not regulated by Fur as it occurs with its homolog iroB in Salmonella enterica. We demonstrated that mceJI along with the previously uncharacterized gene mceX are transcribed as a single mRNA, and that Fur binds in vivo to a Fur box located upstream of the mceX-mceJI unit. Also, we established that the expression of these genes decreased in a condition of high iron availability, while this effect is abrogated in a Δfur background. Furthermore, our results indicated that MceX acts as a negative regulator of microcin E492 structural gene expression, coupling its synthesis to the iron-dependent regulatory circuit. Consequently, fur or mceX overexpression led to a significant decrease in the antibacterial activity of cells producing microcin E492. Altogether these results show that both the expression of microcin E492 maturation genes mceJI, and MceX the negative regulator of microcin E492 synthesis, are coordinated with the enterochelin production by Fur, depending on the iron levels in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W2887826346,"Mouse lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel-running behavior are helpful models for uncovering gene networks associated with increased motivation for physical activity and other reward-dependent behaviors. The fact that multiple brain regions are hypothesized to contribute to distinct behavior components necessitates the simultaneous study of these regions. The goals of this study were to identify brain-region dependent and independent gene expression patterns, regulators, and networks associated with increased voluntary wheel-running behavior. The cerebellum and striatum from a high voluntary running line and a non-selected control line were compared. Neuropeptide genes annotated to reward-dependent processes including neuropeptide S receptor 1 (Npsr1), neuropeptide Y (Npy), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9), and genes implicated in motor coordination including vitamin D receptor (Vdr) and keratin, type I cytoskeletal 25 (Krt25) were among the genes exhibiting activity line-by-region interaction effects. Genes annotated to the Parkinson pathway presented consistent line patterns, albeit at different orders of magnitude between brain regions, suggesting some parallel events in response to selection for high voluntary activity. The comparison of gene networks between brain regions highlighted genes including transcription factor AP-2-delta (Tfap2d), distal-less homeobox 5 gene (Dlx5) and sine oculis homeobox homolog 3 (Six3) that exhibited line differential expression in one brain region and are associated with reward-dependent behaviors. Transcription factors including En2, Stat6 and Eomes predominated among regulators of genes that differed in expression between lines. Results from the simultaneous study of striatum and cerebellum confirm the necessity to study molecular mechanisms associated with voluntary activity and reward-dependent behaviors in consideration of brain region dependencies."
https://openalex.org/W2886381914,"Hospitalized cancer patients are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite current recommendations in clinical guidelines, thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is underused. We performed an observational prospective study to analyse factors influencing prophylaxis use, VTE events and mortality in cancer-hospitalized patients. 1072 consecutive adult cancer patients were included in an University Hospital from April 2014 to February 2017, and followed-up for 30 days after discharge. The rate of LMWH prophylaxis was 67.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.7% to 70.4%), with a 2.8% rate of VTE events (95% CI 1.9% to 3.9%) and 3.5% rate of major bleeding events (95% CI 2.5% to 4.8%). 80% of VTE events occurred despite appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Overall, 30-day mortality rate was 13.2% (95% CI 11.2% to 15.3%). Active chemotherapy treatment, hospital stay ≥ 4 days, and metastatic disease were associated with a higher use of LMWH. On the contrary, patients with hematologic malignancies, anemia or thrombocytopenia were less prone to receive thromboprophylaxis. The main reasons for not prescribing LMWH prophylaxis were thrombocytopenia (23.9%) and active/recent bleeding (21.8%). The PRETEMED score, used for VTE risk stratification, correlated with 30-day mortality. There is room for improvement in thromboprophylaxis use among hospitalized-cancer patients, especially among those with hematologic malignancies. A relevant number of VTE events occurred despite prophylaxis with LMWH. Therefore, identification of risk factors for thromboprophylaxis failure is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2887499579,"Preclinical studies indicate that neural stem cells (NSCs) can limit or reverse central nervous system (CNS) damage through delivery of therapeutic agents for cell regeneration. Clinical translation of cell-based therapies raises concerns about long-term stability, differentiation and fate, and absence of tumorigenicity of these cells, as well as manufacturing time required to produce therapeutic cells in quantities sufficient for clinical use. Allogeneic NSC lines are in growing demand due to challenges inherent in using autologous stem cells, including production costs that limit availability to patients.We demonstrate the long-term stability of L-MYC immortalized human NSCs (LM-NSC008) cells in vivo, including engraftment, migration, and absence of tumorigenicity in mouse brains for up to nine months. We also examined the distributions of engrafted LM-NSC008 cells within brain, and present computational techniques to analyze NSC migration characteristics in relation to intrinsic brain structures.This computational analysis of NSC distributions following implantation provides proof-of-concept for the development of computational models that can be used clinically to predict NSC migration paths in patients. Previously, models of preferential migration of malignant tumor cells along white matter tracts have been used to predict their final distributions. We suggest that quantitative measures of tissue orientation and white matter tracts determined from MR images can be used in a diffusion tensor imaging tractography-like approach to describe the most likely migration routes and final distributions of NSCs administered in a clinical setting. Such a model could be very useful in choosing the optimal anatomical locations for NSC administration to patients to achieve maximum therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2887721649,"Breast cancer early detection is the major strategy for mortality rates reduction. In Brazil, Primary Health Care is an important strategy for public health promotion. To analyse the association between breast cancer mortality and primary health care indicators in Brazilian municipalities, data on breast cancer mortality and primary healthcare coverage of the 5,700 Brazilian municipalities were collected from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System. We collected data on the deaths of women living in Brazil in 2010 with breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality was calculated by 100,000 women and age-standardised from the World Health Organisation population. We studied the coverage of primary health care, family health team and community health agents. We found that increase of both primary care indexes was related to increasing of the breast cancer mortality. Additionally, improving the scholarly and reducing the income inequality was related to reducing the breast cancer mortality. Strategies to improve the quality of primary care, reduce the income inequality and improve elementary scholarly should be taken into account in the development of public policies in the Brazilian municipalities to reduce breast cancer in Brazilian municipalities."
https://openalex.org/W2885646016,"The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of increasing workload on individual thigh muscle activation during a 20 minute incremental cycling test. Intramuscular electromyographic signals were recorded from the knee extensors rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and vastus intermedius and the knee flexors semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and the short and long heads of the biceps femoris during increasing workloads. Mean activation levels were compared over the whole pedaling cycle and the crank angles at which onset and offset of activation and peak activity occurred were identified for each muscle. These data were compared between three workloads. EMG activation level significantly increased (p<0.05) with increasing workload in the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, biceps femoris long head, semitendinosus and semimembranosus but not in the biceps femoris short head. A significant change in activation timing was found for the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and semitendinosus. Of the knee flexors only the short head of the biceps femoris had its peak activity during the upstroke phase at the two highest workloads indicating a unique contribution to knee flexion."
https://openalex.org/W2885929230,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide and is classified into subtypes based on the cancer's receptor status. Of these subtypes, those expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor were traditionally associated with poor prognosis. Several advances have been made in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, yet issues of resistance and poor response to therapy remains prevalent. In this study we explored the impact of HER-family and homologous recombination deficiency SNPs on response to patients who received TCH-based (docetaxel (T), carboplatin (C), and trastuzumab (H)) treatment versus those who received other treatment regimens. Using Cox regression analysis, we identified 6 SNPs that correlate with recurrence free survival in our patients and supported our findings using support vector machines. We also used reverse phase protein array analysis to examine the impact ERBB3 SNPs may have on both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Finally, using cell line models, we correlated SNP status with sensitivity to platinum based drugs and docetaxel. We found that patients on a TCH based regimen with the minor allele of the ERBB3 (rs2229046 and rs773123) and BARD1 (rs2070096) SNPs, were significantly more likely to relapse than those women who were not. Additionally, we observed that patients with these ERBB3 SNPs had shown elevated protein expression/phosphorylation of Src kinase, c-MET (Y1234/1235), GSK-3β (S9) and p27, indicating that these SNPs are associated with non-PI3K/AKT signaling. Finally, using cell line models, we demonstrate that the BARD1 SNP (rs2229571) is associated with greater sensitivity to both carboplatin and cisplatin. The BARD1 and ERBB3 SNPs can potentially be used to determine those patients that will have a worse response to TCH based treatment, an effect that may arise from the SNPs impact on altered cellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2886464557,"Cancer cells are known for aberrant methylation patterns leading to altered gene expression and tumor progression. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible for regulating DNA methylation in normal cells. However, many aberrant versions of DNMTs have been identified to date and their role in cancer continues to be elucidated. It has been previously shown that an aberrant version of a de novo methylase, DNMT3B7, is expressed in many cancer cell lines and has a functional role in the progression of breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma. It is clear that DNMT3B7 is important to tumor development in vitro and in vivo, but it is unknown if expression of the transcript in all of these cell lines translates to relevant clinical results. In this study, a bioinformatics approach was utilized to test the hypothesis that DNMT3B7 expression corresponds to tumor progression in patient samples across cancer types. Gene expression and clinical data were obtained from the Genomic Data Commons for the 33 cancer types available and analyzed for DNMT3B7 expression with relation to tissue type in matched and unmatched samples, staging of tumors, and patient survival. Here we present the results of this analysis indicating a role for DNMT3B7 in tumor progression of many additional cancer types. Based on these data, future in vitro and in vivo studies can be prioritized to examine DNMT3B7 in cancer and, hopefully, develop novel therapeutics to target this aberrant transcript across multiple tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2887144354,"During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), there is a high incidence of capnograms distorted by chest compression artifact. This phenomenon adversely affects the reliability of automated ventilation detection based on the analysis of the capnography waveform. This study explored the feasibility of several filtering techniques for suppressing the artifact to improve the accuracy of ventilation detection.We gathered a database of 232 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest defibrillator recordings containing concurrent capnograms, compression depth and transthoracic impedance signals. Capnograms were classified as non-distorted or distorted by chest compression artifact. All chest compression and ventilation instances were also annotated. Three filtering techniques were explored: a fixed-coefficient (FC) filter, an open-loop (OL) adaptive filter, and a closed-loop (CL) adaptive filter. The improvement in ventilation detection was assessed by comparing the performance of a capnogram-based ventilation detection algorithm with original and filtered capnograms.Sensitivity and positive predictive value of the ventilation algorithm improved from 91.9%/89.5% to 97.7%/96.5% (FC filter), 97.6%/96.7% (OL), and 97.0%/97.1% (CL) for the distorted capnograms (42% of the whole set). The highest improvement was obtained for the artifact named type III, for which performance improved from 77.8%/74.5% to values above 95.5%/94.5%. In addition, errors in the measurement of ventilation rate decreased and accuracy in the detection of over-ventilation increased with filtered capnograms.Capnogram-based ventilation detection during CPR was enhanced after suppressing the artifact caused by chest compressions. All filtering approaches performed similarly, so the simplicity of fixed-coefficient filters would take advantage for a practical implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2886019488,"In an internet-based, forced-choice, test of the 'face race lightness illusion', the majority of respondents, regardless of their ethnicity, reported perceiving the African face as darker in skin tone than the European face, despite the mean luminance, contrast and numbers of pixels of the images were identical. In the laboratory, using eye tracking, it was found that eye fixations were distributed differently on the African face and European face, so that gaze dwelled relatively longer onto the locally brighter regions of the African face and, in turn, mean pupil diameters were smaller than for the European face. There was no relationship between pupils' size and implicit social attitude (IAT) scores. In another experiment, the faces were presented either tachistoscopically (140 ms) or longer (2500 ms) so that, when gaze was prevented from looking directly at the faces in the former condition, the tendency to report the African face as ""dark"" disappeared, but it was present when gaze was free to move for just a few seconds. We conclude that the presence of the illusion depends on oculomotor behavior and we also propose a novel account based on a predictive strategy of sensory acquisition. Specifically, by differentially directing gaze towards to facial regions that are locally different in luminance, the resulting changes in retinal illuminance yield respectively darker or brighter percepts while attending to each face, hence minimizing the mismatch between visual input and the learned perceptual prototypes of ethnic categories."
https://openalex.org/W2886350321,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest, ubiquitous and diverse protein families in nature. Categorized into nine subfamilies, its members are important to most organisms including fungi, where they play varied roles in fundamental cellular processes, plant pathogenesis or fungicide tolerance. However, these proteins are not yet well-understood in the class Dothideomycetes, which includes several phytopathogens that infect a wide range of food crops including wheat, barley and maize and cause major economic losses.We analyzed the genomes of 14 Dothideomycetes fungi (Test set) and seven well-known Ascomycetes fungi (Model set- that possessed gene expression/ functional analysis data about the ABC genes) and predicted 578 and 338 ABC proteins from each set respectively. These proteins were classified into subfamilies A to I, which revealed the distribution of the subfamily members across the Dothideomycetes and Ascomycetes genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of Dothideomycetes ABC proteins indicated evolutionary relationships among the subfamilies within this class. Further, phylogenetic relationships among the ABC proteins from the Model and the Test fungi within each subfamily were analyzed, which aided in classifying these proteins into subgroups. We compiled and curated functional and gene expression information from the previous literature for 118 ABC genes and mapped them on the phylogenetic trees, which suggested possible roles in pathogenesis and/or fungicide tolerance for the newly identified Dothideomycetes ABC proteins.The present analysis is one of the firsts to extensively analyze ABC proteins from Dothideomycetes fungi. Their phylogenetic analysis and annotating the clades with functional information indicated a subset of Dothideomycetes ABC genes that could be considered for experimental validation for their roles in plant pathogenesis and/or fungicide tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2886361908,"Background Survival of mothers and newborns depends on life-saving interventions reaching those in need. Recent evidence suggests that indicators of contact with health services are poor proxies for measures of coverage of life saving care and attention has shifted towards the quality of care provided during contacts. Methods and findings Regression analysis using data from representative cluster-based household surveys and surveys of the frontline health workers and primary health facilities in four regions of Ethiopia in 2012 and 2015 was used to explore associations between increased numbers of contacts or improvements in quality and any change in the coverage of interventions (intervention coverage). In pregnancy, in multiple regression, an increase in the quality indicator ‘focused ANC behaviours’ was associated with a change in both the coverage of iron supplementation and syphilis prevention ((regression coefficients (95% CI)) 0·06 (0·01, 0·11); 0·07 (0·04, 0·10)). This equates to a 0.6% increase in the proportion of women taking iron supplementation and a 0.7% in women receiving syphilis prevention for a 10% increase in the quality indicator ‘focused ANC behaviours’. At delivery, in multiple regression the quality indicator ‘availability of uterotonic supplies amongst birth attendants’ was associated with improved coverage of prophylactic uterotonics (0·72 (0·50, 0·94)). No evidence of any relationships between contacts, quality and intervention coverage were observed within the early postnatal period. Conclusions Increases in both contacts and in quality of care are needed to increase the coverage of life saving interventions. For interventions that need to be delivered at multiple visits, such as antenatal vaccination, increasing the number of contacts had the strongest association with coverage. For those relying on a single point of contact, such as those delivered at birth, we found strong evidence to support current commitments to invest in both input and process quality."
https://openalex.org/W3145835881,"Hypothesis testing in contingency tables is usually based on asymptotic results, thereby restricting its proper use to large samples. To study these tests in small samples, we consider the likelihood ratio test and define an accurate index, the P-value, for the celebrated hypotheses of homogeneity, independence, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The aim is to understand the use of the asymptotic results of the frequentist Likelihood Ratio Test and the Bayesian FBST -- Full Bayesian Significance Test -- under small-sample scenarios. The proposed exact P-value is used as a benchmark to understand the other indices. We perform analysis in different scenarios, considering different sample sizes and different table dimensions. The exact Fisher test for $2 \times 2$ tables that drastically reduces the sample space is also discussed. The main message of this paper is that all indices have very similar behavior, so the tests based on asymptotic results are very good to be used in any circumstance, even with small sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2885085899,"This paper investigates the consequences of ignoring the clustered data structure on allometric models. Clustered data, in the form of multiple trees sampled from multiple forest stands is commonly used to develop biomass allometric models. Of 102 reviewed papers published between 2012 and 2016 that reported biomass allometric models, 84 (82%) have used a clustered sampling design. However, in as many as 80% of these, the clustered data structure was ignored, potentially violating the independence assumption in ordinary least squares methods. The consequences of ignoring clustered data structure were empirically validated using two clustered biomass datasets (of 110 and 220 trees, with the cluster size of 5 and 10 trees respectively). We showed that when Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was higher than zero, ignoring the clustered data structure returned underestimated standard errors, affecting further the confidence interval and t-test results. The underestimation level depended on ICC (which shows the variance proportion that was caused by the forest stand) and on cluster size (the number of trees sampled from one forest stand). We also showed that using first-order autocorrelation tests, such as the traditional Durbin-Watson statistic, to detect the autocorrelation due to clustered structure could be misleading as the test may show lack of autocorrelation even though ICC is different from zero. In conclusion, when ICC is higher than zero, ignoring the clustered data structure yields over-confident biomass predictions (due to underestimated confidence interval) and/or incorrect research conclusions (due to overestimated evidence against null hypothesis in t-test). Therefore, using a modelling approach that accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data is highly recommended when any form of clustering can be identified, even if the autocorrelation is not significant."

The molecular complexes with which TBX18 regulates transcription are poorly understood prompting us to use an unbiased proteomic approach to search for protein interaction partners. Using overexpressed dual tagged TBX18 as bait, we identified by tandem purification and subsequent LC-MS analysis TBX18 binding proteins in 293 cells. Clustering of functional annotations of the identified proteins revealed a highly significant enrichment of transcriptional cofactors and homeobox transcription factors. Using nuclear recruitment assays as well as GST pull-downs, we validated CBFB, GAR1, IKZF2, NCOA5, SBNO2 and CHD7 binding to the T-box of TBX18 in vitro. From these transcriptional cofactors, CBFB, CHD7 and IKZF2 enhanced the transcriptional repression of TBX18, while NCOA5 and SBNO2 dose-dependently relieved it. All tested homeobox transcription factors interacted with the T-box of TBX18 in pull-down assays, with members of the Pbx and Prrx subfamilies showing coexpression with Tbx18 in the developing ureter of the mouse. In summary, we identified and characterized new TBX18 binding partners that may influence the transcriptional activity of TBX18 in vivo."

The study aims to examine the relationship between beliefs about medicines and self-medication with analgesics in dental pain management in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study was conducted among conveniently sampled patients attending dental clinics, located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to assess association between self-medication with analgesics and patient’s beliefs about medicines via Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. Participants were evaluated for their self-medication practices via 4 items. Further assessment was done via Quantitative Analgesic Questionnaire (QAQ) regarding the analgesics taken. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24, with 0.05 as level of significance. The prevalence of self-medication with analgesics was 29.4%, with 95.6% of the participants took analgesics when necessary. Participants practising self-medication for dental pain reported more positive beliefs in General-Necessity (13.04 vs. 9.98, p = 0.001) than those not practising self-medication. However, these participants had weaker beliefs in General-Harm (12.00 vs. 10.29, p = 0.006) and General-Overuse (11.38 vs. 10.31, p = 0.032) than those not practising self-medication. Participants beliefs in General-Harm (r = -0.243; p = 0.003) and General-Overuse (r = -0.203; p = 0.012) were negatively correlated with total QAQ point. The study found that individuals who practised self-medication had stronger beliefs about the benefits of medicines and weaker beliefs in viewing medicines as harmful and overused. Findings can guide public education to improve the safety aspects of self-medication with analgesics in dental practice."
https://openalex.org/W2885214510,"Phosphorus (P) is arguably more limiting than nitrogen for forest ecosystems being free of disturbances for lengthy time periods. The elucidation of multivariate relationships between foliar P and its primary drivers for dominant species is an urgent issue and formidable challenge for ecologists. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of primary drivers on foliar P of Quercus wutaishanica, the dominant species in broadleaved deciduous forest at the Loess Plateau, China. We sampled the leaves of 90 Q. wutaishanica individuals across broad climate and soil nutrient gradients at the Loess Plateau, China, and employed structural equation models (SEM) to evaluate multiple causal pathways and the relative importance of the drivers for foliar P per unit mass (Pmass) and per unit area (Parea). Our SEMs explained 73% and 81% of the variations in Pmass and Parea, respectively. Pmass was negatively correlated to leaf mass per area, positively correlated to leaf area, and increased with mean annual precipitation and total soil potassium. Parea was positively correlated to leaf mass per area, leaf dry weight, and increased significantly with total soil potassium. Our results demonstrated that leaf P content of Q. wutaishanica increased with total soil potassium in the Loess Plateau accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2886083098,"This prospective observational study was designed to analyze platelet functions across time in 50 patients scheduled for liver transplantation (LT) secondary to decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Platelet functions were assessed before LT (pre-LT), one week (D7) and 1 month (D28) after LT. Platelet count significantly increased from pre-LT time to day 28 as well as circulating CD34+hematopoietic stem cells. To avoid any influence of platelet count on assays, platelet function was evaluated on platelet-rich-plasma adjusted to pre-LT platelet count. Although platelet secretion potential did not differ between time-points, as evaluated by the expression of CD62P upon strong activation, platelet aggregation in response to various agonists significantly increased along time, however with no concomitant increase of circulating markers of platelet activation: platelet microvesicles, platelet-leukocyte complexes, soluble CD40L and soluble CD62P. In the multivariate analysis, hepatic function was associated with platelet count and function. A lower platelet aggregation recovery was correlated with Child C score. History of thrombosis or bleeding was associated with respective higher or lower values of platelet aggregation. This longitudinal analysis of platelet functions in LT patients showed an improvement of platelet functions along time together with platelet count increase, with no evidence of platelet hyperactivation at any time-point."
https://openalex.org/W2886889345,"Turtle shell rattles are percussion instruments used by Indigenous peoples of the Americas in ceremonial contexts to keep rhythm. Archaeological investigations in the southeastern United States produced several complete and partial Eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) shell rattles from mortuary contexts dating from the Archaic (ca. 8000–1000 BC) through Mississippian periods (ca. AD 800–1500). Fragmentary turtle remains, some identified as Eastern box turtle, are frequently recovered from non-mortuary contexts. Traditionally, these fragmentary remains are attributed to food waste. Given the archaeological and ethnographic evidence for turtle shell rattles, we need to consider how fragmentary remains might fit into the chaîne opératoire of rattle production. This paper presents the results of an experimental study designed to identify one such chaîne opératoire of rattle production. During this experiment, the data on taphonomic processes such as manufacturing marks, use-wear, and breakage patterns, were recorded. We then tested the taphonomic findings from the experimental study and an object trait list we compiled from known rattle specimens and documentary sources with archaeological turtle remains recovered from non-mortuary contexts at two Mississippian period (ca. AD 1000–1450) sites in Middle Tennessee. Historic indigenous groups are known to have, and still do into the present-day, make and use turtle shell rattles in the region. Ultimately, we determined that “food refuse” should not be the default interpretation of fragmentary box turtle remains, and instead the taphonomic history and contextual associations must be considered in full. The experimental process of crafting turtle shell rattles enhances our understanding of an ancient musical instrument and the success rate of identifying musical artifacts and distinguishing between other modified turtle remains in the archaeological record. This study expands our knowledge of ancient music in North America and prompts re-analysis of curated turtle remains in museums for rattle-related modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2885610779,"The successful implementation of disarmament treaties of the last centuries has led to significant amounts of weapon-grade Plutonium which are currently stored in high security storage facilities. Disposing this Plutonium should be seen as 'good housekeeping' avoiding unnecessary costs and the hazards of storing this material indefinitely. In addition, the disarmament is only brought to a successful end when the Plutonium isn't available for the production of new weapons anymore. We propose a disruptive approach for Plutonium disposition and demonstrate the feasibility in a neutronic study. Burning of weapon-grade Plutonium in a molten salt fast reactor is significantly more efficient than in the studied other reactors, while efficient process design has the potential to reduce the security concerns significantly. The proposed system could turn about 1.25 tons of weapon-grade Plutonium into electric energy worth £ 0.5 to 1 billion/year, depending on the electricity price while avoiding the hassle and eliminating the risk of high security Plutonium storage. In conclusion, burning of the weapon-grade Plutonium resulting from disarmament could be an economically very attractive approach to reduce the nuclear threat."
https://openalex.org/W2886511827,"Poly(lactic acid) has been extensively investigated in the biomedical field because of its good biocompatibility and biodegradability. As an important method of poly(lactic acid) synthesis, metal complex-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide can achieve a controllable lactide polymerization through the selection of appropriate ligands and metals. In this study, a novel metal (LTi–O)2 complex was synthesized and structurally characterized. (LTi–O)2 showed a relatively high catalytic activity and controllability of Poly(D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) molecular weights (polydispersity index of 1.02–1.22) in the ROP of D,L-lactide. The kinetic equation of D,L-LA ROP catalyzed by (LTi–O)2 could be expressed as–d[M]/dt = k[M]2[(LTi–O)2]1, and the reaction activation energy was 95.67 kJ·mol−1. Physical/chemical properties and biocompatibility evaluation results showed that PDLLA obtained through the (LTi–O)2-catalyzed ROP of D,L- lactide exhibited a good degradation performance and excellent biocompatibility."
https://openalex.org/W2885495322,"Hemorrhagic shock has a potential to be life-threatening when it is not treated. The main causes of hemorrhagic shock involve: (1) forces causing injury; and (2) diseases that can cause hemorrhage., Therefore, due to the causes of hemorrhagic shock and the life-threatening potential, the search for new methods of shock treatment is extremely valuable to the modern medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of clobenpropit in the model of hemorrhagic shock. The experiments were conducted in 110 adult male Wistar rats weighing between 205 and 470g. 1, 2 and 5 μmol/kg of intravenous H3 receptors reverse agonists, clobentropit, and/or 1, 5 and 10 μmol/kg H3 receptor agonist, imetit, were used as general anesthetics. Irreversible hemorrhagic shock was induced by the paused bleeding until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) lowered to the level of 20–25 mmHg. It was proved that, in cases of critical hypotension, clobenpropit triggered a dose-dependent increase of: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MPA and heart rate (HR) of rats with critical hypotension. The most significant changes in hemodynamic parameters were achieved by administrating dosages of 2 mmol/kg. This resulted in the survival rate increase to up to 100%. However, imetit did not trigger any hemodynamic changes nor an increase in SBP, DBP, MAP or HR. Furthermore, it was found that the premedication with prazosin, yohimbine, 6-hydroxydopamine and the vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist blocked the effects of clobenpropit. Additionally, premedication with propranolol, captopril and ZD 7155 did not cause any significant changes in the measured hemodynamic parameters. In conclusion, after an intravenous injection clobenpropit, the inverse agonist of H3 histamine receptors/agonist of histamine receptors H4, causes a resuscitating effect on rats in hemorrhagic shock. Moreover, such effect is based on the effector mechanisms of sympathetic nervous system and vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W2885832010,"Mathematical modeling has been recognized as an important tool to advance the understanding of the synergetic effect of coupled disturbances (stressors) on the forest population dynamics. Nonetheless, most of the modeling done on disturbances focus on individual disturbance agents and the modeling research on disturbances interactions uses predominantly descriptive statistical processes. This state of art points to the need for continuing modeling efforts not only for addressing the link among multiple disturbances but also for incorporating disturbance processes. In this paper, we present an age-structured forest-beetle mechanistic model with tree harvesting. We investigate three scenarios involving the beetles equilibrium states (no beetles, beetles in endemic and epidemic states). Optimal control theory was applied to study three different benefit functions involving healthy and dead trees. The numerical simulations show that maintaining the beetle infestation at endemic level instead of eliminating all the beetles is sufficient to ensure the forest has trees with all ages. Furthermore, the numerical simulations shows that the harvesting benefit decreases as the number of beetles increases in all cases except when the benefit functional includes a cost (ecological and harvest implementation) and the value of wood is equal across all trees (healthy harvested trees, trees killed by beetles, and trees that die naturally)."
https://openalex.org/W2886541075,"A new sequential method based on multi-resolution approximation is proposed for solving computationally expensive multi-objective optimization problems. A traditional strategy is to decompose a multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization problems, whereby the PF can be regarded as a function of weights. Therefore, it is very natural to use wavelet multi-resolution approximation techniques for setting weight vectors. In our framework, the sequential approach starts with sampling aggressive functions on the initial coarsest grid with a few collocation points; once a rough PF is obtained, new points are automatically added on the basis of an adaptive wavelet collocation method. Therefore, the PF can be approximated with a relatively small number of weights. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated on two examples: a typical multi-objective optimization problem and an expensive multi-objective control optimal problem."
