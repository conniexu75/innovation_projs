https://openalex.org/W1513285127,"Abstract Human platelets were subjected to hypotonic lysis after being loaded intracellularly with glycerol (4.3 m) by centrifugation in a glycerol gradient under controlled conditions. A homogeneous membrane fraction, free of intracellular organelles, was isolated after a single density step centrifugation, while continuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation gave two subfractions with densities of 1.090 and 1.120, and with identical isoelectric points (pI 3.9) as determined by isoelectric focusing. Compositional studies indicated that the platelet membrane was a lipoglycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of approximately 7%. The sugar components were identified as glucose, galactose, mannose, hexosamines (GlcN:GalN = 6:1), sialic acid, and fucose. The chemical composition of the platelet membranes isolated at d, 1.090 was protein, 31.9%; lipid, 55.9%; carbohydrate, 7.3%; RNA, 0.3%; DNA, 0.0%; and for those isolated at d, 1.120, it was protein, 40.1%; lipid, 48.2%; carbohydrate, 6.9%; RNA, 0.4%; DNA, 0.0%. The membranes were characterized by a high molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid (0.49 and 0.45) that was similar to that found in liver plasma membranes. Phosphodiesterase, acid phosphatase and ATPase were purified 8-, 4-, and 2-fold, respectively, in the membrane fractions, whereas succinic dehydrogenase, esterase, and a variety of β-glycosidases were present only at very low levels. These results demonstrate the absence of intracellular membranes and, together with the chemical analyses, they suggest that the outer membrane of the platelet is similar to plasma membranes of other cells, and they provide biochemical confirmation of its origin from the plasma membrane of the megakaryocyte. The vesicles of the two membrane bands differed in ultrastructure, the lighter (d, 1.090) having an average diameter of 1750 A with numerous concentric double membrane structures, while the heavier (d, 1.120) consisted of single membranes of diameter 700 A."
https://openalex.org/W1594474986,"Abstract Induction of the synthesis of the specific protein avidin by a single administration of progesterone has been demonstrated previously in chicks in vivo and in tissue minces and monolayer cultures of chick oviduct. To investigate the mechanism of induction, macromolecular components of oviduct cytoplasm which bind 3H-progesterone in vitro were isolated and characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzymatic digestion, and gel filtration on Agarose (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, California). The radioactive steroid in the isolated complex was identified as progesterone, not a metabolite, by paper chromatography. The interaction with 3H-progesterone has an apparent dissociation constant kd ≃ 8 x 10-10 m in 0.3 m KCl at 1° and is reversed by mild heating and by unlabeled progesterone g testosterone g 20α-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one g 17β-estradiol g cortisol g estrone g androstenedione. The participation of protein in the steroid-binding site was inferred from the destruction of the complex by 10-3 m p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and by Pronase, but not by ribo- or deoxyribonucleases. The apparent number and size of the cytoplasmic binding components vary with the concentration of KCl and the technique of isolation and detection. In the absence of KCl, the major components are characterized by sedimentation coefficients, s020,w, of about 5 S and 8 S, molecular weights of about 1.0 and 3.6 x 105 (estimated from the variation of electrophoretic mobility with gel concentration), and sufficiently large effective radii to be eluted in, or near, the void volume of columns of Agarose A-0.5m. Under the same conditions the corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) of chick plasma behaves as a single component with s020,w ≃ 3.7 S and mol wt ≃ 6.0 x 104. In solutions containing 0.3 m KCl, the cytoplasmic components and CBG all sediment at about the same rate but may be distinguished from each other by the distribution coefficients on Agarose A-0.5m. From the latter results, molecular Stokes radii of 55 and 63 A can be calculated for the cytoplasmic components, compared with 37 A for CBG. The progesterone-binding components of chick oviduct cytoplasm are thus distinguishable from CBG by all physicochemical methods tested. A functional role for these components in the induction of avidin synthesis by progesterone is supported by (a) the parallel order of effectiveness of various steroids in competing with progesterone binding and in potency as inducers, and (b) the analogous effects of treating the chicks with diethylstilbestrol on progesterone-binding activity and on avidin induction."
https://openalex.org/W1532577754,"Abstract Cyanogen bromide cleavage of bovine plasma albumin in 75% formic acid gave two fragments, N and C, in yields of 80%. After reduction of the cross-linking disulfide bonds of Fragment N, two peptides containing 88 and 98 amino acid residues were isolated. The single sulfhydryl group of albumin was found to be located in the 88 amino acid residue peptide which occupies the amino-terminal position of the molecule. After reduction of Fragment C, three peptides containing 211, 148, and 34 amino acid residues were isolated. These five peptides together account for the albumin molecule. Limited tryptic hydrolysis of defatted bovine plasma albumin at pH 8.8 and 0° gave a fragment of molecular weight of about 40,000 in a yield of 21%. The fragment is derived from the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the albumin molecule as shown by a comparison of its three cyanogen bromide peptides with those from albumin. These data were used for the alignment of the five cyanogen bromide peptides of albumin. Binding studies showed that the tryptic fragment and defatted albumin both had one primary site for octanoate and l-tryptophan. d-Tryptophan competitively displaced either of these two ligands from the fragment and from albumin, thus suggesting that all three ligands bind at the same site. The binding constants of the fragment for the three ligands were all about one-third of those for albumin. The ratio of the binding constants of l-and d-tryptophan for the fragment was nearly the same as that for albumin, and this was also the case for octanoate and l-tryptophan. These similarities strongly suggest that the binding site in the fragment is the one present in albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1574348079,"Crude enzyme obtained from heparin-induced flavobacteria has been fractionated into a heparitinase acting on heparitin sulfates and related compounds and a heparinase acting mainly on heparin. Purification achieved for each was from 50 to 100 times that of earlier preparations containing a mixture of the two enzymes. In agreement with previous data both enzymes act as eliminases rather than hydrolases yielding products containing Δ4,5-unsaturated uronic acid. Specificity of the heparitinase appears to require the absence of O-sulfate and the presence of N-acetyl or sulfamido groups. Specificity of the heparinase requires the presence of O-sulfate and sulfamido groups while derivatives containing free amino or N-acetyl are not substrates. The heparinase degrades heparitin sulfate to some extent acting apparently on the heparin-like portion."
https://openalex.org/W1580745621,"Abstract Intracellular distribution of the sialidase of adult bovine brain gray matter was determined. The sialidase was found to be concentrated in the synaptosome fraction, and when the latter was disrupted and further fractionated, sialidase activity was found to be concentrated in the synaptosomal membrane. Sialidase in all cell fractions showed activity toward an intrinsic endogenous substrate, as well as toward added disialo- and trisialogangliosides, and sialyllactose. Km values for the sialidase in an acetone powder preparation from gross gray matter were 8 x 10-5 and 2 x 10-3 m for gangliosides and sialyllactose, respectively. There was an unequivocal lag phase of about 15 min between the time of addition of exogenous substrate and the time the sialidase measurably acted on it. The enzyme was found to act on the intrinsic endogenous substrate during the lag phase. Thin layer chromatography showed monosialo-, disialo-, and trisialogangliosides to be present in all cell fractions having sialidase activity. Analysis of the active fractions after incubation at 37° for 75 min without added exogenous substrate showed that monosialoganglioside, the end product of enzyme action on the intrinsic ganglioside substrate, remained associated with the membrane fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1556772506,"Abstract A single injection of isoproterenol results, after a lag period of 20 hours, in a marked stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the mouse salivary gland. The incorporation of leucine-3H into three acidic nuclear protein fractions (nonhistone nuclear proteins) increases within 30 min following the administration of isoproterenol and does not return to control levels until 48 hours later. The three fractions consist of (a) a fraction soluble in Tris-EDTA (ribonucleoprotein fraction); (b) one extractable from nuclei with 0.15 n NaCl; and (c) an acidic fraction insoluble in the above solutions and in 0.25 n H2SO4 (residual fraction). The incorporation of leucine-3H into acidic nuclear proteins reaches its peak 12 hours after isoproterenol injection while the peak activity of the histone fraction coincides with the peak of DNA synthesis. Since the specific activity of the leucine pool does not change in stimulated glands, the increased incorporation of leucine-3H into acidic nuclear proteins indicates an increase in the rate of synthesis of these proteins. Actinomycin D given 30 min prior to isoproterenol inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis but does not affect the increase in the rate of synthesis of nuclear proteins which occurs 2 hours after isoproterenol. However, the increases in the rates of synthesis occurring at 8 and 12 hours are inhibited. Cycloheximide, administered 1 hour after isoproterenol, inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis as well as the increase in acidic nuclear protein synthesis at 8 and 12 hours. These results indicate a temporal difference in the synthesis of histones and acidic proteins during the transition of G0 cells to the S phase and suggest that acidic nuclear proteins may be involved in the control of cell proliferation in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1538270730,"Abstract Benz[a]anthracene induces aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in secondary fetal cell cultures derived from various inbred mouse strains. The maximally inducible level of hydroxylase activity from the C57BL/6N strain is 4 to 6 times higher than that from the DBA/2N strain in cell cultures derived from the entire mouse fetus. There are no differences between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N cell cultures in the rate of uptake of benz[a]anthracene by the cells, in the binding of polycyclic hydrocarbon to cellular material, or in the rate of degradation of the induced hydroxylase activity. A 24-hour treatment of the cell cultures with benz[a]anthracene produces increases in the microsomal content of total protoheme and CO-binding cytochrome (about 88% and 120%, respectively) in C57BL/6N cells compared to about 31% and 33%, respectively, in DBA/2N cells. Concomitantly, the blue spectral shift in the absorption maximum of the reduced hemoprotein-CO complex is at least 4 nm in microsomal fractions from C57BL/6N cells and between 1 and 2 nm in DBA/2N microsomes. In cells exposed to benz[a]anthracene plus cycloheximide and then grown in fresh growth medium, the rise in hydroxylase activity in C57BL/6N cells is at least 4 times greater than that from DBA/2N cells. In cells exposed to benz[a]anthracene and then treated with actinomycin D, the stimulatory phenomenon by the antibiotic is at least 4 times greater in C57BL/6N cells than that in DBA/2N cells. These experiments provide indirect evidence for a decreased expression of an induction-specific RNA in DBA/2N cells. The decreases in (a) formation of CO-binding hemoprotein, (b) spectral shift in the absorbance peak of the reduced microsomal cytochrome-CO complex, and (c) expression of induction-specific RNA may be related to the decreased extent of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction in DBA/2N cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065693587,"THIS report describes an effect (not previously reported) of single doses of steroids on the cell cycle of haemopoietic stem, cells. This effect, one of increasing the sensitivity of spleen colony forming units (CFU) to the lethal effects of 3H-thymidine, is seen well before the long-term effects of steroids on erythropoiesis1. Increased sensitivity of CFU to 3H-thymidine was also observed in steroid-treated polycythaemic mice. The latter finding suggests that the steroid effect is not mediated through erythropoietin."

https://openalex.org/W1493864303,"Abstract 1. The fluorescence properties of the 2 tryptophans of native sperm whale apomyoglobin suggest that they are in rather nonpolar environments but are partially exposed to solvent. 2. Apomyoglobin undergoes an abrupt unfolding in the pH region between 5.5 and 4, with loss of α helix content and increased exposure of the tryptophans. Below pH 4, unfolding, loss of α helix, and exposure of the tryptophans become even more pronounced. 3. The fluorescence yield, but not the excited lifetime, is increased significantly upon titration from pH 5.5 to 8.3, without an appreciable change in the size or shape of the protein. The most likely explanation is that at pH 5.5 the fluorescence of one of the tryptophan residues is quenched by a nearby histidine residue. Increasing the pH deprotonates the histidine residue and renders it nonquenching."
https://openalex.org/W1544960916,"Abstract The rate of activation of the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin has been found to be greatly accelerated by the neodymium(III) ion. The similarity of this process to the calcium(II) ion activation suggests that both metal ions bind at identical sites in trypsinogen. The rate of activation in the presence of the neodymium ion is much greater than that of the calcium ion, probably reflecting the increased stability constant of the neodymium-protein complex. In contrast to the calcium ion, however, neodymium(III) can be scrutinized by a variety of spectral and magnetic techniques which should reveal information concerning the calcium ion binding sites in proteins. Since the chemistry and the range of sizes of the rare earth metal ions are so similar to that of the calcium ion, it is suggested that generally these ions should make good replacement ions for probing the calcium ion binding sites of proteins and enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1485022941,"Abstract Using isotopically asymmetric phosphoenolpyruvate-3-d,t it was established that pyruvate kinase causes the addition of a proton to C-3 from the face designated by a counterclockwise sequence of phosphate, carboxyl, and vinyl groups, the si face. Having shown that the pyruvate carboxylase reaction has a normal primary isotope effect, it was possible to determine its stereochemistry with enantiomorphic pyruvate prepared in the pyruvate kinase reaction. Carboxylation occurs with retention of configuration at carbon-3 of pyruvate. With this information, it was possible to analyze the enantiomorphic pyruvates formed by reaction of (3S)- or (3R)l-malate-3-d,t with malate enzyme. The decarboxylation occurred with retention."
https://openalex.org/W1530231574,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence has been determined for hemoglobin V from the lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. This sequence differs at only 12 sites from the sequence proposed for the hemoglobin of another species of lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis. The primary structure of Petromyzon hemoglobin is compared with those of other vertebrate hemoglobins and is discussed in terms of the results of x-ray diffraction studies which indicate the presence of 2 residues not found in the sequence work. Suggestions concerning possible structure-function relationships are based in part on the hypothesis that residues which are identical or very similar in all hemoglobins may have the same functions."
https://openalex.org/W1555260403,"Abstract Adenylate kinase activity (ATP:AMP-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3) was studied in subcellular extracts of rat liver tissue. Essentially all of the activity, over 150 units per g of tissue, wet weight (1.7 units per mg of protein), was released into the cytosol when the tissue was homogenized in 0.025 m sucrose. Isotonic (0.25 m sucrose) homogenization and separation of subcellular fractions by both differential centrifugation and linear sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed 8 units per g (0.4 units per mg) in the nuclear fraction, 84 units per g (2 units per mg) in the heavy mitochondrial fraction, 22 units per g (0.6 unit per mg) in the light mitochondrial fraction, and 30 units per g (0.5 unit per mg) in the cytosol fraction. Rat liver adenylate kinase activity was separated into four electrophoretically distinct isozymes. Isozyme I, at 3 units per g of tissue, wet weight, was observed only in the nuclear fractions. Isozyme II was found in the cytosol at 19 units per g. Isozyme III, at 110 units per g, was the predominant adenylate kinase isozyme in the rat liver; it was localized in the outer compartment of the mitochondria. Since adenylate kinase III is easily released from mitochondria, mitochondrial damage can be observed by monitoring this isozyme. Also, because of this release, the true subcellular distribution of rat liver adenylate kinase activity is probably better represented by the corresponding values for each isozyme, not the values obtained by normal subcellular extraction procedures."

https://openalex.org/W1600218847,"Abstract Aldehyde dehydrogenase had previously been purified from autolyzed yeast and had been obtained in crystalline and ultracentrifugally homogeneous form. Further examination of the product by amino-terminal end group analysis revealed gross microheterogeneity which is ascribed to proteolysis. By avoiding autolysis and by using large concentrations of the esterase inhibitors, diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, the enzyme was isolated in a 10-fold greater yield and in a form in which serine was the amino-terminal end group. By proper choice of the inhibitor and its concentration, two proteolytically degraded forms of the enzyme can be isolated in a state of macrohomogeneity. The three enzyme species differ in specific activity but not in their gross kinetic parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1573598247,"Abstract The optically pure d and l isomers of 2-phospholactate were synthesized by phosphorylation of the appropriate lactic acids. The interactions of these analogues and of phosphoglycolate with several enzymes that catalyze reactions of phosphoenolpyruvate were examined by kinetics and by direct binding studies measuring the longitudinal relaxation rate of water protons. With pyruvate kinase, the Ki of d-phospholactate (21 µm) and of phosphoglycolate (52 µm) agree with the Km of phosphoenolpyruvate (26 µm), while the Ki of l-phospholactate (380 µm) is 18-fold greater. This difference in affinity is confirmed in the direct binding studies. The enhancement of the ternary pyruvate kinase-Mn-inhibitor complex of d-phospholactate (et = 1.9) and of phosphoglycolate (et = 1.7) agree with that of phosphoenolpyruvate (et = 2.2), but differs from that of l-phospholactate (et = 3.8), indicating a structural difference in this latter metal bridge complex. With enolase, the inhibition was not stereospecific since the Ki values of both isomers of phospholactate and of phosphoglycolate were equal (370 µm) and larger than the Km of 2-phosphoglycerate (6.7 µm). Equal affinities for the analogues were confirmed by direct binding studies, but unequal ternary enhancements were observed for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (et = 3.7), d-phospholactate (et = 11.6), phosphoglycolate (et = 8.4), and l-phospholactate (et = 5.8) because of structural differences in their respective ternary complexes. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which catalyzes a reaction with a mechanism homologous with that of pyruvate kinase, shows the opposite inhibition pattern since it is preferentially inhibited by l-phospholactate (Ki = 28 µm) as compared with d-phospholactate (Ki = 292 µm). None of the analogues inhibited the reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. The patterns of inhibition by the phospholactates of pyruvate kinase (d >> l), enolase (d = l), and carboxykinase (l >> d) are explained in terms of the known stereochemistries of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes and the structures at their respective active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1592368245,"Abstract Cranial bone (calvaria) from newborn rats, cultured in the presence of β-aminopropionitrile to prevent cross-linking of the collagen, were pulse-labeled with radioactive glycine at 37°. Collagen was extracted with cold 1 m NaCl and purified to yield native collagen. The α1 and α2 chains were chromatographically separated and cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the resulting peptides were separated and counted. For both the α1 and α2 chain, a plot of the relative specific activities of the cyanogen bromide peptides versus their positions in the chain showed a radioactive gradient, the gradient being steepest after the shortest pulse. The results indicate that the α chains of collagen, like other polypeptide chains, are synthesized as single chains by sequential amino acid addition from the amino-terminal end and not as short pieces which are later joined. From the data obtained it could be estimated that the average time required for completion of one α chain of about 1040 amino acids was approximately 4.8 min and was about equal for the two kinds of α chains. The synthesis time includes hydroxylation of proline and lysine and any other steps required to make a native collagen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1602073524,"Abstract The encephalitogenic basic protein of the myelin contains 168 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 18,200. Among these residues, there are 2 methionines and 1 tryptophan. In order to locate and identify the number of encephalitogenic determinants of this protein, chemical degradation of the methionine and modifications of the tryptophan by various specific reagents were carried out. Cleavage of the polypeptide chain at the methionyl residues was effected with cyanogen bromide. Three peptides were produced. Peptide C-1 (20 amino acid residues) was derived from the amino-terminal part of the protein, Peptide C-2 (143 residues) from the middle part, and Peptide C-3 (3 residues) from the carboxyl terminus. Only Peptide C-2 is active at the same level as the parent protein. These results are in agreement with our previous report that part of the amino-terminal segment of the protein can be removed without affecting the biological activity. The tryptophan residue was modified by the following reagents: 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, oxidation by performic acid, alkylation with 2-nitrophenylsulfenyl chloride, and formylation with formic acid saturated with HCl gas. The modified proteins, except the formylated one, were not encephalitogenic in guinea pigs. The animals did not show any neurological sign during the assay period of 30 days. The same compounds were tested with rabbits and the rabbits developed typical experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. It is concluded that there are at least two encephalitogenic determinants. One contains tryptophan, a residue essential for activity in guinea pigs, and the other is active in rabbits without the tryptophan residue. The results suggest that the encephalitogenic determinant is species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1573030930,"Abstract The fact that individual protein subunits must have different regions in contact with neighboring subunits in any oligomeric assembly greater than a dimer is considered in relation to the nature of subunit interactions. Binding equations for this model have been derived for various different tetrameric arrangements and compared with the equations given by other models. Methods of distinguishing between models on the basis of binding curves alone are discussed, including the relationships which each model requires between the association constants for successive molecules of ligand. It is found that certain features of a binding curve, such as its symmetry or asymmetry, and the degree of cooperativity between sites, can be used to discriminate between models. Data in the literature which appear to contradict simple models for ligand binding have been re-examined and found to be consistent with the general ligand-induced model for subunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1658129649,"Abstract Rat liver adenylate kinase III (ATP:AMP-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3) has been purified and characterized. The enzyme was purified 1500-fold to a final specific activity of 1000 µmoles of ADP produced per min per mg of protein at 25°. The preparation was homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis and at 10 mg per ml was essentially a single component by analytical ultracentrifugation. Molecular weight studies with Sephadex G-150 column chromatography revealed a Vo:Ve ratio of 1.94 which corresponded to a molecular weight of 46,000 for the enzyme. A range of Svedberg values as a function of protein concentration was obtained by ultracentrifugation and established the presence of two molecular weight forms of the enzyme; extrapolation to zero protein concentration indicated two S020, w values of 1.23 and 3.52. With the extrapolated value of the diffusion coefficient of 4.8 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 and the partial specific volume of 0.74 calculated from the amino acid analysis, molecular weights of 23,000 and 68,000, respectively, were obtained. Frictional and axial ratios were found to be 1.1 and 4.0, respectively. We propose that rat liver adenylate kinase III is a globular protein existing as monomer, dimer, or trimer in very rapid equilibrium. Amino acid analysis revealed a total of 216 amino acids with a calculated minimum molecular weight of 23,400. The protein was found to be high in glutamic acid, alanine, aspartic acid, and leucine residues; it was low in histidine, methionine, half-cystine, and phenylalanine residues. Initial velocity studies revealed a narrow specificity for adenine nucleotides. The respective Km values for ATP, dATP, and dGTP were 0.12, 0.77, and 1.77 mm with respective Vmax values of 16,000, 40,000, and 25,000 moles of triphosphate min-1 mole-1 of enzyme. The only monophosphate acceptor, with a Km of 0.12 mm was 5'-AMP. The Km for ADP was 0.18 mm with a Vmax of 10,700 moles of diphosphate min-1 mole-1 of enzyme. It would appear that rat liver adenylate kinase III slightly favors the forward reaction (conversion of ATP)."

https://openalex.org/W1531236809,"Abstract Hyaluronidase activity has been studied during hormone-dependent cell differentiation of the germinal epithelium in the rat testis. Hyaluronidase in rat testis is particulate and sediments with the lysosomal fraction, but can be released by treatment with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Rat testicular hyaluronidase activity is undetectable until 33 to 34 days of age, at which time it appears and subsequently increases 400-fold. This rapid increase is correlated with acrosome formation in the newly formed spermatids. Hypophysectomy completely prevents the formation of spermatids and of hyaluronidase, although prolonged treatment of the hypophysectomized rats with luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone or with testosterone permits spermatid formation and restores the specific activity of hyaluronidase to normal. Hyaluronidase activity thus appears to represent an accurate biochemical marker for the biological development of testis cells at a specific, hormone-dependent transition in spermatogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W3120504400,"The binding of phenylalanyl and other aminoacyl oligonucleotides, prepared by enzymic digestion of aminoacyl-tRNA, to ribosomes was characterized. Optimal binding of C-A-C-C-A(Phe) and C-A-A-C-C-A-(fMet) requires a free amino group; acetylation, formylation, or deacylation markedly reduces the binding of the aminoacyl oligonucleotide. Also required are a monovalent and divalent cation. Either K+ or NH4+ can satisfy the monovalent cation requirement, but Na+ or Li+ cannot. Mg++ best satisfies the divalent cation requirement, but Mn++ and Ca++ are also effective; Zn++, Co++, spermidine, and putrescine are not. Binding of Phe-, Val-, Leu-, and Met-oligonucleotides to ribosomes is stimulated by ethanol; however, C-C-A(Ser) binding is not. The results indicate that binding of the aminoacyl terminus of aminoacyl-tRNA is useful in studying a distinct step in peptide bond formation and protein synthesis, and that the ribosomal site binding these aminoacyl oligonucleotides has the ability to discriminate between acylated and deacylated tRNA termini as well as between blocked and unblocked aminoacyl-tRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1566074904,"Abstract Pyruvate carboxylase purified from bakers' yeast was analyzed for its content of 11 metal ions. After removal of extraneous metal ions, only zinc (3.1 g atoms per mole (600,000 g) of enzyme) and iron (1.2 g atoms per mole of enzyme) were present in significant concentration, as compared with the biotin content (3.3 moles per mole). The equimolar ratio between zinc and biotin content was confirmed for four preparations of the purified enzyme. Correlation of catalytic activity, zinc, and 3H-biotin contents was demonstrated in fractions obtained by chromatography of pyruvate carboxylase from yeast on Sagarose 8F and by gel filtration of this enzyme on Sephadex G-200. No such correlation was observed between enzymic activity and iron content in the fractions obtained by gel filtration. Zinc was tightly bound to pyruvate carboxylase from yeast but was partially removed by gel filtration at 23° in the presence of 10 mm 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate. The loss of the bound zinc under these conditions was associated with an equivalent decrease in catalytic activity. Pyruvate carboxylase purified from yeast grown in the presence of 2 mm CoCl2 contained approximately equal amounts of bound cobalt and zinc in a combined stoichiometry equivalent to the biotin content. The bound cobalt was removed on gel filtration in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and a concomitant decrease in specific activity was observed under these conditions. The data presented indicate that pyruvate carboxylase from bakers' yeast contains zinc as its bound metal and suggest an essential role for this bound metal ion in the catalysis of CO2 fixation on pyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1606747142,"Abstract Transcarboxylase (E.C.2.1.3.1), a high molecular weight biotin enzyme, dissociates in a complex fashion to inactive subunits. The rate of dissociation is increased by increasing pH and temperature and decreased by increasing concentration of protein and polyvalent anions. The active species exhibits two sedimenting forms of s20,w ∼ 16 and ∼18 S when sedimented at speeds of 50,000 rpm or above. At the same speeds, the subunits formed show s20,w values of ∼12 S and ∼6S. Dissociation in the presence of 20% glycerol is slower and leads to subunits of similar sedimentation coefficients but they behave differently on reassociation. When dissociation occurs at pH 10 a species of s20,w ∼5 S and a smaller component are formed. Small components also arise in urea, dodecyl sulfate or after succinylation. Transcarboxylase which has been inactivated by dissociation can be reassociated with concomitant reactivation. Three methods have been successful: (a) adjustment to pH 5 with acetate buffer, (b) addition of a high concentration of phosphate buffer, and (c) transfer to dilute phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The latter method has succeeded only with subunits formed in the presence of glycerol and leads to an active species with approximately the same sedimentation coefficient as the native enzyme. Reassociation by any of the methods, with subunits formed in the absence of glycerol leads to an active species of s20,w ∼ 25 S. A 1.3 S biotin-carboxyl carrier subunit is formed during the dissociation but it is not observed in the Schlieren patterns of dissociated enzyme because of its low concentration. By use of transcarboxylase labeled with tritiated biotin and by sucrose density gradient separation of subunits it has been shown that the reassociation does involve the use of the 1.3 S biotin-carboxyl carrier subunit. In addition to inactivation by dissociation, transcarboxylase undergoes a second type of inactivation which occurs when the purified enzyme is stored at -20°. No changes in the sedimentation coefficient or distribution of sedimenting species occur during this type of inactivation. This partially inactive enzyme is reactivated by incubation with 1.5 µ of (NH4)2SO4 at 25°. The enzyme appears to be pressure sensitive. Although it exhibits two forms, ∼16 and ∼18 S, when sedimented at 50,000 rpm, at speeds of 30,000 or 40,000 rpm only one species is observed of s20,w ∼17 S."
https://openalex.org/W1528614971,"Abstract Feeding a low fat, biotin-deficient diet to young rats for 1 to 2 weeks leads to a decrease in acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase levels in epididymal adipose tissue with accumulation of the apoenzyme. These changes occur prior to changes in hepatic propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase levels. Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase levels in liver decrease minimally with biotin deficiency, and little apoenzyme accumulates. The presence of apoenzyme in adipose tissue of deficient rats was initially suggested by the rapid rise in acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase activity which occurred within minutes of biotin injection. Further evidence for the presence of apoenzyme in deficient adipose tissue came from equivalence point determinations with the use of an antibody against acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. These experiments indicated that adipose tissue from deficient rats contains immunologically reactive but catalytically inactive protein which is presumably acetyl coenzyme A apocarboxylase. Biotin-deficient and control rats were injected with 3H-biotin, and subsequently acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was isolated from liver and adipose tissue by immunological precipitation. There was increased 3H-biotin incorporation into deficient adipose tissue enzyme compared with control adipose tissue enzyme but only minimally increased incorporation into liver enzyme, again demonstrating the marked difference in the metabolism of the enzyme in these tissues. The conversion of acetyl coenzyme A apocarboxylase to holoenzyme was demonstrated in vitro with the use of a 105,000 x g supernatant fraction from adipose tissue of deficient animals."
https://openalex.org/W1650033039,"Abstract The α-d-apio-d-furanosyl 1-phosphate and α-d-apio-l-furanosyl 1-phosphate esters of d-apiose have been prepared from a mixture of the β-d-apiose tetraacetates in 20% yield. The β isomers of d-apiose tetraacetate were prepared from a dry syrup of the chromatographically pure sugar in almost quantitative yield. The tetraacetates of the two different ring forms were separated by paper and thin layer chromatography, and they were characterized by gas chromatography and analysis of their nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. Reaction of the d-apiose tetraacetates with crystalline phosphoric acid resulted in the formation of four isomers of d-apiose monophosphate. The two monophosphate isomers described above and their 1,2-cyclic phosphodiester derivatives were separated by chromatography on Dowex 1-C1 columns. The products were further purified by paper chromatography in several solvent systems. Analytical data indicated the monophosphate esters were pure. The only sugar released on acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of these compounds was indistinguishable from d-apiose on paper chromatography with a wide range of solvent systems. Procedures for evaluating the stereochemical homogeneity of the d-apiose phosphate esters were developed. The configuration and position of the phosphate group was established by periodate oxidation and analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. A colorimetric method for the quantitative determination of small amounts of d-apiose and microprocedures for studying the rate of phosphorylation of fully acetylated d-apiose-14C by crystalline phosphoric acid were also developed during the course of this study. The sugar phosphate esters were utilized to identify intermediates involved in the synthesis of the branched chain sugar which is present as a cell wall polysaccharide in Lemna minor and as a flavone glycoside in parsley."
https://openalex.org/W1575814900,"Abstract Yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase and each of two of its active proteolytic digestion products are readily dissociable into subunits which can, in turn, reassociate. The native protein dissociates into four subunits of equal size. The partially digested enzymes dissociate into the same subunit plus a second, smaller subunit. The data are interpreted in terms of a tetrameric native enzyme, differing from its tetrameric degradation products, of which four are known, in the number of intact and functional subunits. Dissociation and reassociation of one of the hybrid forms resulted in the formation principally of a catalytically active aldehyde dehydrogenase, indistinguishable from the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1601114888,"Investigation of the occurrence in hen oviduct of highly acidic nucleotides other than the known sulfated sugar nucleotide, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate, revealed the presence of four other sugar nucleotides, each bearing 1 or 2 sulfate residues. They are: (a) UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6-disulfate, the same compound that was previously synthesized from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate in the presence of a sulfotransferase preparation from hen oviduct; (b) UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate-6-phosphate, i.e. a UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine derivative bearing a sulfate and a phosphate residue at position 4 and position 6, respectively, on the N-acetylgalactosamine moiety; (c) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphogalactose-sulfate, i.e a derivative of the known disaccharide-carrying nucleotide, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphogalactose, bearing a sulfate residue on the galactose moiety; and (d) UDP-galactose-sulfate, i.e. a UDP-galactose derivative bearing also a sulfate residue on the galactose moiety. The diversity of sulfated sugar nucleotides suggests the existence of a common plan of sugar-nucleotide sulfation, with which the tissue makes striking changes in the biological activities or metabolic fates conferred on the sugar nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1523753595,"Abstract The reaction of rabbit muscle phosphoglucose isomerase with iodoacetamide was studied at both pH 5.8 and 8.55 by monitoring loss of enzymatic activity and the rate of modification of affected amino acid residues. The inactivation process was found to be of apparent first order with respect to both enzyme and iodoacetamide, at least until 90% of the original activity was lost. The inactivation was accompanied by carboxamidomethylation of histidine, cysteine, and methionine at both pH 5.8 and 8.55 and of lysine at pH 8.55 only. Substrate or the competitive inhibitor 6-phosphogluconate protected against inactivation and alkylation at either pH. At pH 5.8, 6-phosphogluconate completely prevented loss of enzymatic activity, as well as alkylation of any histidine, whereas at pH 8.55, substrate was found to afford better protection than the straight chain competitive inhibitor. The data are in agreement with the previously proposed mechanism involving the sequential action of both a lysine and a histidine residue in phosphoglucose isomerase catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1557473750,"Abstract A sulfotransferase system that catalyzed the sulfation of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine in the presence of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate was obtained in a particulate form from the isthmus of hen oviduct. The product of sulfation was identified as UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate, the same compound that accumulates in the isthmus region during egg formation. Several attempts were made to solubilize the enzyme system following some of the procedures which were successful in solubilizing sulfotransferases for mucopolysaccharide sulfation. No indication was obtained, however, that the enzyme system which produces UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate could be solubilized. Results from examination for substrate specificity and from kinetic studies indicated that the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate is the principal function of this enzyme system. This was also supported by the finding that the enzyme system tends to be much lower in content in the adjacent magnum region (synonym: albumin-secreting region) where UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate does not accumulate in more than trace amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1575013478,"Abstract Dissociation of transcarboxylase at pH 9.0 and low ionic strength results in subunits with s20,w values of ∼6 S, ∼5 S, and 1.3 S. The 1.3 S subunit, designated as the biotin-carboxyl carrier protein, contains all the biotin initially present in the enzyme. Acid treatment (pH 5) of these unresolved subunits brings about reincorporation of the 1.3 S subunit into a reconstituted ∼6 S biotin subunit which has been isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Dissociation in the presence of 20% glycerol at pH 8 and low ionic strength yields a ∼12 S subunit and a ∼6 S subunit to which the 1.3 S biotin-carboxyl carrier protein remains attached. The ∼12 S subunit and the native ∼6 S biotin subunit have been separated by density gradient centrifugation. Active enzyme has been formed from a combination of the ∼12 S subunit with either the native ∼6 S biotin subunit or the reconstituted ∼6 S biotin subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2295484893,"Abstract Biotin d-sulfoxide can be utilized as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur for growth of a pseudomonad. The following series indicates the relative rates of uptake of 14C-biotin and the 14C-analogues by 0.9% NaCl solution-washed cells, which were grown in a medium containing biotin d-sulfoxide: biotin sulfone g biotin l-sulfoxide g biotin d-sulfoxide g biotin g dethiobiotin. Bacteria grown on a salts-trace element medium containing 0.3% 14C-carbonyl-labeled biotin d-sulfoxide have an extended initial period of slow growth as compared to that on a medium containing 14C-biotin. Biotin is slowly produced in the d-sulfoxide culture, and the concentration of biotin reaches a maximum of approximately 5 to 7% of the total remaining substrate during the log phase of growth. Several metabolites have been isolated from culture filtrates of the pseudomonad grown for 9 days on a medium containing 14C-carbonyl-labeled d-sulfoxide. Purification of the following metabolites has been achieved by anion exchange chromatography over Dowex 1-X2: biotin; bisnorbiotin; tetranorbiotin; biotin l-sulfoxide; biotin sulfone; and a new catabolite, bisnorbiotin sulfone. The results are consistent with the conclusion that reduction of d-sulfoxide to the thioether precedes utilization of the sulfur atom. Thus, the major pathway for the degradation of biotin d-sulfoxide appears to be through biotin."

The failure to detect an inhibitor in urine from patients with sexual precocity due to pinealoma suggested that the pineal was the source of the urinary gonadotrophin inhibitor1. On the other hand, the presence of a gonadotrophin inhibitor in the pineal or in urine has been doubted3,4 or the effects of the latter have been ascribed to the toxicity of the extracts used5. The gonadotrophin inhibitory properties of pineal extracts clearly warrant further investigation and I report here the effects of a pineal extract on gonadotrophin responses in the mouse uterus assay."
