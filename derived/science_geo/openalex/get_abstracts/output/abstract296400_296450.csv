https://openalex.org/W2136412446,"The submarine hydrothermal activity on and near the Galápagos Rift has been explored with the aid of the deep submersible Alvin. Analyses of water samples from hydrothermal vents reveal that hydrothermal activity provides significant or dominant sources and sinks for several components of seawater; studies of conductive and convective heat transfer suggest that two-thirds of the heat lost from new oceanic lithosphere at the Galápagos Rift in the first million years may be vented from thermal springs, predominantly along the axial ridge within the rift valley. The vent areas are populated by animal communities. They appear to utilize chemosynthesis by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria to derive their entire energy supply from reactions between the seawater and the rocks at high temperatures, rather than photosynthesis."

Photographs of the lasing droplets in the micrometer size range taken in a single 10-nanosecond laser pulse clearly show the dynamic changes in droplet size, shape, and orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1986014568,"Six common species of lake algae were found to ingest bacteria. The ingestion rates measured were of the same magnitude as those recorded for marine microflagellates totally dependent on external sources of carbon. A large biomass of Dinobryon species removed more bacteria from the water column of a lake than crustaceans, rotifers, and ciliates combined."
https://openalex.org/W2088717901,"Molybdenum disulfide has been prepared in an unusual poorly crystalline form, termed the ""rag"" structure, consisting of several stacked but highly folded and disordered S-Mo-S layers. This previously unknown structure demonstrates the flexible and macromolecular nature of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides. The determination of this structure provides a basis for understanding its highly broadened x-ray diffraction pattern and relatively low surface area, and is a starting point for optimizing the catalytic and surface properties of molybdenum disulfide."
https://openalex.org/W1983871626,"Individuals of the grass-feeding caterpillar of Pseudaletia unipuncta, reared from hatching on hard grass, had head masses twice as great as those of caterpillars fed soft artificial diet, even though the larvae reached the same body mass. Larvae reared on soft wheat seedlings had intermediate head masses. Thus muscular effort increases muscular development in an insect, which in turn has a dramatic morphogenetic effect on head size. Size differences in the head capsules, with the correlated differences in mandibular power, have a direct effect on the ability of the insects to ingest hard foods rapidly: larger heads are adaptive for dealing with hard grasses."
https://openalex.org/W2043598284,"Noninvasive photochemical and physiological experiments with intact butterflies of 17 species showed that nine species have a rhodopsin absorbing maximally at 610 nanometers, contained in retinular cells that are maximally sensitive at 610 nanometers. This is the longest-wavelength visual pigment known for an invertebrate. Eight species of butterflies lack the 610-nanometers rhodopsin. All species possess a rhodopsin absorbing maximally in the green region of the spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2029073329,"A G(2|)factor in the cotyledons of Pisum sativum, which arrests the growth of cells in both roots and shoots in the G(2) stage of the cell cycle, has been isolated and identified as trigonelline (N-methylnicotinic acid). To our knowledge, trigonelline is the first hormone that effects cell arrest in complex tissues of plants and animals to be chemically identified."
https://openalex.org/W2031735107,The mesopelagic shrimp Sergestes similis emits ventrally directed bioluminescence that closely matches the intensity of downward-directed illumination and is able to rapidly modify its light output to match changes in background intensity. Masking experiments show that the photoreceptors involved are the compound eyes or adjacent tissues. Light emission originates from modified portions of the hepatopancreas and is similar to oceanic light in angular distribution and spectral characteristics. Normally oriented animals respond minimally to upward-directed light.

https://openalex.org/W2068796919,"Important applications to oceanography, hydrology, and agriculture have been developed from operational satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and are currently expanding rapidly. Areas of interest involving the oceans include sea surface temperature, ocean currents, and ocean color. Satellites can monitor various hydrological phenomena, including regional and global snow cover, river and sea ice extent, and areas of global inundation. Agriculturally important quantities derived from operational satellite observations include precipitation, daily temperature extremes, canopy temperatures, insolation, and snow cover. This overview describes the current status of each area."
https://openalex.org/W1965598213,"Pyroclastic eruption and the intrusion of batholiths associated with large-volume ash-flow tuffs may be driven by a decrease in reservoir pressure caused by the low density of the magma column due to vesiculation. Batholithic intrusion would then be accomplished by the subsidence and settling of kilometer-sized crustal blocks through the magma chamber, resulting in eventual collapse to form large caldera structures at the surface. Such a model does not require the formation of a large, laterally extensive, shallow magma chamber before the onset of large-volume ash-flow eruptions. Eruption could commence directly from a deeper reservoir, with only a small channelway being opened to the surface before the onset of catastrophic ash-flow eruptions of the scale of Yellowstone or Long Valley. Such a model has wide-ranging implications, and explains many of the problems inherent in the simple collapse model involving shallow magma chambers as well as the process and timing of batholith intrusion in such cases."
https://openalex.org/W2037208926,"The first weather satellite was launched on 1 April 1960. In the 25 years since, weather satellites have contributed to improved weather analyses and forecasts worldwide. As a maturing component of a global observing system, the meteorological satellite promises even greater financial benefits and a higher quality of life to mankind."
https://openalex.org/W2019969047,"The gamma and delta rings have by far the largest radial perturbations of any of the nine known Uranian rings. These two rings deviate from Keplerian orbits, having typical root-mean-square residuals of about 3 kilometers (compared to a few hundred meters for the other seven known rings). Possible causes for the perturbations include nearby shepherd satellites and Lindblad resonances. If shepherd satellites are responsible, they could be as large as several tens of kilometers in diameter. The perturbation patterns of the gamma and delta rings have been examined for evidence of Lindblad resonances of azimuthal wave number m = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The beta ring radial residuals are well matched by a 2:1 Lindblad resonance. If this represents a real physical phenomenon and is not an artifact of undersampling, then the most plausible interpretation is that there is an undiscovered satellite orbiting 76,522 +/- 8 kilometers from Uranus, with an orbital period of 15.3595 +/- 0.0001 hours and a radius of 75 to 100 kilometers. Such a satellite would be easily detected by the Voyager spacecraft when it encounters Uranus. The 2:1 resonance location is 41 +/- 9 kilometers inside the delta ring, which makes it unlikely that the resonance is due to a viscous instability within the ring. In contrast, no low-order Lindblad resonance matches the gamma ring perturbations, which are probably caused by one or more shepherd satellites large enough to be clearly visible in Voyager images."
https://openalex.org/W2104457783,"A new problem in technology policy-a discipline hitherto largely concerned with the modern industrial sector-is posed by the need for technology suited to creating productive jobs and providing minimum public services at a cost and level of sophistication within the reach of poor people in developing countries. Careful consideration must be given to overall and sectoral development objectives, economic and manpower resources, and the local institutional and sociocultural context. This may indicate the need for both hardware innovation, such as low-cost alternatives to waterborne sewerage, and social (""software"") innovation, such as training large numbers of supervisors to implement improved technologies for labor-intensive civil works."
