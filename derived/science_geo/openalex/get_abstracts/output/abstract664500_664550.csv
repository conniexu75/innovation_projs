https://openalex.org/W3108193091,"Recent studies have reported the protective efficacy of both natural1 and vaccine-induced2–7 immunity against challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in rhesus macaques. However, the importance of humoral and cellular immunity for protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Here we show that the adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) protects naive recipient macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent macaques partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2, which suggests a role for cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titres. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titres are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titres are required for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. These findings have implications for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immune-based therapeutic agents. Adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects naive macaques against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cellular immune responses contribute to protection against rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3098697637,"Global dispersal and increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant D614G are suggestive of a selective advantage but may also be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection. Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with higher viral load and younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth and size of 614G phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of this variant."
https://openalex.org/W3105908160,"COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute lung damage associated with patient mortality. While multiple inflammatory cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that only the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induced inflammatory cell death characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. Mechanistically, TNF-α and IFN-γ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-α and IFN-γ caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-α and IFN-γ protected mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases by limiting tissue damage/inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3101403202,"SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercytokinemia and inflammation are critically associated with COVID-19 severity. Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced inflammation, decreased lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Importantly, baricitinib-treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of lung macrophage production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3107242996,"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) refers to the use of small molecules to induce ubiquitin-dependent degradation of proteins. TPD is of interest in drug development, as it can address previously inaccessible targets. However, degrader discovery and optimization remains an inefficient process due to a lack of understanding of the relative importance of the key molecular events required to induce target degradation. Here, we use chemo-proteomics to annotate the degradable kinome. Our expansive dataset provides chemical leads for ∼200 kinases and demonstrates that the current practice of starting from the highest potency binder is an ineffective method for discovering active compounds. We develop multitargeted degraders to answer fundamental questions about the ubiquitin proteasome system, uncovering that kinase degradation is p97 dependent. This work will not only fuel kinase degrader discovery, but also provides a blueprint for evaluating targeted degradation across entire gene families to accelerate understanding of TPD beyond the kinome."
https://openalex.org/W3109709532,"The human intestinal stem cell niche supports self-renewal and epithelial function, but little is known about its development. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing with in situ validation approaches to interrogate human intestinal development from 7-21 weeks post conception, assigning molecular identities and spatial locations to cells and factors that comprise the niche. Smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosa, in close proximity to proliferative crypts, are a source of WNT and RSPONDIN ligands, whereas EGF is expressed far from crypts in the villus epithelium. Instead, an PDGFRAHI/F3HI/DLL1HI mesenchymal population lines the crypt-villus axis and is the source of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family member NEUREGULIN1 (NRG1). In developing intestine enteroid cultures, NRG1, but not EGF, permitted increased cellular diversity via differentiation of secretory lineages. This work highlights the complexities of intestinal EGF/ERBB signaling and delineates key niche cells and signals of the developing intestine."

These studies reveal the basic organization of area postrema nausea circuitry and provide a framework toward understanding and therapeutically controlling nausea. Nausea is a sickness-associated sensation that has remained almost completely uncharted at a molecular and cellular level. Nausea is frequently associated with vomiting, a forceful evacuation of gastrointestinal contents, and also conditions-learned aversion of associated stimuli to avoid future sickness bouts. Many stimuli evoke nausea and/or vomiting, including pathogens, toxins, drug therapies, pregnancy, and motion sickness (Andrews, 1992Andrews P.L. Physiology of nausea and vomiting.Br. J. Anaesth. 1992; 69: 2S-19SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hornby, 2001Hornby P.J. Central neurocircuitry associated with emesis.Am. J.

Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 15: 301-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Sickness responses to toxin ingestion and infection are evolutionarily beneficial survival behaviors; however, the sensation of nausea can also be maladaptive, as many treatments for cancer, diabetes, and other illnesses induce nausea as a major adverse side effect. Current anti-nausea medications display highly variable success across patient populations, with nausea being a principal reason why cancer patients are unable to adhere to particular treatment regimens (Hesketh, 2008Hesketh P.J. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Understanding the diversity of molecular and cellular pathways capable of evoking nausea should allow for more effective nausea intervention. Sensory pathways leading to nausea have remained enigmatic, with several neuronal routes of transmission to the brain possible, including through vagal afferents, area postrema neurons, the vestibular system, and potentially other cell types. The area postrema is a circumventricular organ implicated in nausea and vomiting responses to at least some visceral stimuli (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Miller and Leslie, 1994Miller A.D.

The area postrema: a brain monitor and integrator of systemic autonomic state.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Electrical stimulation of the area postrema evokes nausea and emesis, and lesions of the area postrema eliminate nausea-related responses to particular intravenous toxins but not to motion sickness (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Ritter et al., 1980Ritter S. McGlone J.J. Kelley K.W. Absence of lithium-induced taste aversion after area postrema lesion.Brain Res. 1980; 201: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mice and other rodents are incapable of vomiting, but some stimuli that evoke nausea and vomiting in humans engage the rodent area postrema and cause robust behavioral aversion to co-presented sensory cues (Andrews, 1992Andrews P.L. Physiology of nausea and vomiting.Br. J. Anaesth. 1992; 69: 2S-19SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional functions for the area postrema in feeding, metabolism, cardiovascular regulation, and body fluid/cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis have been proposed (Price et al., 2008Price C.J. Hoyda T.D. Ferguson A.V. The area postrema: a brain monitor and integrator of systemic autonomic state.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), with some physiological responses possibly secondary to nausea (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The area postrema is notably difficult to study, as coarse area postrema lesion or electrical stimulation can potentially impact fibers of passage such as vagal terminals or adjacent brain regions such as the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), both of which control many basic autonomic functions (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains debated whether the area postrema is devoted to processing emetic stimuli or instead contains diverse cell types involved in distinct physiological functions. Located at the floor of the fourth ventricle in the brainstem, the area postrema occupies a privileged anatomical location outside the blood-brain barrier (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Miller and Leslie, 1994Miller A.D.

The area postrema: a brain monitor and integrator of systemic autonomic state.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Resident area postrema neurons are uniquely poised to detect blood-borne cues, projecting neurites to the large perivascular spaces of locally fenestrated capillaries. The area postrema is classically considered a brain-resident sensory structure involved in interoception, as it is a key detection site for circulating hydrophilic chemicals that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Several peptides produced peripherally, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), amylin, and growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), directly stimulate cohorts of area postrema neurons (Barth et al., 2004Barth S.W. Riediger T. Lutz T.A. Rechkemmer G.

Amylin and GLP-1 target different populations of area postrema neurons that are both modulated by nutrient stimuli.Physiol. Behav. 2013; 112-113: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The area postrema also receives second-order inputs from at least some vagal sensory neurons, and top-down inputs from other brain nuclei (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Miller and Leslie, 1994Miller A.D. Leslie R.A. The area postrema and vomiting.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 15: 301-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and many neurotransmitters activate area postrema neurons (Carpenter et al., 1988Carpenter D.O. Briggs D.B. Knox A.P. Strominger N. Excitation of area postrema neurons by transmitters, peptides, and cyclic nucleotides.J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 59: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar; Ferguson and Bains, 1996Ferguson A.V. Bains J.S. Electrophysiology of the circumventricular organs.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1996; 17: 440-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These various stimuli can engage divergent cell-surface receptors and intracellular signaling pathways involving different second messengers. A systematic analysis of hormone and neurotransmitter receptors present across area postrema neuron types is lacking, as are mechanistic insights into the roles of various area postrema receptors in nausea-associated behaviors. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate area postrema cell diversity, finding that it contains only a few neuron types. Genetic approaches for cell-selective activation, ablation, cAMP imaging, gene knockout, and gene rescue revealed a specific area postrema neuron type that mediates behavioral responses to multiple nausea-inducing stimuli. This cell type expresses a rich assortment of cell-surface receptors, and nausea-associated responses to receptor agonists could be predicted and effectively silenced through area postrema-targeted manipulations. We investigated cellular diversity in the area postrema using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sNuc-seq) (Habib et al., 2016Habib N. Li Y. Heidenreich M. Swiech L. Avraham-Davidi I. Trombetta J.J. Hession C. Zhang F. Regev A. Div-Seq: Single-nucleus RNA-Seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons.Science. 2016; 353: 925-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The area postrema resides outside the blood-brain barrier (Figures 1A and S1A) and was acutely harvested using anatomical landmarks to minimize incorporation of adjacent NTS regions (Figure S1B). Nuclei were purified from homogenized tissue on an iodixanol gradient and isolated in nanoliter sized droplets using an inDrop platform for lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of nuclear RNA. Amplified cDNA was sequenced, and transcriptome data were obtained for 3,678 area postrema cells. Single-cell transcriptome data from area postrema neurons are publicly available (Geo accession number GSE160938). Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 1,848 neurons, 1,299 tanycytes, and smaller numbers of other cell types (Figures S1C and S1D). Focused analysis of neuron-derived transcriptomes revealed 10 neuronal clusters ranging in size from 75 to 353 neurons (Figure S1E). Six neuronal cell types (clusters 1–4, 8–9) were glutamatergic excitatory neurons together containing 986 neurons, while four cell types (clusters 5–7,10) were GABAergic inhibitory neurons together containing 862 neurons. Signature genes were identified that marked each cluster (Figure 1B; Table S1), and mRNA in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar) were analyzed for caudal brainstem expression (Figure S1F). Some signature genes showed expression in both the area postrema and neighboring NTS; at least one signature gene from seven clusters (1–7) was expressed only in the area postrema and not NTS, while three clusters (8–10) contained signature genes expressed in the medial NTS instead of area postrema and are presumably adjacent NTS cell types included in the dissection. We conclude that the area postrema contains four principal excitatory neuron types (clusters 1–4) and three principal inhibitory neuron types (clusters 5–7) (Figure 1C). Different area postrema neuron types express various cell-surface receptors (Figure 1D). GLP1 receptor (Glp1r) is expressed in three groups of excitatory neurons (clusters 2–4), with each cluster also showing enriched expression of genes encoding the noradrenaline transporter (NET), also known as SLC6A2 (cluster 2), angiotensin 2 receptor (cluster 3), or GDF15 receptor GFRAL (cluster 4). A separate group of excitatory neurons (cluster 1) does not express Glp1r but instead expresses genes encoding the amylin receptor (CALCR), olfactory receptor 78, and tachykinin receptor 3. We also observed expression of several genes encoding norepinephrine biosynthesis enzymes, including Th, Ddc, and Dbh in cluster 2 neurons, but noted sparser expression of the vesicular transporter gene Slc18a2 (Figure S1G). Area postrema inhibitory neurons also differentially express many cell-surface receptor genes, including those encoding ghrelin receptor (cluster 5), gastric inhibitory peptide receptor (cluster 6), and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (clusters 7/6), as well as Gpr83 and Tmem215 (Figure S1G). GLP1R-expressing excitatory area postrema neurons express many other genes encoding cell-surface receptors whose roles in area postrema neurons are unknown, including the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), prolactin-releasing peptide receptor, GPR88, TRPM3, and TMEM35a. Thus, discrete classes of excitatory and inhibitory area postrema neurons express different repertoires of cell-surface receptor genes. We obtained Cre knockin mice to gain genetic access to subtypes of area postrema excitatory neurons (Figure 1E). We previously generated Glp1r-ires-Cre mice (Williams et al., 2016Williams E.K. Chang R.B. Strochlic D.E. Umans B.D. Lowell B.B. Liberles S.D. Sensory Neurons that Detect Stretch and Nutrients in the Digestive System.Cell. 2016; 166: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), obtained Calcr-ires-Cre mice (Pan et al., 2018Pan W. Adams J.M. Allison M.B. Patterson C. Flak J.N. Jones J. Strohbehn G. Trevaskis J. Rhodes C.J. Olson D.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Essential Role for Hypothalamic Calcitonin Receptor‒Expressing Neurons in the Control of Food Intake by Leptin.Endocrinology. 2018; 159: 1860-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and now generated Gfral-p2a-Cre and Slc6a2-p2a-Cre mice. Two-color expression analysis revealed that most receptor-expressing cells produced Cre-dependent reporters (Figure S2); as is common for Cre lines, some receptor-negative reporter-positive cells were also observed, presumably due to receptor expression that was transient or too low for detection by RNA in situ hybridization. The area postrema mediates illness responses to certain manifestations of visceral malaise. Here, we used chemogenetic approaches to activate small neuronal clusters within the area postrema and ask whether they condition avoidance to presented flavor cues. Area postrema GLP1R neurons were of particular interest, as GLP1R agonists control insulin release, blood glucose levels, and feeding behavior and are a clinical mainstay for diabetes treatment (Baggio and Drucker, 2007Baggio L.L. Drucker D.J. Biology of incretins: GLP-1 and GIP.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2131-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). However, GLP1R agonists also induce nausea as a side effect, and it is unclear whether appetite suppression and nausea involve overlapping neural pathways. Glp1r is expressed in neurons of the area postrema, NTS, hypothalamus, and vagus nerve, and a role for area postrema Glp1r in nausea and/or satiety is unknown (Adams et al., 2018Adams J.M. Pei H.

USA. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Indeed, when area postrema neurons from Glp1r-ires-Cre; Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato and Calcr-ires-Cre; Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato mice were transfected with the genetically encoded fluorescent cAMP sensor cADDis (Tewson et al., 2016Tewson P.H. Martinka S. Shaner N.C. Hughes T.E. Quinn A.M. New DAG and cAMP Sensors Optimized for Live-Cell Assays in Automated Laboratories.J. Biomol. Screen. 2016; 21: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), cAMP responses were observed to the GLP1R agonist exendin-4 in 38% (88/231) of all neurons, 90% (26/29) of GLP1R neurons, and 12% (4/34) of CALCR neurons (Figures 2A and 2B ). Conversely, pramlintide responses were observed in 19% (29/151) of all neurons, 14% (3/21) of GLP1R neurons, and 50% (12/24) of CALCR neurons (Figure 2C). The amylin co-receptor RAMP3 is enriched in area postrema relative to NTS (Figure S1F), so some non-responsive CALCR neurons may be RAMP3-negative NTS neurons included in the analysis. These findings provide further evidence that GLP1R and CALCR area postrema neurons are largely segregated populations. Moreover, activation of these receptors in area postrema neurons boosts cAMP production, justifying use of Gαs-coupled chemogenetic tools. The areas postrema of Glp1r-ires-Cre, Calcr-ires-Cre, Gfral-p2a-Cre, and Slc6a2-p2a-Cre mice were injected with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) containing Cre-dependent genes encoding either a Gαs-coupled DREADD-mCherry fusion protein (AAV-Flex-Gαs-DREADD) or tdTomato (AAV-Flex-tdTomato) (Figure 3A). AAV injections preferentially labeled area postrema neurons, with modest labeling of nearby NTS neurons (Figure S3A) and exclusion of other potential expression sites including vagal ganglia (Figure S3B). cAMP imaging of area postrema neurons from Glp1r-ires-Cre mice injected with AAV-Flex-Gαs-DREADD revealed CNO-evoked cAMP transients in mCherry-positive neurons (67%, 8/12) but not mCherry-negative neurons (0%, 0/42) (Figure S3C). Furthermore, intraperitoneal CNO injection in mice expressing Gαs-coupled DREADDs in area postrema GLP1R or CALCR neurons evoked Fos expression in mCherry-labeled neurons (Figure S3D). Chemogenetic activation of various neuron subtypes was then elicited during a behavioral paradigm to measure conditioned flavor avoidance (Figure 3B). Water-restricted mice were given access to water containing saccharin and a fruit-flavored odor and then immediately injected with CNO. Half the conditioning trials involved cherry-flavored solution, and half involved grape-flavored solution, with mice displaying equal preference for both flavors in the absence of malaise induction (Figure S3E). Two days later, mice were tested in a two-choice preference assay comparing ingestion of cherry and grape solutions, and a preference index calculated as the time drinking the conditioned flavor divided by total time drinking. Control mice lacking DREADD expression (injected with AAV-Flex-tdTomato) across genotypes showed either no preference or a modest preference for the conditioned flavor (Figure 3C). In contrast, CNO-induced activation of DREADD-expressing GLP1R neurons, GFRAL neurons, or SLC6A2 neurons but not CALCR neurons, during the training session caused later avoidance of the conditioned flavor in the test session (Figure 3C). We note that chemogenetic experiments involving Gαq-coupled DREADDs in area postrema GLP1R neurons were similarly effective at conditioning flavor avoidance (Figure S3F) without increasing cAMP levels (Figure S3C), indicating that elevating multiple second messengers in AP neurons, including cAMP or calcium, can trigger behavioral responses. Together, these findings uncover functional specialization among area postrema neurons, as at least two excitatory neuron subtypes (clusters 2 and 4) provide a negative valence-teaching signal, while one subtype (cluster 1) does not. In addition to causing behavioral avoidance, nausea is correlated with autonomic responses, so we measured physiological changes in response to optogenetic stimulation of area postrema neurons. Glp1r-ires-Cre mice were injected in the area postrema with an AAV encoding Channelrhodopsin (AAV-Flex-ChR2) or YFP (AAV-Flex-Yfp, control), and reporter expression was confirmed (Figure S4A). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of dissociated ChR2-positive area postrema neurons revealed light-evoked currents (Figure S4B), and in vivo light stimulation evoked Fos expression in ChR2-positive area postrema neurons (Figure S4C). Optogenetic activation of area postrema GLP1R neurons in anesthetized mice increased heart rate and blood pressure, had no effect on respiration, and evoked a complex change in gastric pressure that included increased tonic pressure and decreased phasic pressure (Figure S4D). Furthermore, optogenetic activation of a smaller neuronal group marked in Slc6a2-p2a-Cre mice produced similarly complex physiological responses (Figure S4E). The area postrema is known to influence autonomic physiology (Price et al., 2008Price C.J. Hoyda T.D. Ferguson A.V. The area postrema: a brain monitor and integrator of systemic autonomic state.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but whether such effects are secondary to nausea are debated (Borison, 1989Borison H.L. Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongata.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 351-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These data show that a small group of aversion-promoting area postrema neurons evokes a coordinated response that includes not only behavioral but also cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects. Area postrema GLP1R neurons condition flavor avoidance, so we asked whether they were required for behavioral responses to viscerally introduced toxins. We used a genetic approach involving diphtheria toxin (DT) to ablate Cre-expressing area postrema neurons. Mouse cells are normally resistant to DT but can be rendered susceptible by expression of the human DT receptor (DTR) from a Cre-dependent allele (Rosa26-LSL-DTR) (Buch et al., 2005Buch T. Heppner F.L. Tertilt C. Heinen T.J. Kremer M. Wunderlich F.T. Jung S. Waisman A. A Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor mediates cell lineage ablation after toxin administration.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We expressed DTR in various area postrema neurons by crossing Rosa26-LSL-DTR mice to Glp1r-ires-Cre, Gfral-p2a-Cre, and Slc6a2-p2a-Cre mice and then injected DT locally in the area postrema to eliminate Cre-expressing cells. Resulting mice were termed Glp1r-ABLATEAP, Gfral-ABLATEAP, and Slc6a2-ABLATEAP mice, respectively. We did not further investigate roles for area postrema CALCR neurons, since they did not condition aversion responses in chemogenetic experiments, and since multiple toxins evoked area postrema Fos responses in CALCR-negative neurons but not CALCR-positive neurons (Figure S5A). DT immunohistochemistry in Glp1r-ABLATEAP mice revealed highly efficient and targeted cell ablation within the area postrema, as well as some cell loss in neighboring NTS regions, while other GLP1R neurons in the brain and vagal ganglia remained intact (Figure 4A). Next, we tested various toxins for their ability to condition flavor aversion in Glp1r-ABLATEAP mice (Figure 4B). Robust flavor avoidance was imposed by exendin-4, lithium chloride, lipopolysaccharide, or cisplatin in control Cre-negative Rosa26-LSL-DTR mice injected with DT (non-ABLATE mice). However, Glp1r-ABLATEAP mice failed to display flavor avoidance conditioned to exendin-4, lithium chloride, and lipopolysaccharide, while responses to cisplatin remained intact. We note that exendin-4 still decreased food intake in Glp1r-ABLATEAP mice (Figure S5B), suggesting that at least partially distinct neural circuits mediate GLP1R-evoked appetite suppression and nausea. To determine whether toxin responses were mediated by particular GLP1R neuron subtypes, similar experiments were performed in Slc6a2-ABLATEAP and Gfral-ABLATEAP mice (Figures 4, S5C, and S5D). Exendin-4 responses persisted following ablation of either SLC6A2 or GFRAL neurons, presumably because exendin-4 engages both cell types, either of which can condition aversion. In contrast, ablation of area postrema GFRAL neurons abolished lithium chloride- and lipopolysaccharide-conditioned aversion, so area postrema cell cluster 4 is required for behavioral responses to different malaise-inducing stimuli. We next obtained mouse lines for Cre-dependent Glp1r knockout (Glp1r-KNOCKOUTCre) and Cre-dependent Glp1r rescue in the knockout background (Glp1r-RESCUECre) (Sisley et al., 2014Sisley S. Gutierrez-Aguilar R. Scott M. D’Alessio D.A. Sandoval D.A. Seeley R.J. Neuronal GLP1R mediates liraglutide’s anorectic but not glucose-lowering effect.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 2456-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We injected AAV-Cre into the area postrema of Glp1r-KNOCKOUTCre and Glp1r-RESCUECre mice to generate Glp1r-KNOCKOUTAP and Glp1r-RESCUEAP mice, respectively. Control experiments involved AAV-mCherry injection to generate No-KNOCKOUT and No-RESCUE mice. RNA in situ hybridization for Glp1r mRNA revealed targeted elimination of Glp1r expression in Glp1r-KNOCKOUTAP mice and targeted restoration of Glp1r expression in Glp1r-RESCUEAP mice (Figures 5A and S5E). Furthermore, peripheral exendin-4 induced area postrema Fos responses in No-KNOCKOUT and Glp1r-RESCUEAP mice but not in No-RESCUE or Glp1r-KNOCKOUTAP mice (Figure S5F). Control No-KNOCKOUT mice avoided flavors paired with exendin-4 injection, while No-RESCUE mice did not. Area postrema-directed alterations in Glp1r expression reversed this behavior (Figure 5B) as Glp1r-RESCUEAP mice displayed exendin-4-evoked flavor avoidance while Glp1r-KNOCKOUTAP mice did not. Since low amounts of AAV-Cre could alter gene expression in vagal"

Increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are linked to proliferation and lineage specification. In contrast to this general principle, we here show that in the hippocampus of adult mice, quiescent neural precursor cells (NPCs) maintain the highest ROS levels (hiROS). Classifying NPCs on the basis of cellular ROS content identified distinct functional states. Shifts in ROS content primed cells for a subsequent state transition, with lower ROS content marking proliferative activity and differentiation. Physical activity, a physiological activator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, recruited hiROS NPCs into proliferation via a transient Nox2-dependent ROS surge. In the absence of Nox2, baseline neurogenesis was unaffected, but the activity-induced increase in proliferation disappeared. These results provide a metabolic classification of NPC functional states and describe a mechanism linking the modulation of cellular ROS by behavioral cues to the activation of adult NPCs."

Additionally, we studied their surface area and pore size distribution, and found a greater enhancement of the morphological structure of the thermally treated rice husk compared with that chemically treated. Thermally treated adsorbents presented a higher surface area (24–201 m 2 .g -1 ) than those chemically treated (3.2 m 2 .g -1 ). The thermal and chemical modifications of rice husk resulted in phenol removal efficiencies of 36%–64% and 28%, respectively. Thus, we recommend using thermally treated rice husk as a promising adsorbent for phenol removal from aqueous solutions."

Constitutive reduction of glycogen synthase-1 (GYS1) activity prevents murine LD, but the effect of GYS1 reduction later in disease course is unknown. Our goal was to knock out Gys1 in laforin (Epm2a)-deficient LD mice after disease onset to determine whether LD can be halted in midcourse, or even reversed. We generated Epm2a-deficient LD mice with tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated Gys1 knockout. Tamoxifen was administered at 4 months and disease progression assessed at 12 months. We verified successful knockout at mRNA and protein levels using droplet digital PCR and Western blots. Glycogen determination and periodic acid–Schiff–diastase staining were used to analyze glycogen and LB accumulation. Immunohistochemistry using astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and microglial (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) markers was performed to investigate neuroinflammation. In the disease-relevant organ, the brain, Gys1 mRNA levels were reduced by 85% and GYS1 protein depleted. Glycogen accumulation was halted at the 4-month level, while LB formation and neuroinflammation were significantly, though incompletely, prevented. Skeletal muscle analysis confirmed that Gys1 knockout inhibits glycogen and LB accumulation. However, tamoxifen-independent Cre recombination precluded determination of disease halting or reversal in this tissue. Our study shows that Gys1 knockdown is a powerful means to prevent LD progression, but this approach did not reduce brain glycogen or LBs to levels below those at the time of intervention.

LD is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in either EPM2A or NHLRC1 (also known as EPM2B), encoding laforin, a glucan phosphatase, and malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively (3Minassian B.A. Lee J.R.

In pursuit of a therapy for this intractable disease, one approach that emerged was to reduce glycogen synthase-1 (GYS1) activity, thereby interfering with chain elongation during glycogen synthesis, in order to prevent glycogen accumulation and LB formation. This approach proved successful with knockout of Gys1 or Ppp1r3c, encoding a protein (also known as PTG) involved in GYS1 activation. Both gene knockouts prevented LB formation, neurodegeneration, and other features of the disease in LD mice (16Turnbull J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Zhao X. Cortez M.A. Pencea N. Tiberia E. Piliguian M.

These results established proof of principle that targeting Gys1 for downregulation could be a promising therapeutic approach in LD. However, the mice in these studies had constitutively reduced GYS1. This left the question open as to how successful therapeutic targeting of Gys1 could be when LBs are already present, i.e., after disease onset and diagnosis. We generated laforin-deficient (Epm2a−/−) mice with tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Gys1 knockout. We administered TAM at 4 months, after murine disease onset, and assessed subsequent disease progression at 12 months. We analyzed glycogen content, LB accumulation, and neuroinflammation to determine whether LD progression can be halted in midcourse, or even potentially reversed. We generated conditional Gys1 knockout mice to test whether genetic pharmacotherapy targeting Gys1 following disease onset would lead to a halt or even reversal of LD progression. We used mice carrying a Gys1-targeting cassette with loxP sites flanking exons 6 to 8 together with TAM-inducible Cre to generate conditional Gys1-knockout mice in wild-type (WT) and Epm2a−/− backgrounds (Fig. 1A). A subset of mice was harvested at 4 months, while the majority of mice were either TAM-treated or not treated and then aged until 12 months (Fig. 1B). Figure 1C gives an overview of all experimental mice, not only explaining their genotype and treatments but also introducing the names of each group used throughout the study. In addition to the WT and Epm2a−/− control (WT, LKO) and Gys1 knockout (WT-KO, LKO-KO) mice, we included LKO-L mice at 4 and 12 months. These LKO-L mice carried floxed Gys1 and expressed Cre but were not TAM-treated. They served to evaluate whether TAM-independent Cre-mediated recombination (referred to as “Cre leakage”) occurred. At 12 months, WT-KO mice exhibited GYS1 protein knockdown in the brain and muscle (Fig. 1D), which clearly indicated that Cre-mediated Gys1 recombination and knockout was successful. To assess the effect of TAM treatment in the brain of conditional Gys1-knockout mice (WT-KO, LKO-KO) and potential Cre-leakage mice (LKO-L), we determined the frequency of recombination events by quantifying Gys1 mRNA that still contained exons 6 to 8. Levels of intact Gys1 mRNA were decreased by approximately 85% in both WT-KO and LKO-KO mice, while LKO-L mice showed no reduction and hence no Cre leakage at 4 or 12 months (Fig. 2A, Fig. S1A). Like WT-KO mice (Fig. 1D), LKO-KO mice exhibited strong knockdown of GYS1 protein levels, while no decrease in GYS1 was detected in LKO-L compared with LKO mice (Fig. 2B). We then asked whether hallmarks of LD such as glycogen and LB accumulation in the brain were halted at the 4-month level, the time point of knockout induction, or perhaps even reversed. Glycogen determination confirmed an age-dependent increase in glycogen accumulation in LKO and LKO-L mice compared with WT in accordance with disease progression (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1B). There was a slight though not statistically significant trend toward less glycogen accumulation in LKO-L mice than in LKO control mice. Therefore, we directly compared LKO-KO mice with LKO-L mice in order to draw valid conclusions about disease halting or reversal. Doing so, we found clear stoppage in disease progression evidenced by LKO-L mice at 4 months having a very similar glycogen content as LKO-KO mice at 12 months (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1B). In WT-KO mice, glycogen levels were depleted, showing that Gys1 expression was sufficiently reduced to almost completely prevent synthesis of normal soluble glycogen. A similar reduction in soluble glycogen is to be expected in LKO-KO mice, and therefore, it can be concluded that the glycogen detected in these mice is mainly insoluble glycogen. Hippocampal LB quantification showed a small though significant amount of corpora amylacea–like (CAL) bodies (normal age-related astrocytic glucan inclusions (20Sinadinos C. Valles-Ortega J.

CAL body formation was prevented by Gys1 knockout in WT-KO mice. LB accumulation was also significantly reduced in LKO-KO mice compared with LKO and LKO-L mice at 12 months, though slightly increased compared with LKO and LKO-L mice at 4 months. Therefore, Gys1 knockout at 4 months did not completely halt but significantly slowed LB formation in the hippocampus. In LD mice, the density of LBs is highest in the hippocampus, a structure whose pathologies commonly underlie epileptogenesis (22Chatzikonstantinou A. Epilepsy and the hippocampus.Front. Neurol. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in order to show a more complete picture regarding the LB load in the whole brain, we also quantified LBs in two additional large brain regions, cerebellum and cortex (Fig. S2, A–B). The results are very similar to what we saw in the hippocampus with the exception that in the cerebellum, a complete halt, versus only slowing of LB accumulation, could be achieved in LKO-KO mice. Representative periodic acid–Schiff–diastase (PASD) images are shown for LB visualization in Figure 2E and Fig. S2C. Another hallmark of LD is glia-derived neuroinflammation (23Lahuerta M. Gonzalez D. Aguado C. Fathinajafabadi A. Garcia-Gimenez J.L. Moreno-Estelles M. Roma-Mateo C. Knecht E. Pallardo F.V. Sanz P. Reactive glia-derived neuroinflammation: a novel hallmark in Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy that progresses with age.Mol. Neurobiol. 2020; 57: 1607-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By performing immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium–binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1), we, respectively, assessed whether astrogliosis and/or microgliosis can be halted or reversed by targeting Gys1. In the hippocampus, WT and WT-KO mice did not exhibit any significant differences irrespective of Gys1 genotype or age (Fig. 3, Fig. S3). LKO and LKO-L mice showed minimal (GFAP) or no (IBA1) neuroinflammation compared with WT mice at 4 months but significantly increased GFAP and IBA1 signals by 12 months, confirming increased hippocampal neuroinflammation with LD progression. Twelve-month-old LKO-KO mice showed partial rescue with GFAP and IBA1 signal levels between 4-month-old and 12-month-old LKO and LKO-L mice levels. GFAP and IBA1 signals were also quantified in the cerebellum (Fig. S4). However, astrogliosis was not significantly increased in LKO or LKO-L mice at 12 months, while microgliosis was significantly increased but not rescued in LKO-KO mice. In the cerebellum, LD-associated neuroinflammation was not as pronounced as in the hippocampus and consequently the timeframe to determine a halt in progression of neuroinflammation was too short to observe significant rescue in LKO-KO mice. While LD manifests as a neurological disease, LBs additionally accumulate in murine and patient skeletal muscle. We therefore analyzed the muscle to further assess the effect of Gys1 knockout on glycogen and LB accumulation post disease onset. Like in the brain, we determined the extent of recombination events by quantifying the reduction of Gys1 mRNA with exons 6 to 8 still present (Fig. 4A, Fig. S5A). Surprisingly, Gys1 mRNA levels were already approximately 90% reduced in LKO-L mice at 4 months, indicating major Cre leakage in the muscle, which was not the case in the brain (Fig. 2A). At 12 months, Gys1 mRNA levels were further reduced by 3.5-fold in LKO-KO and by approximately 2-fold in LKO-L mice, culminating in 97% and 94% knockdown, respectively, while LKO control mice remained unaffected. GYS1 protein levels in LKO-KO mice were as reduced as in WT-KO mice at 12 months (Fig. 1E, Fig. 4B). However, we detected a comparable depletion of GYS1 levels in LKO-L mice at 12 months. Even at 4 months, GYS1 levels were already reduced in LKO-L mice, confirming Cre leakage at the protein level in addition to that seen at the mRNA level. Further analyses focused on the effect of TAM-induced and TAM-independent Gys1 knockout on skeletal muscle total and insoluble glycogen content. For the latter, we used a recently established method that utilizes endogenously expressed metabolic enzymes to digest accessible soluble glycogen completely, leaving only the insoluble glycogen, which is not degradable (24Nitschke S. Petkovic S. Ahonen S. Minassian B.A. Nitschke F. Sensitive quantification of α-glucans in mouse tissues, cell cultures, and human cerebrospinal fluid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.015061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This method allowed us to determine whether changes in total glycogen content were mostly due to changes in soluble glycogen, insoluble glycogen, or both. LKO mice showed an increase in total and insoluble glycogen at 12 months, while the amount of insoluble glycogen was only approximately 3% of the total glycogen at 4 months (Fig. 4, C–D, Fig. S5, B–C). These results are in line with the extensive LB accumulation in LKO mice at 12 months as well as the comparatively small LB load at 4 months, with a substantial number of PASD-positive cells but very small bodies (Fig. 4, E–F). Already at 4 months, LKO-L mice exhibited 50% reduced levels of total glycogen and an almost complete depletion of insoluble glycogen, indicating that not only was disease progression attenuated but also levels of soluble glycogen were significantly reduced. Accordingly, fewer cells were PASD-positive with less/smaller LBs. The extent of LB formation in 12-month-old LKO-KO mice looked very similar to 4-month-old LKO-L mice, in accordance with the comparable insoluble glycogen content. However, in the LKO-KO mice, even the soluble glycogen was reduced further, as total glycogen was reduced by approximately 95% compared with 4-month-old LKO mice. We detected an approximately 2-fold higher amount of total and insoluble glycogen in LKO-L mice at 12 months than in LKO-KO mice. The slightly higher amount, though not statistically significant, is in line with the PASD results that show a few cells with relatively many LBs, which are probably cells where Cre leakage did not occur or only affected one of the two alleles. Taken together, our results show that Gys1 knockout prevented the LD muscle phenotype; however, significant Cre leakage occluded assessment of disease reversal in this organ. Hallmarks of LD are glycogen accumulation and formation of LBs, which are insoluble, glycogen-like particles, characterized by reduced branching and long chains (25Nitschke F. Sullivan M.A. Wang P. Zhao X. Chown E.E. Perri A.M. Israelian L. Juana-Lopez L. Bovolenta P. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Steup M. Minassian B.A. Abnormal glycogen chain length pattern, not hyperphosphorylation, is critical in Lafora disease.EMBO Mol. Med. 2017; 9: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, reducing glycogen synthesis is an attractive avenue toward a therapy for the disease. From studying LD mouse models, we already know that reducing glycogen synthesis either by Gys1 knockout or indirectly by knockout of PTG prevents LB formation, neurodegeneration, and other features of the disease such as impaired autophagy (16Turnbull J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Zhao X. Cortez M.A. Pencea N. Tiberia E. Piliguian M. Roach P.J. Wang P. Ackerley C.A.

Potential strategies to target brain glycogen synthesis are multiple, including antisense oligonucleotides, other forms of RNA interference, genome editing, and small-molecule inhibitors (8Nitschke F. Ahonen S.J. Nitschke S. Mitra S. Minassian B.A. Lafora disease - from pathogenesis to treatment strategies.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14: 606-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Targeting glycogen synthesis as a therapy for LD has the advantage of applicability to patients with mutations in either EPM2A or NHLRC1, as opposed to gene replacement therapies, which would require separate development for each subgroup. A second major advantage is that downregulating a function is comparatively more practicable at the present time than replacing a missing function across the entire brain. Conventional knockout mouse models showed that it is possible to prevent LB formation and other disease-associated features when the capability to synthesize glycogen is blocked with the animal still in utero. Here, we asked the clinically more relevant question, namely, what would the effect of the intervention be after disease onset. We generated a conditional Gys1-knockout mouse, using TAM-induced Cre-mediated recombination, which enabled us to downregulate glycogen synthesis in laforin-deficient mice at 4 months when the LD neuropathological phenotype is already clearly detectable. We studied the hallmarks of LD, glycogen accumulation, LB formation, and consequent neuroinflammation. Interestingly, total brain glycogen in LKO-KO at 12 months was significantly lower than in LKO control mice at 4 months. Although we hoped to see a reversal, our results rather show a halt in disease progression for the following two reasons. Firstly, we expect the amount of soluble glycogen in LKO-KO mice to be reduced as strongly as in WT-KO mice, where the overall glycogen content was reduced by approximately 90%, because Gys1 mRNA and protein levels suggest a similar extent of Cre recombination in WT-KO and LKO-KO mice. This indicates that we detected mostly insoluble glycogen in the Gys1-knockout mice (LKO-KO). Secondly, we need to take into consideration that the amount of total glycogen in 4-month-old LKO control mice is a combination of soluble and insoluble glycogen. In order to estimate the amount of insoluble (LB) glycogen at 4 months, we can subtract the amount of WT glycogen from the amount in LKO mice because we have shown that the amount of soluble glycogen is not altered in LD mice, at least in the muscle (26Sullivan M.A. Nitschke S. Skwara E.P. Wang P. Zhao X. Pan X.S. Chown E.E. Wang T. Perri A.M. Lee J.P.Y. Vilaplana F. Minassian B.A. Nitschke F.

This estimate gives approximately the same glycogen quantity as we see in LKO-KO mice at 12 months, further corroborating our conclusion of a halt in disease progression. Strikingly, although still present, the halt in disease progression was not as complete when we look at the LB quantification results in the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, however, we observed a complete halt in LB formation which is more in line with our findings on total glycogen level, measured in whole brain samples. It could be that Cre recombination was slightly less efficient in the hippocampus than in other parts of the brain such as the cerebellum. The Gys1 mRNA and protein levels are an average over the whole brain and do not reveal any potential disparities in recombination efficiency in different brain regions. An alternative explanation for differences seen in different parts of the brain could be cell type–specific differences in Cre recombination, being, for instance, less efficient in astrocytes than in other cell types (e.g., neurons or other glial cells). It has been shown that a great number of LBs in LD mice are found in astrocytes (21Augé E. Pelegrí C. Manich G. Cabezón I. Guinovart J.J. Duran J. Vilaplana J.

Genet. 2018; 27: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that the ratio between astrocytic and neuronal LBs can be different in different brain regions (21Augé E. Pelegrí C. Manich G. Cabezón I. Guinovart J.J. Duran J. Vilaplana J. Astrocytes and neurons produce distinct types of polyglucosan bodies in Lafora disease.Glia. 2018; 66: 2094-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assuming this ratio is different in the hippocampus and cerebellum, cell type–specific differences in Cre recombination could explain the different extent of rescue seen in these two brain regions. Furthermore, glycogen metabolism in astrocytes is very different from glycogen metabolism in neurons (28Saez I. Duran J. Sinadinos C. Beltran A. Yanes O. Tevy M.F. Martinez-Pons C. Milan M.

Such sites may hold an incredible “dark fungal diversity” which is still underestimated. We explored the culturable fungal richness in the air, on bats, and in the guano in a bat cave in Brazil’s Caatinga dry forest. Fungal abundance was 683 colony-forming units (CFU) in the guano, 673 CFU in the air, and 105 CFU on the bats. Based on morphological and phylogenetic analysis of ITS, LSU, and TUB2 sequences, fungal isolates of 59 taxa belonging to 37 genera in the phyla Ascomycota (28 genera, including Aspergillus , Penicillium , Cladosporium , and Talaromyces ), Basidiomycota (eight genera, including Rhodotorula and Schizophyllum ), and Mucoromycota (only Rhizopus ) were identified. The fungal richness in the air was 23 taxa (especially Aspergillus taxa), mainly found at 15 m and 45 m from the cave entrance; on the bodies of bats it was 36 taxa (mainly Aspergillus taxa), especially on their wing membranes (21 taxa, nine of which were exclusively found in this microhabitat); and in guano 10 fungal taxa (especially Aspergillus and Penicillium ) were found. The fungal richness associated with guano (fresh and non-fresh) was similar from bats with different eating habits (insectivorous, frugivorous, and haematophagous). Sampling effort was not sufficient to reveal the total fungal taxa richness estimated. Eight (21.6%) of the 37 genera and 17 (53.1%) of the 32 identified fungal species are reported for the first time in caves. Our results highlight bat caves in Brazil as hotspots of fungal diversity, emphasizing the need to protect such special roosts."

UBQLN2 is a ubiquitin receptor of the UBL/UBA family that binds the proteasome through its ubiquitin-like domain and is thought to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to proteasomes for degradation. UBQLN2 mutations result in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia in humans through an unknown mechanism. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics was used to provide for the first time an unbiased and global analysis of the role of Ubqln2 in controlling the composition of the proteome. We studied several murine models of Ubqln2-linked ALS and also generated Ubqln2 null mutant mice. We identified impacts of Ubqln2 on diverse physiological pathways, most notably serotonergic signaling. Interestingly, we observed an upregulation of proteasome subunits, suggesting a compensatory response to diminished proteasome output. Among the specific proteins whose abundance is linked to UBQLN2 function, the strongest hits were the ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 and two retroelement-derived proteins, PEG10 and CXX1B. Cycloheximide chase studies using induced human neurons and HEK293 cells suggested that PEG10 and TRIM32 are direct clients. Although UBQLN2 directs the degradation of multiple proteins via the proteasome, it surprisingly conferred strong protection from degradation on the Gag-like protein CXX1B, which is expressed from the same family of retroelement genes as PEG10. In summary, this study charts the proteomic landscape of ALS-related Ubqln2 mutants and identifies candidate client proteins that are altered in vivo in disease models and whose degradation is promoted by UBQLN2.

Although these reports implicate different potential functions of UBQLNs, some of their apparent functional diversity may be due to the multiplicity of Ubqln isoforms. There are six UBQLN genes expressed in humans: UBQLN1, which is expressed throughout the body; UBQLN2, which is enriched in neuronal tissues and muscle; UBQLN 3, 5, and L, which are expressed only in testes; and UBQLN4, which is induced in many cell types upon nutrient limitation (35Marin I.

Thus, perturbation of UBQLN2 function may promote neurodegeneration by compromising the proteasomal degradation of proteins known to cause ALS, such as TDP-43. Alternatively, Ubqln2 mutations may lead to neurodegeneration through the dysregulation of unrelated, unknown proteins, through a general attenuation of protein quality control, or through an inherent toxicity that is unrelated to the normal function of UBQLN2 in protein degradation.

https://openalex.org/W3110114822,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection caused by novel coronavirus 2019. Many individuals suffered psychological symptoms in the early stage when the epidemic was uncertain. We explored the perceived psychological stress and associated factors in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic. Method The Perceived Stress Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Social Support Rating Scale and a general information questionnaire were integrated in an on-line survey conducted from February 1, 2020 until February 4, 2020. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore whether coping style, social support or other factors contributed to psychological stress. Results A total of 1638 participants were included, of whom 44.3% showed moderate psychological stress. Individuals who were younger, female, unmarried, spent more time on the disease, felt more concern about it, reported lower social support (Subjective Social support; Objective social support; Utilization social support), or showed a negative coping style were more likely to suffer higher psychological stress in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusion Psychological interventions may be targeted to individuals with the risk characteristics identified in this study. It may be helpful to promote social support and positive coping style in the early stage of infectious disease epidemics. This initial evidence from the general Chinese population may be relevant to interventions in other countries for dealing with the COVID-19 and other epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W3106763010,"Multiplexed bead-based assays that use Luminex® xMAP® technology have become popular for measuring antibodies against proteins of interest in many fields, including malaria and more recently SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. There are currently two formats that are widely used: non-magnetic beads or magnetic beads. Data are lacking regarding the comparability of results obtained using these two types of beads, and for assays run on different instruments. Whilst non-magnetic beads can only be run on flow-based instruments (such as the Luminex® 100/200™ or Bio-Plex® 200), magnetic beads can be run on both these and the newer MAGPIX® instruments. In this study we utilized a panel of purified recombinant Plasmodium vivax proteins and samples from malaria-endemic areas to measure P. vivax-specific IgG responses using different combinations of beads and instruments. We directly compared: i) non-magnetic versus magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200, ii) magnetic beads run on the Bio-Plex® 200 versus MAGPIX® and iii) non-magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200 versus magnetic beads run on the MAGPIX®. We also performed an external comparison of our optimized assay. We observed that IgG antibody responses, measured against our panel of P. vivax proteins, were moderately-strongly correlated in all three of our comparisons (pearson r>0.5 for 18/19 proteins), however higher amounts of protein were required for coupling to magnetic beads. Our external comparison indicated that results generated in different laboratories using the same coupled beads are also highly comparable (pearson r>0.7), particularly if a reference standard curve is used."

A primary weapon for reducing or eliminating this disease involves physical distancing to thwart transmission. Efforts to keep the economy moving include enacting physical distancing strategies that will increase the safety of workplaces, schools, businesses, etc. Given that education is a critical economic sector that impacts essentially all other sectors in some way, this paper details a planning approach for classroom physical distancing supported by spatial optimization. Devising a configuration of desks and/or workspaces that are physically distant is a type of dispersion problem that can be formalized mathematically and solved.

https://openalex.org/W3110070961,"We studied the habitat selection of pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana ) during seasonal migration; an important period in an animal’s annual cycle associated with broad-scale movements. We further decompose our understanding of migration habitat itself as the product of both broad- and fine-scale behavioral decisions and take a multi-scale approach to assess pronghorn spring and fall migration across the transboundary Northern Sagebrush Steppe region. We used a hierarchical habitat selection framework to assess a suite of natural and anthropogenic features that have been shown to influence selection patterns of pronghorn at both broad (migratory neighborhood) and fine (migratory pathway) scales. We then combined single-scale predictions into a scale-integrated step selection function (ISSF) map to assess its effectiveness in predicting migration route habitat. During spring, pronghorn selected for native grasslands, areas of high forage productivity (NDVI), and avoided human activity (i.e., roads and oil and natural gas wells). During fall, pronghorn selected for native grasslands, larger streams and rivers, and avoided roads. We detected avoidance of paved roads, unpaved roads, and wells at broad spatial scales, but no response to these features at fine scales. In other words, migratory pronghorn responded more strongly to anthropogenic features when selecting a broad neighborhood through which to migrate than when selecting individual steps along their migratory pathway. Our results demonstrate that scales of migratory route selection are hierarchically nested within each other from broader (second-order) to finer scales (third-order). In addition, we found other variables during particular migratory periods (i.e., native grasslands in spring) were selected for across scales indicating their importance for pronghorn. The mapping of ungulate migration habitat is a topic of high conservation relevance. In some applications, corridors are mapped according to telemetry location data from a sample of animals, with the assumption that the sample adequately represents habitat for the entire population. Our use of multi-scale modelling to predict resource selection during migration shows promise and may offer another relevant alternative for use in future conservation planning and land management decisions where telemetry-based sampling is unavailable or incomplete."

Design Markov multistate survival analysis and flexible parametric models. Setting Participants were recruited from the Norwegian Registry of Persons Assessed for Cognitive Symptoms (NorCog) in specialist healthcare between 2008 and 2017 and followed until August 2019, a maximum of 10.6 years follow-up time (mean 4.4 years, SD 2.2). Participants’ address histories, emigration and vital status were retrieved from the National Population Registry from time of diagnosis and linked to NorCog clinical data. Participants 2,938 home-dwelling persons with dementia, ages 40–97 years at time of diagnosis (mean 76.1, SD 8.5). Results During follow-up, 992 persons (34%) were admitted to nursing-homes (NHs) and 1,556 (53%) died. Approximately four years after diagnosis, the probability of living in a NH peaked at 19%; thereafter, the probability decreased due to mortality. Median elapsed time from dementia diagnosis to NH admission among those admitted to NHs was 2.28 years (IQR 2.32). The probability of NH admission was greater for women than men due to women´s lower mortality rate. Persons living alone, particularly men, had a higher probability of NH admission than cohabitants. Age, dementia aetiology and severity of cognitive impairment at time of diagnosis did not influence the probability of NH admission. Those with fewer than 10 years of education had a lower probability of NH admission than those with 10 years or more, and this was independent of the excess mortality in the less-educated group. Conclusion Four years after diagnosis, half of the participants still lived at home, while NH residency peaked at 19%. Those with fewer than 10 years of education were less often admitted to NH."
https://openalex.org/W3109856194,"One of the most fundamental questions in team creativity research is the relationship between individual member creativity and team creativity. The two answers that team creativity research has advanced–teams are more creative when their average member creativity is higher (the additive model) and teams are more creative when their most creative member is more creative (the disjunctive model) are straightforward. Surprising, however, is that neither the additive model nor the disjunctive model is consistently supported, begging the question of what moderates the predictive power of these models. We address this question by integrating individual-to-team creativity models with team process research. We propose that team information elaboration is a key moderating variable, such that average member creativity is more positively related to team creativity with higher information elaboration, and the highest member creativity is more positively related to team creativity with lower information elaboration. A multi-source study of 60 sales teams (483 employees) in a Chinese bakery chain supported these hypotheses. In addition, the study did not support the prediction that the most creative member’s outgoing advice ties (as a conduit for the dissemination of ideas) would further moderate the joint effect of the highest individual creativity and team information elaboration on team creativity."
https://openalex.org/W3110210769,"Transmembrane (TM) signaling is a key process of membrane-bound sensor kinases. The C4-dicarboxylate (fumarate) responsive sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli is anchored by TM helices TM1 and TM2 in the membrane. Signal transmission across the membrane relies on the piston-type movement of the periplasmic part of TM2. To define the role of TM2 in TM signaling, we use oxidative Cys cross-linking to demonstrate that TM2 extends over the full distance of the membrane and forms a stable TM homodimer in both the inactive and fumarate-activated state of DcuS. An S186xxxGxxxG194 motif is required for the stability and function of the TM2 homodimer. The TM2 helix further extends on the periplasmic side into the α6-helix of the sensory PASP domain and on the cytoplasmic side into the α1-helix of PASC. PASC has to transmit the signal to the C-terminal kinase domain. A helical linker on the cytoplasmic side connecting TM2 with PASC contains an LxxxLxxxL sequence. The dimeric state of the linker was relieved during fumarate activation of DcuS, indicating structural rearrangements in the linker. Thus, DcuS contains a long α-helical structure reaching from the sensory PASP (α6) domain across the membrane to α1(PASC). Taken together, the results suggest piston-type TM signaling by the TM2 homodimer from PASP across the full TM region, whereas the fumarate-destabilized linker dimer converts the signal on the cytoplasmic side for PASC and kinase regulation.

The fumarate, or C4-dicarboxylate (C4DC), sensor kinase DcuS of the DcuS–DcuR two-component system consists of a PASP (Per-ARNT-SIM) sensor domain, a TM domain composed of the antiparallel transmembrane helices TM1 and TM2, and a cytoplasmic PASC and the kinase domain (22Zientz E.

The sensory PASP domain is framed by TM1 and TM2 and adopts periplasmic location.

Unden G. Transmembrane signaling in the sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli: a long-range piston-type displacement of transmembrane helix 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 11042-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TM signaling by sensor kinases is, however, complex and can change in different segments of the TM region or combine different modes of conformational changes (31Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Melnikov I. Polovinkin V. Yuzhakova A. Gordeliy V. Sensor histidine kinase NarQ activates via helical rotation, diagonal scissoring, and eventually piston-like shifts.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 3110Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast, TM1 of DcuS exhibits no piston movement and revealed no contribution to TM signaling (18Monzel C. Unden G. Transmembrane signaling in the sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli: a long-range piston-type displacement of transmembrane helix 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 11042-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test for piston-type movement or indications for additional modes of TM signaling upon fumarate activation of DcuS, we studied the α-helical arrangement and dimerization of TM2 for the full-length and for the adjacent cytoplasmic region by Cys scanning and oxidative cross-linking (CL). This should define the extension of the α-helix from the periplasmic side across the membrane and its connection to the cytoplasmic PASC domain, with an emphasis on structural properties that could be relevant for the signal transfer across the membrane. Cysteine scanning and oxidative CL were applied as major methods to study TM2 interactions, as well as structural alterations due to receptor activation by fumarate. All studies were performed in bacteria containing DctA, which is a functional determinant of DcuS function (25Witan J. Bauer J. Wittig I. Steinmetz P.A. Erker W. Unden G.

The role of TM2 and the adjacent cytoplasmic region in DcuS homodimerization was analyzed in aerobically grown Escherichia coli cells, i.e., in the native context with DctA, by Cys CL using membrane-permeant copper(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3, or “Cu2+ phenanthroline,” as an oxidant (18Monzel C.

Here, we studied the involvement of every single residue of the complete TM2 helix in DcuS dimerization up to residue Glu213 (Fig. 1), which is located on the cytoplasmic side in the N terminus of the α1-helix in PASC (9Etzkorn M.

Each amino acid was individually replaced genetically by a Cys residue in the plasmid-encoded Cys-less variant DcuSCys0. In DcuSCys0, the natural Cys199 and Cys471 are replaced by Ser, which only moderately decreases fumarate stimulation of DcuS (18Monzel C. Unden G. Transmembrane signaling in the sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli: a long-range piston-type displacement of transmembrane helix 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Cys variants retained all 87%–118% of DcuSCys0 activity in dcuB-lacZ expression and induced dcuB-lacZ in a fumarate-dependent manner as the wild-type (Fig. 2). However, there was a striking drop in dcuB-lacZ expression in a coherent stretch of seven amino acids (F189–L195).Figure 2Effect of DcuS cysteine substitutions in the TM2-PASC linker region on dcuB-lacZ expression. Expression of dcuB and effect of the substitutions were tested in the dcuS negative strain IMW260 (DcuS–) complemented with plasmid (pMW336)-encoded Cys-less DcuS (DcuSCys0) and derivatives of DcuS with single Cys substitutions. Growth was performed under anaerobic conditions in eM9 medium with glycerol plus 20 mM DMSO with or without 20 mM disodium fumarate. All activities were normalized to the wild-type control of DcuS in the fumarate-activated state. Variants 172–188 and 196–213 have been tested earlier (18Monzel C. Unden G. Transmembrane signaling in the sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli: a long-range piston-type displacement of transmembrane helix 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reaction of the antiserum with DcuS and the cross-link product was verified by comparing the reaction with purified DcuS (Fig. S1) (35Janausch I.G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. Function of DcuS from Escherichia coli as a fumarate-stimulated histidine protein kinase in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39809-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CL efficiency was calculated from the levels of cross-linked versus free DcuS (Fig. 1A) and ranged from 0 to 74%. We ensured that the band intensity was in the linear range of detection to allow a comparison of band intensities (18Monzel C. Unden G. Transmembrane signaling in the sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli: a long-range piston-type displacement of transmembrane helix 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 11042-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The CL efficiencies were high at several positions within TM2 (approx. Ser182 to Leu201), the periplasmic α6 of PASP, and the cytoplasmic α1-PASC helices (see Fig. 1B). Lower CL efficiency was observed at the membrane/water interfaces on the periplasmic (residues Trp181–Trp185) and cytoplasmic (Cys199–Lys207) sites. For most regions, a +3/+4 periodicity of high CL efficiency was observed (Fig. 1B), which is characteristic of the interaction between two α-helices. Notably, the CL efficiency and the +3/+4 periodicity were retained in the region from F189 to L195, demonstrating that the region has a supposed α-helicity, which is retained in the Cys replacement mutations. Remarkably, the CL pattern and yield were essentially identical for fumarate activated versus nonactivated DcuS, with a maximal 12% difference in the CL efficiency. The clearest differences were observed in the Cys199–Lys207 region, corresponding to the TM2-PASC interdomain or linker region. In this region, a generally low CL efficiency was observed with partial nonhelical spacing of the CL maxima, and relatively large fumarate-induced differences, especially for residues Leu201, Val202, Val204, Leu205, and Lys206. The CL results suggest that the region from α6 in PASP to α1 in PASC forms a continuous α-helix, including the complete TM2 region. The sensitivity of DcuS activity to Cys replacement mutation in the F189–L195 region coincides with the presence of a GxxxG motif in this region. GxxxG motifs frequently mediate the interactions of TM α-helices via “ridge into groove” tight packing of two interacting TM helices (36Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M.

The F189–L195 region in TM2 is part of such a glycine-zipper-type motif S186xxxGxxxG194 (Fig. S2) (41Bailey T.L. Williams N. Misleh C. Li W.W.

A role of the motif for DcuS function and activity was tested by substituting the motif residues and adjacent residues with Ala or Cys (for Ser), which avoids gross structural rearrangements. Replacement of Gly with Ala in GxxxG motifs disrupts helix–helix interactions, as the Gly residues are important for TM helix dimerization (38Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M.

A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The impact of the mutations on DcuS function was assayed using the variants in a DcuS-less background by monitoring DcuS-dependent dcuB-lacZ reporter gene expression (Fig. 3). Individual replacements in the signature residues Ser186 and Gly190 of the motif did not significantly affect dcuB-lacZ expression, whereas the activity decreased to 44% of wild-type after replacement of Gly194 by Ala. Mutation of other residues in that region had no effect as well. However, mutation of the core pair of the motif (Gly190 residue together with Gly194) dramatically reduced the activity to ∼16% of wild-type. The effect is specific since mutation of neighboring residues (W185A together with F189A) had no effect. Remarkably, mutation of Ser186 together with Gly190 showed the same reduction in activity as for the Gly190 plus Gly194 pair. Taken together, the data suggest that the S186xxxGxxxG194 motif in TM2 (particularly Gly190 or the Gly190 + G194 pair) is crucial for DcuS function. Notably, the level of DcuS protein in membranes was similar for wild-type and all variants after expression (Fig. S3A), confirming that the observed differences were caused by the mutations rather than by altered DcuS levels. As Thr residues can also be a part of (small)xxx(small) motifs (38Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M. Motifs of serine and threonine can drive association of transmembrane helices.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we analyzed the involvement of Thr198. However, when both the Thr198 and the Gly194 residues were replaced by Ala residues (Fig. 3), dcuB-lacZ expression was not decreased compared with DcuS(G194A) alone, indicating that Thr198 is not important for DcuS activity. The role of the S186xxxGxxxG194 motif in DcuS homodimerization was tested using bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH) systems. For the full-length DcuS protein, we applied the BACTH system that relies on the restoration of adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production by fusing the individual domains (T18 or T25) of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase to interacting proteins. Interaction restores the adenylate cyclase activity, which can be monitored as β-galactosidase expression (49Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D.

When T18-DcuS was coexpressed with T25-DcuS, high β-galactosidase activity was observed for wild-type DcuS (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W3107257413,"The siderophore rhizoferrin (N1,N4-dicitrylputrescine) is produced in fungi and bacteria to scavenge iron. Putrescine-producing bacterium Ralstonia pickettii synthesizes rhizoferrin and encodes a single nonribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore (NIS) synthetase. From biosynthetic logic, we hypothesized that this single enzyme is sufficient for rhizoferrin biosynthesis. We confirmed this by expression of R. pickettii NIS synthetase in Escherichia coli, resulting in rhizoferrin production. This was further confirmed in vitro using the recombinant NIS synthetase, synthesizing rhizoferrin from putrescine and citrate. Heterologous expression of homologous lbtA from Legionella pneumophila, required for rhizoferrin biosynthesis in that species, produced siderophore activity in E. coli. Rhizoferrin is also synthesized by Francisella tularensis and Francisella novicida, but unlike R. pickettii or L. pneumophila, Francisella species lack putrescine biosynthetic pathways because of genomic decay. Francisella encodes a NIS synthetase FslA/FigA and an ornithine decarboxylase homolog FslC/FigC, required for rhizoferrin biosynthesis. Ornithine decarboxylase produces putrescine from ornithine, but we show here in vitro that FigA synthesizes N-citrylornithine, and FigC is an N-citrylornithine decarboxylase that together synthesize rhizoferrin without using putrescine. We co-expressed F. novicida figA and figC in E. coli and produced rhizoferrin. A 2.1 Å X-ray crystal structure of the FigC N-citrylornithine decarboxylase reveals how the larger substrate is accommodated and how active site residues have changed to recognize N-citrylornithine. FigC belongs to a new subfamily of alanine racemase-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylases that are not involved in polyamine biosynthesis. These data reveal a natural product biosynthetic workaround that evolved to bypass a missing precursor and re-establish it in the final structure. The siderophore rhizoferrin (N1,N4-dicitrylputrescine) is produced in fungi and bacteria to scavenge iron. Putrescine-producing bacterium Ralstonia pickettii synthesizes rhizoferrin and encodes a single nonribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore (NIS) synthetase. From biosynthetic logic, we hypothesized that this single enzyme is sufficient for rhizoferrin biosynthesis. We confirmed this by expression of R. pickettii NIS synthetase in Escherichia coli, resulting in rhizoferrin production. This was further confirmed in vitro using the recombinant NIS synthetase, synthesizing rhizoferrin from putrescine and citrate. Heterologous expression of homologous lbtA from Legionella pneumophila, required for rhizoferrin biosynthesis in that species, produced siderophore activity in E. coli. Rhizoferrin is also synthesized by Francisella tularensis and Francisella novicida, but unlike R. pickettii or L. pneumophila, Francisella species lack putrescine biosynthetic pathways because of genomic decay. Francisella encodes a NIS synthetase FslA/FigA and an ornithine decarboxylase homolog FslC/FigC, required for rhizoferrin biosynthesis. Ornithine decarboxylase produces putrescine from ornithine, but we show here in vitro that FigA synthesizes N-citrylornithine, and FigC is an N-citrylornithine decarboxylase that together synthesize rhizoferrin without using putrescine. We co-expressed F. novicida figA and figC in E. coli and produced rhizoferrin. A 2.1 Å X-ray crystal structure of the FigC N-citrylornithine decarboxylase reveals how the larger substrate is accommodated and how active site residues have changed to recognize N-citrylornithine. FigC belongs to a new subfamily of alanine racemase-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylases that are not involved in polyamine biosynthesis. These data reveal a natural product biosynthetic workaround that evolved to bypass a missing precursor and re-establish it in the final structure. Almost all organisms require iron for growth (1Miethke M. Marahiel M.A. Siderophore-based iron acquisition and pathogen control.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 413-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), and many microorganisms obtain iron from the environment by synthesizing, secreting, and retrieving small molecular weight iron chelators known as siderophores (2Neilands J.B.

Siderophores employ hydroxamate, catecholate, or α-hydroxycarboxylate functional groups to bind Fe3+ (3Hider R.C. Kong X. Chemistry and biology of siderophores.Nat. Prod.

Biosynthesis of siderophores employs either the intensively studied nonribosomal peptide synthetase siderophore synthetases (4Crosa J.H. Walsh C.T.

Diverse siderophores utilize primary metabolites of the polyamine family 1,3-diaminopropane, putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane), cadaverine (1,5-diaminpentane), norspermidine (N-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane), spermidine (N-aminopropylputrescine), and homospermidine (N-aminobutylputrescine) (7Michael A.J.

Aminochelin, a catecholamine siderophore produced by Azotobacter vinelandii.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 453-460Google Scholar), and the dicatecholate siderophore photobactin (16Ciche T.A.

Putrescine is also found in the simple polycarboxylate siderophore rhizoferrin (N1,N4-dicitrylputrescine), consisting of two citrate molecules linked to a putrescine backbone (17Thieken A.

Rhizoferrin was first characterized from the zygomycete fungus Rhizopus microspores, and the fungal rhizoferrin is produced as the R,R-rhizoferrin enantiomer (18Dreschel H. Metzger J. Freund S.

Winkelmann G. Stereochemical characterization of rhizoferrin and identification of its dehydration products.BioMetals. 1992; 5: 141-148Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fungal rhizoferrin was found to be synthesized by a single NIS synthetase in Rhizopus delemar (20Carroll C.S. Grieve C.L. Murugathasan I. Bennet A.J. Czekster C.M. Liu H. Naismith J. Moore M.M.

Cell Biol. 2017; 89: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the discovery of fungally produced rhizoferrin, it was then found in the β-proteobacterium Ralstonia pickettii, as the S,S-rhizoferrin enantiomer (21Munzinger M. Taraz K.

The polyamines produced by R. pickettii are putrescine and 2-hydroxyputrescine (22Hamana K. Saito T. Okada M.

Biol. 2016; 11: 2782-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but nothing is known about how rhizoferrin is produced in this species. Recently, the citrate-containing siderophore of the Legionnaires’ disease agent Legionella pneumophila was shown to be rhizoferrin (24Burnside D.M. Wu Y. Shafaie S. Cianciotto N.P. The Legionella pneumophila siderophore legiobactin is a polycarboxylate that is identical in structure to rhizoferrin.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it was previously demonstrated that production of the siderophore is dependent on the NIS synthetase LbtA and major facilitator superfamily (MFS)–type transporter LbtB (25Allard K.A. Viswanathan V.K. Cianciotto N.P. lbtA and lbtB are required for production of the Legionella pneumophila siderophore legiobactin.J.

Microbiol. 2017; 7: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The first sequenced genome of F. tularensis, the virulent SCHU S4 strain, revealed that the pathogen has a small genome of 1.89 Mbp that is undergoing decay associated with an intracellular lifestyle (30Larsson P. Oyston P.C. Chain P. Chu M.C. Duffield M. Fuxelius H.H. Garcia E. Halltorp G. Johansson D. Isherwood K.E. Karp P.D. Larsson E. Liu Y. Michell S. Prior J. et al.The complete genome sequence of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). More than 10% of the coding sequences contain insertion-deletion or substitution mutations resulting in loss of metabolic pathways. Closely related species Francisella novicida does not infect humans except opportunistically and is 98% identical to F. tularensis (31Oyston P.C. Sjostedt A. Titball R.W.

Buckley D. et al.Comparison of Francisella tularensis genomes reveals evolutionary events associated with the emergence of human pathogenic strains.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R102Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The ancestor of Francisella probably synthesized putrescine via the activities of arginine decarboxylase, agmatine deiminase, and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase; however, these genes have become disrupted in the case of F. tularensis or lost in F. novicida (30Larsson P.

The fslA/figA-encoded NIS synthetase is required for rhizoferrin production in F. tularensis and F. novicida (27Sullivan J.T. Jeffery E.F. Shannon J.D. Ramakrishnan G. Characterization of the siderophore of Francisella tularensis and role of fslA in siderophore production.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3785-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Deng K. Blick R.J. Liu W. Hansen E.J. Identification of Francisella tularensis genes affected by iron limitation.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, MFS-type transporter gene figB and figC-encoded alanine racemase (AR)-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylase, homologous to ornithine decarboxylase (OD), are required for rhizoferrin production in F. novicida (34Kiss K. Liu W. Huntley J.F. Norgard M.V. Hansen E.J. Characterization of fig operon mutants of Francisella novicida U112.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 285: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As F. novicida has lost all putrescine biosynthetic genes, we sought to determine how rhizoferrin is produced by this species. During the course of our study, another recent study demonstrated that a figC deletion mutant of F. tularensis accumulates N-citrylornithine, indicating that figC encodes an N-citrylornithine decarboxylase (35Ramakrishnan G. Perez N.M. Carroll C. Moore M.M. Nakamoto R.K. Fox T.E. Citryl ornithine is an intermediate in a three-step biosynthetic pathway for rhizoferrin in Francisella.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We also sought to determine how rhizoferrin is produced by R. pickettii and L. pneumophila, which synthesize putrescine. To elucidate the R. pickettii, L. pneumophila, and F. novicida biosynthetic pathways, we expressed relevant genes in Escherichia coli, and we assayed purified recombinant proteins in vitro. The X-ray crystal structure of the PLP-dependent decarboxylase FigC, which we confirmed in vitro to be an N-citrylornithine decarboxylase, was determined. The environmental β-proteobacterium R. pickettii produces rhizoferrin and encodes (Fig. 1A) a single NIS synthetase of 655 amino acids. Immediately downstream is a 414 amino acid ORF encoding a putative MFS transporter protein. To determine whether the R. pickettii NIS synthetase and MFS transporter are responsible for rhizoferrin production and sufficient to synthesize and export it when expressed heterologously in E. coli BL21, the genes were expressed individually or together from the expression vector pETDuet-1. Siderophore production resulting from growth of liquid cultures (Fig. 1B) or from solid agar plates (Fig. 1C) was detected using the Chrome Azurol S (CAS) reagent, siderophore production being visualized by formation of an intense yellow coloration. Expression of the R. pickettii NIS synthetase alone in E. coli was sufficient to produce a positive reaction with the CAS reagent, which was more intense when the R. pickettii MFS transporter or the F. novicida FigB MFS transporter was co-expressed. After partial purification of the supernatant from liquid cultures of E. coli BL21 co-expressing the R. pickettii NIS synthetase and MFS transporter and analysis by LC-MS, a mass corresponding to rhizoferrin (m/z 437.2) was detected that was absent in the control culture containing the empty plasmid (Fig. 1D). The presence of CAS-positive siderophore in the external medium, when E. coli BL21 expressing only the NIS synthetase was grown, indicates that rhizoferrin is exported by an E. coli efflux transporter. A more intense CAS reaction when the R. pickettii or F. novicida FigB MFS was co-expressed with the NIS synthetase may be because of greater affinity of the R. picketti or F. novicida transporters for rhizoferrin, or it may be because of their potentially higher expression levels compared with the native E. coli transporter(s). An alignment of the only close E. coli homolog, the MFS transporter MdtG (NP_415571), with the R. pickettii MFS, F. novicida FigB, and L. pneumophila LbtB transporters is shown in Figure S1A. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicates that F. novicida FigB and L. pneumophila LbtB transporters are more closely related compared with the R. pickettii MFS or E. coli MdtG proteins (Fig. S1B). The E. coli MdtG efflux transporter is involved in fluoroquinolone resistance (36Fabrega A. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Tavio M.M. Vila J. Constitutive SoxS expression in a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain with a truncated SoxR protein and identification of a new member of the marA-soxS-rob regulon, mdtG.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it is notable (Fig. S1C) that there are two internal amine groups separated by three carbons in the structure of quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (37Wise R. Andrews J.M. Edwards L.J. In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 23: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). To assess the substrate specificity of the R. pickettii NIS synthetase, the recombinant his-tagged purified protein was assayed in vitro with citrate and different diamine and amino acid cosubstrates and siderophore production then detected with the CAS reagent (Fig. 1E). Putrescine and cadaverine produced a strong CAS reaction, a less intense reaction was detected with 1,3-diaminopropane, but no reaction was detected with L-ornithine or L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid. Analysis by LC-MS (Fig. S2) of the in vitro reaction products produced with putrescine or cadaverine revealed masses for rhizoferrin (m/z 437.2) or homorhizoferrin (m/z 451.2), respectively (Fig. 1E). As a dedicated efflux transporter did not appear to be required for excretion of heterologously produced rhizoferrin from E. coli BL21, we expressed in E. coli the L. pneumophila gene encoding the LbtA NIS synthetase that is required for rhizoferrin biosynthesis in that species. Expression of the L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1 lbtA NIS synthetase (599 amino acids) alone from pETDuet-1 in E. coli did not result in siderophore production, as detected by the CAS reagent after growth on solid agar plates. We then noted that the lbtA ORF from the 130b strain of L. pneumophila used in the original study (25Allard K.A. Viswanathan V.K. Cianciotto N.P. lbtA and lbtB are required for production of the Legionella pneumophila siderophore legiobactin.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) lacked 19 amino acids from the N-terminus relative to the Philadelphia 1 strain. After removal of the first 19 amino acids from the Philadelphia 1 LbtA NIS synthetase, which consisted of the region up to the first internal ATG codon, expression of the shortened version in E. coli BL21 then resulted in siderophore production (Fig. 1F). It is noteworthy that R. pickettii likely synthesizes putrescine from ornithine using an aspartate aminotransferase-fold ODC (ACS63448, 759 a.a.) that is a close homolog (95% amino acid identity) of the characterized (38Lowe-Power T.M. Hendrich C.G. von Roepenack-Lahaye E. Li B. Wu D. Mitra R. Dalsing B.L. Ricca P. Naidoo J. Cook D. Jancewicz A. Masson P. Thomma B. Lahaye T. Michael A.J. et al.Metabolomics of tomato xylem sap during bacterial wilt reveals Ralstonia solanacearum produces abundant putrescine, a metabolite that accelerates wilt disease.Environ. Microbiol. 2018; 20: 1330-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) Ralstonia solanacearum ODC (CAD16072, 759 a.a.). In contrast, L. pneumophila likely synthesizes putrescine from arginine using an AR-fold arginine decarboxylase, agmatine deiminase, and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (see correction to [39Nasrallah G.K. Riveroll A.L. Chong A. Murray L.E. Lewis P.J. Garduno R.A. Legionella pneumophila requires polyamines for optimal intracellular growth.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 4346-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar]). In contrast to rhizoferrin biosynthesis in R. pickettii and L. pneumophila, F. novicida requires not only the encoded NIS synthetase FigA and MFS transporter FigB but also a homolog (FigC) of the AR-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylase family that includes L-ornithine decarboxylase (L-ODC), an enzyme that produces putrescine from L-ornithine (34Kiss K. Liu W. Huntley J.F. Norgard M.V. Hansen E.J. Characterization of fig operon mutants of Francisella novicida U112.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 285: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We expressed separately either the F. novicida figA NIS synthetase gene or the figC decarboxylase, from pETDuet-1 in E. coli BL21 grown in liquid culture or on solid agar plates, but no siderophore production was detected using the CAS reagent (Fig. 2, A–B). However, co-expression of figA and figC resulted in a strong positive CAS reaction comparable to the reaction produced by co-expression of the R. pickettii NIS synthetase and MFS transporter. Partial purification of the supernatant from the E. coli liquid culture co-expressing the F. novicida figA and figC genes and analysis by LC-MS (Fig. 2C) revealed a mass corresponding to rhizoferrin (m/z 437.2). To determine whether co-expression of the F. novicida figB or R. pickettii MFS transporters together with figA and figC would increase siderophore production from E. coli, we co-expressed figA and figC from pETDuet-1 and figB or the R. pickettii MFS transporter from pACYCDuet-1 (Fig. 2D). Co-expression of either transporter noticeably increased the intensity of the CAS reagent positive reaction. We reasoned that if FigC was an L-ODC producing putrescine from ornithine, then figC would not be required for heterologous rhizoferrin biosynthesis in E. coli, as there is already abundant putrescine present. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the requirement for figC would be that FigA conjugates L-ornithine to citrate to form N-citrylornithine, which is then decarboxylated by FigC to form N-citrylputrescine. Recombinant FigA and FigC proteins were purified and assayed in vitro with the CAS reagent, and assay reactions contained 2 mM Na-citrate and 2 mM L-ornithine (Fig. 2E). A slight positive reaction was observed with FigA alone, but an intense reaction was observed with FigA and FigC together, comparable with the reaction produced by the R. pickettii-purified recombinant NIS synthetase (Fig. 2E). Although FigA and FigC together produced a positive reaction with L-ornithine, no reaction was seen with D-ornithine, L-lysine, putrescine, cadaverine, 1,3-diaminopropane, L-2,4-diaminobutyrate, or L-2,3-diaminopropionate (Fig. 2F). When the reaction products from FigA alone assayed with citrate and L-ornithine assay were analyzed by LC-MS, a mass for N-citrylornithine was detected (m/z 307.1). With FigA and FigC together, a mass for rhizoferrin (m/z 437.1) was detected (Fig. S3). The requirement for F. novicida figC in heterologous rhizoferrin biosynthesis in E. coli, the fact that FigA can use only L-ornithine and not putrescine in vitro for rhizoferrin biosynthesis, and the need for FigC in the conversion of N-citrylornithine to rhizoferrin in vitro confirms that FigC is an N-citrylornithine decarboxylase and not an L-ornithine decarboxylase. On the basis of these findings, we propose the two alternative bacterial rhizoferrin biosynthetic pathways depicted in Figure 3. The R. pickettii NIS synthetase, and by extension the L. pneumonphila LbtA NIS synthetase, is alone sufficient for rhizoferrin biosynthesis via N-citrylputrescine (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the F. novicida FigA NIS synthetase produces N-citrylornithine, which is then decarboxylated to N-citrylputrescine by FigC, and another citrate condensed to N-citrylputrescine by FigA to produce rhizoferrin (Fig. 3B). Recently, Ramakrishnan et al. (35Ramakrishnan G. Perez N.M. Carroll C. Moore M.M. Nakamoto R.K. Fox T.E. Citryl ornithine is an intermediate in a three-step biosynthetic pathway for rhizoferrin in Francisella.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) have shown that a figC deletion mutant of F. tularensis LVS accumulates N-citrylornithine. Given the novel substrate preference of the FigC decarboxylase for N-citrylornithine, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of FigC and compared it with other AR-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylases. The X-ray crystal structure was solved to 2.1 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction using incorporated selenomethionine to phase the structure (Table S1). Two functional dimers were found in the asymmetric unit (four monomers), and all four active sites showed good density for the cofactor PLP (Fig. 4). FigC is composed of an N-terminal β/α-barrel domain and a C-terminal β-barrel domain (Fig. 5A), typical of the AR-fold PLP-dependent decarboxylases. The FigC structure exhibits strong similarity to other structures within the family representing diverse substrate specificities, including meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) from the euryarchaeote Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (CASDC) from Campylobacter jejuni, lysine/ornithine decarboxylase (L/ODC) from Vibrio vulnificus, and arginine decarboxylase (ADC) from V. vulnificus (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W3108643838,"Background Rare pathogenic variants in either the ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes have been linked to autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia associated with abnormal platelet production and function, deserving the designation of Glanzmann Thrombasthenia-Like Syndrome (GTLS) or ITGA2B/ITGB3-related thrombocytopenia. Objectives To describe a series of patients with familial macrothrombocytopenia and decreased expression of αIIbβ3 integrin due to defects in the ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes. Methods We reviewed the clinical and laboratory records of 10 Portuguese families with GTLS (33 patients and 11 unaffected relatives), including the functional and genetic defects. Results Patients had absent to moderate bleeding, macrothrombocytopenia, low αIIbβ3 expression, impaired platelet aggregation/ATP release to physiological agonists and low expression of activation-induced binding sites on αIIbβ3 (PAC-1) and receptor-induced binding sites on its ligand (bound fibrinogen), upon stimulation with TRAP-6 and ADP. Evidence for constitutive αIIbβ3 activation, occurred in 2 out of 9 patients from 8 families studied, but also in 2 out of 12 healthy controls. We identified 7 missense variants: 3 in ITGA2B (5 families), and 4 in ITGB3 (5 families). Three variants (αIIb: p.Arg1026Trp and p.Arg1026Gln and β3: p.Asp749His) were previously reported. The remaining (αIIb: p.Gly1007Val and β3: p.Thr746Pro, p.His748Pro and p.Arg760Cys) are new, expanding the αIIbβ3 defects associated with GTLS. The integration of the clinical and laboratory data allowed the identification of two GTLS subgroups, with distinct disease severity. Conclusions Previously reported ITGA2B and ITGB3 variants related to thrombocytopenia were clustered in a confined region of the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domains, the inner membrane clasp. For the first time, variants are reported at the outer membrane clasp, at the transmembrane domain of αIIb, and at the membrane distal cytoplasmic domains of β3. This is the largest single-center series of inherited macrothrombocytopenia associated with αIIbβ3 variants published to date."
https://openalex.org/W3109197576,"Postpartum depression is a worldwide public health concern. The prevalence of postpartum depression is reported to be greater in developing countries than in developed countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, no papers on postpartum depression in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic have been published. In order to strengthen maternal and child health, the current situation of postpartum depression should be understood. This study aims to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression and identify factors associated with postpartum depression in Vientiane Capital, Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Study participants were 428 women 6–8 weeks postpartum who visited four central hospitals in Vientiane Capital for postnatal care from July to August 2019. Structured questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic, obstetrical and infant, and psychiatric data about the women and their partners. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to identify suspected cases of postpartum depression with the cut-off score of 9/10. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine independent factors that were associated with suspected postpartum depression (EPDS ≥10). The mean age of the 428 women was 28.1 years, and the prevalence of suspected postpartum depression was 31.8%. Multivariable logistic regression using variables that were statistically significant on bivariate analyses indicated that three variables were associated with suspected postpartum depression: unintended pregnancy (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.00–2.73, P = 0.049), low birth satisfaction (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.00–3.43, P = 0.049), and depression during pregnancy (AOR = 3.99, 95% CI 2.35–6.77, P &lt;0.001). In this study, unintended pregnancy, low birth satisfaction, and depression during pregnancy were independent risk factors for postpartum depression. These results suggest that the mental health of pregnant women should be monitored, and that health care services, especially family planning and supportive birth care, should be strengthened to prevent postpartum depression."
https://openalex.org/W3109381788,"Synaptotagmin-like protein 4 (Slp-4), also known as granuphilin, is a Rab effector responsible for docking secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane before exocytosis. Slp-4 binds vesicular Rab proteins via an N-terminal Slp homology domain, interacts with plasma membrane SNARE complex proteins via a central linker region, and contains tandem C-terminal C2 domains (C2A and C2B) with affinity for phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). The Slp-4 C2A domain binds with low nanomolar apparent affinity to PIP2 in lipid vesicles that also contain background anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine but much weaker when either the background anionic lipids or PIP2 is removed. Through computational and experimental approaches, we show that this high-affinity membrane binding arises from concerted interaction at multiple sites on the C2A domain. In addition to a conserved PIP2-selective lysine cluster, a larger cationic surface surrounding the cluster contributes substantially to the affinity for physiologically relevant lipid compositions. Although the K398A mutation in the lysine cluster blocks PIP2 binding, this mutated protein domain retains the ability to bind physiological membranes in both a liposome-binding assay and MIN6 cells. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate several conformationally flexible loops that contribute to the nonspecific cationic surface. We also identify and characterize a covalently modified variant that arises through reactivity of the PIP2-binding lysine cluster with endogenous bacterial compounds and binds weakly to membranes. Overall, multivalent lipid binding by the Slp-4 C2A domain provides selective recognition and high-affinity docking of large dense core secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane."

All patients underwent endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography scanning, and physical examination. Validated questionnaire was completed for the participants and all were actively followed on monthly basis. Results Median survival time was 6.5 months, and 1-, and 5-year survival rates were 26.2%, and 1.5%. Patients who were older (p&lt;0.001), illiterate (p = 0.004), unmarried (p = 0.003), rural inhabitant (p = 0.013), opium user (p = 0.039), and had lower body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.002) had lower overall survival. Tumors located in the head of pancreas were more commonly diagnosed at lower stages (p&lt;0.001). Only 10.4% of patients underwent surgery who were more commonly educated (p&lt;0.001), married (p = 0.005), had a tumor located in the head of pancreas (p = 0.016), and were diagnosed at lower stages (p&lt;0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders and risk factors, rural inhabitance (HR: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.01–1.74)), having more symptoms (HR for each increasing symptom: 1.06 (1.02–1.11)), using opium (HR: 1.51 (1.04–2.20)), having a tumor located in the body of pancreas (HR: 1.33 (1.02–1.75)), and having an advanced tumor stage (HR: 2.07 (1.34–3.19)) remained significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. After the adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find significant relationships between smoking, alcohol intake, and BMI with the risk of death among patients with pancreatic cancer. Conclusions Iranian patients with PC have very poor long-term survival. Besides tumor’s stage and location, socioeconomic disparities could affect the probabilities of receiving treatment and/or survival in these patients. Opium use is an independent risk factor for mortality among PC patients in Iran."

This paper chooses five proxy variables according to China’s reality and uses a two-step principal component analysis to construct an investor sentiment index. The five proxy variables are the number of new stock accounts, turnover ratio, margin balance, net active purchasing amount, and investor attention. In the final part of this study, using the price data from the Shanghai and Shenzhen Security Exchange, this paper investigates the dynamic relationship between investor sentiment and stock market realized volatility based on the thermal optimal path. The empirical results show that when the market fluctuates severely, investor sentiment leads stock market realized volatility over one or two steps. The prediction power is also checked. The results indicate that investor sentiment indeed forecasts the realized volatility. This research supports regulators and financial institutions in taking advanced measures."
https://openalex.org/W3108004014,"Despite advances in the healthcare system, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are still an important public health problem with disparities in the burden within and between countries. Studies among the adult population documented that socioeconomic and environmental factors play a role in the incidence and progression of CVDs. However, evidence is scarce on the socioeconomic determinants and the interplay with behavioral risks among older adults. Therefore, we identified socioeconomic and behavioral determinants of CVDs among older adults. Our sample consisted of 14,322 people aged 50 years and above from Belgium and France who responded to the waves 4, 5, 6 and/or 7 of the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe. The effect of determinants on the occurrence of CVD was examined using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach for binary longitudinal data. The overall rate of heart attack was 8.3%, which is 7.6% in Belgium and 9.1% in France. Whereas, 2.6% and 2.3% in Belgium and France, respectively, had experienced stroke. In the multivariable GEE model, older age [AOR: 1.057, 95%CI: 1.055–1.060], living in large cities [AOR: 1.14, 95%CI: 1.07–1.18], and retirement [AOR: 1.21, 95%CI: 1.16–1.31] were associated with higher risk of CVD. Furthermore, higher level of education [AOR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.79–0.90], upper wealth quantile [AOR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.76–0.86] and having social support [AOR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.77–0.84] significantly lowers the odds of having CVD. A higher hand grip strength was also significantly associated with lower risk of CVD [AOR: 0.987, 95%CI: 0.984–0.990]. This study demonstrated that older adults who do not have social support, live in big cities, belong to the lowest wealth quantile, and have a low level of education have a higher likelihood of CVD. Therefore, community-based interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular risks need to give more emphasis to high-risk retired older adults with lower education, no social support and those who live in large cities."
https://openalex.org/W3109758605,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the colliculus inferior (IC) improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy and induces paradoxal kinesia in rats. Since the IC is part of the brain aversive system, DBS of this structure has long been related to aversive behavior in rats limiting its clinical use. This study aimed to improve intracollicular DBS parameters in order to avoid anxiogenic side effects while preserving motor improvements in rats. Catalepsy was induced by systemic haloperidol (0.5mg/kg) and after 60 min the bar test was performed during which a given rat received continuous (5 min, with or without pre-stimulation) or intermittent (5 x 1 min) DBS (30Hz, 200–600μA, pulse width 100μs). Only continuous DBS with pre-stimulation reduced catalepsy time. The rats were also submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) test and received either continuous stimulation with or without pre-stimulation, or sham treatment. Only rats receiving continuous DBS with pre-stimulation increased the time spent and the number of entries into the open arms of the EPM suggesting an anxiolytic effect. The present intracollicular DBS parameters induced motor improvements without any evidence of aversive behavior, pointing to the IC as an alternative DBS target to induce paradoxical kinesia improving motor deficits in parkinsonian patients."
https://openalex.org/W3106952868,"With an ever-increasing interest in understanding the relationships between the microbiota and the host, more tools to map, analyze and interpret these relationships have been developed. Most of these tools, however, focus on taxonomic profiling and comparative analysis among groups, with very few analytical tools designed to correlate microbiota and the host phenotypic data. We have developed a software program for creating a web-based integrative database and analysis platform called MANTA (Microbiota And pheNoType correlation Analysis platform). In addition to storing the data, MANTA is equipped with an intuitive user interface that can be used to correlate the microbial composition with phenotypic parameters. Using a case study, we demonstrated that MANTA was able to quickly identify the significant correlations between microbial abundances and phenotypes that are supported by previous studies. Moreover, MANTA enabled the users to quick access locally stored data that can help interpret microbiota-phenotype relations.

https://openalex.org/W3107767882,"The current study investigated the clinical manifestations and outcomes of different age groups of patients with overseas imported COVID-19. In total, 53 COVID-19 patients admitted to the designated Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital between March 16 and April 15 of 2020 were included. Based on the percentage of disease aggravation during hospital stay according to CT, the patients were divided into two groups: ≤40 years (group A; n = 41) and &gt;40 years (group B; n = 12). The demographic data, epidemiological history, disease courses, potential complications, clinical symptoms, lab indices, chest CT outcomes, treatment protocols and turnovers of the two groups were compared. According to clinical typing, compared with group A, group B had a significantly greater proportion of the common type of COVID-19 (P&lt;0.05) and greater comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (P&lt;0.001). The two groups presented significantly different lab indices. Group B showed significantly more frequent CT abnormalities, with greater proportions of multiple lesions and bilateral lung involvement (P&lt;0.05). During hospitalization, group B had a greater proportion of disease aggravation according to CT (P&lt;0.01). Compared with group A, group B received a significantly greater proportion of antiviral therapy and presented a significantly greater occurrence of adverse drug reactions (P&lt;0.05). The two groups did not significantly differ in time from admission to clinical symptom improvement or from disease onset to negative outcomes according to nucleic acid testing, the appearance of IgG or the appearance of IgM. They also did not significantly differ in length of stay. Older imported COVID-19 patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, showed a broader pulmonary extent and faster development of the disease, more severe pathogenetic conditions and a greater risk of developing a critically severe type. Increased attention should be given to this population in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3107921631,"Aim Mouse models of sudden cardiac arrest are limited by challenges with surgical technique and obtaining reliable venous access. To overcome this limitation, we sought to develop a simplified method in the mouse that uses ultrasound-guided injection of potassium chloride directly into the heart. Methods Potassium chloride was delivered directly into the left ventricular cavity under ultrasound guidance in intubated mice, resulting in immediate asystole. Mice were resuscitated with injection of epinephrine and manual chest compressions and evaluated for survival, body temperature, cardiac function, kidney damage, and diffuse tissue injury. Results The direct injection sudden cardiac arrest model causes rapid asystole with high surgical survival rates and short surgical duration. Sudden cardiac arrest mice with 8-min of asystole have significant cardiac dysfunction at 24 hours and high lethality within the first seven days, where after cardiac function begins to improve. Sudden cardiac arrest mice have secondary organ damage, including significant kidney injury but no significant change to neurologic function. Conclusions Ultrasound-guided direct injection of potassium chloride allows for rapid and reliable cardiac arrest in the mouse that mirrors human pathology without the need for intravenous access. This technique will improve investigators’ ability to study the mechanisms underlying post-arrest changes in a mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W3108735510,"There is unmet need for effective stroke therapies. Numerous neuroprotection attempts for acute cerebral ischemia have failed and as a result there is growing interest in developing therapies to promote functional recovery through increasing synaptic plasticity. For this research study, we hypothesized that in addition to its previously reported role in mediating cell death during the acute phase, the alpha isoform of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38α, may also contribute to interleukin-1β-mediated impairment of functional recovery during the subacute phase after acute ischemic stroke. Accordingly, an oral, brain-penetrant, small molecule p38α inhibitor, neflamapimod, was evaluated as a subacute phase stroke treatment to promote functional recovery. Neflamapimod administration to rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion at two dose levels was initiated outside of the previously characterized therapeutic window for neuroprotection of less than 24 hours for p38α inhibitors. Six-week administration of neflamapimod, starting at 48 hours after reperfusion, significantly improved behavioral outcomes assessed by the modified neurological severity score at Week 4 and at Week 6 post stroke in a dose-dependent manner. Neflamapimod demonstrated beneficial effects on additional measures of sensory and motor function. It also resulted in a dose-related increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels, a previously reported potential marker of synaptic plasticity that was measured in brain homogenates at sacrifice. Taken together with literature evidence on the role of p38α-dependent suppression by interleukin-1β of BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity and BDNF production, our findings support a mechanistic model in which inhibition of p38α promotes functional recovery after ischemic stroke by blocking the deleterious effects of interleukin-1β on synaptic plasticity. The dose-related in vivo efficacy of neflamapimod offers the possibility of having a therapy for stroke that could be initiated outside the short time window for neuroprotection and for improving recovery after a completed stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3109895888,"Background Although early diagnosis is a key determinant factor for breast cancer survival, delay in presentation and advanced stage diagnosis are common challenges in low and middle income countries including Ethiopia. Long patient delays in presentation to health facility and advanced stage diagnosis are common features in breast cancer care in Ethiopia but the reasons for patient delays are not well explored in the country. Therefore we aimed to explore the reasons for patient delay in seeking early medical care for breast cancer in North-west Ethiopia. Methods A qualitative study was conducted from November to December 2019 using in-depth interviews from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the two comprehensive specialized hospitals in North West Ethiopia. Verbal informed consent was taken from each participant before interviews. A thematic content analysis was performed using Open Code software version 4.02. Results Lack of knowledge and awareness about breast cancer, cultural and religious beliefs, economic hardships, lack of health care and transportation access, fear of surgical procedures and lack of trusts on medical care were the major reasons for late presentation of breast cancer identified from the patient’s narratives. Conclusions The reasons for late presentation of patients to seek early medical care for breast cancer had multidimensional nature in Northwest Ethiopia. Health education and promotion programs about breast cancer should be designed to increase public awareness to facilitate early detection of cases before advancement on the existing health care delivery system."
https://openalex.org/W3110259409,"Introduction Sexual assault is an important health and social problem affecting young girls. The aim of the study is therefore to do a one-year retrospective review of documents of alleged sexual assaults managed at Saint Paulo’s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) to determine survivors’ characteristics, circumstances of the assault, and treatment offered. Methods This is a hospital-based one-year retrospective review of alleged sexual assault cases. The case records of survivors were retrieved, reviewed and information extracted analyzed using SPSS version 17. Characteristics of victims of the sexual assault, clinical presentation, and management provided were described by frequency and percentage distribution. Result A total of 170 cases of alleged sexual assault who received care during the study period were identified. Around 96% of the survivors were female while there were 6 male cases. The mean age of the victims was 13 yrs. with a range from 2 to 25 yrs. About 23.6% of the victims were less than 10 years. Half of the victims were assaulted by neighbors (45%) followed by strangers (36.5%). The interval between the incident and presentation to the hospital ranged from 2 hours to 93 days (2224 hours) with an average of 98 hours. Most (93.0%) had one or more physical examination findings at presentation. Serology tests for HIV, Hepatitis B, and Syphilis were done in 97.3%, 88.7%, and 84.5% cases respectively. Urine pregnancy tests were done in 62.5% of the cases. Prophylaxis against HIV and STI prophylaxis was provided to 42% and 45% respectively. Social support/counseling was provided to 61% of the victims and legal evidence (certificate) was provided to 45.5% of the cases. Conclusion and recommendations Although it is largely not reported by the victims, sexual assault is a grievous offense still happening constantly. Children and young girls remain the most vulnerable. There is inadequate forensic evidence collection, legal and medical care. There is also a delay in presentation to hospital by victims. Therefore, there is a need to have standardized protocols for comprehensive evaluation and care of the survivors. It is also imperative that a multidisciplinary approach like a one-stop clinic should be utilized to provide effective and efficient medical, social, psychological, and legal services. Finally, it is very necessary to increase public awareness and preventive interventions are required particularly to protect the vulnerable age group to enhance their safety."
https://openalex.org/W3107621525,"Constraint-based models use steady-state mass balances to define a solution space of flux configurations, which can be narrowed down by measuring as many fluxes as possible. Due to loops and redundant pathways, this process typically yields multiple alternative solutions. To address this ambiguity, flux sampling can estimate the probability distribution of each flux, or a flux configuration can be singled out by further minimizing the sum of fluxes according to the assumption that cellular metabolism favors states where enzyme-related costs are economized. However, flux sampling is susceptible to artifacts introduced by thermodynamically infeasible cycles and is it not clear if the economy of fluxes assumption (EFA) is universally valid. Here, we formulated a constraint-based approach, MaxEnt, based on the principle of maximum entropy, which in this context states that if more than one flux configuration is consistent with a set of experimentally measured fluxes, then the one with the minimum amount of unwarranted assumptions corresponds to the best estimation of the non-observed fluxes. We compared MaxEnt predictions to Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae publicly available flux data. We found that the mean square error (MSE) between experimental and predicted fluxes by MaxEnt and EFA-based methods are three orders of magnitude lower than the median of 1,350,000 MSE values obtained using flux sampling. However, only MaxEnt and flux sampling correctly predicted flux through E . coli ’s glyoxylate cycle, whereas EFA-based methods, in general, predict no flux cycles. We also tested MaxEnt predictions at increasing levels of overflow metabolism. We found that MaxEnt accuracy is not affected by overflow metabolism levels, whereas the EFA-based methods show a decreasing performance. These results suggest that MaxEnt is less sensitive than flux sampling to artifacts introduced by thermodynamically infeasible cycles and that its predictions are less susceptible to overfitting than EFA-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W3110103382,"Background/Objectives Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess quality of health care systems is mandated in many countries and has been implemented successfully in many specialities. Ophthalmology currently lags behind. To support and inform future implementation, we investigated paediatric ophthalmic clinicians’ experience of, and future training needs for, using child-appropriate vision PROMs and their views about the barriers and enablers to future routine implementation in clinical practice. Methods We conducted a pilot study, using an online survey to elicit the experience, attitudes, training needs and perceptions of barriers and enablers to routine PROMs use of ophthalmic health professionals in the Paediatric Ophthalmology Department at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. A focus-group was undertaken to discuss survey results and preferences regarding presentation of PROM data. Analysis comprised descriptive statistics, presented alongside complementary qualitative data. Results Eighteen clinicians in the department completed the survey. Twenty-seven took part in the focus group. Clinicians had limited experience of using PROMs but high confidence in the potential positive impact on communication with patients, monitoring chronic conditions and clinical decision-making. Clinicians identified operational issues (collection and analysis of data) and impact (interpretation and application of data) as the two key areas for consideration. Training and information requirements before implementation were clearly articulated, alongside the benefits of using digital/electronic data capture ahead of consultations to allow efficiency and automated analysis, and presentation in an appropriate visual format alongside clinical data to ensure meaningful use. Conclusion The findings of this pilot study of ophthalmic clinicians working in a specialist paediatric ophthalmology department, suggest that ophthalmic clinicians recognise the potential benefits of routine PROMs use in clinical practice. Together with existing literature outside ophthalmology relating to overcoming barriers and exploiting enablers to routine implementation, findings may be applicable in planning routine PROM implementation in paediatric ophthalmology."
https://openalex.org/W3110463484,"Background Gender-based domestic violence has gained significant visibility in recent years and is currently considered a priority in the field of public health. This preliminary, qualitative study explores how social norms and professional regulations impact the attitudes and practices of health workers and criminal justice professionals regarding domestic violence against women in Brazil and Norway. Methods A total of 16 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted; eight in two different cities in Brazil, and eight in two different cities in Norway. In each country, four health workers and four criminal justice professionals were interviewed. We focused on the participants’ experiences with cases of domestic violence, their perceptions of their professional responsibilities, as well as the challenges they encounter. We analysed the transcribed interviews using a focused open coding process. Findings The participants ranged in age from 32 to 59. All of them worked, with and without supervision, in cases involving domestic violence victims. In all four study locations, the professionals felt that they had not received enough training in how to handle domestic violence. Some medical doctors reported becoming personally detached over time, especially when the victims did not admit that their injuries were due to domestic violence. In the Brazilian cities, some professionals reported that women who were beaten by their partners were themselves responsible for the situation. This was not the case in the Norwegian cities. Both countries have laws and regulations that have been put in place to guide professionals who provide services to victims of domestic violence. For many reasons, professionals do not always follow these regulations. For the Norwegian health workers, confidentiality was an important factor explaining why they did not always report suspected domestic violence to the police. For the Brazilian health workers, the fear of having to testify in court, and thus potentially being vulnerable to violence themselves, was a factor that made some not want to involve the justice system. In both countries, the participating professionals reported the need for closer collaboration with social workers and mental health specialists, since domestic violence is closely related to both social norms in the communities and to individual psychological factors. Conclusion Individual characteristics and experiences, the emphasis on confidentiality and the fear of repercussions may affect the way health and criminal justice workers perceive and deal with domestic violence cases. The findings in the study thus indicate that personal psychological factors and social norms concerning the acceptability of domestic violence are critical risk factors for women, and that a multi-professional approach is needed. The findings from this preliminary study can serve as background for larger and more comprehensive studies of how professionals handle cases of domestic violence."

One mineral which may affect bone quality is silicon. The objective of this study was to determine if supplementing bioavailable silicon could affect bone morphology, mineralization, and strength without negatively influencing welfare and meat quality. Male broilers were raised from d 1 after hatching until 42 d of age and randomly assigned to treatment groups for silicon supplementation in water: Control (no supplement, C; n = 125), Normal (0.011 ml supplement/kg bodyweight, N; n = 125) and High (0.063 ml supplement/kg bodyweight, H; n = 125). Toe damage, footpad dermatitis, hock burn, and keel blisters were assessed on d 42. Blood samples were collected from wing veins for serum osteocalcin, pyridinoline cross-links, and mineral analysis. Clinical QCT scans and analysis were conducted immediately before four-point bending tests of tibias. Texture analysis was performed on cooked fillets. Silicon supplementation tended to increase daily water consumption in N and H as compared to C ( P = 0.07). Footpad dermatitis and hock burn scores were higher in H than in N or C ( P &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). Supplementation altered serum minerals ( P &lt; 0.001), but bone density, morphology, and strength measures were similar among groups. The highest level of supplementation in the current study on a kg bodyweight basis was above recommended intakes but below previous amounts demonstrating silicon’s positive influence on bone, indicating that previously suggested minimum thresholds need to be reevaluated. Factors such as growth rate and mechanical loading likely play a greater role in developing bone quality than trying to supplement on top of good basic nutrition alone."

Animals were sacrificed at 7- and 14-days post-Ad injection. Fibrosis, histopathological features, serum creatinine (sCr), BUN, and renal mRNA expression of αSMA, Col-1α, TGF-β1, CTGF, BMP7, IL-1, TNFα, VEGF and PAX2 were analyzed. Interestingly, AdhMMP8 administration resulted in cognate human MMP8 protein detection in both kidneys, whereas hMMP8 mRNA was detected only in the left kidney. AdhMMP8 significantly reduced kidney tubule-interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Also, tubular atrophy and interstitial inflammation were clearly decreased rendering improved histopathology, and down regulation of profibrogenic genes expression. Functionally, sCr and BUN were positively modified. The results showed that AdhMMP8 decreased renal fibrosis, suggesting that MMP8 could be a possible therapeutic candidate for kidney fibrosis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3107541586,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is a class of metalloenzyme that cleaves peptide bonds in extracellular matrices. Their functions are important in both health and disease of animals. Here using quantum mechanics simulations of the MMP8 protein, the coordination chemistry of different metal cofactors is examined. Structural comparisons reveal that Jhan-Teller effects induced by Cu(II) coordination distorts the wild-type MMP8 active site corresponding to a significant reduction in activity observed in previous experiments. In addition, further analysis suggests that a histidine to glutamine mutation at residue number 197 can potentially allow the MMP8 protein to utilize Cu(II) in reactions. Simulations also demonstrates the requirement of a conformational change in the ligand before enzymatic cleavage. The insights provided here will assist future protein engineering efforts utilizing the MMP8 protein."
https://openalex.org/W3108732697,"We have developed a novel methodology for the delivery of cell-impermeable molecules, based on electrical short-circuiting via a water droplet in dielectric oil. When a cell suspension droplet is placed between a pair of electrodes with an intense DC electric field, droplet bouncing and droplet deformation, which results in an instantaneous short-circuit, can be induced, depending on the electric field strength. We have demonstrated successful transfection of various mammalian cells using the short-circuiting; however, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, flow cytometric assays were performed with Jurkat cells. An aqueous droplet containing Jurkat cells and plasmids carrying fluorescent proteins was treated with droplet bouncing or short-circuiting. The short-circuiting resulted in sufficient cell viability and fluorescent protein expression after 24 hours’ incubation. In contrast, droplet bouncing did not result in successful gene transfection. Transient membrane pore formation was investigated by uptake of a cell-impermeable fluorescence dye YO-PRO-1 and the influx of calcium ions. As a result, short-circuiting increased YO-PRO-1 fluorescence intensity and intracellular calcium ion concentration, but droplet bouncing did not. We also investigated the contribution of endocytosis to the transfection. The pre-treatment of cells with endocytosis inhibitors decreased the efficiency of gene transfection in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, the use of pH-sensitive dye conjugates indicated the formation of an acidic environment in the endosomes after the short-circuiting. Endocytosis is a possible mechanism for the intracellular delivery of exogenous DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3110202172,"The integrated counseling and testing center (ICTC) located in the district hospital, Unnao in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India witnessed an increased detection of HIV among its attendees in July 2017. Subsequently, health camps were organized by the UP State AIDS Control Society in the villages and townships contributing to such detection. We conducted a case-control study to identify factors associated with this increased detection; 33 cases and 125 controls were enrolled. Cases were individuals, detected HIV sero-reactive during November 2017-April 2018 from three locations namely Premganj, Karimuddinpur and Chakmeerapur in the Bangarmau block of the district of Unnao. Controls hailed from the same geographical setting and tested HIV sero-nonreactive either in health camps or at ICTC centers from where the cases were detected. Misclassification bias was avoided by confirming HIV sero-status of both cases as well as controls prior to final analysis. Study participants were interviewed on various risk practices and invasive treatment procedures. They were also tested for HIV and other bio-markers reflecting unsafe injecting and sexual exposures such as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV antibody (HCV Ab), anti-herpes simplex-2 Immunoglobulin G (HSV-2 IgG) and rapid plasma regain (RPR) test for syphilis. Secondary data analysis on three time points during 2015 through 2018 revealed a rising trend of HIV among attendees of the ICTCs (ICTC-Hasanganj, ICTC-Unnao district hospital and ICTC- Nawabganj) catering to the entire district of Unnao. While there was a seven fold rise of HIV among ICTC attendees of Hasanganj (χ 2 value for trend 23.83; p &lt; 0.001), the rise in Unnao district hospital was twofold (χ 2 value for trend 4.37; p &lt; 0.05) and was tenfold at ICTC-Nawabganj (χ 2 value for trend 5.23; p &lt; 0.05) indicating risk of infection prevailing throughout the district. Primary data was generated through interviews and laboratory investigations as mentioned above. The median age of cases and controls was 50 year (minimum 18 –maximum 68; IQR 31–57) and 38 year (minimum 18 –maximum 78; IQR 29–50) respectively. Thirty six percent of the cases and 47% of controls were male. A significantly higher proportion of cases (85%) had HCV Ab compared to controls (56%; OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.5–12.1); none reported injection drug use. However, cases and controls did not differ significantly regarding presence of HSV-2 IgG (6% versus 8% respectively). Neither any significant difference existed between cases and controls in terms of receiving blood transfusion, undergoing invasive surgical procedures, tattooing, tonsuring of head or skin piercing. In multivariate logistic regression model, ‘unsafe injection exposure during treatment-seeking’(AOR 6.61, 95% CI 1.80–24.18) and ‘receipt of intramuscular injection in last five years’ (AOR 7.20, 95% CI 1.48–34.88) were independently associated with HIV sero-reactive status. The monophyletic clustering of HIV sequences from 14 cases (HIV-1 pol gene amplified) indicated a common ancestry. Availability of auto-disabled syringes and needles, empowerment of the local communities and effective regulatory practices across care settings would serve as important intervention measures in this context."
https://openalex.org/W3110438002,"Owing to its ability to form biofilms, Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for an increasing number of infections on implantable medical devices. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model using microbeads coated with S . aureus biofilm to simulate such infections and to analyse the dynamics of anti-biofilm inflammatory responses by intravital imaging. Scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry were used in vitro to study the ability of an mCherry fluorescent strain of S . aureus to coat silica microbeads. Biofilm-coated microbeads were then inoculated intradermally into the ear tissue of LysM-EGFP transgenic mice (EGFP fluorescent immune cells). General and specific real-time inflammatory responses were studied in ear tissue by confocal microscopy at early (4-6h) and late time points (after 24h) after injection. The displacement properties of immune cells were analysed. The responses were compared with those obtained in control mice injected with only microbeads. In vitro , our protocol was capable of generating reproducible inocula of biofilm-coated microbeads verified by labelling matrix components, observing biofilm ultrastructure and confirmed in vivo and in situ with a matrix specific fluorescent probe. In vivo , a major inflammatory response was observed in the mouse ear pinna at both time points. Real-time observations of cell recruitment at injection sites showed that immune cells had difficulty in accessing biofilm bacteria and highlighted areas of direct interaction. The average speed of cells was lower in infected mice compared to control mice and in tissue areas where direct contact between immune cells and bacteria was observed, the average cell velocity and linearity were decreased in comparison to cells in areas where no bacteria were visible. This model provides an innovative way to analyse specific immune responses against biofilm infections on medical devices. It paves the way for live evaluation of the effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapies combined with antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3107705927,"Thinking about counterfactual conditionals such as “if she had not painted the sheet of paper, it would have been blank” requires us to consider what is conjectured (She did not paint and the sheet was blank) and what actually happened (She painted and the sheet was not blank). In two experiments with adults (Study 1) and schoolchildren from 7 to 13 years (Study 2), we tested three potential sources of difficulty with counterfactuals: inferring, distinguishing what is real vs conjectured (epistemic status) and comprehending linguistic conditional expressions (“if” vs “even if”). The results showed that neither adults nor schoolchildren had difficulty in the comprehension of counterfactual expressions such as “even if” with respect to “if then”. The ability to infer with both of these develops during school years, with adults showing great ability. However, the third source factor is critical: we found that the key to young children’s difficulty with counterfactual thinking was their inability to differentiate real and conjectured information, while adults showed little difficulty with this."
https://openalex.org/W3108232803,"Sugars act not only as substrates for plant metabolism, but also have a pivotal role in signaling pathways. Glucose signaling has been widely studied in the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana , but it has remained unexplored in non-vascular species such as Physcomitrella patens . To investigate P . patens response to high glucose treatment, we explored the dynamic changes in metabolism and protein population by applying a metabolomic fingerprint analysis (DIESI-MS), carbohydrate and chlorophyll quantification, Fv/Fm determination and label-free untargeted proteomics. Glucose feeding causes specific changes in P . patens metabolomic fingerprint, carbohydrate contents and protein accumulation, which is clearly different from those of osmotically induced responses. The maximal rate of PSII was not affected although chlorophyll decreased in both treatments. The biological process, cellular component, and molecular function gene ontology (GO) classifications of the differentially expressed proteins indicate the translation process is the most represented category in response to glucose, followed by photosynthesis, cellular response to oxidative stress and protein refolding. Importantly, although several proteins have high fold changes, these proteins have no predicted identity. The most significant discovery of our study at the proteome level is that high glucose increase abundance of proteins related to the translation process, which was not previously evidenced in non-vascular plants, indicating that regulation by glucose at the translational level is a partially conserved response in both plant lineages. To our knowledge, this is the first time that metabolome fingerprint and proteomic analyses are performed after a high sugar treatment in non-vascular plants. These findings unravel evolutionarily shared and differential responses between vascular and non-vascular plants."
https://openalex.org/W3110481194,"In the pursuit of a novel class of fluorescent dyes we have developed a programmable polymer system that enables the rational design and control of macromolecular constructs through simple control of polymer primary sequence. These polymers are assembled using standard phosphoramidite chemistry on a DNA synthesizer which allows for extremely rapid prototyping and enables many permutations due to the large selection of phosphoramidite monomers presently available on the market. This programmability to some extent allows us to control the interactions/spacing of payload molecules distributed along the designed polymeric backbone. Control of molecular architecture using this technology has allowed us to address the long-standing technical issue of contact quenching between fluorescent dyes offering new possibilities in the life sciences arena. Much like peptidic sequences coding for enzymes, cofactors, and receptors (all needing control of tertiary structure for proper function via primary sequence) our programmable system approaches a similar endpoint using a phosphate based polymeric backbone assembled in a completely automated fashion. Using this novel technology, we have efficiently synthesized several types of fluorescent dyes and demonstrated the programmability in molecule design, including the increases in brightness of the fluorescence emission."
