Addition of nonradioactive serotonin to preparations in vitro caused a net release of radioactive serotonin from the plexus. This release appeared to result from activity in the intramural nervous system of the intestine. A neurotransmitter role between sensory and motor neurons in the peristaltic reflex pathway is suggested as a working hypothesis to explain the action of serotonin."

https://openalex.org/W16013122,"In 1963, the existence of two isozymes of alanine aminotransferase (Galanine : 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.2) was still somewhat in doubt. Hird and Rowsell (2) reported that alanine aminotransferase was present in the particulate fraction as well as in the soluble phase of rat liver homogenates, and they speculated that the activity was of mitochondrial origin. However, in studies of the release of aminotransferases into serum following liver injury, Fleisher and Wakim (3), using electrophoresis, found only a single alanine aminotransferase, although they discerned both isozymes of aspartate aminotransferase. Segal, Beattie, and Hopper (4), in an extensive study of hepatic alanine aminotransferase, detected only a soluble form of the enzyme. Nevertheless, reports of the existence of a mitochondrial enzyme continue to be published. Kafer and Pollak (5) found 20% of the total alanine aminotransferase activity of liver homogenates in the mitochondrial fraction, and Katunuma et al. (6) reported finding 157,. Rowsell, Turner, and Carnie (7) subsequently found only 4 to 57, of the total activity in the particulate fraction. 13ecause of the disparity of these results, we chose to re-examine the question of the mitochondrial isozyme of alanine aminotransferase. Fractional and gradient centrifugation experiments indicated that the enzyme was present in the mitochondrial as well as in the supernatant fraction, albeit in relatively low concentration. An attempt was therefore made to enrich the isozymes and to characterize them chemically. Purification of alanine aminotransferase from a rat liver homogenate was described by Segal et al. (4), and we encountered little difficulty in repeating their experiments with the enzyme found in the supernatant fraction. More recently, Hopper and Segal (8) recorded attempts to study the mitochondrial enzyme from rat liver with results similar to ours. The enzyme is extremely labile under most conditions, and little enrichment has been achieved. The present report describes the solubilization of mitochondrial alanine aminotransferase by treatment with glycerol or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and its stabilization by glycerol and related compounds. Estimates of the kinetic parameters have been made with the use of such rela"

https://openalex.org/W129108640,"Human erythrocytes contain three distinct forms of carbonic anhydrase (carbonate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.1) which have been denoted as A, B, and C (l-3). In a previous study (4) one of us has investigated the hydrogen ion equilibria of carbonic anhydrase B at ionic strength 0.15. Here we report similar studies on enzyme C at two diierent ionic strengths, and further studies of enzyme B at low ionic strength (0.05). The two enzymes differ markedly in catalytic activity, the specific activity of enzyme C being much higher than that of enzyme B (5). In some respects they also differ markedly in amino acid composition. They are indeed closely alike in their content of histidine, arginine, and aromatic amino acids; each contains only one cysteine residue, and there are no disullide bonds in either (1, 6, 7).’ However, enzyme C contains distinctly more lysine than B, and also its content of ionizable carboxyl groups is somewhat higher. Correspondingly, the isoelectric point of enzyme C (pH 7.3) is higher than that of B, which is 5.7 (1). The minor component, enzyme A, which will not concern us further here, is almost indistinguishable from enzyme B in amino acid composition, although its isoelectric point appears to be slightly lower (1, 6). In optical rotatory dispersion studies both enzymes B and C show characteristic Cotton effects between 260 and 300 mp, which disappear on denaturation. The dispersion patterns for the two native enzymes show a certain broad general similarity but differ in detail (8). The previous titration study of enzyme B (1) showed that most of the histidyl and tyrosyl residues are masked in the native protein and become reactive only after denaturation in acid or alkali (4). Studies of difference spectra between the native and the acid-denatured enzymes B and C suggest that most or all of the tryptophanyl residues in the native protein are in the int.erior of the native molecules, and come into contact with the"

https://openalex.org/W1971180514,"THE pathogenicity, in the classic sense, of bacterial L-phase cells has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. The association of the L-phase of certain bacteria with diverse clinical states has been noted in the past, and this association is being reported more frequently as knowledge and interest in these forms have increased1–9. Such reported investigations lead to the assumption that host resistance mechanisms tend to create the L-phase of a bacterium. Experiments designed to determine the possible pathogenicity of the bacterial L-phase have usually ignored the host. It is not unreasonable to assume that the L-phase is the bacterial form most readily handled by normal host resistance mechanisms."

The optical rotations of the N-acetyl derivatives of the enzymatically synthesized prod- ucts are equal and opposite to those of the corresponding L enzyme surface, replacement of the (Y hydrogen atom of n-glutamic acid by a methyl group would be expected to interfere with its attachment to the enzyme, while similar substitution of the 01 hydrogen atom of L-glutamic acid would not. isomers, which were obtained from 3-L-acetylamino-4-carbo- ethoxylbutanoic acid. The ability of glutamine synthetase to distinguish between the carboxyl groups of ,8-glutamic acid is considered in relation to other data on specificity of this en- zyme. A tentative explanation is proposed for the findings based on spatial similarity between extended conformations of L-glutamine and n-fi-glutamine. Acknowledgments-We are indebted to Dr. Daniel Wellner for many stimulating discussions and to Dr. Vaira Wellner Miss Joyce Tenczar for the purified glutamine synthetase used in these studies.

A number of kinetic studies have been made of this reaction (2-5). The over-all reaction is generally stated to be “irreversible” (2, 3, 6, 7); however, no estimates of the equilib- rium constant have appeared in the literature. In fact, very little thermodynamic data related to cytidine 2’,3’-cyclic phos- phate and cytidine 3’-phosphate are available although the usefulness of such data is readily apparent. In the present study, the equilibrium constant of the hy- drolysis reaction has been determined by two independent methods. The first method utilizes the thermodynamic cycle librium constant utilizes radioactive tracers: is added to a solution of cytidine 3’-phosphate-%, and, after equilibrium has been est.ablished, the concentration of cytidine 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate-% present. is determined by the isotope dilution technique. From a knowledge of the equilibrium constant and the steady state kinetic parameters of the forward reaction some of the steady state kinetic parameters characterizing the reverse re- action can be calculated."

https://openalex.org/W2025460725,"Two homologous lightly coupled dinitrophenyl conjugates of poly-L-lysine of differing average molecular sizes were compared with regard to their abilities to elicit in guinea pigs specific delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and active Arthus reactions. Equal concentrations by weight (but not equimolar concentrations) of the two conjugates elicited equally intense delayed hypersensitivity reactions and Arthus reactions, whereas equimolar concentrations (but not equal weightconcentrations) elicited equally intense passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions. These results suggest that delayed hypersensitivity reactions are initiated by the reaction of antigen with antibody molecules in true solution, and not by the simple bridging by antigen of a small number of antibody molecules firmly fixed to cell membrane surfaces. Whether ""sensitized cells"" or circulating ""delayed hypersensitivity antibodies"" are the specific mediators of the delayed hypersensitivity reactions is discussed."
