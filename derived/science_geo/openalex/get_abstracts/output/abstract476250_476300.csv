https://openalex.org/W2120183938,"Background Zooplankton play an important role in our oceans, in biogeochemical cycling and providing a food source for commercially important fish larvae. However, difficulties in correctly identifying zooplankton hinder our understanding of their roles in marine ecosystem functioning, and can prevent detection of long term changes in their community structure. The advent of massively parallel next generation sequencing technology allows DNA sequence data to be recovered directly from whole community samples. Here we assess the ability of such sequencing to quantify richness and diversity of a mixed zooplankton assemblage from a productive time series site in the Western English Channel. Methodology/Principle Findings Plankton net hauls (200 µm) were taken at the Western Channel Observatory station L4 in September 2010 and January 2011. These samples were analysed by microscopy and metagenetic analysis of the 18S nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene using the 454 pyrosequencing platform. Following quality control a total of 419,041 sequences were obtained for all samples. The sequences clustered into 205 operational taxonomic units using a 97% similarity cut-off. Allocation of taxonomy by comparison with the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database identified 135 OTUs to species level, 11 to genus level and 1 to order, <2.5% of sequences were classified as unknowns. By comparison a skilled microscopic analyst was able to routinely enumerate only 58 taxonomic groups. Conclusions Metagenetics reveals a previously hidden taxonomic richness, especially for Copepoda and hard-to-identify meroplankton such as Bivalvia, Gastropoda and Polychaeta. It also reveals rare species and parasites. We conclude that Next Generation Sequencing of 18S amplicons is a powerful tool for elucidating the true diversity and species richness of zooplankton communities. While this approach allows for broad diversity assessments of plankton it may become increasingly attractive in future if sequence reference libraries of accurately identified individuals are better populated."
https://openalex.org/W2022921936,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the pathology time course of the LRRK2 knockout rat model of Parkinson’s disease at 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-months of age. The evaluation consisted of histopathology and ultrastructure examination of selected organs, including the kidneys, lungs, spleen, heart, and liver, as well as hematology, serum, and urine analysis. The LRRK2 knockout rat, starting at 2-months of age, displayed abnormal kidney staining patterns and/or morphologic changes that were associated with higher serum phosphorous, creatinine, cholesterol, and sorbitol dehydrogenase, and lower serum sodium and chloride compared to the LRRK2 wild-type rat. Urinalysis indicated pronounced changes in LRRK2 knockout rats in urine specific gravity, total volume, urine potassium, creatinine, sodium, and chloride that started as early as 1- to 2-months of age. Electron microscopy of 16-month old LRRK2 knockout rats displayed an abnormal kidney, lung, and liver phenotype. In contrast, there were equivocal or no differences in the heart and spleen of LRRK2 wild-type and knockout rats. These findings partially replicate data from a recent study in 4-month old LRRK2 knockout rats [1] and expand the analysis to demonstrate that the renal and possibly lung and liver abnormalities progress with age. The characterization of LRRK2 knockout rats may prove to be extremely valuable in understanding potential safety liabilities of LRRK2 kinase inhibitor therapeutics for treating Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2043698418,"A variable proportion of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) have autoantibodies to muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). During development agrin, released from the motor nerve, interacts with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4 (LRP4), which then binds to MuSK; MuSK interaction with the intracellular protein Dok7 results in clustering of the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane. In mature muscle, MuSK helps maintain the high density of AChRs at the neuromuscular junction. MuSK antibodies are mainly IgG4 subclass, which does not activate complement and can be monovalent, thus it is not clear how the antibodies cause disruption of AChR numbers or function to cause MG. We hypothesised that MuSK antibodies either reduce surface MuSK expression and/or inhibit the interaction with LRP4. We prepared MuSK IgG, monovalent Fab fragments, IgG1-3 and IgG4 fractions from MuSK-MG plasmas. We asked whether the antibodies caused endocytosis of MuSK in MuSK-transfected cells or if they inhibited binding of LRP4 to MuSK in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In parallel, we investigated their ability to reduce AChR clusters in C2C12 myotubes induced by a) agrin, reflecting neuromuscular development, and b) by Dok7- overexpression, producing AChR clusters that more closely resemble the adult neuromuscular synapse. Total IgG, IgG4 or IgG1-3 MuSK antibodies were not endocytosed unless cross-linked by divalent anti-human IgG. MuSK IgG, Fab fragments and IgG4 inhibited the binding of LRP4 to MuSK and reduced agrin-induced AChR clustering in C2C12 cells. By contrast, IgG1-3 antibodies did not inhibit LRP4-MuSK binding but, surprisingly, did inhibit agrin-induced clustering. Moreover, both IgG4 and IgG1-3 preparations dispersed agrin-independent AChR clusters in Dok7-overexpressing C2C12 cells. Thus interference by IgG4 antibodies of the LRP4-MuSK interaction will be one pathogenic mechanism of MuSK antibodies, but IgG1-3 MuSK antibodies will also contribute to the reduced AChR density and neuromuscular dysfunction in myasthenia patients with MuSK antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2009295409,"Campylobacteriosis is the most frequent zoonosis in developed countries and various domestic animals can function as reservoir for the main pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. In the present study we compared population structures of 730 C. jejuni and C. coli from human cases, 610 chicken, 159 dog, 360 pig and 23 cattle isolates collected between 2001 and 2012 in Switzerland. All isolates had been typed with multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and flaB-typing and their genotypic resistance to quinolones was determined. We used complementary approaches by testing for differences between isolates from different hosts with the proportion similarity as well as the fixation index and by attributing the source of the human isolates with Bayesian assignment using the software STRUCTURE. Analyses were done with MLST and flaB data in parallel and both typing methods were tested for associations of genotypes with quinolone resistance. Results obtained with MLST and flaB data corresponded remarkably well, both indicating chickens as the main source for human infection for both Campylobacter species. Based on MLST, 70.9% of the human cases were attributed to chickens, 19.3% to cattle, 8.6% to dogs and 1.2% to pigs. Furthermore we found a host independent association between sequence type (ST) and quinolone resistance. The most notable were ST-45, all isolates of which were susceptible, while for ST-464 all were resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2092100136,"Although pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by an abundant stroma enriched with hyaluronan (HA), the prognostic impact of HA and its regulators remains unknown.Using immunohistochemistry, expression patterns of HA and its regulators, including a synthesizing enzyme (HAS2), and a degrading enzyme (HYAL1) were investigated in patients who received surgical resection. The prognostic significance of these markers and other clinicopathological variables was determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. The HA levels were determined quantitatively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).We found that strong expressions of HA (P=0.008) and HAS2 (P=0.022) were significantly associated with shorter survival time after surgery. By contrast, weak expression of HYAL1 was significantly associated with poor survival (P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, tumor stage (hazard ratio (HR)=2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-6.66 P=0.024), strong HA expression (HR=6.04, 95%CI: 1.42-25.69 P=0.015), and weak HYAL1 expression (HR=3.16, 95%CI: 1.19-8.40 P=0.021) were independent factors predicting poor survival. ELISA revealed higher concentration of HA in pancreatic cancer tissues than in normal pancreatic tissues (P=0.001).These findings suggest, for the first time, that HA and its regulators may have prognostic impact in patients with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2042016774,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma found in children and young adults. It is characterized by the expression of a number of skeletal muscle-specific proteins, including MyoD and muscle α-actin. However, unlike normal myoblasts, RMS cells differentiate poorly both in vivo and in culture. As microRNAs are known to regulate tumorigenesis, intensive efforts have been made to identify microRNAs that are involved in RMS development. In this work, we found that miR-203 was frequently down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation in both RMS cell lines and RMS biopsies and could be reactivated by DNA-demethylating agents. Re-expression of miR-203 in RMS cells inhibited their migration and proliferation and promoted terminal myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, miR-203 exerts its tumor-suppressive effect by directly targeting p63 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor in RMS cells, which promotes myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the Notch and the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathways, respectively. Our work reveals that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor in RMS development."
https://openalex.org/W2024945926,"Microbes are key components of aquatic ecosystems and play crucial roles in global biogeochemical cycles. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of planktonic microbial community composition in riverine ecosystems are still poorly understood. In this study, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S and 18S rRNA gene fragments and multivariate statistical methods to explore the spatiotemporal patterns and driving factors of planktonic bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities in the subtropical Jiulong River, southeast China. Both bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities varied significantly in time and were spatially structured according to upper stream, middle-lower stream and estuary. Among all the environmental factors measured, water temperature, conductivity, PO4-P and TN/TP were best related to the spatiotemporal distribution of bacterial community, while water temperature, conductivity, NOx-N and transparency were closest related to the variation of eukaryotic community. Variation partitioning, based on partial RDA, revealed that environmental factors played the most important roles in structuring the microbial assemblages by explaining 11.3% of bacterial variation and 17.5% of eukaryotic variation. However, pure spatial factors (6.5% for bacteria and 9.6% for eukaryotes) and temporal factors (3.3% for bacteria and 5.5% for eukaryotes) also explained some variation in microbial distribution, thus inherent spatial and temporal variation of microbial assemblages should be considered when assessing the impact of environmental factors on microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2052595218,"Ras GTPases are signaling switches that control critical cellular processes including gene expression, differentiation, and apoptosis. The major Ras isoforms (K, H, and N) contain a conserved core GTPase domain, but have distinct biological functions. Among the three Ras isoforms there are clear differences in post-translational regulation, which contribute to differences in localization and signaling output. Modification by ubiquitination was recently reported to activate Ras signaling in cells, but the mechanisms of activation are not well understood. Here, we show that H-Ras is activated by monoubiquitination and that ubiquitination at Lys-117 accelerates intrinsic nucleotide exchange, thereby promoting GTP loading. This mechanism of Ras activation is distinct from K-Ras monoubiquitination at Lys-147, which leads to impaired regulator-mediated GTP hydrolysis. These findings reveal that different Ras isoforms are monoubiquitinated at distinct sites, with distinct mechanisms of action, but with a common ability to chronically activate the protein in the absence of a receptor signal or oncogenic mutation.

The small GTPase Ras is a signaling switch that regulates cellular growth and differentiation (1Herrmann C. Ras-effector interactions: After one decade.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In accord with its essential role in regulating cell growth, point mutations in Ras are common in cancer; about 30% of all human tumors contain an activating Ras mutation (2Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2009.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2009; 59: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9886) Google Scholar). To control the activation of essential pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, Ras binds and hydrolyzes GTP. Ras is active when it is GTP-bound and becomes inactive when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP (3Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J.

On its own, Ras is a poor enzyme and requires regulators to respond to cell signals on an appropriate timescale.

There are three isoforms of Ras: K-Ras (two splice variants, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B), H-Ras, and N-Ras. The core guanine nucleotide binding domain is highly conserved between these isoforms (>90% identical in the first 168 amino acids). However, despite the high sequence identity, Ras isoforms play distinct roles in regulating downstream signaling pathways. In particular, the three proteins exhibit differences in their localization in vivo, which alters access to regulatory proteins and downstream effectors (8Daniels M.A. Teixeiro E. Gill J. Hausmann B.

Another post-translational modification, phosphorylation, has been shown to modulate K-Ras signaling output by changing its localization from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria and Golgi (25Castellano E. Santos E. Functional Specificity of Ras isoforms: So similar but so different.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both lipid and phosphoryl modifications are dynamically regulated, which in turn dynamically controls Ras localization and activity (25Castellano E. Santos E. Functional Specificity of Ras isoforms: So similar but so different.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Aside from lipidation and phosphorylation, there is mounting evidence that ubiquitination also contributes to the differentiation between Ras isoforms (26Jura N. Scotto-Lavino E. Sobczyk A. Bar-Sagi D. Differential modification of Ras proteins by ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 679-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of an as yet unidentified site in H-Ras promotes its association with the endosome (26Jura N. Scotto-Lavino E. Sobczyk A. Bar-Sagi D.

Functional Specificity of Ras isoforms: So similar but so different.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that monoubiquitination of Lys-147 in K-Ras does not appear to affect protein localization, but rather acts as a reversible trigger for signal initiation (28Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C.

Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination of K-Ras at this position impedes GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis and promotes association with select downstream effectors (28Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C. Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors.Sci.

Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This mechanism of K-Ras activation appears specific to ubiquitination at Lys-147 because modification of other lysines does not confer a GAP defect (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W. Cantley L.C. Kuhlman B. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, H-Ras and K-Ras display differential regulation by ubiquitination. In addition to Lys-147, Sasaki et al. (28Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C. Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have identified Lys-117 as a site of ubiquitination in H-Ras and Lys-104 as a secondary site of ubiquitination in K-Ras. Thus, we postulated that different sites of H- and K-Ras ubiquitination have distinct consequences for Ras activity. Here, we show that monoubiquitination at Lys-104 does not affect nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis properties of Ras, whereas modification at Lys-117 promotes Ras activation. However, in this case, the mechanism of activation is unique. Although monoubiquitination of K-Ras at Lys-147 inhibits GAP-mediated hydrolysis, monoubiquitination of H-Ras at Lys-117 greatly enhances GTP-GDP exchange. These findings reveal that K-Ras and H-Ras can each be activated by monoubiquitination, but that activation occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms. All Ras constructs were generated with a C118S mutation to eliminate a native solvent exposed cysteine, as described previously (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W.

Briefly, 2 μm RasK104C, mUbRasK104, RasK117C, or mUbRasK117 was incubated with 1 mm 4-fluoro-7-aminosulfonylbenzofurazan (AnaSpec) at pH 7.0 in the presence of 20 μm GTPγS and 2 mm MgCl2 in a gradient thermocycler (Biometra TProfessional thermocycler) at the desired temperature for 3 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.02 n HCl (final concentration). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech) with excitation and emission band-pass filters of 400 and 500 nm. The highest fluorescence for each unfolding curve was normalized to one after base lines were corrected for differences in background fluorescence. Data were fit using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA) to determine the melting temperature (Tm) for each construct. For the RasK104C and mUbRasK104 variants, the N-methylanthraniloyl (MANT)-GDP nucleotide dissociation assay was performed as described previously (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W. Cantley L.C. Kuhlman B. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The assay was adapted for RasK117C and mUbRasK117 as follows. Ras protein was exchanged into MANT nucleotide exchange buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). MANT-GDP (0.5 μm) was added to 1 μm of protein in the cuvette. The Ras protein was determined to be fully loaded when the fluorescence of the spectra no longer increased, ∼500 s. Unlabeled GDP (final concentration of 100 μm) was added to initiate dissociation. Soscat was mixed with H-Ras at a 1:1 molar ratio. MANT-GDP dissociation was measured as a change in fluorescence intensity over time (excitation: 360 nm, emission: 440 nm) (LS50B PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer). Fluorescence data were fit in GraphPad Prism to a one-phase exponential decay curve to determine rates of nucleotide release. Single turnover nucleotide hydrolysis assays were performed as described in Baker et al. (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W. Cantley L.C. Kuhlman B. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ratio of fluorescence emission was measured at 480 and 530 nm with an excitation of 435 nm on a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence ratios were converted to phosphate concentrations using a standard curve. The measured rates of phosphate release over time were fit in GraphPad Prism to a one-phase exponential association curve. Due to limitations associated with instability of RasK117C and mUbRasK117, GTP hydrolysis was measured in the presence of excess GTP (multiple turnover). Ras was exchanged (20-fold dilution and concentrated three times) into phosphate-free buffer with 5 mm EDTA. For intrinsic hydrolysis, 20 μm Ras was mixed with 60 μm GTP, and hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of magnesium. For GAP-mediated hydrolysis, GAP-334, at concentrations ranging from 0.0625 to 8 μm, was added to the reaction. The phosphate-binding protein Flippi 5U (Addgene) was used to detect inorganic phosphate released upon GTP hydrolysis (33Gu H. Lalonde S. Okumoto S. Looger L.L. Scharff-Poulsen A.M. Grossman A.R. Kossmann J. Jakobsen I. Frommer W.B. A novel analytical method for in vivo phosphate tracking.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5885-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission was measured as a ratio at 480 and 530 nm and an excitation of 435 nm (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices). Fluorescence ratios were converted to a phosphate concentration using a standard curve. Data from the first 10 min of hydrolysis were fit in GraphPad Prism to a linear regression and the resulting rates were plotted as a function of GAP concentration. The pHinder algorithm was used to calculate a surface between Ras and the catalytic domains of Sos and p120GAP. Information on the triangulation used to define the surface has been described elsewhere (34Isom D.G. Sridharan V. Baker R. Clement S.T. Smalley D.M. Dohlman H.G. Protons as second messenger regulators of G protein signaling.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 531-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residues were considered to be part of the interaction surface if they were less than 6 Å apart. Interaction surfaces were determined from the crystal structures of Ras with Sos (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1BKD) and Ras with p120GAP (PDB 1WQ1). Ras activation was measured as described previously (28Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C. Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The constructs FLAG-His-H-Ras or the mutant FLAG-His-H-RasK117N were co-expressed with HA-ubiquitin in HEK293T cells. The cells were prepared and lysed as described previously (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W. Cantley L.C. Kuhlman B. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For assays conducted in the presence of either Soscat or p120GAP, the catalytic domains were purified from bacterially produced protein and incubated with the cell lysate for 20 min at room temperature. The effect of the regulators on the population of active Ras or mUbRas was assessed by immunoblotting using GST-Raf-RBD (Ras binding domain) to detect active Ras. For the Soscat assay, 25 μm of GTPγS was added during the incubation. Samples were prepared from SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen, NuPAGE), and Ras was detected by varying exposure times. It was recently shown that H-Ras can be monoubiquitinated at Lys-117 (28Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C. Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Lysine 117 is part of the conserved NKXD motif that contributes to nucleotide affinity and specificity by forming interactions with the guanine nucleotide base and ribose (Fig. 1A) (35Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. The guanine nucleotide-binding switch in three dimensions.Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Conservative mutations at Lys-117 (K117R and K117N) are present in human cancers and developmental disorders and lead to Ras activation by reducing nucleotide binding affinity, resulting in increased rates of nucleotide exchange (36Schubbert S. Bollag G. Lyubynska N. Nguyen H. Kratz C.P. Zenker M. Niemeyer C.M. Molven A. Shannon K. Biochemical and functional characterization of germ line KRAS mutations.Mol. Cell.

The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.Science. 2006; 314: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). Given these observations, we postulated that ubiquitination of Lys-117 is likely to disrupt interactions between the lysine and the guanine nucleotide base and activate Ras by a mechanism similar to mutation at the same site. We chemically ubiquitinated Ras at position 117 (mUbRasK117) using a cysteine ligation approach reported by us previously (Fig. 1B) (29Baker R. Lewis S.M. Sasaki A.T. Wilkerson E.M. Locasale J.W. Cantley L.C. Kuhlman B. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Site-specific monoubiquitination activates Ras by impeding GTPase-activating protein function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutation at a nearby site in the conserved NKXD motif, Asp-119, reduces protein stability and increases the rate of nucleotide exchange (39Schmidt G. Lenzen C. Simon I. Deuter R. Cool R.H. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemical and biological consequences of changing the specificity of p21Ras from guanosine to xanthosine nucleotides.Oncogene. 1996; 12: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether perturbations at Lys-117 could also alter protein stability. We measured the thermal stability of Ras using the fQCR assay (32Isom D.G. Marguet P.R. Oas T.G. Hellinga H.W. A miniaturized technique for assessing protein thermodynamics and function using fast determination of quantitative cysteine reactivity.Proteins. 2011; 79: 1034-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This assay measures protein unfolding as a function of temperature and chemical labeling of exposed cysteines. Because ubiquitin does not contain native cysteines, fQCR can be used to specifically determine whether ubiquitination affects Ras thermal stability. We found that mUbRasK117 retains the thermal stability observed for unmodified Ras (Fig. 1C) (Tm = 52.5 ± 0.5 °C). However, ubiquitination at Lys-117 is distinct from a RasK117C mutation, which leads to a 10° decrease in the thermal stability of Ras (RasK117C Tm = 43.8 ± 0.9 °C). Relative to unmodified Ras, RasK117C and mUbRasK117C exhibited less cooperative unfolding transitions (Fig. 1C) and increased rates of nucleotide dissociation (Fig. 1D). We attribute this correlation to loss of a key interaction (Lys-117) that impairs nucleotide binding, resulting in reduced cooperativity of the unfolding transition (40Zhang J. Matthews C.R. Ligand binding is the principal determinant of stability for the p21H-ras protein.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14881-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although either ubiquitination or mutation of Ras at position 117 alters the lysine side chain, which is crucial for forming interactions with the guanine nucleotide, these distinct alterations differentially affect the thermal stability of Ras. We next measured the effect of monoubiquitination on the rate of guanine nucleotide dissociation. We find that the intrinsic rate of nucleotide dissociation was 70-fold faster for mUbRasK117 as compared with unmodified Ras (8.3 ± 0.3 × 10−3 s−1) (Fig. 1D). This finding is consistent with the 100-fold increased rate of nucleotide release observed when Ras is mutated (RasK117C) at this same position (11.0 ± 0.4 × 10−1 s−1) (Fig. 1D). We also observed a small increase in GDP dissociation for mUbRasK117 in the presence of the GEF, Soscat, indicating that the nucleotide release can be further stimulated by GEFs. Even in the absence of GEF-mediated activation, the increased rate of intrinsic nucleotide dissociation should be sufficient to promote GTP exchange and mUbRasK117 activation in vivo (41Denayer E.

https://openalex.org/W2159601903,"Social functioning depends on the ability to attribute and reason about the mental states of others – an ability known as theory of mind (ToM). Research in this field is limited by the use of tasks in which ceiling effects are ubiquitous, rendering them insensitive to individual differences in ToM ability and instances of subtle ToM impairment. Here, we present data from a new ToM task – the Short Story Task (SST) - intended to improve upon many aspects of existing ToM measures. More specifically, the SST was designed to: (a) assess the full range of individual differences in ToM ability without suffering from ceiling effects; (b) incorporate a range of mental states of differing complexity, including epistemic states, affective states, and intentions to be inferred from a first- and second-order level; (c) use ToM stimuli representative of real-world social interactions; (d) require participants to utilize social context when making mental state inferences; (e) exhibit adequate psychometric properties; and (f) be quick and easy to administer and score. In the task, participants read a short story and were asked questions that assessed explicit mental state reasoning, spontaneous mental state inference, and comprehension of the non-mental aspects of the story. Responses were scored according to a rubric that assigned greater points for accurate mental state attributions that included multiple characters’ mental states. Results demonstrate that the SST is sensitive to variation in ToM ability, can be accurately scored by multiple raters, and exhibits concurrent validity with other social cognitive tasks. The results support the effectiveness of this new measure of ToM in the study of social cognition. The findings are also consistent with studies demonstrating significant relationships among narrative transportation, ToM, and the reading of fiction. Together, the data indicate that reading fiction may be an avenue for improving ToM ability."

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric analyses were employed to determine the metabolite profile of tea including the concentrations of artemisinin (47.5±0.8 mg L(-1)), dihydroartemisinic acid (70.0±0.3 mg L(-1)), arteannuin B (1.3±0.0 mg L(-1)), isovitexin (105.0±7.2 mg L(-1)) and a range of polyphenolic acids. The tea extract, purified compounds from the extract, and the combination of artemisinin with the purified compounds were tested against chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum using the DNA-intercalative SYBR Green I assay. The results of these in vitro tests and of isobologram analyses of combination effects showed mild to strong antagonistic interactions between artemisinin and the compounds (9-epi-artemisinin and artemisitene) extracted from A. annua with significant (IC50 <1 μM) anti-plasmodial activities for the combination range evaluated. Mono-caffeoylquinic acids, tri-caffeoylquinic acid, artemisinic acid and arteannuin B showed additive interaction while rosmarinic acid showed synergistic interaction with artemisinin in the chloroquine sensitive strain at a combination ratio of 1:3 (artemisinin to purified compound). In the chloroquine resistant parasite, using the same ratio, these compounds strongly antagonised artemisinin anti-plasmodial activity with the exception of arteannuin B, which was synergistic. This result would suggest a mechanism targeting parasite resistance defenses for arteannuin B's potentiation of artemisinin."
https://openalex.org/W2002463728,"Current and predicted environmental change will force many organisms to adapt to novel conditions, especially sessile organisms such as plants. It is therefore important to better understand how plants react to environmental stress and to what extent genotypes differ in such responses. It has been proposed that adaptation to novel conditions could be facilitated by heritable epigenetic changes induced by environmental stress, independent of genetic variation. Here we assessed phenotypic effects of heat and salt stress within and across three generations using four highly inbred Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes (Col, Cvi, Ler and Sha). Salt stress generally decreased fitness, but genotypes were differently affected, suggesting that susceptibility of A. thaliana to salt stress varies among genotypes. Heat stress at an early rosette stage had less detrimental effects but accelerated flowering in three out of four accessions. Additionally, we found three different modes of transgenerational effects on phenotypes, all harboring the potential of being adaptive: heat stress in previous generations induced faster rosette growth in Sha, both under heat and control conditions, resembling a tracking response, while in Cvi, the phenotypic variance of several traits increased, resembling diversified bet-hedging. Salt stress experienced in earlier generations altered plant architecture of Sha under salt but not control conditions, similar to transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. However, transgenerational phenotypic effects depended on the type of stress as well as on genotype, suggesting that such effects may not be a general response leading to adaptation to novel environmental conditions in A. thaliana."

In vitro, four GBM lines (U87, U251, 22T, and 33T) demonstrated reduced proliferation 24 hours after transient miR100 overexpression via transfection. miR-100 triggered cell death an average 70% more than scrambled miR controls 24 hours after transient transfection (p < 0.01). miR-100 targeted inhibition of the “silencing mediator of retinoid or thyroid hormone receptor-2” (SMRT/NCOR2) gene was confirmed via reporter assays. Ki67 proliferation index was decreased 40% in tumor xenografts generated from stable miR-100 transfected GBM lines versus controls (p < 0.01). Furthermore, treatment of tumor xenografts with a single pre-mir-100 injection (60 pmol) significantly extended survival of mice bearing intracranial GBM xenografts 25% more than scrambled controls (p < 0.01; n=8).

The changes in the female body during the menstrual cycle can also be reflected in plasma miRNA expression levels. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the plasma miRNA profile of healthy women during the menstrual cycle and to assess which circulating miRNAs are derived from blood cells. The plasma miRNA expression profiles in nine healthy women were determined by quantitative real time PCR using Exiqon Human Panel I assays from four time-points of the menstrual cycle. This platform was also used for studying miRNAs from pooled whole blood RNA samples at the same four time-points. Our results indicated that circulating miRNA expression levels in healthy women were not significantly altered by the processes occurring during the menstrual cycle. No significant differences in plasma miRNA expression levels were observed between the menstrual cycle time-points, but the number of detected miRNAs showed considerable variation among the studied individuals. miRNA analysis from whole blood samples revealed that majority of miRNAs in plasma are derived from blood cells. The most abundant miRNA in plasma and blood was hsa-miR-451a, but a number of miRNAs were only detected in one or the other sample type. In conclusion, our data suggest that the changes in the female body during the menstrual cycle do not affect the expression of circulating miRNAs at measurable levels."
https://openalex.org/W2081037253,"N-α-terminal acetylation is one of the most common, but least understood modifications of eukaryotic proteins. Although a high degree of conservation exists between the N-α-terminal acetylomes of plants and animals, very little information is available on this modification in plants. In yeast and humans, N-α-acetyltransferase complexes include a single catalytic subunit and one or two auxiliary subunits. Here, we report the positional cloning of TRANSCURVATA2 (TCU2), which encodes the auxiliary subunit of the NatB N-α-acetyltransferase complex in Arabidopsis. The phenotypes of loss-of-function tcu2 alleles indicate that NatB complex activity is required for flowering time regulation and for leaf, inflorescence, flower, fruit and embryonic development. In double mutants, tcu2 alleles synergistically interact with alleles of ARGONAUTE10, which encodes a component of the microRNA machinery. In summary, NatB-mediated N-α-terminal acetylation of proteins is pleiotropically required for Arabidopsis development and seems to be functionally related to the microRNA pathway."

The human genome possesses 17 KLF genes (KLF1–KLF17) and nine SP genes (SP1–SP9) with diverse functions. We used sequence similarity searches and gene synteny analysis to identify a new putative KLF gene/pseudogene named KLF18 that is present in most of the placental mammals with sequenced genomes. KLF18 is a chromosomal neighbor of the KLF17 gene and is likely a product of its duplication. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that mammalian predicted KLF18 proteins and KLF17 proteins experienced elevated rates of evolution and are grouped with KLF1/KLF2/KLF4 and non-mammalian KLF17. Predicted KLF18 proteins maintain conserved features in the zinc fingers of the SP/KLF family, while possessing repeats of a unique sequence motif in their N-terminal regions. No expression data have been reported for KLF18, suggesting that it either has highly restricted expression patterns and specialized functions, or could have become a pseudogene in extant placental mammals. Besides KLF18 genes/pseudogenes, we identified several KLF18-like genes such as Zfp352, Zfp352-like, and Zfp353 in the genomes of mouse and rat. These KLF18-like genes do not possess introns inside their coding regions, and gene expression data indicate that some of them may function in early embryonic development. They represent further expansions of KLF members in the murine lineage, most likely resulted from several events of retrotransposition and local gene duplication starting from an ancient spliced mRNA of KLF18."
https://openalex.org/W2150319426,"As the climate warms, species that cannot tolerate changing conditions will only persist if they undergo range shifts. Redistribution ability may be particularly variable for benthic marine species that disperse as pelagic larvae in ocean currents. The blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, has recently experienced a warming-related range contraction in the southeastern USA and may face limitations to northward range shifts within the Gulf of Maine where dominant coastal currents flow southward. Thus, blue mussels might be especially vulnerable to warming, and understanding dispersal patterns is crucial given the species' relatively long planktonic larval period (>1 month). To determine whether trace elemental ""fingerprints"" incorporated in mussel shells could be used to identify population sources (i.e. collection locations), we assessed the geographic variation in shell chemistry of blue mussels collected from seven populations between Cape Cod, Massachusetts and northern Maine. Across this ∼500 km of coastline, we were able to successfully predict population sources for over two-thirds of juvenile individuals, with almost 80% of juveniles classified within one site of their collection location and 97% correctly classified to region. These results indicate that significant differences in elemental signatures of mussel shells exist between open-coast sites separated by ∼50 km throughout the Gulf of Maine. Our findings suggest that elemental ""fingerprinting"" is a promising approach for predicting redistribution potential of the blue mussel, an ecologically and economically important species in the region."

Both sleep deprivation and social enrichment increase ERK phosphorylation in wild-type flies. The effects of both sleep deprivation and social enrichment on structural plasticity in the LNvs can be recapitulated by expressing an active version of ERK (UAS-ERK(SEM)) pan-neuronally in the adult fly using GeneSwitch (Gsw) Gsw-elav-GAL4. Conversely, disrupting ERK reduces sleep and prevents both the behavioral and structural plasticity normally induced by social enrichment. Finally, using transgenic flies carrying a cAMP response Element (CRE)-luciferase reporter we show that activating ERK enhances CRE-Luc activity while disrupting ERK reduces it. These data suggest that ERK phosphorylation is an important mediator in transducing waking experience into sleep."
https://openalex.org/W1967354130,"Biliary obstruction, a severe cholestatic condition, results in a huge accumulation of toxic bile acids (BA) in the liver. Glucuronidation, a conjugation reaction, is thought to protect the liver by both reducing hepatic BA toxicity and increasing their urinary elimination. The present study evaluates the contribution of each process in the overall BA detoxification by glucuronidation. Glucuronide (G), glycine, taurine conjugates, and unconjugated BAs were quantified in pre- and post-biliary stenting urine samples from 12 patients with biliary obstruction, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The same LC-MS/MS procedure was used to quantify intra- and extracellular BA-G in Hepatoma HepG2 cells. Bile acid-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells was evaluated using MTS reduction, caspase-3 and flow cytometry assays. When compared to post-treatment samples, pre-stenting urines were enriched in glucuronide-, taurine- and glycine-conjugated BAs. Biliary stenting increased the relative BA-G abundance in the urinary BA pool, and reduced the proportion of taurine- and glycine-conjugates. Lithocholic, deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acids were the most cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic/necrotic BAs for HepG2 cells. Other species, such as the cholic, hyocholic and hyodeoxycholic acids were nontoxic. All BA-G assayed were less toxic and displayed lower pro-apoptotic/necrotic effects than their unconjugated precursors, even if they were able to penetrate into HepG2 cells. Under severe cholestatic conditions, urinary excretion favors the elimination of amidated BAs, while glucuronidation allows the conversion of cytotoxic BAs into nontoxic derivatives."

Using a combination of RNAcompete and native gel analysis we find that while both hnRNP L and hnRNP LL preferentially bind sequences that contain repeated CA dinucleotides, these proteins differ in their requirement for the spacing of the CAs. Specifically, hnRNP LL has a more stringent requirement for a two nucleotide space between CA repeats than does hnRNP L, resulting in hnRNP L binding more promiscuously than does hnRNP LL. Importantly, this differential requirement for the spacing of CA dinucleotides explains the previously observed differences in the sensitivity of hnRNP L and LL to mutations within the CD45 gene. We suggest that overlapping but divergent RNA-binding preferences, as we show here for hnRNP L and hnRNP LL, may be commonplace among other hnRNP paralogs."
https://openalex.org/W2082525865,"Cannabinoids exert their actions mainly through two receptors, the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) and cannabinoid CB2 receptor (CB2R). In recent years, the G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) was suggested as a cannabinoid receptor based on its activation by anandamide and tetrahydrocannabinol. Yet, its formal classification is still a matter of debate. CB1R and CB2R expression patterns are well described for rodent and monkey retinas. In the monkey retina, CB1R has been localized in its neural (cone photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells) and CB2R in glial components (Müller cells). The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern of GPR55 in the monkey retina by using confocal microscopy. Our results show that GPR55 is strictly localized in the photoreceptor layer of the extrafoveal portion of the retina. Co-immunolabeling of GPR55 with rhodopsin, the photosensitive pigment in rods, revealed a clear overlap of expression throughout the rod structure with most prominent staining in the inner segments. Additionally, double-label of GPR55 with calbindin, a specific marker for cone photoreceptors in the primate retina, allowed us to exclude expression of GPR55 in cones. The labeling of GPR55 in rods was further assessed with a 3D visualization in the XZ and YZ planes thus confirming its exclusive expression in rods. These results provide data on the distribution of GPR55 in the monkey retina, different than CB1R and CB2R. The presence of GPR55 in rods suggests a function of this receptor in scotopic vision that needs to be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2095027782,"Olfactory sensitivity exhibits daily fluctuations. Several studies have suggested that the olfactory system in insects is modulated by both biogenic amines and neuropeptides. However, molecular and neural mechanisms underlying olfactory modulation in the periphery remain unclear since neuronal circuits regulating olfactory sensitivity have not been identified. Here, we investigated the structure and function of these signaling pathways in the peripheral olfactory system of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, utilizing in situ hybridization, qRT-PCR, and electrophysiological approaches. We showed that tachykinin was co-localized with the octopamine receptor in antennal neurons located near the antennal nerves. In addition, the tachykinin receptor was found to be expressed in most of the olfactory receptor neurons in antennae. Functionally, the effects of direct injection of tachykinin peptides, dsRNAs of tachykinin, tachykinin receptors, and octopamine receptors provided further support for the view that both octopamine and tachykinin modulate olfactory sensitivity. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that octopamine and tachykinin in antennal neurons are olfactory regulators in the periphery. We propose here the hypothesis that octopamine released from neurons in the brain regulates the release of tachykinin from the octopamine receptor neurons in antennae, which in turn modulates the olfactory sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons, which house tachykinin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1985265384,"Cellular systems are essential model systems to study reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage but there are widely accepted technical difficulties with available methods for quantifying endogenous oxidative damage in these systems. Here we present a stable isotope dilution UPLC-MS/MS protocol for measuring F2-isoprostanes as accurate markers for endogenous oxidative damage in cellular systems. F2-isoprostanes are chemically stable prostaglandin-like lipid peroxidation products of arachidonic acid, the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid in mammalian cells. This approach is rapid and highly sensitive, allowing for the absolute quantification of endogenous lipid peroxidation in as little as ten thousand cells as well as damage originating from multiple ROS sources. Furthermore, differences in the endogenous cellular redox state induced by transcriptional regulation of ROS scavenging enzymes were detected by following this protocol. Finally we showed that the F2-isoprostane 5-iPF2α-VI is a metabolically stable end product, which is excreted from cells. Overall, this protocol enables accurate, specific and sensitive quantification of endogenous lipid peroxidation in cellular systems."
https://openalex.org/W2015982412,"Background Ovomucoid (OM) has two carbohydrate chains on each of the first and second domains and one in the third. The contribution of the covalently bound carbohydrate chains to the overall OM allergenicity is controversial. Another aspect directly related with the immunological properties of OM that has not been studied in depth is the importance of the carbohydrate chains on its digestibility. Objective The aim of the study was to assess the involvement of the carbohydrate moieties of OM in its digestibility and allergenic properties. Methods IgE-binding and basophil activation by glycosylated and enzymatically deglycosylated OM (dOM) were compared using blood from egg-allergic patients. The peptides obtained after digestion using a physiologically relevant model were identified by RP-HPLC-MS/MS and the IgE-binding of the resulting fragments was evaluated by DOT-Blot. Results No structural changes were observed after deglycosylation of OM. 80% of the patients showed lower IgE binding to dOM as compared with OM and, in some patients, IgE reactivity could not be inhibited by pre-incubation with dOM. A subtle reduction in the percentage of activated basophils was observed when incubated with dOM as compared to OM. Following simulated digestion, dOM was more extensively degraded than OM, particularly during the gastric phase and both, OM and dOM, yielded, after the duodenal phase, immunoreactive fragments that were totally or partially coincident with previously described epitopes. Conclusion & Clinical Relevance: this work demonstrated an enhanced IgE reactivity towards carbohydrate containing OM in some egg-allergic patients that could be attributed to cross-sensitization or sensitization to the glycosylated components. The carbohydrate chains contributed to an increased resistance to proteolysis, and thus, to its allergenic potency. Evaluation of the products of digestion of OM and dOM revealed the presence of high-frequency IgE-binding epitopes that could remain linked by disulphide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2044614275,"Natural forest succession often affects soil physical and chemical properties. Selected physical and chemical soil properties were studied in an old-growth forest across a forest successional series in Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Southern China.The aim was to assess the effects of forest succession change on soil properties. Soil samples (0-20 cm depth) were collected from three forest types at different succession stages, namely pine (Pinus massoniana) forest (PMF), mixed pine and broadleaf forest (PBMF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest (MEBF), representing early, middle and advanced successional stages respectively. The soil samples were analyzed for soil water storage (SWS), soil organic matter (SOM), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), pH, NH4(+)-N, available potassium (K), available phosphorus (P) and microelements (available copper (Cu), available zinc (Zn), available iron (Fe) and available boron (B)) between 1999 and 2009. The results showed that SWS, SOM, SMBC, Cu, Zn, Fe and B concentrations were higher in the advanced successional stage (MEBF stage). Conversely, P and pH were lower in the MEBF but higher in the PMF (early successional stage). pH, NH4(+)-N, P and K declined while SOM, Zn, Cu, Fe and B increased with increasing forest age. Soil pH was lower than 4.5 in the three forest types, indicating that the surface soil was acidic, a stable trend in Dinghushan.These findings demonstrated significant impacts of natural succession in an old-growth forest on the surface soil nutrient properties and organic matter. Changes in soil properties along the forest succession gradient may be a useful index for evaluating the successional stages of the subtropical forests. We caution that our inferences are drawn from a pseudo-replicated chronosequence, as true replicates were difficult to find. Further studies are needed to draw rigorous conclusions regarding on nutrient dynamics in different successional stages of forest."
https://openalex.org/W2111249832,"Loss of Fhit expression, encoded at chromosome fragile site FRA3B, leads to increased replication stress, genome instability and accumulation of genetic alterations. We have proposed that Fhit is a genome ‘caretaker’ whose loss initiates genome instability in preneoplastic lesions. We have characterized allele copy number alterations and expression changes observed in Fhit-deficient cells in conjunction with alterations in cellular proliferation and exome mutations, using cells from mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse kidney, early and late after establishment in culture, and in response to carcinogen treatment. Fhit-/- MEFs escape senescence to become immortal more rapidly than Fhit+/+ MEFs; -/- MEFs and kidney cultures show allele losses and gains, while +/+ derived cells show few genomic alterations. Striking alterations in expression of p53, p21, Mcl1 and active caspase 3 occurred in mouse kidney -/- cells during progressive tissue culture passage. To define genomic changes associated with preneoplastic changes in vivo, exome DNAs were sequenced for +/+ and -/- liver tissue after treatment of mice with the carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and for +/+ and -/- kidney cells treated in vitro with this carcinogen. The -/- exome DNAs, in comparison with +/+ DNA, showed small insertions, deletions and point mutations in more genes, some likely related to preneoplastic changes. Thus, Fhit loss provides a ‘mutator’ phenotype, a cellular environment in which mild genome instability permits clonal expansion, through proliferative advantage and escape from apoptosis, in response to pressures to survive."
https://openalex.org/W1971949734,"Triptolide, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Leigongteng (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.), shows a broad-spectrum of anticancer activity through its cytotoxicity. However, the efficacy of triptolide on laryngocarcinoma rarely been evaluated, and the mechanism by which triptolide-induced cellular apoptosis is still not well understood. In this study, we found that triptolide significantly inhibited the laryngocarcinoma HEp-2 cells proliferation, migration and survivability. Triptolide induces HEp-2 cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways since both caspase-8 and -9 are activated. Moreover, triptolide enhances p53 expression by increasing its stability via down-regulation of E6 and E6AP. Increased p53 transactivates down-stream target genes to initiate apoptosis. In addition, we found that short time treatment with triptolide induced DNA damage, which was consistent with the increase in p53. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of triptolide is decreased by p53 knockdown or use of caspases inhibitor. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that triptolide inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in laryngocarcinoma cells by enhancing p53 expression and activating p53 functions through induction of DNA damage and suppression of E6 mediated p53 degradation. These studies indicate that triptolide is a potential anti-laryngocarcinoma drug."
https://openalex.org/W1990374107,"It is well established that male rats have an advantage in acquiring place-learning strategies, allowing them to learn spatial tasks more readily than female rats. However many of these differences have been examined solely during acquisition or in 24h memory retention. Here, we investigated whether sex differences exist in remote long-term memory, lasting 30d after training, and whether there are differences in the expression pattern of molecular markers associated with long-term memory maintenance. Specifically, we analyzed the expression of protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) and the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA2. To adequately evaluate memory retention, we used a robust training protocol to attenuate sex differences in acquisition and found differential effects in memory retention 1d and 30d after training. Female cohorts tested for memory retention 1d after 60 training trials outperformed males by making significantly fewer reference memory errors at test. In contrast, male cohorts tested 30d after 60 training trials outperformed females of the same condition, making fewer reference memory errors and achieving significantly higher retention test scores. Furthermore, given 60 training trials, females tested 30d later showed significantly worse memory compared to females tested 1d later, while males tested 30d later did not differ from males tested 1d later. Together these data suggest that with robust training males do no retain spatial information as well as females do 24h post-training but maintain this spatial information for longer. Males also showed a significant increase in synaptic PKMζ expression and a positive correlation with retention test scores, while females did not. Interestingly, both sexes showed a positive correlation between retention test scores and synaptic GluA2 expression. Furthermore, the increased expression of synaptic PKMζ, associated with male memory but not with female memory, identifies another potential sex-mediated difference in memory processing."
https://openalex.org/W1993078308,"The cause of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) remains unknown. We attempted to find out if occupational exposure to toxicants plays a part in the pathogenesis of this disease. In an Australia-wide case-control study we compared the lifetime occupations of 611 SALS and 775 control individuals. Occupations were coded using country-specific as well as international classifications. The risk of SALS for each occupation was calculated with odds ratios using logistic regression. In addition, the literature was searched for possible toxicant links between our findings and previously-reported occupational associations with SALS. Male occupations in our study that required lower skills and tasks tended to have increased risks of SALS, and conversely, those occupations that required higher skills and tasks had decreased risks of SALS. Of all the occupations, only truck drivers, where exposure to diesel exhaust is common, maintained an increased risk of SALS throughout all occupational groups. Another large case-control study has also found truck drivers to be at risk of SALS, and almost two-thirds of occupations, as well as military duties, that have previously been associated with SALS have potential exposure to diesel exhaust. In conclusion, two of the largest case-control studies of SALS have now found that truck drivers have an increased risk of SALS. Since exposure to diesel exhaust is common in truck drivers, as well as in other occupations that have been linked to SALS, exposure to this toxicant may underlie some of the occupations that are associated with SALS."
https://openalex.org/W1980666583,"Background New biomarkers may aid in preventive and end-of-life decisions in older adults if they enhance the prognostic ability of traditional risk factors. We investigated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) improve the ability to predict overall mortality among the elderly of the Bambuí, Brazil Study of Aging when added to traditional risk factors. Methods From 1997 to 2007, 1,470 community-dwelling individuals (≥60 years) were followed-up. Death was ascertained by continuous verification of death certificates. We calculated hazard ratios per 1 standard deviation change (HR) of death for traditional risk factors only (old model), and traditional risk factors plus CRP and/or BNP (new models) and assessed calibration of the models. Subsequently, we compared c-statistic of each of the new models to the old one, and calculated integrated discriminative improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Results 544 (37.0%) participants died in a mean follow-up time of 9.0 years. CRP (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17-1.40), BNP (HR 1.31 95% CI 1.19-1.45), and CRP plus BNP (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38, and HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.42, respectively) were independent determinants of mortality. All models were well-calibrated. Discrimination was similar among the old (c-statistic 0.78 [0.78-0.81]) and new models (p=0.43 for CRP; p=0.57 for BNP; and p=0.31 for CRP plus BNP). Compared to the old model, CRP, BNP, and CRP plus BNP models led to an IDI of 0.009 (p<0.001), -0.005 (p<0.001) and -0.003 (p=0.84), and a NRI of 0.04 (p=0.24), 0.07 (p=0.08) and 0.06 (p=0.10), respectively. Conclusions Despite being independent predictors of long-term risk of death, compared to traditional risk factors CRP and/or BNP led to either a modest or non-significant improvement in the ability of predicting all-cause mortality in older adults."

This ADP inhibition mechanism of TthV0V1 is advantageous as it prevents consumption of ATP when proton motive force is lost.

In this study, domain swapping was applied to the V1-A subunit to investigate the factors that define sensitivity to ADP inhibition using V1 from T. thermophilus and E. hirae. The results indicate that sensitivity to ADP inhibition is not due to differences in the NB domains of the two V1-ATPases. We have experimentally demonstrated the relationship between the affinity for Pi and sensitivity to ADP inhibition of V1. With recent structural studies of both V1-ATPases (13.Nagamatsu Y. Takeda K.

These PCR fragments contain sequences complementary to each other. They were mixed and submitted to a further round of amplification using the 5′- and 3′-terminal primers used in the first PCR to produce a single fragment containing the chimeric gene sequence. The chimeric gene sequences were then digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding region of the TthV1 expression plasmid (17.Imamura H. Ikeda C. Yoshida M.

Cells containing the expressed proteins were suspended in equilibration buffer (20 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and disrupted by sonication. After removal of debris by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+ affinity column (Qiagen; 3 × 5 cm), the column was washed thoroughly with equilibration buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The V1 was exchanged into 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA by ultrafiltration (Millipore, Amicon Ultra), and the dialysis solution was applied to a UNOQ column (Bio-Rad) for further purification. The fractions containing chimeric V1 were concentrated, and contaminating proteins were removed on a Superdex HR-200 column equilibrated with MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl). For single molecular observation experiments, cysteine residues were introduced into the D subunit in the V1-A011. Then the modified V1-A011 was biotinylated as described previously (5.Imamura H.

Briefly, the biotinylated chimeric V1 (∼1 nm) was bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-coated coverslips via their His tag. Then streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (nominal diameter, ∼200 nm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were bound to the chimeric V1, and finally, observation of the rotation was initiated after infusion of buffer containing Mg-ATP. To observe the rotation under a low viscous load, instead of the magnetic beads, we used gold beads (nominal diameter, 80 nm; BBInternational, Cardiff, UK) that functionalized with Neutravidin (Pierce) and polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 1214; Quanta BioDesign, Powell, OH) (19.Furuike S.

Protein concentrations of the purified V1 constructs were determined from UV absorbance calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis; 1 mg/ml gives 0.88 OD at 280 nm. ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C with an enzyme-coupled ATP-regenerating system. The ATPase assay solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 100 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.2 mm NADH, and a range of concentrations of Mg-ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzymes. ADP removal treatments for chimeric V1 were carried out by methods described previously (11.Nakano M. Imamura H. Toei M. Tamakoshi M.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS or alkyl ether sulfate (AES) was carried out as described previously (22.Yokoyama K. Nagata K. Imamura H. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M.

The TthV1 and TthV0 were isolated from the membranes from the mutated T. thermophilus strain incorporating a His3 tag on the C terminus of subunit L as described previously (23.Tamakoshi M. Uchida M.

The reconstituted chimeric V0V1 was then incorporated into liposomes by a freeze-thaw method (24.Kishikawa J. Yokoyama K.

The condition used is as follows: pHin = 4.9, pHout = 8.5, [K+]in = 1 mm, [K+]out = 100 mm, 25 °C. Figures of structural models were prepared using the UCSF Chimera package (25.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27902) Google Scholar). All chimeric V1 constructs were generated using the basic TthV1 (Figs. 1, b and c, and 3). The subunit stoichiometry and complex formation of all the purified chimeric V1 constructs were confirmed by both SDS- and native PAGE (Fig. 1, d and e). The NB domain is thought to be critical for entrapment of inhibitory ADP at a catalytic site. ADP inhibition of TthV1 can be overcome by introduction of the TSSA mutation in the P-loop region in the NB domain of the A subunit (S232A/T235S; see Refs. 5.Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Evidence for rotation of V1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and 11.Nakano M. Imamura H. Toei M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this case, entrapped inhibitory ADP in the catalytic site of TSSA mutated TthV1 was easily detached from the enzyme during turnover because of its lower affinity for nucleotide (ADP and/or ATP) than that of wild-type TthV1. Assuming that the insensitivity of EhiV1 to ADP inhibition is due to a difference in the molecular characteristics of the NB domain of the two enzymes, chimeric V1-A010 containing the NB domain (residue numbers 194–434; Figs. 1, b and c, 2, and 3) of the A subunit of EhiV1 should show insensitivity to ADP inhibition. However, the ATP hydrolysis activity of isolated V1-A010 was very low due to the presence of inhibitory ADP bound to the enzyme (Fig. 4). This inhibitory ADP in V1-A010 was successfully removed by phosphate/EDTA treatment as described previously (17.Imamura H. Ikeda C. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. The F subunit of Thermus thermophilus V1-ATPase promotes ATPase activity but is not necessary for rotation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18085-18090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After the treatment, V1-A010 showed an apparent ATP hydrolysis activity of 34.4 ± 0.6 s−1, which is almost equivalent to that of TthV1 (39.9 ± 0.3 s−1) (11.Nakano M. Imamura H. Toei M. Tamakoshi M. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. ATP hydrolysis and synthesis of a rotary motor V-ATPase from Thermus thermophilus.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of V1-A010 rapidly decayed due to transition into the ADP inhibition state. The inhibition rate of the V1-A010 was 1.4 × 10−2 s−1, which is higher than that of TthV1 (7.9 × 10−3 s−1; see Ref. 11.Nakano M. Imamura H. Toei M. Tamakoshi M. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. ATP hydrolysis and synthesis of a rotary motor V-ATPase from Thermus thermophilus.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These results clearly indicate that the different sensitivities of the two V1 enzymes to ADP inhibition are not solely dependent on the properties of the NB domain. A CT domain chimera, V1-A001 (containing residue numbers 435–593 of the A subunit of EhiV1; Figs. 1c and 3), was constructed and purified (Fig. 1, c and d). The isolated V1-A001 exhibited extremely low ATP hydrolysis activity likely as the result of bound inhibitory ADP (Fig. 4), indicating that the V1-A001 is sensitive to ADP inhibition. Following ADP removal, V1-A001 exhibited ATPase activity of 5.0 ± 0.2 s−1, which is significantly lower than that of V1-A010 or TthV1. The ATPase activity of V1-A001 also decayed. The results indicate that substitution of the CT domain of TthV1 to that of EhiV1 is not sufficient to suppress ADP inhibition of V1. In contrast, the chimeric V1-A011 containing both the NB and CT domains of A subunit of EhiV1 maintained nearly continuous ATP hydrolysis activity of 57.7 ± 0.8 s−1 without ADP removal treatment (Fig. 4). These results from three chimeric V1 indicate that substitution with both the NB and CT domains of EhiV1-A subunit is required to suppress the ADP inhibition of the TthV1. The first and second helices of the CT domain lie in close proximity to the lower side of the NB domain in the crystal structure of TthV1 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that these helices play an important role in the interaction between the two domains. To investigate the inherent function of the CT domain helices in ADP inhibition, chimeric construct V1-A010.1, which contains both the NB domain and the first and second CT helices (residue numbers 435–481; Figs. 1c and 3) of the A subunit of EhiV1, was constructed and purified (Fig. 1, c and d). V1-A010.1 showed continuous ATP hydrolysis activity without ADP removal treatment (Fig. 4), indicating that both of these regions of the A subunit of EhiV1 are required to overcome ADP inhibition of TthV1. In other words, interdomain interaction between the NB domain and the first and second helices of the CT domain is likely to be important for suppression of ADP inhibition. Affinity of V1 for nucleotides seems to be key for sensitivity of ADP inhibition because the ADP inhibition is due to entrapment of ADP in a catalytic site of the V1. In fact, TSSA mutated TthV1 exhibited insensitivity to ADP inhibition because of its lower affinity for nucleotide (ADP and/or ATP) than that of wild-type TthV1 (5.Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H.

Thus, we examined kinetic parameters of V1-A011, which exhibits insensitivity to ADP inhibition, and other chimeric V1 by both bulk phase assay and single molecule observation. The ATP hydrolysis rates of V1-A010 and V1-A011 obeyed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 5a). The Vmax values of V1-A010 and V1-A011 were calculated to be 34.4 ± 0.6 and 57.7 ± 0.8 s−1 (mean ± S.E.), respectively (Table 1), which are similar to that of TthV1. The Km for ATP (Km(ATP)) of V1-A011, 21.5 ± 1.8 μm (mean ± S.E.), was 10-fold lower than that of TthV1 (205 ± 7 μm (mean ± S.E.)) and 6-fold lower than that of V1-A010 (132 ± 11 μm (mean ± S.E.)) (Table 1). The Vmax/Km value of V1-A011 was ∼14-fold higher than that of TthV1 despite that Vmax of V1-A011 was 1.5-fold higher than that of TthV1. These results suggest that V1-A011 has a higher affinity for ATP compared with TthV1 and V1-A010.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for ATP hydrolysis of TthV1, TSSA V1, and chimeric V1VmaxKmVmax/Kms−1μmm−1 s−1TthV1aValues from Ref. 11.39.9 ± 0.3205 ± 71.9 × 105TSSA V1aValues from Ref. 11.55.8 ± 0.3510 ± 111.1 × 105V1-A01034.4 ± 0.6132 ± 12.6 × 105V1-A01157.7 ± 0.821.5 ± 1.82.7 × 106a Values from Ref. 11.Nakano M.

https://openalex.org/W2012078000,"Environmentally transmitted pathogens face ecological interactions (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism) in the outside-host environment and host immune system during infection. Despite the ubiquitousness of environmental opportunist pathogens, traditional epidemiology focuses on obligatory pathogens incapable of environmental growth. Here we ask how competitive interactions in the outside-host environment affect the dynamics of an opportunist pathogen. We present a model coupling the classical SI and Lotka–Volterra competition models. In this model we compare a linear infectivity response and a sigmoidal infectivity response. An important assumption is that pathogen virulence is traded off with competitive ability in the environment. Removing this trade-off easily results in host extinction. The sigmoidal response is associated with catastrophic appearances of disease outbreaks when outside-host species richness, or overall competition pressure, decreases. This indicates that alleviating outside-host competition with antibacterial substances that also target the competitors can have unexpected outcomes by providing benefits for opportunist pathogens. These findings may help in developing alternative ways of controlling environmental opportunist pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2005460334,"Apart from few early biophysical studies, the relative thermal instability of HbE has been only shown by clinical investigations. We have compared in vitro thermal stability of HbE with HbA2 and HbA using optical spectroscopy. From absorption measurements in the soret region, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering experiments, we have found thermal stability of the three hemoglobin variants following the order HbE<HbA<HbA2 in terms of structural unfolding and aggregation pattern. We have found formation of intermolecular dityrosine fluorophores with characteristic fluorescence signature, at pH >11.0 in all the three variants. Under oxidative stress conditions in presence of hydrogen peroxide, HbE has been found to be more vulnerable to aggregation compared to HbA and HbA2. Taken together, these studies have shown thermal and oxidative instability of HbE and points towards the role of HbE in the upregulation of redox regulators and chaperone proteins in erythrocyte proteome of patients suffering from HbEbeta thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W2075685836,"Heparan sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPG) are ubiquitous molecules with indispensable functions in various biological processes. Glypicans are a family of HSPG's, characterized by a Gpi-anchor which directs them to the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix where they regulate growth factor signaling during development and disease. We report the identification and expression pattern of glypican genes from zebrafish. The zebrafish genome contains 10 glypican homologs, as opposed to six in mammals, which are highly conserved and are phylogenetically related to the mammalian genes. Some of the fish glypicans like Gpc1a, Gpc3, Gpc4, Gpc6a and Gpc6b show conserved synteny with their mammalian cognate genes. Many glypicans are expressed during the gastrulation stage, but their expression becomes more tissue specific and defined during somitogenesis stages, particularly in the developing central nervous system. Existence of multiple glypican orthologs in fish with diverse expression pattern suggests highly specialized and/or redundant function of these genes during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1971244622,"Research has established decreased sensory habituation as a defining feature in migraine, while decreased cognitive habituation has only been found with regard to cognitive assessment of the relative probability of the occurrence of a stimulus event. Our study extended the investigation of interictal habituation in migraine to include cognitive processing when viewing of a series of visually-complex images, similar to those we encounter on the internet everyday. We examined interictal neurocognitive function in migraine from a habituation perspective, using a novel paradigm designed to assess how the response to a series of images changes over time. Two groups of participants--migraineurs (N = 25) and non-migraine controls (N = 25)--were asked to view a set of 232 unfamiliar logos in the context of a target identification task as their brain electrical responses were recorded via event-related potentials (ERPs). The set of logos was viewed serially in each of 10 separate trial blocks, with data analysis focusing on how the ERP responses to the logos in frontal electrodes from 200-600 ms changed across time within each group. For the controls, we found that the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) ERP component elicited by the logos had no significant change across trial blocks. In contrast, in migraineurs we found that the LPP significantly increased in amplitude across trial blocks, an effect consistent with a lack of habituation to visual stimuli seen in previous research. Our findings provide empirical support abnormal cognitive processing of complex visual images across time in migraineurs that goes beyond the sensory-level habituation found in previous research."

Vitamin D pathway is controlled by genes presenting functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Data regarding the association between these polymorphisms and the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) following antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are largely incomplete. Aim of this study was to evaluate if the carriage of different SNPs of these genes could influence the rate of SVR in patients treated with interferon plus ribavirin. Two hundred and six HCV positive patients treated with PEG-interferon plus ribavirin were retrospectively evaluated. Polymorphic loci rs7041 G>T and rs4588 C>A of the vitamin D transporter GC-globulin, rs10741657 G>A of the vitamin D 25 hydroxylase CYP2R1 and rs10877012 G>T of vitamin D 1-hydroxylase CYP27B1 were genotyped. A genetic model named VDPFA (vitamin D Pathway Functional Alleles) was constructed considering for each patient the sum (from 0 to 8), derived from every functional allele carried, associated with the achievement of SVR. Three groups were identified: those carrying ≤4 VDPFA (N=108), those carrying 5-6 VDPFA (N=78) and those carrying ≥7 VDPFA (N=20). Significant associations were found between the rates of SVR and the VDPFA value both in all (61/108, 53/78, 17/20, p=0.009) and in 1/4-5 HCV genotypes (17/56, 23/43, 6/8, p=0.003). Moreover in patients who don't achieve rapid viral response (RVR) SVR and VDPFA were found to be in stronger associations in all (12/55, 17/39, 7/9, p<0.001) and in 1/4-5 HCV genotypes (4/41, 12/31, 5/6, p=0.001). VDPFA value ≥7 could aid to select, among RVR negative difficult to treat 1/4-5 HCV genotypes, those achieving SVR. These observations could permit to extend the indication to adopt dual antiviral therapy beyond RVR positivity rule without reducing the chances of SVR."
https://openalex.org/W2002854322,"Feedforward inhibition controls the time window for synaptic integration and ensures temporal precision in cortical circuits. There is little information whether feedforward inhibition affects neurons uniformly, or whether it contributes to computational refinement within the dendritic tree. Here we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition crucially shapes the integration of synaptic signals in pyramidal cell dendrites. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging we studied the transmembrane voltage patterns in CA1 pyramidal neurons after Schaffer collateral stimulation in acute brain slices from mice. We observed a high degree of variability in the excitation-inhibition ratio between different branches of the dendritic tree. Many dendritic segments showed no depolarizing signal at all, especially the basal dendrites that received predominantly inhibitory signals. Application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline resulted in the spread of depolarizing signals throughout the dendritic tree. Tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs induced significant alterations in the patterns of excitation/inhibition, indicating that they are modified by synaptic plasticity. In summary, we show that feedforward inhibition restricts the occurrence of depolarizing signals within the dendritic tree of CA1 pyramidal neurons and thus refines signal integration spatially."
https://openalex.org/W2018019689,"In human and experimental heart failure, the activity of the type 1 phosphatase is significantly increased, associated with dephosphorylation of phospholamban, inhibition of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and depressed function. In the current study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling protein phosphatase-1 activity. Using recombinant proteins and complementary in vitro binding studies, we identified a multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance in the β-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying fine-tuned regulation of protein phosphatase-1 and its impact on the SERCA2/phospholamban interactome in cardiac function."

Mice were fed a saturated fat-enriched diet for 1 week prior to pump implantation and during 4 weeks of infusion. Infusion of amlodipine resulted in plasma concentrations of 32 ± 2 ng/ml and 27 ± 2 ng/ml for mice in saline + amlodipine and AngII + amlodipine groups, respectively. This infusion rate of amlodipine did not affect AngII-induced increases in systolic blood pressure. Three of 10 (30%) mice infused with AngII died of aortic rupture, while aortic rupture did not occur in mice co-infused with AngII + amlodipine. Suprarenal aortic width and intimal area of ascending aortas were measured to define aortic aneurysms. In the absence of AngII infusion, amlodipine did not change suprarenal aortic width and ascending aortic area. Infusion of AngII led to profound increases of suprarenal aortic width (saline + vehicle versus AngII + vehicle: 0.86 ± 0.02 versus 1.72 ± 0.26 mm; P=0.0006), whereas co-infusion of AngII and amlodipine diminished abdominal dilation (1.02 ± 0.14 mm; P=0.003). As expected, AngII infusion increased mean intimal area of ascending aortas (saline + vehicle versus AngII + vehicle: 8.5 ± 0.3 versus 12.5 ± 1.1 mm2; P=0.001), while co-infusion of AngII and amlodipine ablated dilation of the ascending aorta (8.6 ± 0.2 mm2; P=0.03). Co-administration of amlodipine also significantly attenuated AngII-induced atherosclerosis in the thoracic region as quantified by percent lesion area (AngII + vehicle versus AngII + amlodipine: 5.8 ± 2.1 % versus 0.3 ± 0.1%; P=0.05). Conclusions Amlodipine inhibited AngII-induced aortic aneurysms in both the abdominal and ascending regions, and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2067166479,"Day-to-day variability in performance is a common experience. We investigated its neural correlate by studying learning behavior of monkeys in a two-alternative forced choice task, the two-armed bandit task. We found substantial session-to-session variability in the monkeys’ learning behavior. Recording the activity of single dorsal putamen neurons we uncovered a dual function of this structure. It has been previously shown that a population of neurons in the DLP exhibits firing activity sensitive to the reward value of chosen actions. Here, we identify putative medium spiny neurons in the dorsal putamen that are cue-selective and whose activity builds up with learning. Remarkably we show that session-to-session changes in the size of this population and in the intensity with which this population encodes cue-selectivity is correlated with session-to-session changes in the ability to learn the task. Moreover, at the population level, dorsal putamen activity in the very beginning of the session is correlated with the performance at the end of the session, thus predicting whether the monkey will have a ""good"" or ""bad"" learning day. These results provide important insights on the neural basis of inter-temporal performance variability."
https://openalex.org/W2094258712,"It is well established that acute activation of members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family induced by activation of cellular receptors can transduce extracellular stimuli to intracellular signaling. However, the functions of sustained activation of PKC are not well studied. We have previously shown that sustained activation of classical PKC isoforms over 15-60 min induced the formation of the pericentrion, a subset of recycling endosomes that are sequestered perinuclearly in a PKC- and phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the role of this process in the phosphorylation of EGFR on threonine 654 (Thr-654) and in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and fate of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Sustained stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor induced translocation of the EGFR to the pericentrion, which in turn prevents full access of EGF to the EGFR. These effects required PKC and PLD activities, and direct stimulation of PKC with phorbol esters was sufficient to reproduce these effects. Furthermore, activation of PKC induced delayed phosphorylation of EGFR on Thr-654 that coincided with the formation of the pericentrion and which was dependent on PLD and endocytosis of EGFR. Thus, Thr-654 phosphorylation required the formation of the pericentrion. On the other hand, using a T654A mutant of EGFR, we find that the phosphorylation on Thr-654 was not required for translocation of EGFR to the pericentrion but was required for protection of EGFR from degradation in response to EGF. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for the pericentrion in the regulation of EGFR phosphorylation, which in turn is important for the fates of EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2105236214,"Breast cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in American women, and better preventative strategies are needed. Epidemiological and laboratory studies point to vitamin D3 as a promising chemopreventative agent for breast cancer. Vitamin D3 metabolites induce anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, but few studies have investigated their effects in normal mammary epithelial cells. We hypothesized that 1,25(OH)2D3, the metabolically active form of vitamin D3, is growth suppressive in normal mouse mammary epithelial cells. In addition, we have previously established a role for the cytokine interleukin-1 alpha (IL1α) in the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in normal prostate cells, and so we hypothesized that IL1α is involved in the 1,25(OH)2D3 response in mammary cells. Evaluation of cell viability, clonogenicity, senescence, and induction of cell cycle regulators p21 and p27 supported an anti-proliferative role for 1,25(OH)2D3 in mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the intracellular expression of IL1α, which was necessary for the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in mammary cells. Together, these findings support the chemopreventative potential of vitamin D3 in the mammary gland and present a role for IL1α in regulation of mammary cell proliferation by 1,25(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W2041502765,"In Drosophila, the non-LTR retrotransposons HeT-A, TART and TAHRE build a head-to-tail array of repetitions that constitute the telomere domain by targeted transposition at the end of the chromosome whenever needed. As a consequence, Drosophila telomeres have the peculiarity to harbor the genes in charge of telomere elongation. Understanding telomere expression is important in Drosophila since telomere homeostasis depends in part on the expression of this genomic compartment. We have recently shown that the essential kinase JIL-1 is the first positive regulator of the telomere retrotransposons. JIL-1 mediates chromatin changes at the promoter of the HeT-A retrotransposon that are necessary to obtain wild type levels of expression of these telomere transposons. With the present study, we show how JIL-1 is also needed for the expression of a reporter gene embedded in the telomere domain. Our analysis, using different reporter lines from the telomere and subtelomere domains of different chromosomes, indicates that JIL-1 likely acts protecting the telomere domain from the spreading of repressive chromatin from the adjacent subtelomere domain. Moreover, the analysis of the 4R telomere suggests a slightly different chromatin structure at this telomere. In summary, our results strongly suggest that the action of JIL-1 depends on which telomere domain, which chromosome and which promoter is embedded in the telomere chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2045824414,"Background/Aim of the study Low-grade systemic inflammation was suggested to participate to the decline of physiological functions and increased vulnerability encountered in older patients. Geriatric syndromes encompass various features such as functional dependence, polymorbidity, depression and malnutrition. There is a strong prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and related risk factors and chronic cytomegalovirus infections in the geriatric population. As these underlying conditions were proposed to influence the inflammatory state, the aim of this study was to assess their potential contribution to the association of geriatric syndromes with inflammatory parameters. Methodology We recruited 100 subjects in the general population or hospitalized for chronic medical conditions (age, 23-96 years). We collected information on clinical status (medical history, ongoing comorbidities, treatments and geriatric scales), biological parameters (hematological tests, cytomegalovirus serology) and cytokines production (basal and alum-induced interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels). Using stepwise backward multivariate analyses, we defined which set of clinical and biological variables could be predictive for increased inflammatory markers. Principal Findings We confirmed the age-associated increase of circulating IL-6 levels. In contrast to geriatric scales, we found history of cardiovascular diseases to be strongly associated for this parameter as for high IL-6 production upon ex vivo stimulation with alum. Conclusions Association between low-grade inflammation and geriatric conditions could be linked to underlying cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2050302654,"The moderating role of affective-cognitive consistency in the effects of affectively-based and cognitively-based attitudes on consummatory and instrumental behaviors was explored using two experimental studies in the intergroup context. Study 1 revealed that affectively-based attitudes were better predictors than cognitively-based attitudes regardless of affective-cognitive consistency for consummatory behaviors (e.g., undergraduates’ supportive behaviors toward government officials). Study 2, which investigated task groups’ supportive behaviors toward an immediate supervisory group, found that for these instrumental behaviors cognitively-based attitudes were better predictors than affectively-based attitudes only when affective-cognitive consistency was high. The present research also examined the mechanism by which affective-cognitive consistency moderates the relative roles of affectively-based and cognitively-based attitudes in attitude-behavior consistency. Results indicated that attitude-behavior consistency is eroded primarily because of the weaker relationship of affective or cognitive components to behaviors than to general attitudes. The reciprocal implications of research on attitudes and work on intergroup relations are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2086718704,"Alcohol abuse is a major cause of pancreatitis. However alcohol toxicity has not been fully elucidated in the pancreas and little is known about the effect of alcohol on pancreatic ducts. We report the molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced damage of pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Ethanol treatment for 1, 4, and 24 h resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The ethanol-induced cell damage was mainly apoptosis due to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activation of caspase-3 enzyme. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated these cellular responses and reduced cell death significantly, suggesting a critical role for ROS. Acetaldehyde, a metabolic product of alcohol dehydrogenase, induced significant cell death, depolarization of MMP, and caspase-3 activation as ethanol and this damage was also averted by NAC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression of several subtypes of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data confirmed the accumulation of acetaldehyde in ethanol-treated cells, suggesting that acetaldehyde formation can contribute to alcohol toxicity in PDEC. Finally, ethanol increased the leakage of PDEC monolayer which was again attenuated by NAC. In conclusion, ethanol induces apoptosis of PDEC and thereby may contribute to the development of alcohol-induced pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2089184193,"The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to alcohol are incompletely understood. Recent research has highlighted the involvement of two presynaptic proteins, Munc18 and Rab3. We have previously characterised biochemically a number of specific Munc18 point mutations including an E466K mutation that augments a direct Rab3 interaction. Here the phenotypes of this and other Munc18 mutations were assessed in alcohol sensitivity and exocytosis using Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that expressing the orthologous E466K mutation (unc-18 E465K) enhanced alcohol sensitivity. This enhancement in sensitivity was surprisingly independent of rab-3. In contrast unc-18 R39C, which decreases syntaxin binding, enhanced sensitivity to alcohol in a manner requiring rab-3. Finally, overexpression of R39C could suppress partially the reduction in neurotransmitter release in rab-3 mutant worms, whereas wild-type or E465K mutants showed no rescue. These data indicate that the epistatic interactions between unc-18 and rab-3 in modulating sensitivity to alcohol are distinct from interactions affecting neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2046078043,"Setting The “Thibela TB” cluster randomised trial of community-wide isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) to reduce tuberculosis incidence in the South African gold mines. Objectives To determine the proportion of participants eligible for IPT and the reasons and risk factors for ineligibility, to inform the scale-up of IPT. Design Cross-sectional survey of participants in intervention clusters (mine shafts) consenting to tuberculosis screening and assessment for eligibility to start IPT. Results Among 27,126 consenting participants, 94.7% were male, the median age was 41 years, 12.2% reported previous tuberculosis, 0.6% reported ever taking IPT and 2.5% reported currently taking antiretroviral therapy. There were 24,430 (90.1%) assessed as eligible to start IPT, of whom 23,659 started IPT. The most common reasons for ineligibility were having suspected tuberculosis that was subsequently confirmed by a positive smear and/or culture (n=705), excessive alcohol consumption (n=427) and being on tuberculosis treatment at time of initial screen (n=241). Ineligibility was associated with factors including older age, female gender, prior history of tuberculosis and being in “HIV care”. However, at least 78% were eligible for IPT in all of these sub-groups. Conclusions The vast majority of participants in this community-wide intervention were eligible for IPT."
https://openalex.org/W2071096945,"Purpose To examine the associations between area-level socioeconomic attributes and stage of esophageal adenocarcinoma diagnoses in 16 SEER cancer registries during 2000-2007. Methods Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relationship between distant-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma and individual, census tract, and county-level attributes. Results Among cases with data on birthplace, no significant association was seen between reported birth within versus outside the United States and distant-stage cancer (adjusted OR=1.02, 95% CI: 0.85-1.22). Living in an area with a higher percentage of residents born outside the United States than the national average was associated with distant-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma; census tract level: >11.8%, (OR=1.10, 95% CI:1.01–1.19), county level: >11.8%, (OR=1.14, 95% CI:1.05-1.24). No association was observed between median household income and distant-stage cancer at either census tract or county levels. Conclusion The finding of greater odds of distant-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma among cases residing in SEER areas with higher proportion of non-U.S. Natives suggests local areas where esophageal cancer control efforts might be focused. Missing data at the individual level was a limitation of the present study. Furthermore, inconsistent associations with foreign birth at individual- versus area-levels cautions against using area-level attributes as proxies for case attributes."
