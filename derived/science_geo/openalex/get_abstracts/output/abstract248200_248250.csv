Although both groups performed the tasks equally well, children with autism showed no mirror neuron activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Notably, activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional 'mirror neuron system' may underlie the social deficits observed in autism."

Non-fucosylated bisected IgGs bind this receptor with increased affinity and trigger FcγRIII-mediated effector functions more efficiently than native, fucosylated antibodies. In this study the contribution of the carbohydrates of both binding partners to the strength of the complex was analyzed. Glycoengineering of the antibody increased affinity for two polymorphic forms of soluble human FcγRIIIa (by up to 50-fold) but did not affect binding to the inhibitory FcγRIIb receptor. While the absence of carbohydrate at FcγRIIIa’s Asn-162 increased affinity for native IgG, presumably due to the removal of steric hindrance caused by the bulky sugars, it unexpectedly reduced affinity for glycoengineered (GE) antibodies by over one order of magnitude, bringing the affinity down to the same level as for native IgG. We conclude that the high affinity between GE antibodies and FcγRIII is mediated by productive interactions formed between the receptor carbohydrate attached at Asn-162 and regions of the Fc that are only accessible when it is nonfucosylated. As FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are the only human Fcγ receptors glycosylated at this position, the proposed interactions explain the observed selective affinity increase of GE antibodies for only these receptors. Furthermore, we predict from our structural model that only one of the two Fc-fucose residues needs to be absent for increased binding affinity toward FcγRIII. This information can be exploited for the design of new antibodies with altered Fc receptor binding affinity and enhanced therapeutic potential.

Antibodies provide a link between the humoral and the cellular immune system with IgG 2The abbreviations used are: IgG, immunoglobulin G; GE, glycoengineered; Fuc, fucose; GnT-III, β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; FcγR, Fcγ receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; h, human; s, soluble; m, mouse. 2The abbreviations used are: IgG, immunoglobulin G; GE, glycoengineered; Fuc, fucose; GnT-III, β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; FcγR, Fcγ receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; h, human; s, soluble; m, mouse. being the most abundant serum immunoglobulin. While the Fab regions of the antibody recognize antigens, the Fc part interacts with membrane-bound Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) that are differentially expressed by all immune competent cells. Receptor crosslinking by a multivalent antigen-antibody complex triggers degranulation, cytolysis or phagocytosis of the target cell, and transcriptional activation of cytokine-encoding genes (1Deo Y.M. Graziano R.F. Repp R. van de Winkel J.G. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of the activating receptor FcγRIIIa for the in vivo elimination of tumor cells in humans has been demonstrated. In follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients, a relationship was discovered between the FcγRIIIa genotype and clinical and molecular responses to rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric antibody used against hematological malignancies (2Cartron G. Dacheux L. Salles G. Solal-Celigny P. Bardos P. Colombat P. Watier H. Blood. 2002; 99: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated that the efficacy of rituximab was higher in patients homozygous for the “high affinity” FcγRIIIa, characterized by a valine at position 158 (FcγRIIIa[Val-158]), than in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the “low affinity” FcγRIIIa, which has a phenylalanine residue at this position (FcγRIIIa[Phe-158]) and has lower affinity for IgG (3Koene H.R. Kleijer M. Algra J. Roos D. von dem Borne A.E. de Haas M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased survival of lymphoma patients that mount an anti-tumor humoral response after anti-idiotypic vaccination has also been correlated with homozygocity for FcγRIIIa[Val-158] (4Weng W.K. Czerwinski D. Timmerman J. Hsu F.J. Levy R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above observations imply a crucial role for FcγRIIIa in the elimination of tumor cells and support the idea that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with increased affinity for FcγRIIIa will have improved biological activity. One route to increase the affinity of monoclonal antibodies toward FcγRIIIa and consequently to enhance their effector functions is manipulation of their carbohydrate moiety (5Umaña P. Jean-Mairet J.

The N-glycosylation pattern of mAbs can be manipulated by engineering the glycosylation pathway of the production cell line using enzyme activities that lead to naturally occurring carbohydrates.

Antibodies with increased binding to FcγRIIIa have also been obtained using a cell line which is unable to add fucose residues to N-linked oligosaccharides (6Shields R.L. Lai J. Keck R.

The crystal structure of unglycosylated FcγRIII in complex with the Fc fragment of human (h) IgG1 indicates that a carbohydrate moiety attached at Asn-162 of FcγRIII would point into the central cavity within the Fc fragment (14Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), where the rigid core glycans attached to IgG-Asn-297 are also located (15Huber R. Deisenhofer J. Colman P.M. Matsushima M. Palm W. Nature. 1976; 264: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the present study, binding of glycosylated soluble (s) hFcγRIIIa variants to distinct antibody glycovariants was evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and in a cellular system to dissect the interaction between IgG1 and glycosylated FcγRIIIa on a molecular level. Cell Lines, Expression Vectors, and Antibodies—HEK293-EBNA cells were a kind gift from Rene Fischer (Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, Zürich, Switzerland). Additional cell lines used in this study were Jurkat cells (human lymphoblastic T cell, ATCC number TIB-152) and FcγRIIIa[Val-158]- and FcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162]-expressing Jurkat cell lines, generated as described previously (7Ferrara C. Brünker P. Suter T. Moser S. Püntener U. Umaña P. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultivated according to the instructions of the supplier. DNA encoding the shFcγRIIIa[Val-158] and shFcγRIIIa[Phe-158] variants were fused after residue 191 to a hexahistidine tag (NH2-MRTEDL... GYQG(H6)-COOH, numbering is based on the mature protein) using PCR as described (16Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Rae J. Briggs J. Xie D. Lai J. Stadlen A. Li B. Fox J.A. Presta L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6591-6604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Asn-162 of shFcγRIIIa[Val-158] was exchanged for Gln by PCR. All expression vectors contained the replication origin oriP from the Epstein-Barr virus for expression in HEK293-EBNA cells. GE and native anti-CD20 antibodies were produced in HEK-293 EBNA cells and characterized by standard methods. Neutral oligosaccharide profiles for the antibodies were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Autoflex, Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Faellanden, Switzerland) in positive ion mode (17Papac D.I. Briggs J.B. Chin E.T. Jones A.J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Production and Purification of Recombinant shFcγRIIIa Receptors— The shFcγRIIIa variants were produced by transient expression in HEK-293-EBNA cells (18Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and purified using a HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences, Otelfingen, Switzerland) and a size exclusion chromatography step with HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20). Human sFcγRIIb and mouse (m) sFcγRIIb were produced and purified as described (19Sondermann P. Jacob U. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined as described (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4969) Google Scholar). SPR—SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore3000 with HBS-EP as running buffer (Biacore, Freiburg, Germany). Direct coupling of around 1,000 resonance units of human IgG glycovariants was performed on a CM5 chip using the standard amine coupling kit (Biacore). Different concentrations of soluble FcγRs were passed with a flow rate of 10 μl/min through the flow cells. Increasing the flow rate did not influence the binding curves. Bulk refractive index differences were corrected for by subtracting the response obtained on flowing sample over a bovine serum albumin-coupled surface. The steady state response was used to obtain the dissociation constant KD by non-linear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm. Kinetic constants were obtained using the BIAevaluation program curve-fitting facility (v3.0, Biacore), to fit rate equations for 1:1 Langmuir binding by numerical integration. Binding of IgG to FcγRIIIa-expressing Cells—The experiment was conducted as described previously (7Ferrara C. Brünker P. Suter T. Moser S. Püntener U. Umaña P. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hFcγRIIIa-expressing Jurkat cells were incubated with IgG variants in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, antibody binding was detected by incubating with 1:200 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human F(ab′)2, F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (16Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Rae J. Briggs J. Xie D. Lai J. Stadlen A. Li B. Fox J.A. Presta L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6591-6604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of the bound antibody variants was determined on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, Allschwil, Switzerland). Modeling—We visualized the interaction of the Fc fragment derived from native IgG and the FcγRIII glycans after creating a carbohydrate in silico, attached at the position Asn-162 of the receptor. The glycan unit was modeled on to the crystal structure of FcγRIII in complex with Fc-IgG (Protein Data Bank code 1e4k). The interaction between FcγRIII and IgG was modeled by directing the Fc-linked pentasaccharide core to the fucose residue of oligosaccharide linked to the Fc-Asn-297. The model was not energy minimized and only created to visualize the proposed binding mode. Biochemical Characterization of Soluble hFcγRIIIa Receptors and Antibody Glycovariants—ShFcγRIIIa[Val-158], shFcγRIIIa[Phe-158], and shFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] were expressed in HEK293-EBNA cells and purified to homogeneity. The purified shFcγRIIIa[Val-158] and [Phe-158] migrate as broad bands in the apparent molecular weight range of 40–50 kDa when subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. The apparent molecular weight is slightly lower for the mutant shFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] (data not shown). This can be explained by the elimination of the carbohydrates linked to Asn-162. Upon enzymatic N-deglycosylation all three receptor variants migrate identically in the apparent molecular weight range of 25–30 kDa and feature three bands as observed previously for the membrane form of N-deglycosylated hFcγRIII (21Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3849-3857Google Scholar, 22Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This heterogeneous pattern may result from the presence of O-linked carbohydrates. The native antibody glycosylation pattern is characterized by biantennary, fucosylated complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 1, b and c), heterogeneous with respect to terminal galactose content. GE-hIgG1 antibodies were produced in a cell line overexpressing β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), an enzyme catalyzing the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc (Fig. 1a) to the β-mannose of the core. Two different GE antibody variants were generated; Glyco-1 was produced by overexpression of GnT-III alone and Glyco-2 by co-expression of GnT-III and recombinant Man-II (Ref. 7Ferrara C. Brünker P. Suter T. Moser S. Püntener U. Umaña P. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1b). Both Glyco-1 and Glyco-2 feature high proportions of bisected, non-fucosylated oligosaccharides (92 and 84%, respectively; Fig. 1c). We have previously shown that both forms give similar increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity relative to native hIgG1 but differ in their reactivity in complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays (7Ferrara C. Brünker P. Suter T. Moser S. Püntener U. Umaña P. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). IgG Oligosaccharide Modifications Lead to Antibodies with Increased Affinity for shFcγRIIIa—The interaction of antibody glycovariants with shFcγRIIIa variants ([Val-158], [Phe-158], and [Val-158/Gln-162]) shFcγRIIb and smFcγRIIb was analyzed by SPR. Binding of shFcγRIIIa[Val-158] to the GE antibodies was up to 50-fold stronger than to the native antibody (KD(Glyco-2) 0.015 μm versus KD(native) 0.75 μm, Table 1). The low affinity polymorphic form of the receptor, shFcγRIIIa[Phe-158], also bound to the GE antibodies with significantly higher affinity than to the native antibody (KD(Glyco-1) 0.27 μm (18-fold), KD(Glyco-2) 0.18 μm (27-fold), KD(native) 5 μm (Table 1)).TABLE 1Summary of affinity constants determined by equilibrium and kinetic analysis Data are the average of two experiments.

To estimate dissociation rates from native IgG dissociation curves were simulated using different rate constants and compared with the experimental data (data not shown). These calculations indicated that the entire increase in affinity upon glycoengineering could be accounted for by decreased dissociation rate constant (koff). The association rate constants (kon values) of the two polymorphic forms of shFcγRIIIa for GE antibodies were similar, but the dissociation rate of sFcγRIIIa[Phe-158] was significantly faster and largely accounts for the lower affinity of this receptor (Table 1). The affinity of the antibodies for human and murine FcγRIIb was also measured. GE and native IgGs bound the human inhibitory receptor shFcγRIIb with similar affinity (KD = 1.6–2.4 μm, Table 1). For the murine version of this receptor the affinity for human IgG1 was also unaltered by antibody glycoengineering, but surprisingly was 3.4–5.5 times that of the human FcγRIIb receptor (Table 1). The dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of the native antibody with sh/mFcγRIIb could only be determined by steady state analysis (Table 1) because the equilibrium was attained too quickly for a kinetic evaluation (Fig. 2a). FcγRIIIa Glycosylation Regulates Binding to Antibody Glycovariants—A mutant form of hFcγRIIIa that is not glycosylated at Asn-162 (shFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162]) was used to analyze the influence of the receptor’s carbohydrate on complex formation with IgG. Interestingly, upon removal of N-glycosylation at Asn-162, native IgG showed a 3-fold increase (KD = 0.24 versus 0.75 μm) in affinity for the receptor, whereas GE antibodies showed an over 13-fold decrease in affinity (Table 1). For binding to GE antibodies, removal of the receptor glycosylation site resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in kon but an over 14-fold increase in koff (Table 1). Steady state and kinetically determined KD values differed by 1.6–2.2-fold for binding of shFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] to the antibodies. This discrepancy most likely results from a high error in fitting the very fast dissociation phase. The SPR-based results were corroborated using Jurkat cells expressing membrane bound FcγRIIIa, which represents a natural environment for FcγRIIIa expression (23Braakman E. van de Winkel J.G. van Krimpen B.A. Jansze M. Bolhuis R.L. Cell Immunol. 1992; 143: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We used the anti-FcγRIII mAb 3G8, which does not discriminate between FcγRIIIa[Val-158] and FcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] (24Drescher B. Witte T. Schmidt R.E. Immunology. 2003; 110: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), to monitor FcγRIII expression in these cell lines. In this experiment GE antibodies bound FcγRIIIa[Val-158] better than the native antibody (Fig. 3c). Binding to FcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] was, however, significantly reduced for all IgG variants, including native IgG (Fig. 3c). The very fast dissociation rate constants found in the SPR experiment for binding of FcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162] to all three IgG variants could explain the lower binding in the cellular assay. Kinetic Analysis of the FcγRIIIa/IgG Interaction—Overall our measured KD values for the interaction of IgG1 with glycosylated FcγRIIIa agree with those previously published by Okazaki et al. (25Okazaki A. Shoji-Hosaka E. Nakamura K. Wakitani M. Uchida K. Kakita S. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Shitara K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that the affinity increase of the non-fucosylated (GE) antibody is predominantly caused by an increase in kon. In contrast, although we could not quantify kon and koff for binding to native IgG due to the high velocity of the reaction, comparison of the binding curves for native and GE antibodies clearly shows significantly faster dissociation of the receptor variants from native IgG (Fig. 2a). We conclude that upon antibody glycoengineering either new interactions between the binding partners are formed or the present ones are improved. Importantly, we showed that glycoengineered antibodies bind with significantly higher affinity to the more common low affinity variant of FcγRIIIa than native antibodies do to the less common high affinity variant of the receptor. This gives the hope of improving anti-cancer antibody therapies for people with this allelic variant. The Glycosylation of FcγRIIIa at Asn-162 Modulates Binding to Antibodies—FcγRIIIa of mammalian origin is a highly glycosylated protein with five N-linked glycosylation sites. From the crystal structure of IgG1-Fc in complex with unglycosylated FcγRIII (14Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), glycosylation at Asn-162 in FcγRIII has been hypothesized to reduce affinity for native IgG1 due to steric hindrance exerted by the hFcγRIIIa[Asn-162] carbohydrate moiety. This has been confirmed with the appropriate glycosylation mutant of FcγRIII, while removal of carbohydrates at the other four N-glycosylation sites did not affect affinity for native IgG (24Drescher B. Witte T. Schmidt R.E. Immunology. 2003; 110: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further investigate the importance of glycosylation of IgG and FcγRIIIa for their interaction, a mutant version of the high affinity receptor which is unglycosylated at position 162 (shFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162]) was constructed. As expected, removal of the carbohydrate at Asn-162 of the receptor increased binding affinity for the native antibody (3-fold, Table 1). On the other hand, removal of the FcγRIIIa’s carbohydrate at Asn-162 unexpectedly led to reduced binding affinity for GE antibodies by over an order of magnitude, bringing the affinity down to the level observed for the native antibody. The data were corroborated in a cellular assay system, where GE antibodies bound significantly better to hFcγRIIIa[Val-158]- than to hFcγRIIIa[Val-158/Gln-162]-expressing cells (Fig. 3c). In summary, two requirements have to be met for high affinity interaction between GE IgG and FcγRIII; a carbohydrate has to be attached at FcγRIII’s Asn-162, and productive contacts of this receptor carbohydrate with the IgG-Fc can only be made if the latter is non-fucosylated. Based on these results we propose a model in which the Asn-162-linked carbohydrate of FcγRIII contacts a region of the IgG-Fc where a fucose residue is attached in native antibodies. This fucose residue protrudes from the continuous surface of the Fc into open space and may prohibit a close approach of the Fc receptor carbohydrate core, thereby precluding additional productive interactions (Fig. 4). It should be noted that a complete overlap with the mentioned Fc region is attained by a receptor carbohydrate with as few three monossacharide units (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the model predicts that only one of the two Fc-fucose residues needs to be absent for increased binding affinity toward FcγRIII. In a recent study Okazaki et al. (25Okazaki A. Shoji-Hosaka E. Nakamura K. Wakitani M. Uchida K. Kakita S. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Shitara K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) proposed that non-fucosylated antibodies bind FcγRIIIa with increased affinity as a result of a newly formed bond between Tyr-296 of the Fc and Lys-128 of the FcγRIIIa. However, we found that the increased affinity of non-fucosylated antibodies depends on glycosylation of the receptor which implies that an IgG-Fc[Tyr-296]/FcγRIIIa[Lys-128] bond is insignificant to the affinity between GE antibodies and FcγRIIIa. FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb forms are the only forms of the human FcγRs that possess N-glycosylation sites within the binding region to IgG. We therefore conclude that affinity for IgG will be influenced by receptor glycosylation only for these two FcγRs. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of FcγRIII from other species indicates that the N-glycosylation site Asn-162 is shared by FcγRIII from macaca, cat, cow, and pig, whereas it is lacking in the known rat and mouse FcγRIII. Recently mouse (CD16-2) and rat (GenBank™ accession number AY219230) genes with high homology to the human FcγRIII and which encode proteins containing the Asn-162 glycosylation site were identified (26Mechetina L.V. Najakshin A.M. Alabyev B.Y. Chikaev N.A. Taranin A.V. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and functional expression of the murine protein was recently reported (27Nimmerjahn F. Bruhns P. Horiuchi K. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 2005; 23: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The presence of a FcγRIIIa-Asn-162 glycosylation site may enable the immune system to tune the affinity toward FcγRIII by differential FcγRIII glycosylation (21Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3849-3857Google Scholar) and by modulation of the fucose content of IgG. The Immunological Balance between Activating and Inhibitory FcγRs—It has been proposed that an improvement in the ratio of activating to inhibitory signals should enhance the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies (28Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). In the current study, the inhibitory shFcγRIIb receptor was found to have a similar affinity for native and GE antibodies (Table 1). The inhibitory receptors sFcγRIIbs from mouse and human are not glycosylated at Asn-162. The lack of discrimination for GE antibodies displayed by FcγRIIb is consistent with glycosylation of activating FcγRIII at Asn-162 being essential for increased binding to non-fucosylated IgGs and suggests that these GE antibodies could show enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The finding that murine FcγRII has significantly higher affinity than human FcγRIIb for both native and GE hIgG1 may be important for the correct interpretation of in vivo experiments using mouse models. Enhanced binding to the inhibitory receptor in a mouse model may result in a different threshold of the immune response than that observed in humans. We demonstrated the importance of the carbohydrate moieties of both FcγRIII and IgG for their interaction. Our data provide further insight into the complex formation and identified an important interaction between the Asn-162 carbohydrate of FcγRIII and the Fc of non-fucosylated IgG glycoforms. This finding should allow the design of new antibody variants that make further productive interactions with the carbohydrate of FcγRIIIa, which may impact on future therapies with monoclonal antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1971776337,"Here we describe a novel collagen belonging to the class of von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain-containing proteins. This novel protein was identified by screening the EST data base and was subsequently recombinantly expressed and characterized as an authentic tissue component. The COL28A1 gene on human chromosome 7p21.3 and on mouse chromosome 6A1 encodes a novel protein that structurally resembles the beaded filament-forming collagens. The collagenous domain contains several very short interruptions arranged in a repeat pattern. As shown for other novel minor collagens, the expression of collagen XXVIII protein in mouse is very restricted. In addition to small amounts in skin and calvaria, the major signals were in dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. By immunoelectron microscopy, collagen XXVIII was detected in the sciatic nerve, at the basement membrane of certain Schwann cells surrounding the nerve fibers. Even though the protein is present in the adult sciatic nerve, collagen XXVIII mRNA was only detected in sciatic nerve of newborn mice, indicating that the protein persists for an extended period after synthesis.

Even though the protein is present in the adult sciatic nerve, collagen XXVIII mRNA was only detected in sciatic nerve of newborn mice, indicating that the protein persists for an extended period after synthesis. The collagen superfamily covers a variety of subclasses. Most of these genes are unique to vertebrates and only some collagens are conserved throughout the animal kingdom (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), indicating that most collagens have evolved in parallel with the appearance of an internal skeleton. Up to date 42 genes of this family have been described and the different polypeptides can be assembled into at least 28 distinct trimeric collagens. The importance of collagens is well established through the study of more than 1300 different mutations found in collagen genes (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The first collagens were identified through biochemical purification and amino acid sequencing. In a second wave, with the help of cDNA library screening methods, several additional collagens were found. Recently, the information provided by genome projects allowed the identification of yet not described members. One of the reasons for the late discovery of these collagens is the fact that they are minor components and often expressed at very specific sites. VWA 3The abbreviations used are: VWA, von Willebrand factor A; FACIT, fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices; RT, reverse transcriptase; EST, expressed sequence tag. domains are found in a variety of proteins, e.g. the prototype von Willebrand factor, collagens, matrilins, and integrins (2Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The functions of the VWA domains are to facilitate protein-protein interactions. For example, the VWA domains present in the integrin α1β1 and α2β1 receptors are responsible for the interaction with fibrillar collagens (3Nolte M. Pepinsky R.B. Venyaminov S. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P.J. Karpusas M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). VWA domains are also found in collagen VI (beaded filament-forming collagen) as well as in collagen VII (anchoring fibril-forming collagen). In addition, several members of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens) also contain VWA domains (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Collagens can be found in all the tissues throughout the vertebrate body and are important for tissue integrity. In the peripheral nervous system, they are present in the endoneurium in the form of fibrillar collagens and as components of the basement membranes surrounding the processes of Schwann cells and perineurial cells. One of the fibrillar collagen chains, collagen α4(V), is predominantly expressed in the developing nerve (4Rothblum K. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51282-51288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The basement membrane is essential for the integrity of myelinated nerves. As demonstrated in several studies, the removal of laminin chains or of the corresponding receptors lead to neuropathy (demyelinated type), characterized by the presence of naked axons (5Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2005; 10: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study we identified and characterized the novel collagen XXVIII in the mouse and human and showed that it is mainly a component of the basement membranes around Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. RT-PCR and 5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—RT-PCR was used to clone the mouse and human collagen XXVIII cDNAs. Primers were designed according to EST and genomic sequences deposited in the data bases (Table 1). To prevent mutations in the RT-PCR we used the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics). The mouse full-length clone was amplified using primer pairs c28m-1/c28m-5 and c28m-6/c28m-7 and the partial sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse cDNA AJ890450 was amplified using the primer pair c28m-8/c28m-9 from cDNA of epiphyseal cartilage of newborn mice. The human cDNA was cloned from mRNA prepared from human lung using primer pairs c28h-1/c28h-2, c28h-3/c28h-4, and c28h-5/c28h-6.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primer sequencesNameSequence 5′ → 3′Positiona(f), forward; (r) reverse.c28m-1TCTTCATCAAACCCCTGCC1-20 (f)c28m-2ACCCGCTGCTTAAATGTCC492-474 (r)c28m-3GCCCACTAGTTGCCATTTGCTTCATAGATGTTG256-278 (f)c28m-4CACGCGGCCGCTCATTGTTTAATGCAGGTTTCTCG3556-3533 (r)c28m-5TCCTTTCTGAGCATCACCC961-943 (r)c28m-6ATTATGCCATCTCCAATGCC531-550 (f)c28m-7AACTCTCTGTCTCCCCACAC4230-4211 (r)c28m-8CCTGGCATGCCTGGTCTTAAAGGA1-24 (f)c28m-9TGGGGTCAAGAGGTTAGCAG710-690 (r)c28m-10AACTCTAGAGGGCCCAAATGCAAAGAGAC3089-2515 (f)c28m-11GTGGGATCCTTAGGAGTCAAAATCTTCACAAA3070-3089 (r)c28h-1TAACTTCACCCCCAACCAC1-19 (f)c28h-2TCCCTTCTCACATTCACAAATC852-831 (r)c28h-3GTAAGGATGGTGTGAAAGTGG563-583 (f)c28h-4ATTAGCCACCTTCTCCACC2670-2652 (r)c28h-5TGGGAAAGAAAGGTGATAAAGG2348-2369 (f)c28h-6AGACAGGCCAATTTACTTGC3515-3496 (r)a (f), forward; (r) reverse. Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of newborn and adult C57BL/6J mice by the guanidinium thiocyanate method. mRNA from limbs of newborn mice was prepared by using the QuickPrep®Mikro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots (3 μg) were electrophoresed on a 0.8% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted, and hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe (nucleotides 2320-3243). The conditions for the last two wash steps were: 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min each. The blots were developed using CDP-Star (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Collagen XXVIII and Its VWA2 Domain—VWA domains expressed in bacteria are often correctly folded after purification (6Dumas J.J. Kumar R. McDonagh T. Sullivan F. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and suited for the generation of specific antisera. Therefore the collagen XXVIII VWA2 cDNA was generated by PCR on the full-length cDNA. The primer pair c28m-10/c28m-11 introduced a 5′ terminal XbaI and a 3′ terminal BamHI restriction site. The cDNA was cloned into a modified pGEX vector carrying a glutathione S-transferase His6 tag with a thrombin cleavage site. Escherichia coli cells (Rosetta®DE3, Novagen) were transformed with the recombinant plasmid. The bacteria were induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside and grown for 16 h at 28 °C. The cells were treated with lysozyme and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche). After centrifugation (30 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) the supernatant was concentrated on glutathione SuperFlow Resin (Clontech) and the protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Thrombin cleavage was performed overnight at room temperature (1 unit/mg thrombin, 5 mm CaCl2) and the cleaved off glutathione S-transferase His6 tags were removed by passing the solution over a glutathione SuperFlow column. For the expression of full-length murine collagen XXVIII, cDNA was generated by PCR on the full-length cDNA. Suitable primers (c28m-3/c28m-4) introduced a 5′ SpeI and a 3′ NotI restriction site. The amplified PCR product was inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu (7Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The vector contained an N-terminal His6 tag (7Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of the SpeI site. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation. The cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) and transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for harvest of the recombinant protein. After filtration and centrifugation (1 h, 10,000 × g), the cell culture supernatant was applied to TALON Metal Affinity Resin (BD Biosciences) and the protein was eluted with 100 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Collagenase Digestion—For assessment of the domain structure of collagen XXII, the recombinant protein was subjected to collagenase digestion. The incubation with 40 units/ml of highly purified bacterial collagenase (CLOSA, Worthington Biochemicals) was carried out in 50 μl of elution buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm Pefablock (Roche) for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Preparation of Antibodies to the Collagen XXVIII VWA2 Domain—The purified recombinant VWA2 protein was used to immunize a rabbit. The antiserum obtained was purified by affinity chromatography on a column with antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The specific antibody, termed pAb KR43, was eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.5, and the eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Sequential Extraction of Collagen XXVIII from Mouse Sciatic Nerves—The extraction was performed as described before (8Ko Y. Kobbe B. Nicolae C. Miosge N. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Aszodi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sciatic nerves were weighed and frozen at -80 °C. On the day of extraction, the specimens were cut into 1-mm3 pieces. 10 volumes (ml/g wet tissue) of chilled buffer 1 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) was added, and the tissue was extracted for 7-10 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants stored at -20 °C. The pellets were re-extracted in an identical manner with buffer 2 (1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and the remaining insoluble material with buffer 3 (4 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). All extraction buffers contained 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Aliquots (100 μl), extracted with buffers I, II, or III were precipitated with 1 ml of 96% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with a mixture of 9 volumes of 96% ethanol and 1 volume of Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. After centrifugation the pellets were air dried and suspended in 150 μl of water and the same volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. Aliquots were applied to 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Determination of the N-terminal Sequence—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For immunoblots the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with the appropriate affinity-purified rabbit antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% low fat milk powder. Bound antibodies were detected by luminescence using peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), 3-amin-opthalhydrazide (1.25 mm), p-coumaric acid (225 μm), and 0.01% H2O2. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen embedded sections of fetal (E18.5), newborn (P1), and 4-week-old mice. The frozen sections were preincubated in ice-cold methanol for 2 min. The sections were blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with the primary antibody pAb KR43 overnight at 4 °C. Double immunofluorescence labeling and microscopy were performed as described previously (10Sengle G. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50240-50249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody KR43, a rat monoclonal nidogen-1 antibody (JF3) directed against the G1 domain (11Ries A. Göhring W. Fox J.W. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a mouse monoclonal antibody (NF-01) directed against the heavy neurofilament protein (Abcam), a rabbit antiserum directed against galactocerebroside (Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab14688) directed against S100β (Abcam), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against myelin basic protein (12Uschkureit T. Spörkel O. Stracke J. Büssow H. Stoffel W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5225-5233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a Cy3®-conjugated affinity pure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), a Cy2-conjugated affinity purified Fab fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova), an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes), an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and a Cy3-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (Sigma). The KR43 antibody was biotinylated using Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FluoroMyelin® Red (Molecular Probes) was used as a myelin stain. Immunoelectron Microscopy—The sciatic nerve was diced into 1 × 1-mm pieces and immersed in primary KR43 antibody diluted 1:5 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight at 4 °C. The tissue was washed in medium for 4 h, and then immersed in 10-nm gold-labeled secondary antibody diluted 1:3 in medium overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive wash in medium, the tissue was immersed in gold enhancement solution, rinsed, fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde, 1.5% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% tannic acid, osmicated, and prepared for transmission electron microscopy by a standard protocol. Cloning of Human and Mouse Collagen XXVIII cDNAs—In a screen of the genomic data base with collagen and matrilin sequences as query, a gene was identified in both the human and mouse genome that codes for a new VWA domain-containing collagen that was designated as the α1 chain of the next available number in the collagen family, collagen XXVIII. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR using primers deduced from the genomic sequence and sequenced. The mouse collagen XXVIII cDNA of 4,230 bp (accession number AJ890449) contains an open reading frame of 3,423 bp, encoding a protein consisting of 1,141 amino acid residues preceded by a signal peptide of either 20 or 23 residues, as predicted by a method using neural networks or hidden Markov models, respectively (13Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5660) Google Scholar). The mature secreted protein has a calculated Mr of either 116,414 or 116,095 (Fig. 1A) and consists of a N-terminal VWA domain followed by a 528-amino acid residue collagenous domain, which has altogether 16 very short imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat. The C terminus is made up by a second VWA domain followed by module without homology to any other protein domain and a domain related to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor/Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors (Kunitz domain; Fig. 1, A and B). The human cDNA of 3,515 bp (accession number AJ890451) has an open reading frame of 3,375 bp and an overall identity of 85.9% to the mouse ortholog in the coding region (Fig. 1A). The human protein has a predicted signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues and the mature secreted protein an Mr of 113,917. The domain structure is identical to that of the mouse collagen XXVIII. The overall identity at the amino acid level is 86.5%. The identity is lowest (63.9%) in the unique domain, which in addition is 16 amino acid residues shorter in human, because a deletion of the splice donor site present in mouse. The identity is highest in the collagenous domain (91.5%) (Fig. 1A). Alternative Splicing of Collagen XXVIII—Splice variants leading to premature stop codons were detected in human and mouse. In a partial mouse cDNA clone (AJ890450) intron 24 (Fig. 5) is not spliced, which if translated would lead to a protein that contains most of the collagenous domain but lacks the second VWA domain and the Kunitz domain. The human partial cDNA clone AJ890452, which splices to an alternative exon within intron 24 (Fig. 5), would encode a similar protein. The human partial cDNA clone AJ890453 contains an additional exon in intron 7 (Fig. 5) that includes a stop codon and would lead to a protein that lacks most of the collagenous domain. In addition, other mouse and human EST clones representing alternatively spliced mRNAs are present in the data bases. However, none of the splice variant clones or EST sequences is full-length and therefore their complete protein sequences are not known. Analysis of the Collagenous Domain of Collagen XXVIII—The 528-amino acid residue long collagenous domain contains 12 GXG and four GXXXXG imperfections that are uniformly distributed along the sequence. The sizes and positions of these imperfections are completely conserved between man and mouse (Fig. 1). In mouse, eight of the amino acid residues at the X position of the 12 GXG motifs are hydrophobic and the sequence GIG occurs five times. In human, the isoleucine is replaced by valine in two positions. The length of the perfect GXY triplet segments between the imperfections varies and lays between 19 and 82 residues. The longer non-interrupted sequences are equally distributed in the middle and at both ends of the collagenous domain (Fig. 1). At the Y position of the GXY triplets the lysine content is relatively high (20%), whereas the content of proline is normal in the X and Y positions (32%). The lysine residues are often part of a KG(D/E) motif that has been shown to contribute to the stability of the triple helix (14Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and that occurs in 12.9% of the triplets of collagen XXVIII. In the N- and C-terminal ends of the collagenous domain a CXC motif is present, which could be used for formation of disulfide bonds between the chains. An unpaired cysteine residue is present in the longest non-interrupted N-terminal collagenous segment. An RGD motif is found at the C-terminal end of the collagenous domain in both mouse and man. Analysis of the Collagen XXVIII VWA Domains and the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor/Kunitz Family of Serine Protease Inhibitors Domain—The metal ion-dependent adhesion site (D-X-S-X-S-X-nT-X-nD), is fully conserved only in the VWA2 domain (Fig. 2). As in human and mouse matrilin-3, in the VWA1 domain of collagen XXVIII the threonine is replaced by a serine. Sequence alignment of the mouse collagen XXVIII VWA domains with their counterparts in selected matrilins and collagens highlights the homology (Fig. 2). The sequence identity between the two mouse collagen XXVIII VWA domains is only 22.9%, the similarity is 40.0%. Higher identity values were obtained for the VWA2 domain of mouse matrilin-2 and the mouse collagen XXVIII VWA2 domain (32.2%), and the VWA domain of mouse matrilin-3 and the mouse collagen XXVIII VWA2 domain (27.6%). Of the various VWA domains found in collagen, the VWA1 domain of α2(VI) collagen has the highest identity value (20.9%). In phylogenetic analyses using protein distance and protein parsimony the collagen XXVIII VWA domains cluster to the VWA domains of collagen α1(VI) and α2(VI) (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Phylogenetic trees of the VWA domains of collagen XXVIII. The sequences of the VWA domains of collagen XXVIII, collagen α1(VI), and α2(VI) and matrilins from mouse were aligned using the PILEUP program of WISCONSIN PACKAGE version 10.3 (Accelrys Inc.). The trees were constructed using the programs PROTEIN DISTANCE, NEAREST NEIGHBOUR, and CONSENSE (A) and PROTEIN PARSIMONY and CONSENSE (B)of PHYLIP package version 3.5. Bootstrap analyses using 100 replicates were performed to show the significance. The numbers indicate the statistical weight of the individual branches. The VWA1 domain of AMACO was used as an outgroup.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Kunitz domain at the C-terminal end (Fig. 1) contains the full consensus pattern (F-X(3)-G-C-X(6)-[FY]-X(5)-C). A BLAST search with the collagen XXVIII Kunitz domain revealed that the Kunitz domains of papilin and α3(VI) collagen are most related and are 48 and 45% identical, respectively, whereas the Kunitz domain of α1(VII) collagen is only 33% identical. Recombinant Expression of Mouse Collagen XXVIII VWA Domains and Generation of Antisera—Recombinant expression of full-length collagen XXVIII yielded insufficient protein amounts to be used in immunization. Therefore the cDNA encoding the collagen XXVIII VWA2 domain was expressed in bacteria (not shown). It has been shown earlier that VWA domains expressed in bacteria are often correctly folded after purification (6Dumas J.J. Kumar R. McDonagh T. Sullivan F. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and therefore suited for the generation of specific antisera. The purified VWA2 domain was used to immunize a rabbit. Recombinant Expression of Full-length Mouse Collagen XXVIII—cDNA encoding the sequence of full-length mouse collagen XXVIII was cloned into the pCEP-Pu vector utilizing the BM40 secretion signal sequence and an N-terminal His6 tag (7Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells and maintained in an episomal form. The recombinant collagen XXVIII protein was secreted into the cell culture medium and appeared in reducing SDS-PAGE as a band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼135,000, which is in the range expected for monomeric collagen XXVIII (Fig. 4, A and B). A band corresponding to the homotrimeric form of collagen XXVIII could be detected in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). After reduction this band disappeared (Fig. 4A). Only minor amounts of recombinant collagen XXVIII could be purified by affinity chromatography on a TALON® column. However, these were sufficient to perform a collagenase digestion (Fig. 4B). In immunoblots the major band running at ∼135,000 Da nearly completely disappeared and a band at ∼60,000 Da appeared. As the immunoblot was developed using the antiserum directed against the VWA2 domain, this band represents the C-terminal half of the protein. Structure of the Collagen COL28A1 Genes—The human and mouse collagen XXVIII genes map to syntenic regions on chromosomes 7 (7p21.3) and 6 (6A1), respectively. Upstream in both cases lie the genes coding for a hypothetical protein containing a WD40 domain, the replication protein A3, glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1, the islet cell autoantigen 1, and neurexophilin 1. Downstream of the collagen XXVIII genes lies the gene coding for core 1 UDP-galactose:N-acetyl-galactosamine-α-(R)β1,3-galactosyltransferase, which represents the end of the syntenic region. Both collagen XXVIII genomic sequences (human, NT_007819, NT_079592, NT_086703; mouse, NT_039340) are completely contained in the public data bases, except for a short gap in the first intron of the mouse gene. We identified exons by flanking consensus splice signals and comparison with the respective cDNAs. The exon/intron organization of the two genes is very similar (Fig. 5; Table 2) regarding size, exon, and intron length and codon phase. The human gene is 178 kb, the mouse gene 195 kb long, and both collagen XXVIII genes consist of 34 exons that code for the translated part of the mRNA. In addition, in mouse and man an exon 0 exists that encodes the 5′ untranslated region. Exon 1 codes for the signal peptide sequence, whereas the first VWA domain is encoded by exons 2 and 3, the collagenous domains by exons 4-29, and the second VWA domain by exons 31 and 32, respectively. Exon 30 codes for a short spacer region. The unique domain is encoded by exon 33, the only exon that differs in size between man and mouse. The Kunitz domain and the 3′ UTR are encoded by exon 34. In both the human and mouse genes the splice donor site at the 5′ end of intron 28 contains the non-canonical GC dinucleotide instead of GT. Interestingly, an mouse EST clone (CR519347) exists where exon 28 is spliced out and exon 27 is directly spliced to exon 29. In addition, here exon 29 is spliced to an alternative exon within intron 29, which would lead to a protein that contains most of the collagenous domain but lacks the second VWA and the Kunitz domain, similar to the splice variants described above.TABLE 2Splice junction sites in the human and murine COL28A1 genesExonSizeaThe lengths of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs are not included.Splice donorIntronSizeSplice acceptorCodon phaseAmino acid interuptedbpbp0H5′UTRATAAGgtaaga02837tctattaaagGTG0M5′UTRAACAGgtcaga0∼16208ccatttcaagGTG1HSigPep161CCAGGgtaaaa1847tctgtttcagGCTIGly1MSigPep161CCAGGgtaaaa1509tctctttcagATGIAsp2HVWA 1A557GTCTGgtaggt27098tcccttgtagGAT0Leu/Asp2MVWA 1A557GCCTGgtaggt25529ccccttctagGGT0Leu/Gly3HVWA 1B21AGAAGgtaagc32267attgattcagTGT0Lys/Cys3MVWA 1B21GGAAGgtaagc31451gctgatttagTGT0Lys/Cys4HCol157CTCCTgtgagt41789ttgccttcagGGT0Pro/Gly4MCol157CTCCTgtgagt41392ttgctttagGGT0Pro/Gly5HCol254ACCCGgtaaat52224tttgtcacagGGC0Pro/Gly5MCol254ACCCGgtaaat52007tttgttgcagGGT0Pro/Gly6HCol342CAGGGgtatgt61955tttaaattagGGA0Gly/Gly6MCol342CTGTGgtatgt62386tttaaactagGGA0Val/Gly7HCol427ACAAGgtaagt74678tattttttagGGT0Lys/Gly7MCol427ACAAGgtaagt74025ttatttatagGGT0Lys/Gly8HCol545ACAAGgtaagg83929tattccacagGGA0Lys/Gly8MCol545ACAAAgtaagg82722tattctacagGGA0Lys/Gly9HCol645TTCAGgtaagg91049cctggagcagGGA0Gln/Gly9MCol645TTCAGgtaagg91162cttggagcagGGC0Gln/Gly10HCol754ATAAGgtaatc1015367cttcctccagGGT0Lys/Gly10MCol754ATAAGgtacac1025339tctattctagGGT0Lys/Gly11HCol869TTAAGgtaaag111120tttctcttagGGA0Lys/Gly11MCol869TTAAGgtagag111386cctgtctcagGGT0Lys/Gly12HCol969AGCCAgtaagt1212208tcctaaccagGGT0Pro/Gly12MCol969AGCCAgtaagt1220620ccctaaccagGGT0Pro/Gly13HCol1069CAAAGgtaaca132442gtactttcagGGT0Lys/Gly13MCol1069CTAAGgtaaca133033ttgcttttagGGT0Lys/Gly14HCol1169AGAAGgtactg1418488ttctgtgcagGGG0Lys/Gly14MCol1169ATAAGgtattg146398atttgacagGGG0Lys/Gly15HCol1269AACAGgtaatt152535tattttaaagGGA0Gln/Gly15MCol1269AGCAGgtaagc153894tattctgaagGGG0Gln/Gly16HCol1369CCAAGgtaact161052ttcttactagGGA0Lys/Gly16MCol1369CTAAGgtaatt161153tccttcccagGGA0Lys/Gly17HCol1469CAAAGgtgagt177829cattcaccagGGA0Lys/Gly17MCol1469CAAAGgtgagc174837tatccaccagGGG0Lys/Gly18HCol1572AGAAGgtaaca18764ttttctctagGGA0Lys/Gly18MCol1572AGAAGgtaatc18756ttccctccagGGA0Lys/Gly19HCol1672CCAAGgtatgg192723attttgttagGGT0Lys/Gly19MCol1669CCAAGgtatgc192301attctgtcagGGT0Lys/Gly20HCol1772CAAAGgtatgt203327tctttttaagGGT0Lys/Gly20MCol1772CAAAGgtatgt203362gttgtctcagGGA0Lys/Gly21HCol1869CAAAGgtatat21930aaatgtacagGGA0Lys/Gly21MCol1869CAAAGgtatat21539aaattgacagGGA0Lys/Gly22HCol1969CAAAGgtatgc223694atttacccagGGT0Lys/Gly22MCol1969CAAAGgtatga223790atttttacagGGT0Lys/Gly23HCol2069TGCCTgtaagt2390gtcatctcagGGA0Pro/Gly23MCol2069TGGCTgtaagt23429atcaccttagGGA0Ala/Gly24HCol2169CAAAGgtaaga2412519gtcttttcagGGA0Lys/Gly24MCol2169CAAAGgtaaga2413047gtcttttcagGGA0Lys/Gly25HCol2269CAAAGgtgagt251957cttctaacagGGT0Lys/Gly25MCol2269CAAAGgtgagc252855cttttcacagGGT0Lys/Gly26HCol2369TTAAAgtaagt2636246tcctatgtagGGG0Lys/Gly26MCol2369TTAAAgtaagt2636492tctcatatagGGG0Lys/Gly27HCol2469AGAAGgtaagt27681ttgtgtaaaGGGA0Lys/Gly27MCol2469AGAAGgtaagt27436cttt"

https://openalex.org/W2010224007,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Genes expressed only in cancer tissue will be useful molecular markers for diagnosis and may also be good therapeutic targets. However, little is known about cancer-specific genes, at least in GC. In this study, we searched for GC-specific genes by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)–PCR. Comparing GC SAGE libraries with those of various normal tissues in the SAGEmap database, we identified 54 candidate GC-specific genes. Quantitative RT–PCR analysis of these candidates revealed that APin protein (APIN), taxol resistance-associated gene 3 (TRAG3), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily W, polypeptide 1 (CYP2W1), melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA), matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10), dickkopf homolog 4 (DKK4), GW112, regenerating islet-derived family, member 4 (REGIV), and HORMA domain-containing 1 (HORMAD1) were expressed much more highly in GC than in 14 kinds of normal tissues. Immunohistochemical staining for MIA, MMP-10, and DKK4 was found in 47 (31.1%), 68 (45.0%), and two (1.3%) of 151 GCs, respectively, and staining for both MIA and MMP-10 was correlated with poor prognosis in advanced GC (P=0.0001 and 0.0141, respectively). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed high levels of MMP-10 (65/69, 94.2%) in serum samples from patients with GC. Levels of MIA were raised in a small proportion of serum samples from patients with GC (4/69, 5.8%). In Boyden chamber invasion assays, MIA-transfected GC cells were up to three times more invasive than cells transfected with empty vector. Taken together, these results suggest that MMP-10 is a good marker for the detection of GC and that MIA and MMP-10 are prognostic factors for GC. As expression of MIA and MMP-10 is narrowly restricted in cancer, these two molecules may be good therapeutic targets for GC."
https://openalex.org/W2158080871,"KAI1/CD82, a tetraspanin protein, was first identified as a metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer. How loss of CD82 expression promotes cancer metastasis is unknown. Restoration of CD82 expression to physiological levels in the metastatic prostate cell line PC3 inhibits integrin-mediated cell migration and invasion, but does not affect integrin expression. Integrin-dependent activation of the receptor kinase c-Met is dramatically reduced in CD82-expressing cells, as is c-Met activation by its ligand HGF/SF. CD82 expression also reduced integrin-induced activation and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src, and its downstream substrates p130Cas and FAK Y861. Inhibition of c-Met expression or Src kinase function reduced matrigel invasion of PC3 cells to the same extent as CD82 expression. These data indicate that CD82 functions to suppress integrin-induced invasion by regulating signaling to c-Met and Src kinases, and suggests that CD82 loss may promote metastasis by removing a negative regulator of c-Met and Src signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2093767005,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)α expression was found in ovarian cancer cells and tumors by microarray hybridization. This led us to test whether ovarian cancers also produce ligands for this receptor, as this would demonstrate that such malignancies support their own growth and spread through autocrine activation. We assayed the expression of ligands for the PDGFR in ovarian tumors, cell lines and peritoneal fluid using RT–PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ELISA. We detected strong mRNA expression for the PDGFRα ligands in most ovarian tumors. Receptor and ligand expressions (PDGFRα and PDGF AB) were also detected by IHC in, respectively, 34 and 32 of 47 ovarian tumors. The stainings for PDGFRα and PDGF AB were strongly correlated (P-value=0.014), suggesting that an autocrine loop is functional in ovarian cancer. PDGF AA and BB were quantified in peritoneal fluid by ELISA. Both ligands are secreted at higher levels in ovarian cancer ascites specimens (n=54) than in fluid from nonmalignant disorders (n=8). PDGF was detected in media conditioned by ovarian cancer cells. Such conditioned media induced activation of the PDGFR, Akt and MAPK and stimulated cell proliferation. A neutralizing PDGF antibody blocked these effects. Specific PDGFR inhibition by siRNA or a neutralizing antibody to the receptor inhibited PDGF-stimulated receptor activation and cell proliferation, suggesting that receptor targeting has a role in ovarian cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1993666748,"The F-box-containing protein Skp2 plays a critical role in coordinating the G1/S transition and progression through the S phase of the mammalian cell cycle. Skp2 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human cancers and the expression level correlates with tumor malignancy. However, the Skp2 gene is neither amplified nor rearranged in most human cancers and the underlying mechanism of Skp2 overexpression remains poorly understood. We show here that the Skp2 gene contains a functional E2F response element (hSRE2). Ectopic expression of E2F1 induces expression of the endogenous Skp2 gene in human fibroblast cells, whereas antisense-mediated knockdown of E2F1 in human tumor cell lines reduces expression of endogenous Skp2 gene. The hSRE2 element not only participates in activation of Skp2 promoter function during normal cell cycle progression into S phase, it is also required for the high-level Skp2 gene expression in many human tumor cell lines. These results reveal Skp2 as a novel target for E2F regulation that is disrupted in several human tumor cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2087659427,"N-terminal tandem GAF domains are present in 5 out of 11 mammalian phosphodiesterase (PDE) families. The ligand for the GAF domains of PDEs 2, 5, and 6 is cGMP, whereas those for PDEs 10 and 11 remained enigmatic for years. Here we used the cyanobacterial cyaB1 adenylyl cyclase, which has an N-terminal tandem GAF domain closely related to those of the mammalian PDEs, as an assay system to identify the ligands for the human PDEs 10 and 11 GAF domains. We report that a chimera between the PDE10 GAF domain and the cyanobacterial cyclase was 9-fold stimulated by cAMP (EC50 = 19.8 μm), whereas cGMP had only low activity. cAMP increased Vmax in a non-cooperative manner and did not affect the Km for ATP of 27 μm. In an analogous chimeric construct with the tandem GAF domain of human PDE11A4, cGMP was identified as an allosteric activator (EC50 = 72.5 μm) that increased Vmax of the cyclase non-cooperatively 4-fold. GAF-B of PDE10 and GAF-A of PDE11A4 contain an invariant NKFDE motif present in all mammalian PDE GAF ensembles. We mutated the aspartates within this motif in both regions and found that intramolecular signaling was considerably reduced or abolished.

Therefore, intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP are strictly regulated by the rate of biosynthesis and degradation by a set of cyclase and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 2The abbreviations used are: PDE, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; AC, adenylyl cyclase. 2The abbreviations used are: PDE, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; AC, adenylyl cyclase. isozymes, respectively (2Martinez S.E.

They have an identical domain organization, i.e. an N-terminal GAF-A domain of ∼160 amino acids is linked via about 30 amino acids to a GAF-B domain of about 160 amino acids. Further, they have considerable sequence similarity, e.g. the rat PDE2 GAF domain is 25% identical and 42% similar to that of the cyanobacterial cyaB1 AC.

Notwithstanding an evolutionary distance of about three billion years, the mammalian and cyanobacterial tandem GAF domains are surprisingly also functionally closely related (14Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y.

The cyanobacterial tandem GAF domain can be substituted by the mammalian GAF domain of PDE2, i.e. the cAMP-activated AC is converted to a cGMP-activated cyclase (23Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In PDE2, cGMP is the allosteric regulator and concurrently the substrate, a situation that poses intractable kinetic problems. In the PDE-cyclase chimera, the allosteric regulator (cGMP) and the substrate (ATP) differ and do not interfere with each other. Here we asked whether we could determine the unknown ligands of the tandem GAF domains of the human PDEs 10 and 11 by constructing chimeras in which they replace the cyanobacterial GAF domains using the AC activity as a convenient assay system. We report that PDE10 is the only family of the mammalian PDEs in which a GAF domain ligand is cAMP, whereas for the PDE11 GAF domain, cGMP is a ligand as it is already known for PDEs 2, 5, and 6. Recombinant DNAs—The cyaB1 gene (gi 15553050) was a gift from Prof. M. Ohmori, University of Tokyo. cDNA clones of human PDEs 10 and 11 (PDE10A1, gi 4894715; PDE11A4, gi 15128482) were provided by Dr. Quintini, AltanaPharma, Konstanz, Germany. Nucleotides were purchased from either Roche Diagnostics or Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). PDE10A-GAF-CyaB1-Adenylyl Cyclase Chimeras—The N-terminal tandem GAF domain of PDE10A1 (amino acids Leu-14-His-422) was amplified by PCR. It was cloned via BamHI and SalI sites in front of the CyaB1 AC (amino acids 386-859) in Bluescript II SK(-) generating PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859. The PDE10 GAF-B domain mutation D397A was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using nearby restriction sites for cloning (BamHI and HindIII) producing PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859D397A. Both PDE10/cyaB1 constructs were transferred into expression vector pRSETA using a 5′-BamHI and a 3′-PstI site. This added an N-terminal MRGSH6GM affinity tag. PDE11A-GAF-CyaB1-Adenylyl Cyclase Chimeras—The tandem GAF domain (Lys-197-Lys-568) of PDE11A4 was amplified by PCR. The product was inserted into the cyaB1 AC via SfuI and SalI sites and replaced the cyaB1 tandem GAF domain (Gln-49 to Leu-385) in Blue-script II SK(-). The cyanobacterial N terminus was retained in this construct (CyaB11-50PDE11A4197-568cyaB1386-859). Secondly, the PDE11A4 tandem GAF domain including its N terminus (Met-1-Lys-568) was amplified by PCR and cloned in front of the CyaB1 AC (amino acids 386-859) via its BamHI and SalI sites in Bluescript II SK(-) generating PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859. Finally, the PDE11/cyaB1 constructs were transferred into the expression vector pET16b via 5′-NdeI and 3′-XhoI sites. This added an N-terminal MGH10SSGHIEGRH affinity tag. The mutation D355A in GAF-A was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using restriction sites located nearby (SacI and MfeI) generating PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859D355A. All primer sequences are available on request. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pRep4). Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 mg of ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin. Usually, expression was induced with 200 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6, and the culture was continued overnight at 16-19 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (PDE11) or pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (PDE10) at 4 °C, and stored at -80 °C. For purification, cells were lysed at 1000 p.s.i. with a French press in lysis buffer (PDE10, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 15 mm imidazole; PDE11, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C. After removal of debris (48,000 × g, 45 min), aNi2+-nitrilotetraacetate slurry (0.1 ml) was added for affinity purification. Protein binding was for 2 h at 0 °C; the resin was then transferred into a column and washed (2 ml/wash). PDE10-CyaB1 chimeras were washed with 6 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 35 mm imidazole), 8 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 70 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol), and 6 ml of buffer C (buffer B with 10 mm NaCl). For PDE11-CyaB1 chimeras, the columns were washed with 2 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 20% glycerin), buffer E (buffer A + 15 mm imidazole), and buffer F (buffer D + 10 mm NaCl and 25 mm imidazole). Proteins were eluted with 0.3 ml of buffer C plus 300 mm imidazole. To remove imidazole, the fractions were immediately dialyzed for 2 h against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (PDE10) or pH 8.5 (PDE11), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 35% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—The AC activity was assayed for 10 min at 37 °C in 100 μl (25Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 22% glycerol, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 75 μm [α-32P]ATP (25 kBq; from Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). 2 mm [2.8-3H]cAMP (150 Bq; from Amersham Biosciences) was added after stopping the reaction to determine yield during product isolation. The protein concentration was adjusted to limit substrate conversion to <10%. The reaction was started by the addition of the substrate. Values are given as means ± S.E. (n = 4). PDE activity was absent in all affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Western Blot Analysis—Protein in sample buffer after SDS-PAGE (12.5%) was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequentially probed with either an anti-RGS-H4 or an anti-His4 antibody (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and with a 1:5000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Peroxidase detection was carried out with the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of a Ligand for the GAF Domains of Human PDE10—Six splice variants of human PDE10A have been reported that differ at their N and C termini, whereas the GAF domains are identical among all variants (26Fujishige K. Kotera J. Yuasa K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The two major isoforms are PDE10A1 and A2 (PDE10A2, gi 5902442). We attached amino acids Leu-14 to His-422 of PDE10A1, i.e. the tandem GAF domain and an N terminus of 57 amino acids, which are identical in the PDE10A1 and A2 isoforms, to the cyanobacterial adenylyl cyclase cyaB1 (amino acid 386-859), generating PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859. The full-length PDE10A1 N terminus would include 13 amino acids, and that of PDE10A2 would contain 23 additional amino acids, respectively. The chimeric protein was expressed in E. coli, affinity-purified, and assayed for AC activity. Basal AC activity of 45 ± 3.9 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1 was linear with protein concentration. The Km for ATP was 27 ± 0.8 μm, and the Vmax was 84.5 ±15 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1 at pH 7.6. In contrast to PDEs 2, 5, and 6, cGMP did not stimulate AC activity (Fig. 2). However, for the first time for a mammalian GAF domain, we observed activation by cAMP; maximal stimulation was 9-fold (Fig. 2). The following nucleotides and nucleosides were tested at 100 μm concentrations: ADP, AMP, 2′-d-5′-AMP, GMP, cyclic 3′,5′-cytidine monophosphate (cCMP), cyclic 3,5-uridine monophosphate (cUMP), cyclic 3′,5′-xanthosine monophosphate (cXMP), cyclic 3′,5′-inosine monophosphate, (cIMP), adenosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, and inosine. With the exception of cIMP, which enhanced cAMP formation 1.6-fold at 100 μm (p < 0.05 when compared with the unstimulated control (n = 4), students t test), none of these compounds had any significant stimulatory activity. The minor effect of cIMP was significantly different from the stimulation observed with 100 μm cAMP (p < 0.001; n = 4). Stimulation by cAMP was direct, and no preincubation was required to achieve full activation (data not shown). Similarly, deactivation was immediate upon removal of cAMP by a 200-fold dilution because subsequent AC activity measurements consistently yielded basal activities (data not shown). This indicated that association and dissociation of cAMP to and from the PDE10 tandem GAF domain was rapid, resulting in high on/off rates. cAMP stimulation increased Vmax of the AC to 859 ± 146 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1 (derived from a linear Line-weaver-Burk plot) and did not affect Km. A dose-response curve for cAMP gave an EC50 of 19.8 ± 1.6 μm cAMP (n = 4), and the Hill coefficient was 1.0, i.e. no cooperativity was detected (Fig. 2). The EC50 for cAMP was considerably higher when compared with 1 μm cAMP for activation of cyaB1 AC or 3 μm cGMP for activation of PDE2 in association with the cyanobacterial AC (23Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In fact, a Kd well above 9 μm was predicted for the PDE10A GAF domains based on negative results of cAMP and cGMP binding studies (27Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). With a Kd of 22 μm cAMP, our data confirmed this prediction experimentally. Role of the NKFDE Motif in GAF-B of Human PDE10—As mentioned above, the NKFDE signature sequence is strongly implicated in cyclic nucleotide binding, possibly via formation of the binding pocket, because a direct structural correlate is not evident from the existing x-ray structures (3Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl.

A. 2005; 102: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The PDE10 tandem GAF domain contains a conserved NKFDE motif only in GAF-B; in GAF-A, the corresponding positions are RHFHQ (Fig. 1). It was, therefore, likely that GAF-B would be involved in cAMP signaling, whereas the GAF-A site may serve some other function. Therefore, we generated a D397A mutation in GAF-B (PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859D397A). The specific activity of the cyanobacterial AC was reduced by 97% (no change in Km) in accordance with results concerning an analogous construct with the tandem GAF domains of PDE2 and the cyaB1 AC (23Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), possibly indicating a generally deleterious effect by such a mutation on enzyme activity. The minor residual stimulation observed with cAMP had an EC50 of 268 ± 4.2 μm (n = 4), i.e. 13.5-fold higher than the unmutated AC chimera (Fig. 2). The difference in the EC50 values between PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859 and PDE10A114-422/cyaB1AC386-859D397A was highly significant (≪0.001; n = 4). Determination of a Ligand for the GAF Domains of Human PDE11—PDE11 is the most recent PDE family identified. It is coded by a single gene, PDE11A (29Yuasa K. Kanoh Y. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The existence of four tissue-specific splice variants that differ in the length of their N-terminal regions (7Fawcett L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12891-12895Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has been described (PDE11A1-PDE11A4). PDE11 is a dual specificity PDE (30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PDE11A4 is the only splice variant that has a complete N-terminal tandem GAF domain. The GAF-A domain of PDE11A4 consists of about 170 amino acids and is connected to GAF B (166 amino acids) via a 36-amino-acid linker, i.e. the domain organization is identical to that in the other PDEs and cyanobacterial ACs. In PDE11A4, the GAF ensemble is preceded by a 196-amino-acid-long N terminus of unknown function (30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Similar to the PDE10 GAF domains, all efforts to assign a function to the PDE11A4 GAF domains were unsuccessful (30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Neither cAMP nor cGMP bound to the GAF domain or affected the hydrolytic activity (30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the first chimera, we omitted the 196-amino-acid N-terminal of PDE11A4 and replaced it with the 50-amino-acid N terminus of the bacterial cyaB1 to ease expression in E. coli. This yielded the chimera cyaB11-50PDE11A4197-568cyaB1386-859 (Fig. 3A, construct I) in which the tandem GAF arrangement of PDE11A4 exactly replaced that of cyaB1. CyaB11-50PDE11A4197-568cyaB1386-859 was expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein and affinity-purified. The basal AC activity was 5.3 ± 0.6 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1; however, it was not significantly affected by the addition of cAMP or cGMP up to 10 mm (Fig. 3B). In view of these negative data, we suspected that the 196-amino-acid-long N terminus of PDE11A4 might have an intrinsic function in GAF domain signaling. Therefore, in the next construct, the complete PDE11A4 N terminus was linked to cyaB1 AC, generating PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859 (Fig. 3A, construct II). Expression in E. coli yielded a soluble protein. The basal activity of the affinity-purified chimera was 5.8 ± 0.3 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1. The Km for ATP was 19 ± 1 μm, and the Vmax was 10 ± 0.2 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1 at pH 7.5. This construct was stimulated 4-fold by cGMP with significant stimulations beginning with 10 μm cGMP. cAMP did not effectively activate (Fig. 3C, closed symbols). Similar to PDE10A, cGMP increased Vmax 2.2-fold (22 ± 1 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1) and did not affect Km. The EC50 for cGMP was 72.5 ± 1 μm, and maximal activation was obtained at 3 mm cGMP, most likely not a physiologically relevant cGMP concentration. We also determined the on/off rates via activation/deactivation assays. A plot of cAMP formation over time after the addition of 3 mm cGMP was linear for at least 10 min, passing through the origin on backward extrapolation. This established that the cGMP activation was virtually instantaneous. Similarly, when the recombinant protein was preincubated with 1 mm cGMP for 15 min at 0 °C and diluted 200-fold to 5 μm cGMP immediately prior to assay, we did not observe a persisting AC activation. This means that on/off rates for cGMP were rather rapid, as we found for cAMP in PDE10 (see above). These rapid on/off rates may explain why no cGMP or cAMP binding has been observed in earlier experiments (27Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine the nucleotide specificity of the activation, we tested the following purine nucleotides and nucleosides with PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859 at 1 mm concentrations: ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, GMP, cXMP, cIMP, dicyclic guanosine monophosphate (100 μm), guanosine, and adenosine. We did not see any statistically significant or insignificant stimulatory or inhibitory potency. This leaves cGMP as the only purine nucleotide capable of stimulation of the PDE11A tandem GAF domain. Role of the NKFDE Motif in GAF-B of Human PDE10—In PDE11A, a single NKFDE signature motif is present in GAF-A, and it is blurred (NRFDQ) in GAF-B. Because so far the conservation of the NKFDE motif has turned out to be a major requirement for cAMP (see above) and cGMP binding and activation (3Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we assumed that in PDE11A4, signaling will occur via GAF-A and generated a D355A mutant (PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859D355A). Basal activity was significantly reduced to 2.1 ± 0.2 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1 when compared with the wild-type PDE11A GAF domain. Activation by cGMP was not completely lost but significantly reduced from a 4-fold stimulation to a 2.6-fold stimulation (statistically significant at 2p < 0.05, n = 4; Fig. 3C). This result was expected and in line with data reported for cyclic nucleotide binding and activation of other GAF domains in which a residual activity often seemed to remain (22Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Bruder S. Linder J.U. Martinez S.E. Zheng N. Beavo J.A. Schultz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This was reassuring in view of the rather high EC50 concentration for cGMP because it established that the PDE11 tandem GAF domain belongs exactly in the same category as the other tandem GAF domains of mammalian PDEs. We identified ligands for the tandem GAF domains of the human PDEs 10 and 11 as cAMP and cGMP, respectively. Thus, the GAF domain of PDE10 is the only one of the five mammalian PDE families that binds and regulates via cAMP. The EC50 concentrations of 19.8 μm cAMP for PDE10 and 72.5 μm cGMP for PDE11A4 were 2-23-fold higher when compared with those for cGMP activation via the GAF domains of PDE2 or PDE5 (23Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Are these physiologically relevant concentrations in terms of PDEs 10 and 11 regulation, or are they artificially high due to the test system? We believe that they are not artifactual because chimeras between the cyanobacterial AC and the tandem GAF domains of PDEs 2 and 5 have yielded EC50 concentrations for cGMP-stimulated cAMP formation around 1 μm, which compares favorably with those determined in binding and PDE activation assays (23Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, this chimeric assay system is validated with analogous constructs. The rather high Kd values explain why the ligands were not identified earlier. Too low concentrations of cAMP and cGMP were employed (27Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the immediacy of the on/off rates probably caused loss of ligand upon rinsing of the filters. The significance of the cAMP-stimulated GAF domain for the regulation of intracellular PDE10 activity remains to be established. An EC50 of 19.8 μm cAMP appears to be reasonable, and it is not necessary to invoke potential cAMP and PDE10 sequestration in cellular compartments. Of course, this does not exclude the possibility for specific complexes composed of biosynthetic and hydrolytic activities together with a protein kinase for downstream signaling. This might locally facilitate and coordinate certain signal transduction processes within a cell. PDE10 has been shown to be expressed in testis and thyroid and to be particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of the brain (27Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because these brain areas control major behavioral and motor functions, implying dopaminergic neurotransmission possibly involving cyclic nucleotide pathways, PDE10 as a dual specificity enzyme is currently envisaged as a potential drug target for the development of mood-affecting drugs (33Seeger T.F. Bartlett B. Coskran T.M. Culp J.S. James L.C. Krull D.L. Lanfear J. Ryan A.M. Schmidt C.J. Strick C.A. Varghese A.H. Williams R.D. Wylie P.G. Menniti F.S. Brain Res. 2003; 985: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The data of a cAMP-regulated PDE10 now allow a novel look at this strategy. Concerning PDE11, the EC50 of 72.5 μm cGMP is much higher than the generally accepted cellular cGMP concentration of around 1 μm. Therefore, a cGMP-signaling complex involving PDE11A would be expected to be spatially confined such that the local concentration of cGMP may reach levels close to the EC50 concentration reported here. Another possibility might be that PDE11A4 is undergoing secondary modifications that enhance cGMP sensitivity of its N-terminal tandem GAF domain. These questions have to be addressed using the PDE11A holoenzyme. Regarding the 196-amino-acid-long N terminus of PDE11A4, we accidentally noted an effect on signaling. With the cyaB1 N terminus preceding the PDE11A GAF domains as in the cyaB11-50PDE11A4197-568cyaB1386-859 chimera, cGMP did not activate, whereas it did when the complete N terminus of PDE11A4 was swapped for the cyanobacterial one as in the PDE11A41-568cyaB1386-859 chimera. This result could have implications for the activation process. One may argue that the N-terminal GAF domain in the cyaB11-50PDE11A4197-568cyaB1386-859 construct did not fold correctly. Considering the impossibility to check cGMP binding of the PDE11A4 GAF domains, this cannot completely be ruled out. However, this would imply that of the two domains in a single protein, one folded correctly and the other did not. Obviously, the tandem GAF domain did not interfere with dimerization, which is absolutely required for AC activity. The Km for this construct was 48 μm ATP, and Vmax was 15 nmol of cAMP·mg-1·min-1, strongly indicating that loss of activation was due to an effect of the N terminus on intramolecular signaling. Actually, this effect appears to have a counterpart in the PDE11 holoenzyme enzyme. The effects of inhibitors on the activity of PDE11A3 (gi 63253296), which has a different N terminus when compared with PDE11A4, were 2-3-fold more potent than those on the PE11A4 isoform (30Yuasa K. Kotera J. Fujishige K. Michibata H. Sasaki T. Omori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31469-31479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34Loughney K. Taylor J. Florio V.A. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; 17: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that the N terminus of PDE11A affects the overall conformation of the protein, leading to changes of the enzymatic PDE profile and, as shown here, of the associated AC dimer. An interesting question will be to determine whether the N termini of other PDEs similarly affect intramolecular signaling. A physiological function for PDE11 needs to be established. Interestingly, in humans, PDE11A4 was reported to be the only isoform that is expressed in quantity (33Seeger T.F. Bartlett B. Coskran T.M. Culp J.S. James L.C. Krull D.L. Lanfear J. Ryan A.M. Schmidt C.J. Strick C.A. Varghese A.H. Williams R.D. Wylie P.G. Menniti F.S. Brain Res. 2003; 985: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It appears to be exclusively localized in the human prostate, whereas other human tissues contain only minor amounts (34Loughney K. Taylor J. Florio V.A. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; 17: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the prostate, cGMP is reported to be involved in proliferation of stromal cells and in the regulation of potassium channels via cGMP-dependent protein kinase and apoptotic processes in prostate cancer cells (35Cook A.L. Haynes J.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Cook A.L. Frydenberg M. Haynes J.M. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, PDE11 may be involved in these processes. In rat and mouse, several other PDE11A isoforms and their tissue-specific expression have been demonstrated (37Yuasa K. Ohgaru T. Asahina M. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4440-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Wayman C. Phillips S. Lunny C. Webb T. Fawcett L. Baxendale R. Burgess G. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; 17: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, a PDE11 knock-out mouse did not exhibit any striking abnormalities (38Wayman C. Phillips S. Lunny C. Webb T. Fawcett L. Baxendale R. Burgess G. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; 17: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A reduction in sperm motility was taken as evidence for a role in spermatogenesis and fertilization, albeit the knock-out did not affect animal fecundity (38Wayman C. Phillips S. Lunny C. Webb T. Fawcett L. Baxendale R. Burgess G. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; 17: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, based on the effects of the D/A mutation within the NKFDE motif in all GAF domains of this type, we would propose that the NKFDE motif defines a distinct subclass of GAF domains that is required, but not absolutely sufficient (e.g. in GAF-A of PDE2), for cAMP or cGMP signaling. The above prediction may be tested with a tandem GAF domain containing a canonical NKFDE motif in GAF-A, which was recently identified in an open reading frame from the protozoon Paramecium (Fig. 1). This subclass is set apart from a subclass proposed to be present in phytochromes. Those GAF domains that have different signature sequences either directly bind a bilin-type chromophore or are necessary for phytochrome binding by an adjacent PAS-like domain (39Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A third subclass of GAF domains may comprise the one present in the transcription activator FhlA, which is regulated by formate, and the one in the NifL-NifA transcriptional regulatory complex, which is regulated by α-ketobutyrate as in Azotobacter vinelandii (40Little R. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28711-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

In the present work we examined the interplay between Chk1 and Hsp90 in intact cells, identified a source of unchaperoned Chk1, and report the in vitro chaperoning of Chk1 in reticulocyte lysates and with purified chaperones and co-chaperones. We find that bacterially expressed Chk1 is post-translationally chaperoned to an active kinase. This reaction minimally requires Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, Cdc37, and the protein kinase CK2. The co-chaperone Hop, although not essential for the activation of Chk1 in vitro, enhanced the chaperoning process, whereas the co-chaperone p23 did not stimulate the chaperoning reaction. Additionally, we found that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Chk1 affects the association of Chk1 with Hsp90. Collectively these results provide new insights into Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of a client kinase and identify a novel, biochemically tractable model system that will be useful to further dissect the Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of this important and ubiquitous class of Hsp90 clients.

Hsp90 is an integral part of a multiprotein complex that transitions between at least two forms, dependent on whether or not Hsp90 is bound to ATP. In a steroid receptor model system, ATP-bound Hsp90 complexes with the co-chaperones p23 and immunophilins, and this complex promotes client protein stabilization. On the other hand, Hsp90 lacking nucleotide or bound to ADP is associated with Hsp70 and Hop. This intermediate stage complex can also promote proteasomal degradation of client proteins.Hsp90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, radicicol, and their derivatives, disrupt Hsp90 function by mimicking the ADP-bound conformation and targeting client proteins for proteasomal degradation, thereby depleting client proteins from treated cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Isaacs J.S.

The discovery of specific Hsp90 inhibitors has facilitated the identification of Hsp90 clients, leading to a vast expansion of the list of Hsp90 clients. Notably, many Hsp90 clients, such as Akt, Raf-1, and Her2/Neu, play important roles in tumor cell survival and proliferation, which has further fueled the interest in the role of Hsp90 in client protein function, especially the role of Hsp90 in regulating protein kinase clients.The Hsp90 chaperoning process has been studied most extensively for the steroid receptors. These studies have demonstrated that five purified proteins: Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, p23, and Hop, are sufficient to chaperone steroid receptors in vitro into Hsp90-receptor complexes capable of binding hormone (6Kosano H.

Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the binding of ATP to Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hop dissociate from the complex and are replaced by p23 (8Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is this mature complex containing receptor bound to Hsp90 and p23 that has hormone binding activity.The detailed characterization of the chaperoning process of steroid receptors has provided important insights into the chaperoning process and the roles played by various chaperone proteins. Additional studies have demonstrated that chaperoning of hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase requires the same five proteins (13Hu J. Toft D. Anselmo D. Wang X. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Hu J. Flores D. Toft D. Wang X. Nguyen D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13122-13131Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, no in vitro system using purified proteins has been established to study protein kinases, an important class of Hsp90 clients that plays key roles in regulating tumor cell proliferation and survival. This is particularly relevant because a large number of the Hsp90 clients discovered to date are protein kinases, and yet the molecular details of how they are chaperoned remain elusive.In the present work we demonstrate the first successful fully defined system for in vitro chaperoning of a protein kinase using purified proteins. Our studies show that Chk1, a kinase that was recently identified as an Hsp90 client, can be post-translationally chaperoned from an inactive to an active kinase using a five-protein system. Notably, however, the proteins required to chaperone Chk1 differ from those required to chaperone steroid receptors. Collectively, our results identify the minimal complement of chaperone and co-chaperone proteins essential to chaperone a protein kinase, demonstrate a novel model system to dissect the chaperoning reaction for this import class of Hsp90 clients, and suggest a model for the process of chaperoning Hsp90-dependent kinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Casein kinase-2 (CK2), cycloheximide, phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase were purchased from Sigma. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was generously provided by Kosan Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MP Biomedicals (formerly ICN Radiochemicals). Redivue l-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare). Mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize various antigens were obtained as follows: anti-Cdc37 (MA3-029) was from Affinity BioReagents and used for immunoblotting according to the supplier's instructions; anti-HA (MMS-101P) was from BAbCO (Covance Research Products) and used for immunoprecipitations as directed by the supplier; anti-Chk1 (sc-7898), anti-Raf-1 (sc-133), and anti-HA-conjugated agarose (sc-7292AC) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used as directed by the supplier; anti-Hsp90 (H9010) and anti-Hsp70 (BB70) have been previously described (15Barent R.L.

Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3-hChk1-HA2, a plasmid that expresses a C-terminal tagged Chk1 in mammalian cells or in in vitro transcription/translation reactions. HA-tagged human Chk1 (encoding amino acids 1-265 of Chk1) was produced by PCR amplifying amino acids 1-265 of Chk1. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and AscI and ligated into EcoRI- and AscI-digested pcDNA3-hChk1-HA2. These restriction enzymes excised full-length Chk1 from the pcDNA3-HA2 backbone, allowing replacement with the Chk1-(1-265) fragment. The resulting plasmid (pcDNA3-Chk1-265-HA2) expressed truncated Chk1 that was C-terminal-tagged (identical to the tag in pcDNA3-hChk1-HA2) in mammalian cells or in in vitro transcription/translation reactions. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length Chk1 (GST-Chk1(FL)) or GST-Chk1(FL)-His6 expression vectors were generated using a PCR-based strategy to fuse GST to the N terminus of full-length Chk1 (and the His6 epitope for the dually tagged Chk1). The resulting PCR fragment was then cloned into pET-21(+) (Novagen) to produce pET-21(+)-GST-Chk1(FL). Similarly truncated GST-tagged Chk1 fusions that express the conserved kinase domain (residues 1-265) or the kinase domain plus a 24-residue linker region (residues 1-289) were also generated (GST-Chk1-(1-265) and GST-Chk1-(1-289), respectively). The Escherichia coli expression vector for the His6 N-terminal-tagged Cdc37 S13A was constructed using a PCR-based strategy to clone wild-type Cdc37 into pET24(+), followed by incorporation of the S13A mutation using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced to verify accuracy of PCR amplification. The estrogen receptor expression plasmid was obtained from P. Webb (University of California San Francisco, CA).Cross-linking Antibodies to Protein A-Sepharose—Antibodies to Hsp90 and Chk1 were covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) using 20 mg/ml dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by washing the beads with 0.2 m ethanolamine (Sigma). Antibody cross-linked beads were stored in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C.Protein Purification—Purified GST-Cdc25C (residues 200-256) was prepared as described (18Sarkaria J.N.

Cdc37 with an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli strain M15[pRep4] using a plasmid obtained from R. Matts (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK). The fusion protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. His6-Cdc37 S13A was expressed in BL21(DE3) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 17 °C. Following induction, cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was applied to a TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). Following extensive washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, the bound Cdc37 was eluted from the column with an imidazole gradient. Fractions containing Cdc37 were pooled, dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at -80 °C.GST-Chk1-(1-265) was induced in Rosetta E. coli (Novagen) with 0.6 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. The cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.27 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the cleared supernatant was incubated with GSH-agarose (Clontech). The column was washed with calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, followed by extensive washing with calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl. Bound protein was eluted with 100 mm GSH in calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (adjusted to pH 7.4). Fractions containing GST-Chk1-(1-265) were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, diluted with an equal volume of glycerol, and stored at -80 °C.The expression of GST-Chk1(FL)-His6 in Rosetta(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) was induced in 4 liters with 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cleared cell lysate was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed extensively in lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and 1% Triton X-100 (but no protease inhibitors), and bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercatopethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 m imidazole. Eluted proteins were then incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-agarose (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed extensively with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100, followed by washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The beads (with bound Chk1) were then used for chaperoning assays.Chk1 Chaperoning Assays—Inactive 35S-labeled, HA-tagged Chk1 was expressed in vitro in the presence of 10 μm 17-AAG in a 25-μl reaction using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions for 1 h at 30 °C. Chk1 was immunoprecipitated from the reaction using anti-HA-conjugated agarose in 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.27 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 0.5 m NaCl, and freshly added 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Alternatively, purified GST-Chk1-(1-265) or soluble bacterial lysates were bound to GSH-agarose in the above buffer. Immobilized Chk1 was washed 3 times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol).Pellets of Chk1-bound resin (15 μl) were incubated in a 100-μl reaction containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares) with an energy regeneration system consisting of 10 mm phosphocreatine and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. When activated with purified chaperone proteins, 0.25 μg of resin-bound GST-Chk1 protein was incubated in a 100-μl reaction with various amounts of Hsp90, Hsp70, Ydj1, Hop, p23, Cdc37, and CK2 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol (chaperoning buffer). Reactions were gently mixed every 5 min and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h oras otherwise indicated. At the end of the chaperoning incubation, bead pellets were washed 4 times with wash buffer supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl, and 0.025% SDS and 4 times with kinase buffer in preparation for subsequent kinase assays.Immunodepletion Assays—GST-Chk-(1-265) (1 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with 2 μg of Hsp90, 20 μg of Hsp70, 4 μg of Ydj1, 4 μg of Cdc37, 5 μg of Hop, 5 μg of p23, and 0.14 units of CK2 in a 200-μl reaction in chaperoning buffer. The reaction mixture was split into two equal parts, and each portion was incubated with 20-μl pellets of Hsp90 or Chk1 antibody cross-linked beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were then subjected to a second identical round of immunodepletion. Finally, all supernatants, whether previously Hsp90 or Chk1 depleted, were incubated with anti-Chk1 cross-linked beads for 1 h at 4°C. All pellets were washed once with wash buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and twice with kinase buffer in preparation for subsequent kinase assays. Additionally, a fraction of each of the final supernatants was saved for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Chk1 Kinase Assays—Chk1 activity was determined similarly to a previously described procedure (25Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) by incubating bead-bound Chk1 with [γ-32P]ATP and the Chk1 substrate GST-Cdc25C (residues 200-256) at 30 °C for 10 min. Kinase reactions were terminated with the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Reactions were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% SDS gel) and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membrane-bound radiolabeled proteins were detected and quantitated using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitations—HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, grown to 90% confluence, and lysed on ice for 10 min in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.27 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g and 1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose cross-linked with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were then washed with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Detection of endogenous Chk1 from immunoprecipitations was performed using the secondary antibody mouse IgG TrueBlot (eBioscience) according to the supplier's instructions. Immunoblots were developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology).RESULTSSome Hsp90 clients, such as the steroid receptors, are constitutively associated with and maintained in a functional conformation by Hsp90 (26Joab I.

Together, these results suggested that Chk1 interacts transiently with Hsp90 during the chaperoning reaction and is then released as a functional kinase. To test this prediction and gain further insight into the interplay between Chk1 and Hsp90, we examined what fraction of Chk1 is associated with Hsp90 by immunoprecipitating Hsp90 and blotting for Chk1 (Fig. 1). Because Chk1 migrates very near immunoglobulin G heavy chain, we covalently cross-linked the anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibody to protein A-Sepharose for this experiment. We first demonstrated that covalent coupling did not disrupt the ability of Hsp90 to co-precipitate Raf-1, a bona fide Hsp90 client (35Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R.

(Note that the band marked with an asterisk did not co-migrate with Chk1.) This discrepancy with our previous finding, that Chk1 immunoprecipitates contained Hsp90, is likely because of the fact that immunoblotting with the anti-Hsp90 antibody is more sensitive than immunoblotting with the anti-Chk1 antibody (34Arlander S.J.

Nonetheless, given that 1000 μg of cell lysate protein were immunoprecipitated and that we could readily detect Chk1 in as little as 10 μg of cell lysate, the simplest explanation of these results is that only a small percentage of Chk1 is stably associated with Hsp90 in exponentially growing cells, a result that is similar to what has been reported for other Hsp90 client kinases (40Whitesell L.

Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription/translation reactions were programmed with empty vector or a vector that expresses HA-tagged full-length Chk1 and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads. Following washing, the precipitates were subjected to kinase assays by incubating with [γ-32P]ATP and the GST-Cdc25C substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the reactions programmed with empty vector, no 35S-labeled Chk1 was visible (upper panel), and only background kinase activity was detected (lower panel and graph, lanes 1-4). In the reactions programmed with the Chk1 expression vector, 35S-labeled Chk1 was clearly present and the translated kinase exhibited robust kinase activity (lane 5).FIGURE 2Chk1 chaperoning requires Hsp90. A, in vitro transcription/translation reactions containing [35S]methionine were programmed with empty vector (EV) or pcDNA3-Chk1-HA2 (full-length Chk1) and performed in the presence or absence of 10 μm 17-AAG. The reaction products were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and the precipitates were used directly for kinase reactions (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or were further incubated with 100 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL)(lanes 3 and 7) or with reticulocyte lysate containing 10 μm 17-AAG (lanes 4 and 8) for 30 min at 30 °C. Following incubation in RRL, the precipitates were washed and subjected to kinase assays in parallel with the samples in lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6. Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST-Cdc25C and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel), and transferred to Immobilon-P. Radiolabeled Chk1 (upper panel) and GST-Cdc25C were detected (middle panel) and quantitated (graph) using a PhosphorImager. The experiment was repeated 4 times with similar results. B and D, lysates from E. coli transformed with empty vector, GST-Chk1(FL) (B), GST-Chk1-(1-265) (D), or GST-Chk1-(1-289) (D) expression vectors were incubated with GSH-agarose to recover GST-Chk1 proteins. The GSH-agarose beads were then washed and incubated with GST-Cdc25C and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and imaged by PhosphorImager analysis. -Fold activation for GST-Chk1(FL), GST-Chk1-(1-265), and GST-Chk1-(1-289) were 50, 50, and 6, respectively. C, purified GST-Chk1(FL), GST-Chk1-(1-265), and GST-Chk1-(1-289) were separated by SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue.

When Chk1 was translated in the presence of 17-AAG, Chk1 was produced; however, only background kinase activity was present (lane 6). We consistently noticed that 17-AAG reduced the amount of 35S-labeled Chk1, raising the possibility that the reduced kinase activity was the result of diminished amounts of Chk1 (cf. lanes 5 to 6-8). To adjust for differing amounts of Chk1, we calculated the specific activity of Chk1 (determined by dividing the counts of 32P substrate by the counts of 35S Chk1). When translated in the absence of 17-AAG, Chk1 had a specific activity of 2.0. In contrast, when translated in the presence of 17-AAG, Chk1 specific activity was 0.4"

In response to p53 activation at 32 °C, DP16.1/p53ts cells undergo p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As a result of viral transformation, these cells express the spleen focus forming env-related glycoprotein gp55, which can bind to the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and mimics many aspects of EPO-induced EPO-R signaling. We demonstrate that ERK, p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are constitutively active in DP16.1/p53ts cells. Constitutive MEK activity contributes to p53-dependent apoptosis and phosphorylation of p53 on serine residue 15. The pro-apoptotic effect of this MAPK kinase signal likely reflects an aberrant Ras proliferative signal arising from FVP-induced viral transformation. Inhibition of MEK alters the p53-dependent cellular response of DP16.1/p53ts from apoptosis to G1 cell cycle arrest, with a concomitant increase in p21WAF1, suggesting that the Ras/MEK pathway may influence the cellular response to p53 activation. p38 and JNK activity in DP16.1/p53ts cells is anti-apoptotic and capable of limiting p53-dependent apoptosis at 32 °C. Moreover, JNK facilitates p53 protein turnover, which could account for the enhanced apoptotic effects of inhibiting this MAPK pathway in DP16.1/p53ts cells. Overall, these data show that intrinsic MAPK signaling pathways, active in transformed cells, can both positively and negatively influence p53-dependent apoptosis, and illustrate their potential to affect cancer therapies aimed at reconstituting or activating p53 function.

Overall, these data show that intrinsic MAPK signaling pathways, active in transformed cells, can both positively and negatively influence p53-dependent apoptosis, and illustrate their potential to affect cancer therapies aimed at reconstituting or activating p53 function. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is activated in response to DNA damage and abnormal proliferative signals and can induce apoptosis through the activation of death-promoting gene targets (e.g. Bax, p53AIP1, Pidd/Lrdd, Puma, and Noxa), and cell cycle arrest through the activation of p21WAF1, GADD45, and 14-3-3σ (1.Benchimol S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Apoptosis and arrest are believed to be important mechanisms of p53 tumor suppression, and are capable of preventing the expansion of cancer-prone cells (e.g. harboring mutations and/or under the influence of inappropriate growth signals). The factors and mechanisms underlying the decision to undergo apoptosis or growth arrest in response to p53 are not fully understood. This decision is likely complex and governed by multiple factors that depend on extrinsic factors (e.g. the presence of soluble growth factors) and intrinsic factors (e.g. hyperactive survival signaling pathways, defective death-signaling pathways) that are additionally cell type-specific. We and others have shown that p53-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cells can be suppressed in the presence of cytokines or mitogenic factors such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and that cells remain in a viable growth-arrested state (2.Lin Y.

Survival pathways, commonly activated in transformed cells independently of their normal regulatory signals, can also rescue cells from p53-dependent death. For example, cells with constitutively activated phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase (PI3′K) 2The abbreviations used are: PI3′K, phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; ts, temperature-sensitive; FVP, Friend murine erythroleukemia virus; SFFV, spleen focus-forming virus; EPO, erythropoietin; EPO-R, erythropoietin receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D./protein kinase B (PKB) have a delayed response to apoptosis induced by p53 (8.Lin Y.

Extrinsic and intrinsic survival factors that alter the cellular response to p53 activation are likely to impinge upon targets that inhibit the cell death machinery. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins comprise a subset of proteins that function in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, inhibiting the action of pro-apoptotic family members that trigger the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria, leading to caspase activation and apoptosis (14.Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). Under cytokine-stimulated growth and differentiation conditions, the resulting expression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL leads to hematopoietic cell survival (15.Lotem J. Sachs L. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Kinases acting in survival pathways like PKB, Rsk, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase are all able to inhibit Bad, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (16.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated at key residues by these kinases, Bad is bound by 14-3-3 proteins and sequestered in the cytoplasm where it is unable to inactivate Bcl-XL at the mitochondria (17.Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Previously, we generated a cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive (ts) p53 transgene from an erythroleukemia cell line null for p53 (DP16.1/p53ts) (18.Mowat M. Cheng A. Kimura N. Bernstein A. Benchimol S. Nature. 1985; 314: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This cell line was established from a mouse infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of the Friend murine erythroleukemia virus (FVP), a complex of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFVP) and Friend murine leukemia virus. The p53ts mutation consists of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at position 135 (p53Val-135), producing a protein that adopts a mutant conformation at 37 °C and a wild-type conformation at 32 °C, the temperature at which p53 is activated and induces G1 arrest and apoptosis (2.Lin Y. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6045-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19.Johnson P. Chung S. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As a result of viral transformation, DP16.1/p53ts cells express the SFFVP-encoded env-related glycoprotein gp55 (19.Johnson P. Chung S. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The oncogenic potential of gp55 derives from its ability to bind and activate the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R), mimicking many aspects of EPO/EPO-R-induced signaling (20.Li J.P. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 343: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 21.Ney P.A. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3675-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including the activation of Ras/Raf-1/MAPK, PI3′K/PKB, and protein kinase C (22.Muszynski K.W. Thompson D. Hanson C. Lyons R. Spadaccini A. Ruscetti S.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8444-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23.Muszynski K.W. Ohashi T. Hanson C. Ruscetti S.K. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 3037-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gp55/EPO-R interaction is believed to be responsible for the increase in proliferation of splenic erythroid precursors observed during the initial stages of FVP infection, (25.Johnson P. Benchimol S. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 137-151PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ruscetti S.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1089-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, an isoform of stem cell-derived tyrosine kinase (Sf (short form)-Stk) was identified as a host factor that renders mice susceptible to FVP-induced disease (21.Ney P.A. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3675-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Persons D.A. Paulson R.F. Loyd M.R. Herley M.T. Bodner S.M. Bernstein A. Correll P.H. Ney P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Sf-Stk can covalently interact with gp55 bound to the EPO-R, resulting in constitutive Sf-Stk kinase activity (28.Nishigaki K. Thompson D. Hanson C. Yugawa T. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Sf-Stk activation of Ras/MAPK and PI3′K/PKB signaling pathways has been implicated in gp55-mediated expansion of primary erythrocytes infected with FVP (29.Finkelstein L.D. Ney P.A. Liu Q.P. Paulson R.F. Correll P.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3562-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other genetic alterations including the inactivation of p53 occur during the late stages of FVP infection leading to erythroleukemia (18.Mowat M. Cheng A. Kimura N. Bernstein A. Benchimol S. Nature. 1985; 314: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 30.Moreau-Gachelin F. Tavitian A. Tambourin P. Nature. 1988; 331: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the PI3′K/PKB pathway is activated in DP16.1/p53ts cells. PKB is constitutively phosphorylated in these cells, as is its pro-apoptotic target, Bad. Moreover, in the presence of PI3′K inhibitors, phosphorylation of PKB and Bad is inhibited and p53-dependent apoptosis is markedly enhanced (8.Lin Y. Brown L. Hedley D.W. Barber D.L. Benchimol S. Blood. 2002; 100: 3990-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, when p53 is activated in the context of an active PI3′K/PKB signaling pathway, its ability to promote apoptosis is limited. It is possible that other EPO-R-dependent signaling pathways are activated in DP16.1/p53ts cells and that these could also influence the cellular response to p53 activation. In this respect, DP16.1/p53ts cells provide a useful model to study the interplay between p53 and growth/survival pathways that are frequently activated in transformed cells and may give insight into how cancer cells evade p53-dependent apoptosis. Here we have examined the status of three EPO-responsive kinases, ERK, p38, and JNK (31.Nagata Y. Nishida E. Todokoro K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in DP16.1/p53ts cells and investigated their ability to modulate the cellular response to p53 activation. We show that ERK, p38, and JNK are constitutively active in DP16.1/p53ts cells and that signaling through these MAPK pathways can influence the ability of p53 to promote apoptosis. The constitutive MEK signal is pro-apoptotic and contributes to p53 activation by phosphorylation on serine residue 15. When MEK is inhibited, the response of DP16.1/p53ts cells to p53 activation is redirected from apoptosis toward G1 arrest, with a concomitant increase in p21WAF1 protein expression. Conversely, p38 and JNK MAPKs are anti-apoptotic, and p53-dependent apoptosis increases when signaling through these kinases is inhibited. Thus, p38 and JNK MAPKs represent intrinsically activated survival pathways in DP16.1/p53ts cells. JNK activity in DP16.1/p53ts cells destabilizes p53, which could provide an explanation for the observed increase in p53-dependent apoptosis when JNK signaling is inhibited in these cells. This is consistent with other models that suggest JNK activity in proliferating cells promotes p53 degradation (33.Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Overall, this work demonstrates that intrinsic MAPK signaling pathways, active in transformed cells, can differentially regulate the cellular response to p53 activation and suggests that the Ras/MEK pathway may be a specific determinant of the decision to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis or G1 arrest. Cell Culture—The DP16.1/p53ts cell line was derived from the Friend virus-transformed parental murine erythroleukemia cell line (DP16.1) by stable introduction of a temperature-sensitive p53 allele (A135V). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and routinely screened for p53 expression by Western blotting. MAPK inhibitors U0126, SB203580, and SP600125 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, 0.025%) and added directly to cell cultures 1 h prior to culturing at 32 °C. No-drug controls contained an equal volume of Me2SO. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis—Apoptosis was assessed using annexin V-phycoerythrin (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Sigma) staining of cells and flow cytometry. Cells staining positive for annexin V and negative for 7-AAD were scored as apoptotic. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed on ice in 70% ethanol, washed with 1% bovine serum albumin-containing phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C, and finally resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide. Acquisition and analysis of flow cytometry data were carried out using CellQuest (version 3.3) on a FacScan™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was performed using ModFit LT (version 2.0). Western Blotting—Buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was used for cell lysis. For the detection of phosphorylated p53, this buffer additionally contained 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) was used to estimate protein concentrations. 80 μg of total protein was routinely used for antigen detection, with the exception of p53, for which 30 μg was sufficient. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, bromphenol blue) was added to samples prior to resolution by PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with the indicated antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Panspecific p53 monoclonal antibody (PAb421) and polyclonal p53 antibody (Ab7) from Oncogene were used to detect total p53 protein. Monoclonal phosphospecific p53 (serine 15), ERK1/2 (threonine 202/tyrosine 204), and polyclonal phospho-specific MAPKAPK-2 (threonine 334) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal phosphospecific JunD (serine 73) antibody was from Upstate, and total JunD antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal p21WAF1 (Santa Cruz) and monoclonal β-actin (Sigma) antibodies were also used in this study.

FuGene™ (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent was used to introduce kinase expression constructs in combination with a pcDNA3.1-CD20 expression plasmid (3 μg:1 μg, respectively) into 2 × 106 DP16.1/p53ts cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for a 24-h recovery period and then diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml and cultured at 32 °C for 12, 16, or 20 h. CD20 expressing cells were identified by flow cytometry with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen), and apoptosis was measured in this CD20+ subpopulation. Raf-caax was additionally transfected into the H1299 human lung carcinoma cell line using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antisense Inhibition of ERK Expression—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified, phosphorothioate-modified antisense (AS) and control scrambled (CON) ERK oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were introduced into DP16.1/p53ts cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector system: AS-ERK: 5′-GCCGCCGCCGCCGCCAT-3′; CON-ERK: 5′-CGCGCGCTCGCGCACCC-3′ (36.Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in Nucleofector solution to a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. 100 μl of this cell suspension was added to 3 μg of AS- or CON-ERK oligonucleotide and exposed to the electrical pulse generated by the Nucleofector device (program U-15). Immediately thereafter, cells were diluted to 2 × 105 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were further diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum prior to culturing at 32 °C. ERK expression was determined by Western blot analysis, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry as described. Detection of ubiquitinated p53—DP16.1 and DP16.1/p53ts cells were cultured in the presence or absence of SP600125 (10 μm) for 15 h at 32 °C. Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) for 5 h prior to harvesting. Cells were lysed into immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of 1% Triton-X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 1 mg of total protein was incubated with 3 μg of polyclonal p53 antibody (FL393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG for 12 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the immunoprecipitates, and following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, beads were recovered, washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitinated p53 was detected by Western blot analysis with a mouse anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (6C1.17, BD Biosciences-Pharmingen). MAPKs Are Intrinsically Active in DP16.1/p53ts Cells—To evaluate how MAPK signaling might modulate the cellular response to p53 activation, we examined the activity of ERK, p38, and JNK kinases in DP16.1/p53ts cells. Phosphorylated ERK was present in DP16.1/p53ts cells under normal growth conditions, and treatment with 5 μm of the MEK inhibitor U0126 effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and had no effect on total ERK1/2 protein levels (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylated MAPKAPK-2 kinase was detected in DP16.1/p53ts and decreased in cells grown in the presence of 10 μm SB203580, the p38 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1B). DP16.1/p53ts cells also expressed phosphorylated JunD, which was inhibited with 10 μm of the JNK inhibitor SP600125, with no effect on levels of total JunD protein (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that ERK, p38, and JNK kinases are constitutively active in DP16.1/p53ts cells and suggest that their respective signaling pathways are intrinsically active in DP16.1/p53ts cells under normal growth conditions. MEK Contributes to p53-dependent Apoptosis—To determine whether MEK activity influences the cellular response to p53 activation, DP16.1/p53ts cells were cultured at 32 °C in the presence and absence of MEK inhibitor. Apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometry, is represented as the percentage of cells that stained positive for annexin V-PE and negative for 7-AAD (Fig. 2A, upper left quadrant). p53 activation resulted in 19% apoptosis by 16 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with U1026 led to a significant dose-dependent decrease in apoptosis. At 5 μm U0126, a concentration that decreased the level of phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A), apoptosis was reduced at least 50% in comparison with control-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Treatment of DP16.1/p53ts cells with the MEK inhibitor at 37 °C had no effect on cell viability in the time frame that p53 induces apoptosis (data not shown), consistent with a recent report that factor-independent growth of SFFV-transformed erythroid cells is independent of Ras/MAPK (22.Muszynski K.W. Thompson D. Hanson C. Lyons R. Spadaccini A. Ruscetti S.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8444-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These data indicate that MEK inhibition suppresses p53-dependent apoptosis in DP16.1/p53ts cells. To validate this result, we tested whether the expression of a constitutively activated Raf-1 kinase (Raf-caax) had the opposite effect and enhanced apoptosis of DP16.1/p53ts cells after p53 activation at 32 °C. Raf-caax-transfected cells showed a modest increase in apoptosis at 32 °C at 12 and 20 h in comparison to untransfected and empty-vector control-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, Raf-caax expression did not promote apoptosis of DP16.1/p53ts cells cultured at 37 °C, indicating that the enhanced apoptotic effect was dependent upon p53. The modest effect of Raf-caax likely reflects the high levels of phosphorylated active ERK in DP16.1/p53ts cells and is consistent with the view that MEK may already be fully activated in these cells. The ability of Raf-caax to stimulate MEK/MAPK signaling was demonstrated in transfected H1299 cells in which Raf-caax expressing cells showed increased phospho-MEK1/2 compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 3B). Together, these data suggest that Raf-1 and MEK can act as proapoptotic kinases, supporting a model in which constitutive Ras/Raf-1/MEK signaling sensitizes cells to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis.FIGURE 3p53-dependent apoptosis increases in cells expressing Raf-caax. A, DP16.1/p53ts cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing CD20 together with Rafcaax or empty vector (EV) and cultured at 37 °C or 32 °C for 12 h (open bars) or 20 h (filled bars). Cells were fixed and stained for CD20 expression and for apoptosis with annexin V and 7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis is presented as the percentage of CD20-positive cells that were also positive for annexin V-PE and negative for 7-AAD. UT, indicates cells that were not transfected. B, H1299 cells were transfected with the same Raf-caax vector used in A. Phosphorylation of the Raf kinase substrate MEK1/2 was detected by Western blotting with antibodies for phospho-MEK1/2 (upper panel) and total MEK1/2 protein (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of p53 at Serine 15 is Associated with p53 Activation and Apoptosis Induction—A number of reports suggest that ERK phosphorylates p53 on serine 15 in response to various stress-inducing stimuli known to cause apoptosis (37.Persons D.L.

We examined the phosphorylation status of this residue in DP16.1/p53ts cells and found that p53 was not phosphorylated at serine 15 at 37 °C, consistent with p53 inactivation at this temperature. After cells were cultured at 32 °C for 6 h, serine 15-phosphorylated p53 was readily detected (Fig. 4A). Cells cultured at either temperature expressed comparable levels of total p53 protein. Phosphoserine p53 persisted in DP16.1/p53ts cells cultured at 32 °C for up to 14 h, when markers of apoptosis such as the appearance of nuclear bodies and annexin V reactivity became evident (Fig. 4B). Serine 15 phosphorylation decreased upon U0126 treatment (Fig. 4B). The ability of U0126 (10 μm) to block MEK activity and diminish p53 serine 15 phosphorylation and p53-dependent apoptosis raised the possibility that constitutive Ras/MEK sensitizes DP16.1/p53ts cells to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis by contributing to p53 phosphorylation at serine 15. It is likely that other factors also contribute to p53 serine 15 phosphorylation at 32 °C, because serine 15 phosphorylation was not completely suppressed with U0126. To investigate a direct involvement of ERK in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, we introduced antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit ERK expression in DP16.1/p53ts cells. Despite effective ablation of ERK expression in the antisense-treated cells (Fig. 5A), p53-dependent apoptosis was unaffected (Fig. 5B). Thus, the constitutive Ras/MAPK signal that contributes to p53-dependent apoptosis of DP16.1/p53ts cells is likely mediated through MEK independently of ERK.FIGURE 5p53-dependent apoptosis is unaffected by ERK1/2 inhibition. A, DP16.1/p53ts cells were left untreated (NO) or treated with control (CON) or antisense (AS) ERK oligonucleotides and cultured for 24 h. ERK1/2 protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. B, 24 h after the oligonucleotides were introduced into DP16.1/p53ts cells, the cells were incubated at 32"

This protein is responsible for degradation of internalized dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid component of lung surfactant. The PLA2 activity is inhibited by surfactant protein A (SP-A). We postulate that SP-A regulates the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 through direct protein-protein interaction. Recombinant human Prdx6 and SP-A isolated from human alveolar proteinosis fluid were studied. Measurement of kinetic constants at pH 4.0 (maximal PLA2 activity) showed Km0.35 mm and Vmax 138 nmol/min/mg of protein. SP-A inhibited PLA2 activity non-competitively with Ki 10 μg/ml and was Ca2+ -independent. Activity at pH 7.4 was ∼50% less, and inhibition by SP-A was partially dependent on Ca2+. Interaction of SP-A and Prdx6 at pH 7.4 was shown by Prdx6-mediated inhibition of SP-A binding to agarose beads, a pull-down assay using His-tagged Prdx6 and Ni2 -chelating beads, co-immunoprecipitation from lung epithelial cells and from a binary mixture of the two proteins, binding after treatment with a trifunctional cross-linker, and size-exclusion chromatography. Analysis by static light scattering and surface plasmon resonance showed calcium-independent SP-A binding to Prdx6 at pH 4.0 and partial Ca2+ dependence of binding at pH 7.4. These results indicate a direct interaction between SP-A and Prdx6, which provides a mechanism for regulation of the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 by SP-A.

Pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex lining the lung surface, consists of phospholipids, specific proteins, and other lipid components. It is synthesized by alveolar type II epithelial cells, assembled in lamellar bodies, the intracellular surfactant storage organelle, and secreted into the alveolar space and terminal airways where it functions to reduce surface tension and stabilize alveoli (1Van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Robertson B. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 374-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).

DPPC is cleared from the alveolar space predominantly through endocytosis by type II cells with a minor contribution from alveolar macrophages. Under normal physiological conditions, clearance and secretion of DPPC appear to be coordinately regulated (3Jain D. Dodia C. Bates S.R. Hawgood S. Poulain F.R. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L759-L765Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) are a recently described superfamily of Se-independent peroxidases that are distributed in all phyla (4Manevich Y. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3780-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). They are classified according to the number (1 or 2) of conserved cysteine (Cys) residues directly involved in peroxidase catalysis. Of the six mammalian peroxiredoxins, Prdx6 has a single conserved Cys, whereas Prdx1-5 are 2-Cys enzymes. Prdx6 is expressed in various tissues, but is especially enriched in lung and brain (5Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 6Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar). By immunocytochemistry, Prdx6 in lung is present in alveolar type II cells, alveolar macrophages, and bronchiolar epithelium (6Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar), and subcellular fractionation of lungs has demonstrated the presence of this protein in lamellar body, lysosomal, and cytosolic fractions (7Akiba S. Dodia C. Chen X. Fisher A.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Prdx6 functions to protect cells against oxidant stress by glutathione-dependent reduction of short-chain and phospholipid hydroperoxides into corresponding alcohols (4Manevich Y. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3780-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the peroxiredoxin family, Prdx6 possesses phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in addition to peroxidase activity (6Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kim T.S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M.K. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J.

PLA2 enzymes hydrolyze phospholipids at the sn-2 position leading to the release of lysophosphatidylcholine and a fatty acid. PLA2s have been classified as cytosolic PLA2, secreted PLA2, or calcium-independent PLA2. Because the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 is Ca2+ -independent and maximal at acidic conditions (pH 4), it has been named acidic calcium-independent PLA2 (aiPLA2). aiPLA2 activity is inhibited by the competitive transition state inhibitor MJ33 (9Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of Prdx6 in lung [3H]DPPC metabolism has been demonstrated using MJ33 in intact rats, isolated perfused rat lungs, and isolated rat alveolar epithelial type II cells (9Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L748-L754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently, by study of mice with “knock-out” of Prdx6 (11Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Ho Y.S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Inhibited aiPLA2 function in these models resulted in both decreased degradation of internalized DPPC as well as decreased DPPC synthesis by the reacylation pathway. Our laboratory has provided evidence that SP-A modulates the aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6. Addition of SP-A to rat lung homogenate, isolated lamellar bodies, or isolated rat alveolar type II cells inhibited aiPLA2 activity and the degradation of DPPC (3Jain D. Dodia C. Bates S.R. Hawgood S. Poulain F.R. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L759-L765Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of SP-A or SP-A knock-out resulted in increased lung aiPLA2 activity (3Jain D. Dodia C. Bates S.R. Hawgood S. Poulain F.R. Fisher A.B. Am. J.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of SP-A on aiPLA2 activity of recombinant enzyme and tested the hypothesis that SP-A regulates the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 through direct protein-protein interaction. The effect of SP-A on Prdx6 activity and their interaction was studied at pH 4 as well as pH 7.4, because our studies have demonstrated that activity is maximal at acidic conditions compatible with a lysosomal localization for DPPC degradation in the lung (13Rider E.D.

The purity of SP-A and Prdx6 protein preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from rat lungs using elastase digestion as described previously (18Chinoy M.R. Dodia C. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L300-L307PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 1 h on IgGcoated plastic dishes to remove contaminating macrophages. Of the non-adherent cells, 90% were type II cells as indicated by staining with Nile red (Molecular Probes) for the presence of lamellar bodies. Cells were maintained in solution and used immediately for study. Alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage of rat lungs with normal saline (9Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lavage fluid was centrifuged at 100 × g for 120 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. Cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip by incubation at room temperature for 1 h and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS before use. Phospholipase A2 Assay—PLA2 activity was measured as previously described (12Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L335-L341PubMed Google Scholar) using unilamellar liposomes containing DPPC:phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylglycerol:cholesterol (0.5:0.25:0.1:0.15, mol fraction) with a trace of [3H]DPPC. Recombinant Prdx6 (2.5 μg/ml) was incubated with substrate under acidic (40 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH) or alkaline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 or 8.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GSH) conditions at 37 °C, generally for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:2), lipids were extracted, components were separated by two-step TLC using hexane:ether:acetic acid, and the free fatty acid spot was scraped for measurement of dpm. In different experiments, Ca2+ (10 mm) or SP-A in varying concentration was added. As controls, SP-A was boiled, reduced by 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, or alkylated by 0.5 mm iodoacetimide prior to addition to the assay medium. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot—For gel electrophoresis, loading buffer and dithiothreitol (50 mm) were added to the proteins before boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% Tris-glycine gel) with an Xcell Surelock™ mini-cell system (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free milk. Membranes were probed with either anti-SP-A polyclonal antibody (1:1500) or one of the anti-Prdx6 antibodies (mAb 1:2000, pAb196-2111:3000, or pAb1-224 1:1500) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000). The reaction was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL detection reagents (GE Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ) and exposed to X-Omat AR-2 x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). SP-A Binding to Agarose Beads—Affi-gel beads (500 μl) were washed twice in PBS (pH 7.4), treated twice with ethanolamine (0.1 m) for 10 min at room temperature, then washed four times in PBS followed by three washes with ice-cold H2O, equilibrated in PBS for 30 min, centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 rpm, and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. SP-A (2 μg) was incubated with or without Prdx6 (2 μg) for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 10 μl of PBS. Then 100 μl of beads was added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with slow rotation. In some experiments, anti-Prdx6 pAb (1:400 dilution) was added to the incubation mixture. The beads were washed three times with PBS, and sample buffer with denaturing reagent was added to the pellet. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Pull-down Assay—SP-A (2 μg) was incubated for 30 min with Histagged recombinant human Prdx6 (2 μg) in PBS to bring the mixture to a final volume of 10 μl. This mixture was then added to 100 μl of a slurry (∼50 μl) of Ni2+ beads, incubated for an additional 10 min in the presence of mannose (10 mm), and washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 10 mm mannose. Mannose was used to decrease nonspecific binding to agarose, because SP-A belongs to the C-type (Ca2+ -dependent) carbohydrate binding protein family (19Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 20Haagsman H.P. Hawgood S. Sargeant T. Buckley D. White R.T. Drickamer K. Benson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13877-13880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with the protein mixture, the Ni2+ beads were washed three times with PBS. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation in vitro was performed by incubating recombinant Prdx6 (2 μg) and native SP-A (2 μg) with either anti-SP-A pAb or anti-Prdx6 pAb for 1 h at 4 °C with slow rotation. Proteins in 80 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% BSA) were added to washed protein A-linked agarose beads (20 μl) and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C under slow rotation. After centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 1 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. In some experiments, 2.5 mm Ca2+ was added to the binding and washing buffers. A similar protocol was used with protein-A linked to acrylic beads, protein-G linked to agarose beads, and protein-G linked to Sepharose to immunoprecipitate the proteins. Antibodies to Prdx6 and SP-A were also used to immunoprecipitate proteins from isolated rat type II lung cells. Cells were lysed by incubation with Mammalian Cell Lysate buffer (Sigma) and brief sonication. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept at -80 °C in aliquots until use. A Profound™ mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit from Pierce was used to perform ex vivo immunoprecipitation according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, 100 μl of antibody coupling gel slurry (50-μl bed volume) was added to a spin column and washed four times with 0.4 ml of coupling buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.008 m sodium phosphate, 0.002 m potassium phosphate, and 0.01 m KCl, pH 7.4). After washing, 100 μg of pAb (anti-SP-A or anti-Prdx6) was immobilized on the coupling gel by incubating for 4 h with gentle agitation, and then unreacted gel was quenched using quenching buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The supernatant of the type II cell lysate was added to the column, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h with slow rotation at 4 °C. The column was washed three times with coupling buffer, and protein bound to agarose beads was eluted using elution buffer (ImmunoPure® IgG Elution Buffer, pH 2.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Control experiments included gel, which was not activated, addition of quenching buffer instead of antibody to the coupling gel, and addition of a non-related Ab (anti-πGST pAb) to the coupling gel. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed by using an HPLC Alliance 2695 separation unit, a photodiode array detector, and a YMC-Pack Diol column (500 × 8 mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle, and 120-Å pore sizes, all from Waters, Milford, MA). The column was calibrated (R2 = 0.99) with a standard mixture of proteins. The samples containing Prdx6 (15 μg) or equimolar SP-A were eluted isocratically (1.0 ml/min) with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl; absorbency was monitored at 280 nm. In some experiments, SP-A was incubated with Prdx6 for 1 h at 20°C before loading onto the column. Fractions of interest were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Protein Cross-linking—Prdx6 was incubated with sulfo-SBED reagent (Pierce, 1:50, mol/mol) in the dark under constant stirring for 30 min. Excess reagent was eliminated by size-exclusion chromatography (micro Bio-spin 6 column, Bio-Rad). The resulting biotinylated Prdx6 was incubated with equimolar SP-A for 1 h at room temperature with slow stirring in the dark and then illuminated at 365 nm for 15 min. The protein sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Static Light Scattering—Static light scattering experiments were performed using a BI-2000SM instrument equipped with an He-Ne, 623.8 nm, 75-milliwatt Melles Griot laser and BI-APD avalanche photodiode detector (Brookhaven Instruments Inc., Holtsville, NY). SP-A (10 μg) and Prdx6 (10 μg) in 2 ml of buffer were incubated at room temperature under either alkaline (40 mm PBS, pH 7.4) or acidic (40 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0) conditions. To study the effect of Ca2+, CaCl2 was added to the samples at a final concentration of 2.0 mm. The signal of light scattering was accrued at 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°, 105°, 120°, and 135° angles. These results were computed as a Stokes radius using Guinier analysis and expressed by the Williams-Watts size distribution program with the BI-2000SM instrument software. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Studies were performed using a Biacore 3000 apparatus in the Biosensor Shared Resource Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. Prdx6 was covalently coupled via primary amino groups on a CM3 sensor chip surface according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After equilibration of the sensor chip surface dextran with the running buffer (5 mm Ca2+, 0.005% Tween 20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), the carboxymethylated matrix was activated with a mixture of an N-ethyl-N′-((dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. Recombinant Prdx6 (10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8) was injected at a flow of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. Unreacted groups were blocked by ethanolamine (pH 8.5) followed by washing with 50 mm glycine/HCl (pH 2.0) to remove unbound protein. Another flow cell for use as a control was subjected to the identical immobilization procedure in the absence of protein. The association of SP-A with immobilized Prdx6 was studied at both acidic (pH 4.0) and alkaline (pH 7.4) conditions with varying concentrations of SP-A or Ca2+ at 25 °C in running buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 4.0, or 10 mm HEPES, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Dissociation of the SP-A·Prdx6 complex was performed by an injection of running buffer without protein and plus or minus Ca2+. BSA was substituted for SP-A as a negative control and anti-Prdx6 pAb was used as a positive control. Data analysis was performed using BIAevaluation software 3.2 RCI (Biacore). Immunohistochemistry—For light microscopy, freshly isolated rat alveolar type II cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h at 37 °C in room air with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol/acetone (1:1, v:v) on ice for 5 min. Cells were treated with 5% BSA plus 10% normal goat serum in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h to decrease nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were incubated with primary antibody, either anti-SP-A pAb (1:200 dilution), anti-Prdx6 mAb (1:100 dilution), anti-Prdx6 pAb (1:100 dilution), or 3C9 mAb (1:250 dilution), in blocking solution for 3 h. In control experiments, cells were incubated with blocking buffer instead of primary antibody. After washing with PBS (5 min × 5), the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution) and Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250 dilution) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum. After a final washing (5 min × 5 with PBS and 5 min × 2 with dH2O), the coverslip was mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and observed with a confocal microscope (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). For immunofluorescence of alveolar macrophages, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 15 min and then were treated with 5% BSA plus 5% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with both mouse anti-LAMP1 mAb (1:100 dilution) and rabbit anti-Prdx6 pAb (1:100 dilution) in 1% BSA for 3 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h and examined by confocal microscopy as described above. For immunogold staining, mouse lungs were cleared of blood by perfusion and fixed by perfusion and endotracheal instillation of ice-cold buffer containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After 15 min, lungs were cut into 1 × 1 mm pieces and further fixed for 2.5 h in fixation buffer followed by an additional 1 h in ice-cold 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer containing 1% OsO4. The lung pieces were dehydrated at -20 °C with 70%, 80%, and 90% acetone, embedded in LR White resin, and cut into ultrathin sections (80 nm) with a Leica Ultracut UCT (Vienna, Austria). Samples were treated with 0.2% sodium borohydride for 10 min, 0.3% glycine for 10 min, and blocking buffer (0.2% cold water fish skin gelatin and 2% Aurion BSA-c in PBS) for 1 h to block any remaining free aldehyde groups and nonspecific binding sites. Samples then were incubated with anti-Prdx6 mAb (1:100) in PBS with 1% Aurion BSA-c for 2 h at room temperature. For control, samples were incubated with PBS buffer containing only 1% Aurion BSA-c. After washing with PBS (5 min × 6), samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 nm gold-coupled goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:25), then rinsed with distilled water (5 min x 6) and stained for 10 min with 2.5% aqueous uranyl acetate. Labeled sections were observed and photographed at 60 kV in a Jeol 100CX electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) coupled with an AMT advantage HR/HR-B charge-coupled device camera system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA). The PLA2 activity of recombinant Prx6 and the effect of SP-A were evaluated under acidic (pH 4.0) or alkaline (pH 7.4 or 8.5) conditions. Although we have reported previously that aiPLA2 activity is trivial at pH >6 (6Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J.

Manevich, C. Dodia, S. I. Feinstein, and A. B. Fisher, unpublished observation.PLA2 activity at both acidic and alkaline conditions was linear with time during a 60-min incubation; activity at pH 7.4 was ∼50% of the activity at pH 4.0 (Fig. 1). Activity was the same (56 nmol/min/mg of protein) at pH 7.4 (Fig.1) and pH8.5 (Fig.2). The addition of SP-A resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of PLA2 activity of Prdx6 by SP-A (Fig. 2). The effect showed a linear relationship to the logarithm of the SP-A concentration. Inhibition was Ca2+ -independent at pH 4.0 but was accentuated by Ca2 at pH 8.5. In the presence of 50 μg/ml SP-A, aiPLA2 activity was inhibited by 80% under acidic conditions, whereas with alkaline conditions, inhibition was 70% in the presence of Ca2+ and 50% in its absence. The inhibitory effect of SP-A was abolished by its reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, inactivation by boiling, or alkylation with iodoacetamide (Table 1). As a control, BSA had no effect on aiPLA2 activity of recombinant Prdx6 (Table 1).FIGURE 2Effect of native human SP-A on PLA2 activity of recombinant Prdx6. Prdx6 (2.5 μg/ml) was incubated with varying concentrations of SP-A in acidic (pH 4.0) (A) or alkaline (pH 8.5) (B) buffers in the absence or presence of 10 mm Ca2+. The concentration of SP-A is plotted as the log10. Activity in nanomoles/min/mg of protein with zero SP-A (not shown) was 106 ± 2 at pH 4.0 and 56 ± 3 at pH 8.5.

https://openalex.org/W2035820016,"A recent study revealed that the p110α (PIK3CA), catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), is somatically mutated in many types of cancer. For example, PIK3CA is mutated in an estimated 35.6% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. To measure the frequency of PIK3CA hotspot mutations in Japanese HCC patients, exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene were sequenced in 47 clinical HCC samples. Contrary to expectations, no hotspot mutations were found any of the HCC samples. In addition, we found abnormally migrating waves near the end of exon 9 in the PCR chromatograms from 13 of the 47 samples. PCR amplification and subsequent cloning and sequencing revealed that these chromatograms contained two distinct sequences, the wild-type p110α sequence and a different sequence found on human chromosome 22q11.2, the Cat Eye Syndrome region, which contains a putative pseudogene of PIK3CA. These abnormally migrating waves were also found in noncancerous liver tissue, indicating that this was not a result of HCC-associated mutations. Therefore, it is likely that the percentage of hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene of Japanese HCC patients is lower than was previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2081741849,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is expressed by endothelial cells and neurons and serves as a receptor for both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenesis factor, and semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a mediator of axonal guidance. We show here that NRP1 is also expressed in keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo. However, nothing has been reported about the regulation or function of keratinocyte NRP1. Using NRP1 promoter constructs in HaCaT cells, a keratinocyte cell line, we could demonstrate that a neuron restrictive silencer element (NRSE) was implicated in transcriptional repression of the NRP1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binds to NRSE. Overexpression of NRSF in HaCaT cells decreased NRP1 RNA and protein, whereas a dominant negative NRSF increased NRP1. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, an inhibitor of NRSF silencing activity, also increased NRP1 levels. NRP2 expression was not affected. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) strongly up-regulated NRP1 expression, concomitant with down-regulation of NRSF. Other keratinocyte mitogens such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) had no effect. To address function, HaCaT cells were exposed to two NRP1 ligands, VEGF165 and Sema3A. Neither had an effect on proliferation, whereas Sema3A, but not VEGF165, inhibited cell migration. Down-regulation of NRP1 by NRSF overexpression reduced Sema3A activity. It was concluded that NRSF is a transcription factor that silences NRP1 expression and thereby diminishes the Sema3A mediated inhibition of HaCaT keratinocyte migration.

STKE 2002. 2002; : RE4Google Scholar). There are two genes, NRP1 and NRP2, with some distinct and some overlapping properties (3Klagsbrun M. Takashima S. Mamluk R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). NRPs are expressed by many cell types, including neurons, endothelial cells, tumor cells, osteoblasts, and T cells (3Klagsbrun M. Takashima S. Mamluk R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). NRPs bind members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, including VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and placenta growth factor PlGF-2 (1Neufeld G. Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Klagsbrun M. Takashima S. Mamluk R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In angiogenesis, it is thought that NRP1 expressed by endothelial cells forms a tertiary complex with VEGF and the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, VEGFR-2, resulting in enhancement of VEGF biological activity (4Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In neuronal guidance, class 3 semaphorins bind neuronal NRP1, and a tertiary complex is formed with plexins, which are transmembrane proteins that transduce the semaphorin signal (5Puschel A.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There are six members in the class 3 semaphorin family, secreted proteins that bind to NRP1 and/or NRP2. An exception is Sema3E, which binds plexin D1 (6Gu C. Yoshida Y. Livet J. Reimert D.V. Mann F. Merte J. Henderson C.E. Jessell T.M. Kolodkin A.L. Ginty D.D. Science. 2005; 307: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). NRPs have important functions during development, which have been shown in knock-out mice and knockdown zebrafish experiments. Nrp1-deficient mice died in utero at E12.5 to E13.5 and exhibited both neuronal and vascular defects, including severe malfunctions in axonal pathfinding, disorganized blood vessels, lack of normal vessel branching, and missing capillary networks (7Kitsukawa T.

Nrp2-deficient mice developed arteries and veins normally but displayed a severe reduction of small lymphatic vessels and capillaries (9Yuan L. Moyon D. Pardanaud L. Breant C. Karkkainen M.J. Alitalo K. Eichmann A. Development. 2002; 129: 4797-4806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In zebrafish, knockdown of NRP1 expression by antisense morpholinos resulted in vascular defects, including a loss of circulation through the intersegmental vessels that correspond to angiogenic capillary sprouts (10Goishi K. Klagsbrun M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 62: 127-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Axial vessel formation, corresponding to arteries and veins, was not affected. Neural defects also occurred in NRP1 morpholino-treated zebrafish such as aberrant axon branching of motor neurons and migration of motor neurons out of the spinal cord. 3Feldner, J., Becker, T., Goishi, K., Schweitzer, J., Lee, P., Schachner, M., Klagsbrun, M., Becker, C. G. (2005) Dev. Dy. 234, 535-549. 3Feldner, J., Becker, T., Goishi, K., Schweitzer, J., Lee, P., Schachner, M., Klagsbrun, M., Becker, C. G. (2005) Dev. Dy. 234, 535-549. NRPs also contribute to tumor angiogenesis (11Neufeld G. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Guttmann-Raviv N. Herzog Y. Kessler O. Front.

NRP expression is tightly regulated. This is illustrated, for example, in endothelial cells. During embryonic development NRP1 is expressed preferentially in arterial endothelial cells, and NRP2 is expressed preferentially in venous endothelial cells (13Herzog Y. Kalcheim C. Kahane N.

Furthermore, arterial differentiation is controlled by a positive feedback-loop of VEGF and NRP1 (18Mukouyama Y.S. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Gu C. Anderson D.J.

Haemost. 2003; 90: 167-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the transcriptional machinery involved in regulating NRP1 expression, we isolated the mouse and human NRP1 promoters (19Rossignol M. Pouyssegur J. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 744-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An NRP1 luciferase promoter/reporter construct demonstrated optimal activity in a region from -823 to +79 base pairs relative to the transcriptional start site. It was demonstrated by mutation, deletion, and gel shift analysis that an AP-1 element, two SP-1 sites, and a CCAAT box are involved in regulating constitutive and phorbol ester-induced promoter activity in HeLa cells (19Rossignol M. Pouyssegur J. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 744-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Only a few regulators of NRP1 expression are known, including transcription factors and growth factors. Overexpression of the transcription factor Prox-1 down-regulates NRP1 expression in the transition from vascular to lymphatic endothelial cells (20Hong Y.K. Harvey N. Noh Y.H. Schacht V. Hirakawa S. Detmar M. Oliver G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of the transcription factor Ets-1 has been shown to directly up-regulate NRP1 expression (21Watanabe D. Takagi H. Suzuma K. Suzuma I. Oh H. Ohashi H. Kemmochi S.

Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the first report that keratinocytes express NRP1. Whereas NRP1 function and binding of VEGF and semaphorins has been studied extensively in endothelial cells and neurons (1Neufeld G. Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Klagsbrun M. Takashima S. Mamluk R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the regulation of NRP1 gene expression and the response to NRP1 ligands in keratinocytes has not been documented. Therefore, we carried out regulation and response studies using HaCaT cells, a keratinocyte cell line (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) that resembles primary keratinocytes and that can be readily transfected. Closer examination of the NRP1 promoter showed that there were possible repressor elements in the promoter region between -173 and -97. The most promising candidate for a negative transcriptional regulator in this region is the neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), also known as the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which was discovered in 1995 independently by two groups (27Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 28Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). NRSF is a zinc finger transcription factor that binds to a 21-bp recognition sequence known as NRSE (neuron restrictive silencer element) (29Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The main function of NRSF is to repress expression of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cell types and in neuronal progenitor cells (30Jones F.S. Meech R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Repression is accomplished by recruitment of histone deacetylases, which deacetylate histone lysines, rendering them more basic. As a consequence, histones become tightly associated with the DNA, making the DNA less accessible to the transcription machinery (32Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13691-13696Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We report here, using overexpression of wild-type and dominant negative NRSF, that NRSF is a direct transcriptional repressor of NRP1 expression that lowers both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the strong up-regulation of NRP1 by EGF or the heparin-binding HB-EGF in HaCaT cells is accompanied by a down-regulation of NRSF RNA and protein levels. In addition, this is the first report to show that keratinocyte NRP1 is biologically functional. Of the two NRP1 ligands, VEGF does not affect either keratinocyte migration or proliferation, whereas Sema3A inhibits migration. The inhibitory effects of Sema3A are diminished when NRSF is overexpressed in these cells, presumably by making less NRP1 available as a Sema3A receptor. It is concluded that, in keratinocytes, NRP1 is functional as a Sema3A receptor and that NRP1 expression is negatively regulated by NRSF. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained according to the company's recommendations. Culture and preparation of porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells and PAE cells stably overexpressing NRP1 have been described previously (4Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) were maintained as monolayers at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml l-glutamine. Trichostatin A (200 μm, dissolved in ethanol, Sigma) was added to the HaCaT culture medium at a final concentration of 200 nm, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Control cells were cultured in the presence of ethanol using the same dilutions. Stably Transfected Cell Lines—HaCaT cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 6 μg of pcDNA 3.1 expression plasmids (Invitrogen) containing the cDNAs for either NRP1, NRSF, or dominant-negative NRSF for 24 h using the FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and following manufacturer's instructions. Selection was carried out by adding Geneticin (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml over a period of 30 days. Clones derived from single cells were expanded and screened for transgene expression by PCR and Western blotting. NRP1 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Assays—To prepare NRP1 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, various regions of the NRP1 promoter were cloned into the pGL2-luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) as described earlier (19Rossignol M. Pouyssegur J. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 744-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To measure promoter-reporter activity, HaCaT cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates and grown to a density of 5 × 105 cells per well. Into each well 2 μg of pGL2-plasmid were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pSV-βGal control plasmid (Promega), using 6 μl of FuGENE6 reagent. After 24 h the medium was changed, and 24 h later cells were lysed in 120 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates (30 μl) were measured for luciferase activity. To normalize for transfection efficiency, the β-galactosidase activity of 50 μl of lysate was determined with an assay system (Promega). The NRSE element in the neuropilin-1 promoter (located at position -134 to -114 bp upstream of the transcriptional start) was mutated from CGCAGACACCCGGACCTCCC to CGCAGACACCTTGACCTCCC using the Quick-Change XL-Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Successful alteration of the NRSF binding site was verified by sequencing. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The preparation of nuclear extracts from HaCaT cells was carried out as described earlier (34Paya C.V. Ten R.M. Bessia C. Alcami J. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7826-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed mechanically with a glass homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed with a combination of high salt treatment and mechanical disruption in a glass homogenizer. After high speed centrifugation, soluble proteins in the supernatant were dialyzed to reduce the salt concentration, measured for protein content and stored at -80 °C prior to use. Double-stranded 32P-labeled fragments of the NRP1 promoter containing the NRSE were generated by oligonucleotide synthesis (Invitrogen, sequence: 5′-CATTGCTCGTTCCCCTCCTTCCCGCAGACACCCGGACCTCCCCTGGGCGCCACGTCCGCGGCTC) and subsequent end-labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using [γ-32P]ATP, following the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting fragment had a length of 64 bp. For binding reactions, 300 pm of these fragments was incubated with 4 μg of nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature in a binding buffer (Promega, 5× gel shift binding buffer). For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides or with 2 μg of antibodies (11C-12 mouse monoclonal antibodies against NRSF, kindly provided by Dr. David Anderson, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, or the normal mouse IgG control antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by addition of labeled oligonucleotides. Samples were resolved on 4-20% nonreducing TBE polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried, and subjected to autoradiography. RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction and subsequently reverse-transcribed using Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. Regular PCR for NRSF was performed using Taq polymerase under the following conditions: dissociation at 94 °C; annealing at 55 °C; and elongation for 90 s at 72 °C. Number of cycles: 20-30, depending on signal strength. The following primers were used: forward 5′-GTGACTACCAGAACTCG; reverse 5′-CACCTCTATGGGAGGAG. The 825-bp product was visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent ethidium bromide staining. For semiquantitative PCR of NRP1, amplification of both NRP1 and the control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were performed in the same tube. The following primers and conditions were used: NRP1 (forward, 5′-GCAGAGCAGTGTCTCAG; reverse, 5′-GCTGTCATCCATGATCATC; amplification as described for NRSF, the product has a length of 805 bp) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-CCAGCCTCGTCCCGTAGACA; reverse, 5′-CTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGCCCAAGATG). To check HaCaT cell clones for stable genomic integration of the dominant negative NRSF construct, a forward primer that bound within the pcDNA3.1 plasmid was used (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG), whereas the reverse primer bound to a sequence in the cDNA coding for the dominant-negative NRSF (5′-CCTCCAGTGATACTCG). Conditions for the amplification were as described above for NRSF, and the product had a size of 506 bp. For real-time PCR the Quantitect SYBR-Green-based system from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) was used, with amplification cycles consisting of dissociation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 50 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s, resulting in a PCR product of 144 bp in length. Primers were: forward, 5′-CGCTGTGACCGCTGCG; reverse, 5′-CCTCCAGTGATACTCG. Cloning of NRSF and Dominant-negative NRSF Expression Plasmids—A full-length NRSF cDNA containing the entire coding region was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA (extracted with TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen) from HeLa cells as a template. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers and Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen). Advantage-2 polymerase (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used for PCR amplification. 5′ primer, GCCGAATACAGTTATGGC; 3′ primer, GTTCAAAGTTTCATTACTC. The PCR product was inserted into the pcDNA3.1-TOPO-V5-His plasmid (Invitrogen) by TA cloning, and the correct sequence was verified by automated sequencing. When compared with the published reference mRNA sequence (accession number NM005612), all clones derived from different HeLa and HaCaT RNA preparations contained a single point mutation at position 1889 of the coding region, with a change of leucine into proline. This variant has been published before (accession number AB209750). A truncated NRSF form, spanning amino acids 135-446 of the 1097-amino acid full-length protein that has been reported to act as dominant-negative in vitro and in vivo (27Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), was generated by RT-PCR as described above. A start and a stop codon were inserted by PCR (5′ primer, ATGTCAAATAAAGATCTTCCCCCTGAAACACCTG; 3′ primer, TTAAGTTTTTTCATTGGTAATATTATCAGG), and the PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1-TOPO-V5-His as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For Western blot detection of NRP1 and NRP2, HaCaT cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). The cells were sonicated, and protein content was determined. Equal amounts of total protein were incubated with concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to gel electrophoresis (8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting, and specific proteins were detected after incubation with primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), according to standard procedures. The antibodies used were A12 mouse monoclonal anti-NRP1 antibody (dilution 1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and C9 mouse monoclonal anti-NRP2 antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of NRSF, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with protein G-Sepharose and 11C-12 mouse monoclonal anti-NRSF antibody (kindly provided by Dr. David Anderson). P18 goat polyclonal antibody against NRSF (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as primary antibody. Epidermal extracts were prepared by microdissection of 60-μm cryosections using a binocular microscope with subsequent extraction in Laemmli buffer. Immunohistochemical Staining—Discarded normal skin specimens were obtained from the Dana Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA with Internal Review Board approval. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin sections were de-paraffinized in xylene and rehydrated through ethanol to water and then PBS (pH 7.5). Endogenous peroxidases were blocked using 3% peroxide in methanol for 12 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, proteins were incubated in protein blocking solution (3% normal goat serum Sigma and 2% normal sheep serum Sigma in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-NRP1 antibody 44-2 (recognizing amino acids DDSKRKAKSFEGNNNYD in the b2 domain, kindly provided by Seiji Takashima, Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan) at a dilution of 1:400 in protein blocking solution. The next day, sections were washed with PBS, incubated in protein blocking solution for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Slides were washed with PBS and visualized using stable diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Staining was monitored under a bright-field microscope and washed with distilled water to stop the reaction. Sections were then counterstained with Gill's 3 Hematoxylin (Sigma), washed, and mounted with Permount (Fisher). Positive control for NRP1 staining included PAE/NRP1 cells grown on slides, and negative controls for staining included PAE cells grown on slides and skin sections incubated in secondary antibody alone. For immunofluorescent labeling of Sema3A a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Abcam was used (ab23393) on acetone-fixed cryosections. Sema3A was visualized by use of a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. NRSF was stained with the 11C-12 mouse monoclonal anti-NRSF antibody mentioned above. Cells were permeabilized by 0.2% saponin. Bound primary antibody was detected by a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Northern Blot Analysis—HaCaT cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes to 70% confluency, serum-starved overnight, and treated with one of the following growth factors: 10 μg/ml human HB-EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1-24 h, 10 μg/ml human KGF/FGF-7 (R&D Systems) for 8 h, 10 μg/ml recombinant human VEGF165 (R&D Systems) for 4 h, 10 μg/ml amphiregulin (R&D Systems) for 8 h, and 10 μg/ml neuregulin (NRG1β1, R&D Systems) for 8 h. Polyadenylated mRNA was extracted from the cells after growth factor treatment using the Fasttrack™ mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The mRNA was electrophoresed on 1% denatured formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and cross-linked with a GS GeneLinker (Bio-Rad). Membranes were preincubated for 4 h at 65°C in hybridization buffer (1 m NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) followed by overnight incubation with a 32P-labeled 950-bp cDNA probe corresponding to the human NRP1 b domain and prepared with the following primers (forward, 5′-GAAGATTTCAAATGTATGGAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGCTTCCACTTCACAGCCCAG-3′) (25Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Both probes were labeled with the Rediprime™ II, random-primed synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were washed and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Bioscienc"
https://openalex.org/W2015052614,"The aspartic protease cathepsin D (cath-D) is a key mediator of induced-apoptosis and its proteolytic activity has been generally involved in this event. During apoptosis, cath-D is translocated to the cytosol. Because cath-D is one of the lysosomal enzymes that requires a more acidic pH to be proteolytically active relative to the cysteine lysosomal enzymes such as cath-B and -L, it is therefore open to question whether cytosolic cath-D might be able to cleave substrate(s) implicated in the apoptotic cascade. Here, we have investigated the role of wild-type cath-D and its proteolytically inactive counterpart overexpressed by 3Y1-Ad12 cancer cells during chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, as well as the relevance of cath-D catalytic function. We demonstrate that wild-type or mutated catalytically inactive cath-D strongly enhances chemo-sensitivity and apoptotic response to etoposide. Both wild-type and mutated inactive cath-D are translocated to the cytosol, increasing the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspases-9 and -3 and the induction of a caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, pretreatment of cells with the aspartic protease inhibitor, pepstatin A, does not prevent apoptosis. Interestingly therefore, the stimulatory effect of cath-D on cell death is independent of its catalytic activity. Overall, our results imply that cytosolic cath-D stimulates apoptotic pathways by interacting with a member of the apoptotic machinery rather than by cleaving specific substrate(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2101560418,"A powerful endo-chitosanase (CSN) previously described for a large scale preparation of chito-oligosaccharides (Cheng, C.-Y., and Li, Y.-K. (2000) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 32, 197–203) was cloned from Aspergillus fumigatus and further identified as a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 75. We report here a study of gene expression, functional characterization, and mutation analysis of this enzyme. Gene cloning was accomplished by reverse transcription-PCR and inverse PCR. Within the 1382-bp Aspergillus gene (GenBank™ accession number AY190324), two introns (67 and 82 bp) and an open reading frame encoding a 238-residue protein containing a 17-residue signal peptide were characterized. The recombinant mature protein was overexpressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli, rescued by treatment with 5 m urea, and subsequently purified by cation exchange chromatography. A time course 1H NMR study on the enzymatic formation of chito-oligosaccharides confirmed that this A. fumigatus CSN is an inverting enzyme. Tandem mass spectrum analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysate revealed that the recombinant CSN can cleave linkages of GlcNAc-GlcN and GlcN-GlcN in its substrate, suggesting that it is a subclass I chitosanase. In addition, an extensive site-directed mutagenesis study on 10 conserved carboxylic amino acids of glycosyl hydrolase family 75 was performed. This showed that among these various mutants, D160N and E169Q lost nearly all activity. Further investigation using circular dichroism measurements of D160N, E169Q, wild-type CSN, and other active mutants showed similar spectra, indicating that the loss of enzymatic activity in D160N and E169Q was not because of changes in protein structure but was caused by loss of the catalytic essential residue. We conclude that Asp160 and Glu169 are the essential residues for the action of A. fumigatus endo-chitosanase. A powerful endo-chitosanase (CSN) previously described for a large scale preparation of chito-oligosaccharides (Cheng, C.-Y., and Li, Y.-K. (2000) Biotechnol. Appl.

Chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132) is a hydrolytic enzyme acting on the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage of chitosan, a linear biopolymer of β-1,4-linked GlcN, to release chito-oligosaccharides. The oligomers GlcNAc and GlcN have interesting biological activities (1Shahidi F. Arachchi J.K.V. Jeon Y.J. Trends Food Sci.

Because the expression of these eukaryotic chitosanases is relatively inaccessible, studies on their catalytic details are scarce and limited. Based on the anomeric configuration of the C1 proton of the reducing end sugar obtained from the enzymatic products, chitosanases from different families may involve different types of catalysis: either the retaining or the inverting mechanism. The retaining glycosidases catalyze hydrolysis via a two-step, double-displacement mechanism with one of the two essential amino acid residues functioning as a nucleophile and the other as a general acid/base. By contrast, the inverting glycosidases follow a one-step, single displacement mechanism with the assistance of a general acid and a general base. The general base polarizes a water molecule to develop a stronger nucleophile for attacking the anomeric carbon, whereas the general acid protonates the glycosidic oxygen to accelerate the reaction. In the five families containing chitosanase, the retaining configuration of the catalytic mechanism of GH-5 is derived from glucanase (23Wang Q. Tull D. Meinkes A. Gilkes N.R. Warren R.A.J. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14096-14102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inverting configurations have been verified experimentally for GH-8 (24Collins T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31077-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GH-80 is also inferred to be an inverting enzyme. However, the catalytic stereochemistry of GH-75 enzyme remains unknown. In our previous study, a powerful endo-chitosanase (further identified as belonging to the GH-75 family) was induced and purified from the culture medium of Aspergillus fumigatus (11Cheng C.-Y. Li Y.-K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2000; 32: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The purified chitosanase was used for the large scale preparation of chito-oligosaccharides (11Cheng C.-Y. Li Y.-K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2000; 32: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning of this gene, its overexpression in inclusion bodies, and protein refolding. In addition, we analyzed its enzymatic products and performed site-directed mutagenesis. This study is the first extensive investigation of GH-75. Chitosans and Chito-oligosaccharides—Chitosans with different degrees of deacetylation (DDA) were obtained from local suppliers in Taiwan. The DDA values of chitosan were confirmed by quantitatively comparing the signals of the methyl group of the C2 acetyl moiety and the C1 proton in sugar ring with 1H NMR spectroscopy. Most of the chitosans used in this study comprised at least 85% DDA unless otherwise specified. Chito-oligosaccharides (chitodimer, chitotrimer, chitotetramer, chitopentamer, and chitohexamer) were purchased from the Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Bacterial Strains, Plasmid, and Culture Conditions—The A. fumigatus Y2K strain screened from soil, with chitosan as the sole source of carbon (11Cheng C.-Y. Li Y.-K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2000; 32: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was used for gene cloning. For cultivation and enzyme induction, M9 medium with the following composition was used: 1.3 g of Na2HPO4, 3.0 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 0.24 g of MgSO4, and 0.01 g of CaCl2 (in 1 liter). The medium also contained 1% chitosan and was maintained at a pH of 6.0. A spore suspension of ∼1 × 1010 was transferred to 1 liter of the culture medium at 28 °C and agitated at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker. The induced chitosanase and chromosomal DNA were prepared from 5-day cultures, and the total RNA extraction used a four-day culture. Escherichia coli strains TOP10 and pCR 2.1 TOPO-vector (TOPO TA Cloning kit; Invitrogen) were used for DNA cloning, and BL21 (DE3) and pRSET A vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as the protein expression systems. Isolation of Chromosomal DNA and RNA—Mycelia of A. fumigatus were collected by filtration and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Chromosomal DNA was then extracted by the phenol-chloroform method, and total RNA was isolated through acidic guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Construction of the cDNA Library—RNA isolated from the mycelium was used to construct a cDNA library. The method of cDNA synthesis was modified from a SMART PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) (26Seth D. Gorrell M.D. McGuinness P.H. Leo M.A. Lieber C.S. McCaughan G.W. Haber P.S. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2003; 55: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The set of smart primers, pT and pG, were designed and synthesized with the sequences 5′-AAA CAG TGG TAA CAA CGC AGA GTA CTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TVN-3′ and 5′-AAA CAG TGG TAA CAA CGC AGA GTA CGC GGG-3′, respectively, and were used for reverse transcription-PCR amplification (ThermoScript™ reverse transcription-PCR system; Invitrogen). The reverse transcription was performed at 65 °C for 1 h and subjected to PCR with the following parameters for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min, an initial denaturing step at 94 °C for 5 min, and a final extension at 68 °C for 8 min. The freshly prepared cDNA was purified on elution through a GFX column (Amersham Biosciences), cloned into the pCR 2.1 TOPO vector, and transformed into competent E. coli TOP10 for the cDNA library construction. Amplification of cDNA Fragments Containing csn—According to the N-terminal sequence of the mature CSN (11Cheng C.-Y. Li Y.-K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2000; 32: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), two degenerate primers, p1 and p2, were designed. The p1 primer, 5′-TAY AAY YTR CCA CCY AAY YTR AAR C-3′, was designed on the basis of the first eight amino acids of CSN, and the p2 primer, 5′-CNA AYA AYY TNA ARC ARA THT AYG AYG A-3′, was synthesized according to the sequence obtained from the fourth to the twelfth amino acid. These primers were paired with pT for PCR using the cDNA library as the template for amplification of the csn gene fragment. These fragments were then cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO and sequenced. Amplification of the Genomic DNA of CSN—Genomic DNA of CSN was amplified using p2 and p3 (5′-GGA TCC GTT CTA GTT CGC TAT GCT TTC AA-3′) as primers and chromosomal DNA as the template. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO for sequencing. Inverse PCR—The upstream nucleotide sequence containing information about the signal peptide was cloned using inverse PCR according to Ochman et al. (27Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, chromosomal DNA was digested with restriction enzymes. DNA fragments of suitable size were then purified and self-ligated to form circular DNAs, which then served as the template for inverse PCR. Using a set of “outward going” primers, the circular DNA is then amplifiable. In this work, chromosomal DNA (∼5 μg) was completely digested with EcoRI. The digested fragments, ranging in size between 500 and 4000 bp, were isolated from the gels of DNA electrophoresis and further self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Hoffmann-La Roche) at 16 °C overnight. Using a GFX column, the ligated DNA fragments were purified and subjected to serve as a template for inverse PCR. Outward going primers were used to amplify the CSN-related gene function in pairs and were designed as p4 (5′-CTT GTG TTT GTC GTA GAT CTG TTT CAA GT-3′) and p5 (5′-GGA AAA TGT TCC AAG GTA CTG GCA AAA G-3′). The cycling parameters of PCR amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles), with an initial denatured step at 94 °C for 5 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min to complete the unfinished single-stranded products. The inverse PCR product was purified and inserted into pCR 2.1 TOPO for sequence analysis. Construction of Expression System of Recombinant Chitosanase—For the reconstruction of csn in an expression vector, a p6 primer (5′-CAT ATG TAC AAT TTG CCA AAC AAC TTG AAA C-3′) was synthesized with the insertion of a NdeI restriction site (CATATG) before the nucleotide sequence of the first eight residues of the mature protein. Using p3 and p6 as primers and the partial cDNA fragment of csn (described above) as template yielded the mature CSN gene. This PCR product was cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO and further transferred into the pRSET A expression vector between the NdeI and BamHI sites. The resulting vector was named pRSET-csn and expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Chitosanase Activity Assays—Chitosanase activity was analyzed by estimating the amount of the reducing ends of sugars using the dinitrosalicylic acid method (28Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 3: 426-429Crossref Scopus (22220) Google Scholar). The standard assay was prepared by mixing 0.3 ml of chitosan (1%, pH 6.0) and 0.3 ml of enzyme (at a suitable dilution) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C to allow for the completion of hydrolysis; 0.6 ml of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was then added, and the resulting mixture was boiled for 15 min, chilled, and centrifuged to isolate the insoluble chitosan. The resulting adducts of reducing sugars were analyzed and measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. The absorption coefficient of the resulting adducts was determined to be 788 m–1 cm–1 when d-glucosamine was used as the control sample. One unit of chitosanase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of detectable reducing sugars at 37 °C in 1 min (29Fink D. Bouche R.I. Denis F. Brzezinski R. Biotechnol. Lett. 1991; 13: 945-950Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the products could be analyzed using mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization as described below. Protein Expression, Refolding, and Purification—E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring the plasmid pRSET-csn was grown overnight in LB medium. This culture (2.5 ml) was freshly inoculated into the same medium (250 ml) supplemented with ampicillin at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The culture was incubated at 37 °C for 14 h, and the cells were then collected and resuspended in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.0) for sonication. The cell debris was then collected by centrifugation and treated with 5 m urea at 37 °C for 4 h. The supernatant was decanted and kept at 4 °C for at least 3 days to allow protein refolding. Without removing the urea, the supernatant was subjected to cation-exchanged chromatography (HiTrap™ in 5 ml SP-Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffer (pH 6.0, 20 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (from 170 to 240 mm; 10 mm/min) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions with chitosanase activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin 6 centrifugal concentrator with 3,000 molecular weight cut-off, (Vivascience, Edgewood, NY). For purification of inactive mutants, SDS-PAGE separation was used for analyzing the presence of target proteins in all of the fractions collected from column chromatography. Protein Determination—The protein content of the enzyme preparation was determined either by the BCA method as described in the manufacturer's protocol (BCA-1 kit for protein determination; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) or by UV absorption at 280 nm. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study—The stereochemistry of enzymatic hydrolysis was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 40 °C (BioSpin AVANCE 500 spectrometer; Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The chitosan mixture was prepared by dissolving 0.05 g of chitosan containing 98% DDA in 10 ml of 1% acetic acid. This solution was lyophilized and exchanged with D2O repeatedly. The chitosanase for the NMR measurements was also exchanged with deuteriophosphate buffer (20 mm; pD 6.5) by ultrafiltration. After recording the spectrum of the substrate (450 μl), chitosanase (50 μl, 4 mg/ml) was added to the chitosan solution (0.5%). The spectra were recorded 5, 10 15, 20, 30, and 60 min after the addition of the enzyme. All the spectra were recorded over a 5000-Hz sweep width, with eight scans for a total recording duration of 25 s each. Chemical Methylation of Chitosan Hydrolysate—The chito-oligosaccharides were obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan containing 40% DDA. For identification of the structure of these oligosaccharides, a suitable amount of oligosaccharides was chemically methylated at the reducing end of the sugar. Methylation was performed in a solution consisting of an excess of methanol and 2% perchloric acid at 50 °C for 10 h. The methylated oligosaccharides were analyzed with a liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometric (ESI-MS) Analysis— Mass spectra were recorded with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). This was used to scan with a ratio of mass to charge in the range 100–2500 units (m/z), with a scan of 2 s/step and an interscan duration of 0.1 s/step. In all the ESI-MS experiments, the quadrupole scan mode was used under a capillary needle at 3 kV, a source block temperature of 80 °C, and a desolvation temperature of 150 °C. The mass of the desalted form of proteins used for the MS measurements was normally within the range of 5–10 μg. For quantitative analysis of enzymatic activity, chito-oligomers were used as substrates, and the multiple reaction-monitoring scan of a triple quadrupole MS system (Quattro Micro; Micromass) was used. Chitohexamer (100 ppm) and chitopentamer (100 ppm) were mixed with properly diluted chitosanase. The reaction time course was determined using 10 μl of the enzyme mixture injected into the quadrupole MS every 3 min by an auto-sampler. Hydrolysis product ion (m/z 502.2, chitotrimer) was chosen as the specific precursor ion for positive ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Based on its fragment ion signal of m/z 162.0, instrument optimization was performed to achieve more sensitive detection, and the optimum conditions of collision energy setting and cone voltage were 20 and 30 volts, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis for mutations was performed according to the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The basic procedure involved PCR amplification with pRSET-csn as the template and two synthetic oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation as the primer. Table 1 lists the sequences of primers used for the mutagenic tests. The desired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the full gene.TABLE 1Primer pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides designed for mutagenesis and their chitosanase activitiesSymbolOligonucleotide sequenceaThe nucleotides indicated in bold font and underlined are the mutation sites and silent mutation sites, respectively.Mutation sitesbAll of the mutational sites are conserved in family 75 except Glu126.CSN activity%Wild type100D59N(+)5′-CAGTTACTGCGGTAACATTCCGGGD59N96D59N(-)5′-CCCGGAATGTTACCGCAGTAACTGD80N(+)5′-CCAATATGGACATCGACTGCAACGGCD76N65D76N(-)5′-GCCGTCGCAGTCGATGTTCATATTGGD80N(+)5′-CCAATATGGACATCGACTGCAACGGCD78N62D78N(-)5′-GCCGTCGCAGTTGATGTCCATATTGGD80N(+)5′-CCAATATGGACATCGACTGCAACGGCD80N77D80N(-)5′-GCCGTTGCAGTCGATGTCCATATTGGD112N(+)5′-GAAGTTTGGCATCTCCAACCTGGACGCD112N102D114N(-)5′-GCGTTCAGGTCGGAGATGCCAAACTTCD114N109E126Q(+)5′-GGTGTTTGGAAACCAGGATCACTCTCE126Q108E126Q(-)5′-GAGAGTGATCCTGGTTTCCAAACACCD160N(+)5′-GGAATCTGGGGTAACACTAACGGTGD160N∼0D160N(-)5′-CACCGTTAGTGTTACCCCAGATTCCE169Q(+)5′-CGTTTCTACCGGCCAAGCCTCCATTTCE169Q∼0E169Q(-)5′-GAAATGGAGGCTTGGCCGGTAGAAACGD194N(+)5′-GGTCACGATCCCAATAATGTCCTCTTCD194N95D194N(-)5′-GAAGAGGACATTATTGGGATCGTGACCD229N(+)5′CGATCGGTAACAAACTGGTTGCTGGD229N80D229N(-)5′CCAGCAACCAGTTTGTTACCGATCGa The nucleotides indicated in bold font and underlined are the mutation sites and silent mutation sites, respectively.b All of the mutational sites are conserved in family 75 except Glu126. Open table in a new tab CD Spectra of Recombinant Chitosanase—Spectra were obtained at 23 °C on a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-715; cell length, 1 mm). The concentration of proteins used for CD measurement was 1 mg/ml. Sixteen spectra were recorded and averaged. Molecular Cloning and Structure of the csn Gene—To avoid introns in the gene, a cDNA library of A. fumigatus was constructed. Time course tests showed that extracellular chitosanase activity reached a maximum with 5 days of culture, so a 4-day culture of mycelium was used for RNA extraction. The complete molecular cloning of csn involved several steps, as summarized in Fig. 1. Step 1 involved the amplification of cDNA from RNA. Using pT and pG as primers, cDNAs of varied size were synthesized. To obtain the corresponding chitosanase gene, two degenerate primers, p1 and p2, were designed according to the N-terminal sequence of the mature CSN (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). When p1 and pT were used as primers, a major DNA fragment of ∼900 bp was amplified (Step 2). The amino acid sequence deduced from the major DNA fragment was analyzed using the BLAST search on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The deduced sequence was highly homologous with a putative conserved domain of the NADH oxidase family (data not shown). However, when the p2 and pT primers were used, a cDNA fragment corresponding to csn was obtained (Step 3). To obtain information on its structure, we amplified a DNA fragment using p2 and p3 as primers and the chromosomal DNA of A. fumigatus as the template (Step 4). Sequence analysis revealed that two introns with 67 and 82 bp were incorporated in the genomic csn. The upstream nucleotides containing the sequence of the signal peptide was unwound by inverse PCR (Step 5), and the sequence of the full-length genomic csn has been published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank™ with accession number AY190324. In summary, the gene, open reading frame, and two introns of csn were sequences of 866, 717, 67, and 82 bp, respectively. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide that comprises 238 amino acids, including the first 17 amino acids as the signal peptide. The calculated molar mass of the mature protein fused with a Met at the N terminus is 23,593 Da, and this was further confirmed by ESI-MS. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence was 90% identical to that of Aspergillus oryzae (14Zhang X.Y. Dai A.L. Zhang X.K. Kuroiwa K. Kodaira R. Shimosaka M. Okazaki M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1896-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but <30% identical to that of Aspergillus nidulans. Overexpression, Purification, and Refolding of Chitosanase—When pRSET-csn was expressed in BL21 (DE3), weak chitosanase activity was detected in the cytosol. In contrast, protein with a molar mass of ∼25 kDa was observed in cell debris using SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2), indicating the formation of an inclusion body of chitosanase. Attempts to control the expression level of chitosanase by decreasing the culture temperature to 20–25 °C showed no significant improvement in obtaining active enzyme in the cytosol.

We now show that the first two complement control protein (CCP) modules of the C4BP α-chain, plus the four residues connecting them, are necessary and sufficient for binding a bacterial virulence factor, the Streptococcus pyogenes M4 (Arp4) protein.

Bacteria that enter human blood or tissues will be opsonized by complement and destroyed by phagocytes unless they have a means of overcoming attack by the complement system. An extensively studied example of such a virulence mechanism is the ability of many Streptococcus pyogenes M proteins to bind the key human complement regulator C4b-binding protein (C4BP) 2The abbreviations used are: C4BP, C4b-binding protein; C4BP12, C4BP modules 1 and 2;CCP, complement control protein; CR1, complement receptor type 1; DAF, decay accelerating factor; MCP, membrane cofactor protein; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RCA, regulator of complement activation; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; M4-N, a dimer of amino acid residues 1-45 from M4; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: C4BP, C4b-binding protein; C4BP12, C4BP modules 1 and 2;CCP, complement control protein; CR1, complement receptor type 1; DAF, decay accelerating factor; MCP, membrane cofactor protein; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RCA, regulator of complement activation; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; M4-N, a dimer of amino acid residues 1-45 from M4; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation., an interaction that endows the bacteria with resistance to phagocytosis (1Carlsson F. Berggård K. Stalhammar-Carlemalm M. Lindahl G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C4BP is a polymeric, soluble, glycoprotein (∼200 mg/liter in plasma) (2Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The M proteins, classical bacterial virulence factors first recognized over 75 years ago (3Lancefield R. J. Exp. Med. 1928; 47: 91-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are fibrillar surface structures exhibiting antigenic variation within a 50-100-amino acid residue hypervariable N terminus (4Fischetti V.A.

Expression of M protein is important for the ability of S. pyogenes to cause the diseases associated with this pathogen: acute pharyngitis and impetigo (6Stevens D.L. Kaplan E.L. Streptococcal Infections. Clinical Aspects, Microbiology, and Molecular Pathogenesis. University Press, Oxford, New York2000Google Scholar).

Thus escape from complement attack by hijacking of C4BP is emerging as a widespread contributor to immune evasion strategies and is a therapeutic target. The complement system, a vital molecular component of innate immunity, consists of plasma and cell-surface proteins that conspire to rid the body of infectious particles (13Walport M.J. N. Engl. J.

Because complement is potentially harmful to host tissue it is tightly regulated. Like other members of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) protein family, the plasma protein C4BP acts upon the bimolecular C3 convertases that are the main drivers of the complement cascade. The C3 convertases cleave and thereby activate the third component of complement, C3, leading to deposition of C3b on the surface of an unprotected particle such as an invading microorganism. This process, known as opsonization, marks the particle as a target for phagocytosis. C3b also nucleates assembly of further convertase complexes and progression of the cascade toward formation of the membrane attack complex. C4BP regulates the C3 convertase of the classical pathway, a complex of C4b and C2a, by acting as a cofactor for the proteolysis of C4b (15Fujita T. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It binds self-surface glycosaminoglycans where it is maximally effective in preventing complement activation. C4BP additionally acts as a regulator of the alternative pathway (18Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), participates in apoptosis (19Kask L. Trouw L.A. Dahlbäck B. Blom A.M. J. Biol.

Goncalvez I. Landberg G. Blom A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1937-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The predominant isoform of C4BP has seven α-chains each containing eight complement control protein (CCP) modules (or short consensus repeats) and a single β-chain with three CCP modules (22Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy indicated that up to six molecules of C4b bind to one molecule of C4BP at the distal (N-terminal) ends of the seven α-chains (2Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants lacking CCP1, CCP2 (in particular), or CCP3 in their α-chains had severely impaired ability to bind to immobilized C4b (24Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a result confirmed by Fukui et al. (25Fukui A. Yuasa-Nakagawa T. Murakami Y. Funami K. Kishi N. Matsuda T. Fujita T. Seya T. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Four residues, Arg39, Lys63, Arg64, and His67, predicted to reside within a positively charged cluster at the CCP1/2 interface, are crucial for C4b binding (26Blom A.M. Webb J. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19237-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The C4BP-binding M proteins of S. pyogenes interact with a C4BP region close to the C4b-binding site, but sites for binding natural and pathogen-borne proteins appear non-identical (27Blom A.M. Berggård K. Webb J.H. Lindahl G. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial protein adheres more tightly than C4b and is able to displace C4b from its binding site. When bound by a streptococcal M protein, C4BP is still capable of regulating complement and thus protecting the organism upon which it is sequestered from complement-mediated destruction. Unlike in the case of all other RCA proteins there has, until now, been no experimental three-dimensional structural information available for C4BP. Hence the atomic resolution basis of its interactions with pathogen-borne and natural ligands has remained unknown. Opportunities for rational design of therapeutic interventions, e.g. to counter streptococcal infections or to inhibit complement-mediated inflammation, have consequently been limited. Here we demonstrate which domains of C4BP are involved in binding to an M protein of S. pyogenes and present the solution structure of the relevant fragment of C4BP. This has allowed us to delineate in detail the binding sites on the surface of C4BP for the M protein. Expression, Purification, and Sample Preparation—Human C4BP CCP1-2 (C4BP12) cDNA was amplified by PCR yielding the protein sequence: MNCGPPPTLSFAAPMDITLTETRFKTGTTLKYTCLPGY-VRSHSTQTLTCNSDGEWVYNTFCIYKRCRHPGELRNGQVEIKT-DLSFGSQIEFSCSEGFFLIGSTTSRCEVQDRGVGWSHPLPQCEILE-HHHHHH. This was cloned in the Bluescript vector using the PCR-Script cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and transferred into pET16 vector (Novagen, Merck Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) using NdeI and XhoI. The DNA was transfected into BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RP Escherichia coli, which were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol (37 °C). After cooling (30 °C), expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and bacteria grown for 5 h. The bacteria were then centrifuged and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and sonicated. The sonicate was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione. The crude material was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (∼100 ml, Qiagen), and the protein eluted with the same guanidinium buffer plus 0.7 m imidazole. Refolding conditions (from Heiring and Muller (28Heiring C. Muller Y.A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 183-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were screened using a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody and buffer 11 (55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10.6 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 0.055% polyethyleneglycol-4000, 0.55 m arginine, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathoine, 1 mm reduced glutathione) selected. Pooled fractions containing C4BP12 were diluted (20 mg/liter) in buffer 11 and incubated overnight. Iodoacetamide was added to 5 mm, and the solution incubated (30 min, 4 °C) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The protein solution was then applied to an ∼10-ml SourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and correctly folded C4BP12 eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. 15N and 13C, 15N labeling was achieved using M9 medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose. NMR samples were prepared by adding a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) and 0.05% (v/v) NaN3 and concentrating to 500 μl, followed by three rounds of 10-fold dilution in NMR buffer (20 mm deuterated NaOAc, pH 4.5, 0.05% NaN3) and concentration. The final sample volume was 600 μl with protein concentrations of 1.3 mm(15N) or 2.5 mm (13C, 15N), containing 10% (v/v) D2O. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired (37 °C) on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers. Spectra for the titration of M4-derived peptide with C4BP12 were acquired (600 MHz) using a cryo-probe. Spectra were processed using AZARA (W. Boucher, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK). Resonance assignment was performed using ANSIG (29Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 24: 627-633Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments (mixing times = 100 ms). Steady-state 1H-15N NOEs and 15N T1 and T2 values were measured at two field strengths. For experiments to measure residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) the sample was aligned in Pseudomonas filamentous (Pf1) phage (Profos, Regensburg, Germany) with a 2H splitting of 0.9 Hz. Sample conditions were: 0.70 mm C4BP12, 7.3 mg/ml Pf1 phage, 20 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5, 90 mm NaCl. 1DNH, 1DCαC′, 1DNC′, and 1DCαHα couplings were measured for aligned and non-aligned samples. Structure Calculation—NOE intensities were converted into distance categories of 0 -2.7 Å, 0 -3.3 Å, 0 -5.0 Å, and 0 -6.0 Å. The distance restraints, along with four disulfide bonds (defined by homology) and torsion angle restraints calculated from chemical shift index data, were used as input for the structure calculation performed with CNS-solve (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16915) Google Scholar). As calculations progressed, iterative “filtering” of ambiguously assigned NOEs removed duplicates and assignments contributing <1% to the total NOE. The RDC restraints were used only in the final refinement by including the TENSO energy term within CNS-solve using a harmonic potential. Residual dipolar couplings for some residues were excluded on the basis of heteronuclear NOE data. A total of 100 structures were calculated. Titration with M4-N—The peptide dimer, M4-N, was expressed in E. coli, as described. 3I. André, J. Persson, A. M. Blom, H. Nilsson, T. Drakenberg, G. Lindahl, and S. Linse, submitted for publication. Briefly, the part of the M4 gene corresponding to the hypervariable region (residues 1-45) was amplified from plasmid pARP401 (31Frithz E. Hedén L.-O. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cloned into expression vector pET3a, and expressed in E. coli. The codon for a cysteine was added to the 3′ end of the construct to facilitate dimerization of the expressed protein via a disulfide bridge. Dimerization was achieved by oxidation of bacterial lysates with 20 mm CuCl2 in 0.4 m NaCl, pH 8.0 (32Morfeldt E. Berggård K. Persson J. Drakenberg T. Johnsson E. Lindahl E. Linse S. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerized peptide was purified by ion chromatography and gel filtration and was finally dialyzed against doubly distilled H2O. Lyophilized peptide was dissolved in NMR buffer (deuterated NaOAc, pH 6.0) to give 100 μm (dimer concentration). A 20 μm 15 solution of C4BP12 in the same buffer was added and a series of 15N-1H HSQC spectra were subsequently recorded at M4-N concentrations of 100, 50, 25, and 10 μm (dimer concentrations) and compared with a reference spectrum for a sample containing no M4-N. M4 Binding Assay—Microtiterplates were incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with 50 μl of solution containing 10 μg/ml full-length M4 protein, expressed and purified as described in Stenberg et al. (33Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 75 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. Wells were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (washing buffer) and then incubated (room temperature) with 200 μl of quench solution (washing buffer plus 3% fish gelatin). After re-washing, increasing concentrations of recombinant C4BP mutants (see Ref. 24Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumen and 0.1% Tween 20 were added and the plates incubated (4 h, room temperature). Plates were then washed and incubated with biotinylated monoclonal antibody 67 (against CCP4) or monoclonal antibody 104 (against CCP1) diluted in quench solution. After 1 h of incubation, plates were washed and incubated (1 h) with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark), washed again, and developed. The results are shown as a percentage of the maximal binding of recombinant wild type C4BP obtained in each set of triplicate experiments. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Experiments were performed (25 °C) on a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The cell contained 0.01 mm C4BP12 (1.4 ml) and the syringe contained 0.15 mm M4-N. Both solutions were in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. For titrations, one preliminary injection of 1 μl was made, followed by 19 injections of 10 μl with an injection speed of 0.5 μl/s. The stirring speed was 310 rpm; delay time between injections = 3 min. A blank titration, i.e. injecting M4-N into buffer, was used to correct the M4-N:C4BP12 titration. CCPs 1 and 2 of C4BP α-Chain Are Necessary and Sufficient for Binding the Hypervariable Domain of M4—To define the C4BP region involved in M protein binding, deletion mutants of the α-chain were tested for binding to the M protein, M4 (Fig. 1A). None of CCP modules 3-8 were required for M4 binding, but deletion of CCP2 led to significantly reduced affinity. Deletion of CCP1 destroyed binding almost completely. In further investigations, the linking sequences between CCPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the α-chain were engineered by insertions of Ala residues (Fig. 1B). Addition of residues between CCP2 and CCP3, or between CCP3 and CCP4, had no effect on binding, whereas insertions between CCP1 and CCP2 caused a loss of M4 binding. A recombinant protein consisting of residues 1-124 of C4BP α-chain (see Fig. 1C, C4BP12), His-tagged at the C terminus, was expressed in E. coli and refolded. ITC was used (Fig. 1D) to measure the binding affinity between C4BP12 and a dimerised peptide corresponding to the hypervariable region of M4 (residues 1-45 of M4 protein with a C-terminal Cys added. A dimer (M4-N) was created because previous studies had shown dimerization of M4 strongly enhanced C4BP binding (32Morfeldt E. Berggård K. Persson J. Drakenberg T. Johnsson E. Lindahl E. Linse S. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and Kd = 0.5 μm. Taken together, the data summarized in Fig. 1 prove that the N-terminal two CCP modules of C4BP α-chain along with the four residues that link them are necessary and sufficient for M4 recognition. The data confirm that M4-N constitutes a useful model of the C4BP-binding region of the bacterial protein (32Morfeldt E. Berggård K. Persson J. Drakenberg T. Johnsson E. Lindahl E. Linse S. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Structure of C4BP12 Has Been Determined—To further characterize the M4-binding site of C4BP, the structure of C4BP12 was solved using NMR. There were no doubled peaks in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of C4BP12, i.e. there was no indication of multiple conformations. Each of the eight Pro residues is trans as indicated by the difference in chemical shifts, δCβ-δCγ (34Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and appropriate, strong NOE cross-peaks. A total of 1250 inter residue restraints were employed in the structure calculation, along with 895 ambiguous restraints. These were supplemented by 192 residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) collected on an aligned sample of C4BP12 prepared in the presence of filamentous phage. An ensemble of 40 structures was selected from 100 calculated, on the basis of lowest energy arising from experimental restraints (Table 1 and Fig. 2, A-C). The quality of the structures, as judged by the Ramachandran plot (Table 1), is acceptable for a small protein domain with disordered loops (see below); 90% of residues within the ensemble occur in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the plot.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the 40 lowest energy structuresUnambiguous NOEs:Intraresidue1639Sequential899Short range (2 ≤ i − j ≤ 4)240Long range (i − j > 4)763Intermodular7Intralinker111From module 1 to linker35From module 2 to linker21Total unambiguous NOEs3541Total ambiguous NOEs895Residual dipolar couplings1DNH621DNC′651DCαC′411DCαHα24r.m.s.d. for ensemble of 40 structures ± S.D.NOE (Å)0.0423 ± 0.0028Bond lengths (Å)0.0025 ± 0.0001Bond Angles (°)0.5123 ± 0.0177Coordinate rmsd (Å)Backbone atoms (Cα, N, CO): excluding loopsaExcluding residues 15-21, 35-45 (module 1) and 78-82, 107-111 (module 2).

Open table in a new tab The structures of the individual modules converge well (Table 1, Fig. 2, A and B). Each has a similar, elongated shape (Fig. 2D) in which short β-strands and other extended segments (that do not satisfy the criteria used to define β-strands (35Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar)) are aligned with the long axis. Five strands/extended segments wrap around a hydrophobic core that is bounded by the two invariant disulfide bridges. The strands/extended segments run up-down-up-down-up such that the N and C termini are at opposite ends of the module. The connecting turns and loops also generally lie toward the ends of the module, but the “hypervariable loop,” a site of high sequence variation and of insertions or deletions (see Fig. 1C), projects laterally (Fig. 2D). The longer hypervariable loop of CCP1 is poorly defined by the data and corresponds to a prominent dip in the plot of heteronuclear NOEs (Fig. 3), consistent with motion on the nanosecond timescale. A second poorly defined, flexible (as judged by NOEs and the high T1/T2 ratio of Thr45) region of CCP1 includes residues 35-45 (Fig. 3) and is close to, but does not participate in, the interface. A prominent feature of CCP2 is the loop (residues Val108-Val113), between the fourth and fifth extended segments, that carries a three-residue insertion relative to CCP1. This loop is flexible, as judged by heteronuclear NOEs, (see Fig. 3B), and it lies close to the intermodular interface. In general, T1/T2 ratios and heteronuclear NOEs are more variable in CCP1 than in CCP2 (Fig. 3, A and B), reflecting a higher level of flexibility in the first module. The Two N-terminal CCP Modules of C4BP α-Chain Form a Semi-rigid Unit—The ensemble of structures converge well when superimposed over both modules (Fig. 2C). The intermodular interface is mainly hydrophobic with contributions from all four linker residues and from Tyr37 and Val38 of CCP1, along with Phe84, Val108, and Val113 of CCP2. The Tyr37, Tyr62, and Arg64 side chains line up on one side, while on the other, Val38 and Val108 bracket Phe84 and all three contact Lys63, which in turn lies alongside Ile61. There is no evidence from the relaxation measurements for fast or slow timescale motion in the backbone of the linker (Fig. 3, A and B). Nonetheless, a superposition based on individual modules is better than a superposition of the module pair (Fig. 2, A-C), reflecting a small range of intermodular angles among the ensemble (values calculated (Table 1) using for reference a vector connecting the principal inertia tensor of each module with the Cα of its consensus Trp). This could be interpreted in terms of a restricted degree of intermodular movement but could also reflect a limitation of the experimental data. Both the mean tilt and twist angles are relatively small so that the two modules form an elongated structure in which equivalent features, such as the hypervariable loops, lie on the same face of the molecule (Fig. 2D). Residues Involved in Binding to M4 Mapped by Chemical Shift Perturbation—Significant changes in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of C4BP12 occurred upon addition of M4-N (Fig. 4). At a low ratio (0.5:1) of M4-N to C4BP12, some cross-peaks disappear, while others move a small distance within the spectrum. As this ratio is increased, those peaks that had previously vanished reappear at a new frequency, while those that had moved shift further from their original positions. The disappearance and subsequent reappearance of some peaks reflects exchange between free and bound forms of C4BP12 with a frequency comparable with the difference between the frequencies of the original peak (free) and the new one (bound). On the other hand, when the difference between the frequencies of the original peak and the new one is smaller, then the exchange rate is faster relative to the frequency difference, giving rise to the peaks that move incrementally during the course of the titration. The line widths of the cross-peaks for the complex are not significantly broader than those of free C4BP12, despite the increased molecular mass of the complex (15 kDa for C4BP12 + 11.3 kDa for M4-N). One explanation is that the complex is less anisotropic than free C4BP12 and tumbles accordingly; this could happen if the bound form of M4-N is relatively compact and binds toward the center of C4BP12, as opposed to at either end. Most of the significantly perturbed residues (Fig. 5) are in the intermodular linking sequence or in loops or turns near the intermodular interface. From the surface representation (Fig. 5A) it is obvious that these residues do not all lie on one face of the molecule. It is therefore improbable that they are all simultaneously involved in contacting the peptide. More likely the chemical shifts of some of these residues are perturbed by re-orientation of the two modules upon M4-N binding. Within CCP2, however, two stretches of residues distant from the interface have significantly perturbed chemical shifts. These do form a contiguous surface and together comprise a feasible binding patch. The protein engineering experiments described above establish that residues from the interface-proximal region of module 1, and/or in the linker, additionally contribute directly to binding. C4b-binding protein is sequestered by several S. pyogenes strains (36Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar) whereupon the complement regulatory activity of this polymeric protein protects the invading bacteria (1Carlsson F. Berggård K. Stalhammar-Carlemalm M. Lindahl G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C4b-binding protein adheres to the streptococcal M proteins, but the structural details of the protein-protein interactions involved have remained obscure. Our module deletion and ITC-based approach showed that the two N-terminal CCP modules of the C4BP α-chain, and a four-residue linker between them, are necessary and sufficient for binding of the S. pyogenes M protein, M4. This observation is in good agreement with previous module deletion experiments (37Accardo P. Sánchez-Corral P. Criado O. Garcia E. Rodríguez de Córdoba S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4935-4939PubMed Google Scholar), using whole bacteria, that localized the S. pyogenes binding site to CCPs 1-3, with CCP2 absolutely required, while deletion of CCP3 had only a marginal effect. The ITC-based measurements proved that a recombinantly expressed fragment of the C4BP α-chain (C4BP12) composed of residues 1-124, and therefore encompassing CCP1 and CCP2, binds tightly to a dimerized form of a peptide derived from the N-terminal region of M4 (M4-N) and thus that the C4BP-M protein interaction is amenable to structural analysis. To circumvent the possibility that crystal-packing forces, or"
https://openalex.org/W2013752604,"We have investigated the reaction of peptidylglycine monooxygenase with hydrogen peroxide to determine whether Cu(II)-peroxo is a likely intermediate. When the oxidized enzyme was reacted with the dansyl-YVG substrate and H2O2, the α-hydroxyglycine product was formed. The reaction was catalytic and did not require the presence of additional reductant. When 18O-labeled H2O2 was reacted with peptidylglycine monooxygenase and substrate anaerobically, oxygen in the product was labeled with 18O and must therefore be derived from H2O2. However, when the reaction was carried out with H 162O2 in the presence of 18O2, 60% of the product contained the 18O label. Therefore, the reaction must proceed via an intermediate that can react directly with dioxygen and thus scramble the label. Under strictly anaerobic conditions (in the presence of glucose and glucose oxidase, where no oxygen was released into the medium from nonenzymatic peroxide decomposition), product formation and peroxide consumption were tightly coupled, and the rate of product formation was identical to that measured under aerobic conditions. Peroxide reactivity was eliminated by a mutation at the CuH center, which should not be involved in the peroxide shunt. Our data lend support to recent proposals that Cu(II)-superoxide is the active species.

One copper (CuH, also termed CuA) is bound to three histidines (His107, His108, and His172) in domain 1. The other copper (CuM, also termed CuB) is bound to two histidines (His242 and His244) and a methionine (Met314) in domain 2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have identified large changes in coordination between Cu(II) and Cu(I) states (11.Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the oxidized enzyme, CuH is further ligated by at least one solvent molecule, whereas CuM coordinates two histidines and two water molecules in the equatorial plane with the methionine in an axial position undetectable by EXAFS (11.Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12.Chen P. Bell J. Eipper B.A. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5735-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Reduction causes the water ligands to dissociate and the methionine to move close (2.25 Å) to the CuM center (9.Boswell J.S. Reedy B.J. Kulathila R. Merkler D.J. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12241-12250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11.Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, crystallographic studies have failed to detect large changes in metal coordination during redox (6.Prigge S.T. Kolhekar A.S. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of substrate hydroxylation has been the subject of much debate. It is generally accepted that the enzyme cycles through a reductive phase in which the two copper centers are reduced to Cu(I) and an oxidative phase in which O2 is activated by binding at one of the copper centers and subsequently hydroxylates the substrate. How this chemistry occurs is still unclear. Crystal structures of substrate-bound forms of PHM have located a di-iodo-YG substrate bound in the vicinity of the CuM center (2.Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5.Prigge S.T. Kolhekar A.S. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel L.M.

Biol. 1999; 6: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), whereas a precatalytic complex of PHM with the slow substrate tyrosyl-d-threonine and dioxygen shows O2 bound at CuM but rotated away from the Cu-Cα(substrate) vector (7.Prigge S.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel M. Science. 2004; 304: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These structures strongly support the premise that oxygen activation occurs at the CuM center but provide no information on the chemical identity of the reactive species. If the reactive oxygen species is a CuM-peroxo or hydroperoxo complex, an electron must be transferred from CuH to CuM to complete the 2-electron reduction of O2 to peroxide, but this itself presents a mechanistic challenge, since the two coppers are separated across an 11-Å solvent-filled cavity, and the shortest through-bond pathway is >80 Å. To overcome this problem, Prigge et al. (6.Prigge S.T. Kolhekar A.S. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) identified a potential electron transfer (ET) pathway involving the CuH ligand His108, Gln170, a hydrogen-bonded water molecule, and the peptide substrate, which reduced the ET pathway to ∼20 Å. Invoking a different strategy, Jaron and Blackburn (10.Jaron S. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15086-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggested that O2 might react initially at CuH and that the superoxide so formed could channel to CuM providing a carrier for the electron and possibly a proton. Neither of these mechanisms is consistent with all of the available data. Glutamine 170, a critical residue in the substrate-mediated ET pathway, can be mutated to alanine with no loss of catalytic activity (15.Bell J. El Meskini R. D'Amato D. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7133-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas in the related enzyme dopamine β-monooxygenase, oxygen reduction and substrate hydroxylation remain tightly coupled even in the case of extremely slow substrates, apparently ruling out superoxide channeling, where some leakage of superoxide into bulk solution would be expected (16.Evans J.P. Ahn K. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49691-49698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These results led Klinman and co-workers (16.Evans J.P. Ahn K.

IfaCuM(II)-peroxo or hydroperoxo species is an intermediate, then it should be possible to generate product by reacting the oxidized enzyme with hydrogen peroxide and substrate as depicted schematically in the oxidative phase of the mechanism shown in Fig. 1B. This “peroxide shunt” has been shown to occur in other oxygenase systems such as cytochrome P450 (19.Hrycay E.G. Gustafsson J.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ernster L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20.Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), methane monooxygenase (21.Froland W.A. Andersson K.K. Lee S.K. Liu Y. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17588-17597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (22.Wolfe M.D. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 829-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Peroxide shunt reactions have the characteristic that when labeled peroxide is used as the source of the hydroxylating oxygen atom, the label is quantitatively transferred to the products (22.Wolfe M.D. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 829-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have investigated the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide with the oxidized form of the PHM catalytic core (residues 42–356, PHMcc) and find that hydroxylated product is indeed formed in the reaction. However, when 18O-labeled peroxide was used as the source of oxygen, we observed scrambling of the label with atmospheric O2. We also observed that peroxide reactivity is eliminated by a mutation at the CuH center, which should not be involved in the peroxide shunt chemistry. The results have led to the conclusion that Cu(II)-peroxo or -hydroperoxo species are probably not involved in the reaction pathway, and an alternative mechanism involving Cu(II)-superoxo species appears more likely. Chemicals and Reagents—Unless otherwise stated, chemicals and buffers were obtained from Sigma or Fisher and were used without further purification. 18O-Labeled hydrogen peroxide (2% (v/v) solution) and oxygen gas were obtained from Icon Isotopes, New Jersey, at 90 and 99 atom %, respectively. Expression and Purification of PHMcc and Its H242A and H172A Mutants—PHMcc and the H242A and H172A mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (10.Jaron S. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15086-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11.Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13274-13282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using a Cellmax 100 (Spectrum Laboratories) hollow fiber bioreactor with a 1.1-m2 cellulose acetate cartridge. In some experiments, wild type PHMcc was expressed using a Biovest Minimax automated cell culture system (Biovest International). Typically, 5 days of bioreactor harvest were pooled. Ammonium sulfate was added to 50% saturation, and the solution was stirred for 1 h. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g and redissolved, with gentle shaking, in 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), containing 0.001% Triton X-100. The sample was then centrifuged to remove insoluble material, filtered through a 0.45-μm sterile filter, and applied to a 26/60 Hiload Superdex 75 prep grade filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The enzyme began elution at 0.6 column volumes and continued to elute over 45 ml. At this stage of purification, SDS-PAGE revealed a purity level of 90–95%. The enzyme was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Biocad 700E perfusion chromatography system (Applied Biosystems), using a 10 × 100-ml Peek column packed with Poros 20-μm HQ anion exchange resin. Partially purified PHM from size exclusion chromatography was loaded in 20 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.2, and then washed with 2 column volumes of the buffer. The column was eluted by a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in loading buffer, over 10 column volumes. Purified PHM eluted close to 100 mm NaCl. Yields of pure PHMcc for 5 days of harvest ranged from 30 to 50 mg. Copper Reconstitution—The purified protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, was placed in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube to which 100 mm copper sulfate was added at 1 μl/min on ice with gentle stirring until the molar ratio of copper added per protein was 2.5:1. The protein was then concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration device (10,000 Da cut-off) from 30 to 1 ml. This was followed by three wash sequences to remove excess and/or adventitiously bound copper. During each wash, 10 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 25 μm Cu(II) (as Cu(SO4)) was added to the ultrafiltration device, and the solution was concentrated to 1 ml. A final concentration step adjusted the pure PHMcc to 1 mm. The protein was then flash frozen in cryotubes and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. The final Cu/protein ratio was in the region of 2.0–2.2:1. Copper and Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined using the A280 and an extinction coefficient (1 mg/ml) of 0.98 as previously described (10.Jaron S. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15086-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A280 measurements were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-265 spectrophotometer at ambient temperature. Copper concentrations were determined using a PerkinElmer Optima 2000 DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. HPLC Separation and Detection of Product and Substrate—Reverse-phase HPLC was performed with a Varian Pro Star solvent delivery module equipped with a Varian Pro Star model 410 autosampler (250-μl syringe, 100-μl sample loop), on a 250 × 4.6-mm Varian Microsorb-MV 100-5 C18 column. Substrate (dansyl-YVG; American Peptide Co.) and product (produced by the PHM-catalyzed reaction) were monitored by their dansyl fluorescence using a Waters 474 scanning fluorescence detector (λEx = 365 nm, λEm = 558 nm). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Product was separated from substrate via isocratic loading and elution at 25% B in A. Steady State Kinetic Measurements—The kinetics of the peroxide reaction were determined by following the rate of substrate consumption (or product formation) as a function of time. The reaction was performed in a water-jacketed glass reaction vessel, with stirring, in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, at 25 °C. All reagents except for hydrogen peroxide were added to the following final concentrations: dansyl-YVG (50–400 μm), Cu2+ as copper sulfate (5 μm), and PHM (2.5–5 μm). After the reagents were allowed to incubate for 2 min, the reaction was initiated by adding H2O2 from a 15 mm stock, to a final concentration of 0.5–4.0 mm. In a typical experiment using 1 mm H2O2, 330-μl aliquots were removed every 30 s, transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 10 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and vortexed for 10 s. Substrate and product were separated by HPLC, and their concentrations were determined using a standard curve built from chromatograms of 10–200 μm samples of dansyl-YVG run under identical conditions. Kinetic constants were extracted from the raw data by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression in Sigmaplot 8.0. Measurement of the Dansyl-YVG Dissociation Constant KD—For the oxidized enzyme, an Amicon (5-ml) ultrafiltration device was first preincubated overnight with 300 μm Cu(II)-loaded PHM (2.0 copper/protein) in 100 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm dansyl-YVG. The protein solution was then washed repeatedly with buffer until the substrate concentration in the filtrate had fallen to a low level as determined by measurement of dansyl fluorescence of the filtrate. This conditioning procedure ensured that all irreversible substrate and/or protein binding sites on the membrane were occupied. Next, dansyl-YVG was titrated into the PHM solution, and aliquots of the filtrate were extracted for analyses as follows. A septum was placed over the ultrafiltration cell, and the cell was pressurized by injecting 0.6 ml of air over the solution. After a small amount of filtrate had been collected, it was returned to the concentrator, and the process was repeated three times. On the fourth pressurization, 10 μl of filtrate was saved for analysis of the concentration of “free” substrate by fluorimetry (λEx = 365 nm; λEm = 558 nm). The remaining filtrate was returned to the concentrator along with the next titration aliquot (30 μl) of 10 mm substrate for a net volume gain of 20 μl. This procedure was repeated until a total substrate concentration of 1 mm was reached. For the reduced protein, the following modifications to the procedure were used. All solutions were first purged with argon and placed in an anaerobic chamber. Cu(II)-loaded PHM (2.0 copper/protein) in 100 mm MES, pH 5.5, was reduced with a 5-fold excess of buffered ascorbate and then titrated with dansyl-YVG in a conditioned ultrafiltration cell in the anaerobic chamber using an identical protocol. The data were analyzed by constructing plots of fractional binding, f = ([ST] – [SF])/[ET] versus free substrate SF (where the subscripts T and F represent total and free concentrations, respectively). These data were fit by nonlinear regression (Sigmaplot 8.0) to the equation, f=nSFKD+SF (Eq. 1) where KD is the dissociation constant for binding of dansyl-YVG to PHM, and n is the number of binding sites. Values of KD and n were refined in the fits. 18O Incorporation Experiments—18O-Labeling reactions were carried out similarly to those for kinetic analysis, except that all reactions were carried out in an anaerobic chamber. 18O2 reactions were performed by first flushing the enzyme solution with argon for 15 min. The argon headspace was replaced with 18O2, and the reaction mixture was equilibrated for 2 min. H 182O2 experiments were identical to those completed with H 162O2. All reactions were quenched with trifluoroacetic acid (10% in water) and purified on HPLC prior to mass spectrometry measurements. Mass Spectrometry—Samples for mass spectrometry were purified on HPLC and then diluted 250 times for infusion with 50:50 acetonitrile/water in 0.1% formic acid. Samples were directly infused into the electrospray ionization source of a LCQ Deca XP Plus (Thermo, San Jose, CA) ion trap mass spectrometer at 3 μl/min. Typically, 100 profile scans were acquired (200-ms maximum injection time and three microscans) over a range of m/z 500–1500. The standard isotope distribution for substrate and product was calculated using MS-Isotope in Protein Prospector 4.0.5 (by P. Baker and K. Clausner; available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msiso.htm). Measurement of Peroxide Concentration—Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined using a BIOXYTECH H2O2-560 quantitative peroxide formulation kit (OXIS International Inc.). 25 μl of quenched reaction mixture was diluted to 2 ml and mixed thoroughly. 100 μl of this dilution was then added to 1 ml of working reagent. The A560 was recorded for the samples and a series of standards, after incubating for 1 h at ambient temperature. Peroxide Degradation Monitored by Oxygen Production—Oxygen production was monitored using a Rank Brothers oxygen electrode at 25 °C. 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) was added to a stirred cell until a stable base line was achieved. The stirred cell was capped, and H2O2 was then added with a Hamilton syringe, through a small opening in the cap, to a final concentration in the cell of 1 mm. Reagents from the standard reaction including Cu2+, PHM, and substrate, were added consecutively, by Hamilton syringe, with oxygen levels monitored after each addition. Reaction Using Glucose and Glucose Oxidase (GO) to Generate H2O2— Experiments in which a glucose/GO system was used to generate H2O2 were performed in a Rank Brothers oxygen electrode at 25 °C. 100 mm MES buffer (pH 5.5) containing 50 mm d-glucose was added to the cell and allowed to equilibrate, and the response was adjusted to 21%. The base line was allowed to stabilize, the original buffer was removed, and fresh buffer at 100 or 21% oxygen saturation was added. The stirred cell was capped, and glucose oxidase was immediately added with a Hamilton syringe to a concentration of 43 μg/ml. Once all the oxygen was converted to hydrogen peroxide, substrate and PHM were added with a Hamilton syringe to final concentrations of 200 and 5 μm, respectively. Each reaction was performed in a total volume of 2 ml. The reaction was quenched at the desired time, by the addition of 70 μl 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The quenched reaction was immediately analyzed for H2O2, product, and substrate concentrations. Stoichiometry of Peroxide Consumption to Product Formation Using the Glucose/GO Reaction to Generate Hydrogen Peroxide—These experiments were performed in the same manner as the glucose/GO reactions above, with the exception that substrate was added to 400 μm, and only 21% oxygen saturation was used. The initial H2O2 concentration (formed by conversion of the dissolved oxygen to peroxide by glucose/GO) was assayed prior to the addition of substrate and PHM and again after the reaction was quenched with trifluoroacetic acid. EPR Spectroscopic Quantitation of the Reduction of the Copper Centers in PHMcc by Hydrogen Peroxide—EPR spectra were obtained from PHM samples with [Cu(II)] = 250 μm, on a Bruker E500-X-band EPR spectrometer equipped with a SuperX microwave bridge, a superhigh Q cavity, and a nitrogen flow cryostat (Helitran; Advance Research Systems). The following experimental conditions were used: temperature, 80 K; microwave frequency, 9.4 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 10 G. EPR signals were quantified by double integration under nonsaturating conditions and by comparison with 100, 200, and 300 μm Cu(II) (EDTA) standards. Titration with hydrogen peroxide was performed by adding 10-μl aliquots of a 30% hydrogen peroxide stock solution to a 200-μl initial sample volume. The reaction cycle of PHM (Fig. 1B) involves a reductive phase in which the enzyme is reduced by ascorbate to a dicopper(I) reduced intermediate and an oxidative phase in which the reduced enzyme reacts with peptide substrate and dioxygen to generate the hydroxylated product. As depicted in Fig. 1, many of the proposed mechanisms have suggested a CuM(II)-peroxide or hydroperoxide as the hydroxylating species, formed from the reaction of PHM-Cu(I)2 with O2 and subsequent transfer of one electron from each Cu(I) center to dioxygen. If such an intermediate exists, then it should also be generated directly from the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the oxidized (dicopper(II)) enzyme in the presence of substrate. Measurement of Peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine Product Using HPLC— To test whether this peroxide shunt chemistry occurred in PHMcc, we measured the reaction of the oxidized enzyme with dansyl-YVG and hydrogen peroxide. Initial concentrations of reagents were 200 μm substrate, 1 mm peroxide, and 5 μm PHM in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5. Aliquots were sampled at 30-s time intervals, and product was separated from substrate by HPLC, using the fluorescence of the dansyl group for detection (Fig. 2a). Under these conditions, all of the substrate was converted into product within 2–3 min. Further, since the substrate was present in 40-fold excess over the enzyme, at least 40 enzyme turnovers occurred, implying that the reaction was catalytic. Control experiments where peroxide was incubated with substrate and 5 μm Cu2+ in the absence of PHM or in the presence of PHM that had been heated at 90 °C for 30 min gave no product (data not shown), demonstrating that the reaction was enzymatic. Fig. 2 shows rate data for the peroxide reactivity over a range of H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 2c) or dansyl-YVG concentrations (Fig. 2d). Kinetic parameters extracted from these plots are listed in Table 1. Table 1 also lists kinetic parameters for the ascorbate/O2-dependent reaction (Fig. 2b). These data show that although the rate of the peroxide reaction is much slower than the ascorbate/O2 reaction under the standard reaction conditions of 1 mm H2O2 and 200 μm dansyl-YVG, this is due primarily to a large increase in the value of Km for the dansyl-YVG substrate, which is 2 orders of magnitude larger than for the ascorbate reaction. A modest decrease in kcat from 9.2 to 5 s–1 is observed for the peroxide reaction.TABLE 1Comparison of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the PHM-catalyzed hydroxylation of dansyl-Tyr-Val-Gly by the ascorbate/dioxygen and peroxide pathwaysKm,H2O2Km,dansyl-YVGkcatKDμmμms-1μmAscorbate/O25.1 ± 0.69.2 ± 0.4Peroxide reaction2780 ± 260800 ± 4005 ± 3Reduced PHM22.5 ± 2.7Oxidized PHM145 ± 16 Open table in a new tab The large increase in Km for the peroxide pathway suggests that the dansyl-YVG binds to a different form of the enzyme than in the ascorbate/O2-dependent pathway, consistent with reactivity occurring within the oxidized rather than the reduced form of the enzyme. To gain further insight into this possibility, we determined the dissociation constant for dansyl-YVG to PHM in its Cu(I) and Cu(II) forms. PHM was titrated with aliquots of dansyl-YVG in an ultrafiltration cell at 23 °C, and a small volume of filtrate was extracted for measurement of the free substrate concentration from its fluorescence signal. Plots of fractional formation of enzyme-dansyl-YVG versus free substrate were fit to theoretical curves for substrate binding. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The KD values were 22.5 and 145 μm for the Cu(I) and Cu(II) forms of PHM, respectively. The KD for Cu(I)-PHM is in the same range as Km for the ascorbate/O2-dependent pathway, consistent with the dansyl-YVG binding to the Cu(I) form as predicted by the general mechanism of Fig. 1. The KD for Cu(II)-PHM is about 7 times larger than the reduced KD and indicates that structural factors in the oxidized enzyme weaken the binding. Thus, the increased Km measured for the peroxide pathway, although larger than KD for Cu(II)-PHM, is more consistent with substrate binding to the Cu(II) than the Cu(I) form of the enzyme. We also examined the possibility that hydrogen peroxide does not interact directly with the dicopper(II) enzyme but instead reduces it to the dicopper(I) form and that product forms by reaction of the dicopper(I) form with dioxygen and substrate. Here peroxide would be fulfilling the same role as ascorbate. As a test for this reductive peroxide pathway, we studied the reaction of PHM with perox"
https://openalex.org/W2041236494,"BCL-6 is a transcription factor essential for germinal centre B-cell development. The BCL-6 gene is involved in diffuse large-cell lymphoma and overexpressed in other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in high-grade breast cancer. BCL-6 is a transcriptional repressor whose N-terminal POZ domain mediates protein-protein interactions to exert its effects. Reasoning that disruption of POZ domain-mediated interactions may be an effective route to antagonizing the effects of BCL-6 in lymphoma, we screened a library for peptide aptamers that specifically bind to BCL-6 POZ and not the POZ domains of related proteins and describe here the first of these reagents, Apt48. Apt48 binds BCL-6 POZ in a manner distinct from the transcriptional corepressor SMRT, yet was found to prevent BCL-6-mediated repression of a luciferase reporter gene. Apt48 also reproduced several previously validated effects of BCL-6 inhibition. Notably, expression of the differentiation markers CD69, Blimp-1 and cyclin D2 was increased in B-cell lines when Apt48 was expressed. We also show that expression of Apt48 restores cytokine-mediated growth arrest to BCL-6 overexpressing cells. Thus, we have identified a peptide aptamer that affects a function of BCL-6 that is required to prevent differentiation of proliferating B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011598688,"Ionotropic receptors in the neuronal plasma membrane are organized in macromolecular complexes, which assure their proper localization and regulate signal transduction. P2X receptors, the ionotropic receptors activated by extracellular ATP, have been shown to influence synaptic transmission. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach with the P2X2 subunit C-terminal domain as bait we isolated the β-amyloid precursor protein-binding proteins Fe65 and Fe65-like 1 as the first identified proteins interacting with neuronal P2X receptors. We confirmed the direct interaction of Fe65 and the P2X2 C-terminal domain by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. No interaction was observed between Fe65 and the naturally occurring P2X2 splice variant P2X2(b), indicating that alternative splicing can regulate the receptor complex assembly. We generated two antibodies to Fe65 to determine its subcellular localization using postembedding immunogold labeling electron microscopy. We found labeling for Fe65 at the pre- and postsynaptic specialization of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell/Schaffer collateral synapses. By double immunogold labeling, we determined that Fe65 colocalizes with P2X2 subunits at the postsynaptic specialization of excitatory synapses. Moreover, P2X2 and Fe65 could be coimmunoprecipitated from brain membrane extracts, demonstrating that the interaction occurs in vivo. The assembly with Fe65 regulates the functional properties of P2X2 receptors. Thus, the time- and activation-dependent change in ionic selectivity of P2X2 receptors was inhibited by coexpression of Fe65, suggesting a novel role for Fe65 in regulating P2X receptor function and ATP-mediated synaptic transmission.

P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels activated by extracellular ATP. Seven P2X receptor subunits have been identified (P2X1-P2X7) that combine to form trimeric receptors of homomeric or heteromeric composition (1.North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Each P2X subunit has two transmembrane domains, a long extracellular loop, and intracellular N and C termini (1.North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Upon binding of ATP, P2X receptors open an intrinsic pore selectively permeable to monovalent cations and Ca2+ (1.North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Two kinds of deviations from these pore properties have been described. First, chicken and human P2X5 receptors, in addition to cations, allow Cl– to pass (2.Ruppelt A. Ma W. Borchardt K. Silberberg S.D. Soto F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3.Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and second, P2X2, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors become increasingly permeable to organic cations (e.g. N-methyl-d-glucamine) and fluorescent dyes during prolonged or repeated exposure to extracellular ATP (4.Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar, 5.Virginio C. MacKenzie A. Rassendren F.A. North R.A. Surprenant A. Nat.

The kinetics and extent of these selectivity changes can be influenced by point mutations in the transmembrane segments (5.Virginio C. MacKenzie A. Rassendren F.A. North R.A. Surprenant A. Nat.

The C-terminal domain of P2X subunits is the least conserved part of the protein both in length and amino acid composition, indicating that it might confer subunit specific properties. Indeed, the C-terminal domain of P2X subunits was found to determine desensitization kinetics (11.Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, it mediates the interaction of heterologously expressed P2X receptors with intracellular or membrane proteins that influence their functional properties (18.Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L.

The P2X7 subunit heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells has been found to associate with a multiprotein complex containing 11 proteins (18.Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, although it is likely that some of the interactions occur via the long intracellular C-terminal domain of P2X7, this has not yet been determined. Moreover, using affinity chromatography of brain extracts, P2X subunit C-terminal domains have been shown to associate with myelin basic protein and βIII tubulin (22.Gendreau S. Schirmer J. Schmalzing G. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the interaction of P2X subunits with these proteins has not been demonstrated to occur in vivo. P2X2, P2X4, and P2X6 subunits reside at the peripheral portion of the postsynaptic membrane of synapses identified as glutamatergic on the basis of structural characteristics and immunohistochemistry (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This precise location could appose P2X receptors to distinct neurotransmitter release sites and help to compartmentalize intracellular signaling cascades. Interaction with intracellular proteins regulates the targeting and/or signaling of ionotropic glutamate, acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine receptors (24.Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). By analogy, a similar regulation of P2X receptors is expected. In this context, the P2X2 subunit is of special interest, because its C-terminal domain contains several proline-rich sequences (25.Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 26.Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Stuhmer W. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These sequences constitute protein-protein interaction motifs that can bind, e.g. Src homology 3 (SH3), 3The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology domain; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PID, phosphotyrosine interacting domain; Y2H, yeast two-hybrid; GST, gluthatione S-transferase; NMDG, N-methyl-d-aspartate; Trx, thioredoxin.3The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology domain; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PID, phosphotyrosine interacting domain; Y2H, yeast two-hybrid; GST, gluthatione S-transferase; NMDG, N-methyl-d-aspartate; Trx, thioredoxin. Enabled/VASP homology (EVH1), or WW (named for two conserved Trp residues) domains. We therefore used the intracellular C-terminal domain of the P2X2 subunit as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library, and isolated the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) interacting protein Fe65. We show here that Fe65 associates with P2X2 subunits both in vitro and in vivo, and that both proteins colocalize at the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. This interaction has functional consequences, in that the ionic selectivity changes shown by P2X2 receptors are drastically reduced upon coexpression with Fe65 providing a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic receptor function. P2X2 Constructs—Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of the cDNA sequence corresponding to the full cytoplasmic domain of P2X2 comprising amino acids 355–472 (P2X2CD) was amplified by PCR using full-length P2X2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. D. Julius, University of California, San Francisco, CA) as template. The sequence coding for the P2X2 splice variant P2X2(b) cytoplasmic domain comprising amino acids 355–403 (P2X2(b)CD) was amplified by PCR using the P2X2(b) cDNA (kindly provided by E. Glowaztki, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The obtained PCR products were cloned in pLexN vector (27.Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) using the EcoRI/BamHI sites inserted in the oligonucleotides. For recombinant protein expression the sequences coding for the P2X2CD and P2X2(b)CD were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides containing BamHI and NotI sites, the digested PCR products were cloned in-frame with gluthatione S-transferase (GST; pGEX-4T-1 vector; Amersham Biosciences) or thioredoxin (Trx; pET-32a(+); Novagen). Fe65 Constructs—The sequences coding for Fe65 fragments comprising amino acids 218–479 (Fe65-202), 218–309, 218–284, 255–284, and 285–479 were amplified by PCR using full-length Fe65 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. T. Südhof, University of Texas Southwestern, TX) as template and cloned in pVP16-4 vector using the same strategy as with P2X2 constructs. For recombinant protein expression the sequence coding for amino acids 218–479, 197–255, and 40–100 were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame both into pGEX-4T-1 and pET-32a(+) vectors employing the same strategy as with the P2X2CD. The plasmid P2X2CD-pLexN was used as bait to isolate putative interacting proteins from the rat brain cDNA library from postnatal day 8 (27.Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) cloned into pVP16-3 vector. The P2X2CD-pLexN and cDNA library were cotransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method (28.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). The L40 strain harbors the reporter genes lacZ and his3, therefore cotransformants were plated on –THULL plates (lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, lysine, and histidine) to assay for activation of the HIS3 reporter gene, and on –UTL plates (lacking tryptophan, leucine, and uracil) to test β-galactosidase activity as described (29.Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Positive colonies were selected, amplified by PCR employing vector-specific primers, and sequenced. Identity of the interacting proteins was obtained via BLAST on the NCBI data base. Direct assay of the interaction between the different constructs of P2X2 and Fe65 through Y2H was performed following using the same protocol described above. The recombinant proteins GST, GST-P2X2CD, GST-P2X2(b)CD, GST-Fe65-202 (GST-202), Trx-P2X2CD (P2X2CD), Trx-P2X2(b)CD (P2X2(b)CD), and Trx-Fe65-202 (Fe65-202) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as previously described (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For pull-down assays, purified GST-fused proteins or GST alone were bound to 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the corresponding overexpressed proteins for 2 h at 4°C in pull-down buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitor (Complete mini-protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science)). Beads were then extensively washed with pull-down buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS-sample buffer. The protein complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blot using the corresponding primary antibody. Detection was performed by species-specific horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), and visualized using ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using the GST fusion protein containing amino acids 197–255 or amino acids 40–100 of Fe65 (antibodies Fe65-32 or -35, respectively). Antibody purification was performed by using the Aminolink resin from Pierce to which the corresponding Trx fusion proteins were coupled following the manufacturer's instructions. Characterization of the purified antibodies was performed using Western blot of brain crude membrane fractions (P21 rats) as described (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Preabsortion controls were performed by an overnight incubation of the antibodies with 15 μg/ml of the corresponding Trx fusion protein. Four postnatal day 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were transcardially perfused. Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (6.5 mg/kg). After checking anesthetic depth, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.12 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After perfusion, brains were removed, fixed for an additional hour at 4 °C, rinsed in buffer, and stored overnight at 4 °C. For the detection of receptor subunits with peroxidase immunostaining a similar protocol to the one already described (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, vibratome brain slices from two animals were pre-blocked with serum, after they were incubated in Fe65 primary antibodies (for Fe65-32 and -35 sera: 1:1000; for Fe65-32 and -35 affinity purified antibodies 1 μg/ml) and processed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories). Antibody binding was visualized using 3′,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Controls were done by omitting and preadsorption of primary antibody with the corresponding protein for Fe65-32 (20 μg/ml final concentration) and Fe65-35 (10 μg/ml final concentration). Analysis was done with an Olympus upright research microscope. For the detection of receptor subunits with immunogold labeling, a similar protocol described to the one already described (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. CA1 hippocampal regions from two animals were carefully dissected and processed for freeze substitution and low-temperature embedding. For postembedding immunocytochemistry (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ultrathin sections (80 nm in thickness) on nickel grids were incubated in sodium borohydride and glycine Tris-buffered saline solution with Triton X-100. After the sections were pre-blocked with serum, they were incubated with affinity purified primary antibodies for Fe65 (Fe65-32, 10 μg/ml; and Fe65-35, 5 μg/ml), and labeled with colloidal gold-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The analysis of the localization of Fe65 and P2X2 receptor subunits was performed as described (23.Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with double postembedding immunogold labeling using paraformadehyde vapors between two sequential immunogold labeling procedures. Controls were carried out by omitting the primary antibody in the first and sequential immunogold labeling and preadsorption of primary antibody with the corresponding peptide conjugate for P2X2 (50 μg/ml final concentration) or protein for Fe65-32 (20 μg/ml final concentration) and Fe65-35) (10 μg/ml final concentration). Electron micrographs were taken at ×34,300 magnification with a Philips 300M TEM and scanned at a resolution of 1,600 d.p.i. using an Epson Expression 1680 scanner. Image processing was performed with Adobe Photoshop using only the brightness and contrast commands to enhance gold particles. Total membrane protein brain extracts from P8 rats were pre-absorbed with protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The pre-cleared membrane protein extract was then incubated with 2 μg of P2X2 antibody (Alomone Laboratories), P2X7 antibody (Calbiochem), or IgG from rabbit (Sigma) in LP buffer (200 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm NaVO3, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.4% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose was then added to the samples and the mixtures were further incubated 45 min at 4 °C. The protein-bead complexes were washed three times with LP buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and probed by Western blot using P2X2 antibody (U. S. Biological Corp.), P2X7 antibody (Calbiochem), or the Fe65-32 antibody described above. Rat P2X7 receptor subunits were isolated by screening a rat lung library (Clontech) under low stringency conditions using the rat P2X4 as a probe as described (30.Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3684-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). P2X2 cDNA subcloned in pcDNA3 and Fe65 or P2X7 cDNA subcloned in psGEM vector were used to synthesize capped RNA as previously described (30.Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3684-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Defoliculated oocytes were injected with ∼50 nl of cRNA per oocyte at concentrations of 25 ng/μl for P2X2 or P2X7 alone or 25 ng/μl for each P2X2 or P2X7 and Fe65 cRNA for coexpression experiments. Two electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed 2–4 days after cRNA injection in Xenopus laevis oocytes as previously described. The standard Mg2+-Ringer solution used to superfuse the oocytes contained 98 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.35–7.4 (9.Eickhorst A.N. Berson A. Cockayne D. Lester H.A. Khakh B.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with the exception of the concentration-response curves that were performed using a extracellular solution containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35–7.4. The oocytes were voltage-clamped at –60 mV, currents were filtered at 100 Hz and sampled at 500 Hz. In the experiments designed to determine ionic selectivity, equimolar substitution of NMDG+ for Na+ was made in the solution used to superfuse the oocytes. The pulse protocol used consisted of four segments, 50 ms at –60 mV, 50 ms at –90 mV, 250 ms ramp from –90 to 0 mV, and 125 ms at –90 mV. The first segment was used to determine the time course of the current at –60 mV in NMDG+ as shown in Fig. 7, A and C. When the reversal potential in Mg2+-Ringer solution was determined the ramp was performed between –40 and +40 mV. Data were acquired at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. All experiments were done at 20–23 °C. Data were analyzed using Pulse+Pulsefit (HEKA) or IgoPro (Wavemetric). Ion permeability ratios were calculated as described (6.Khakh B.S. Bao X.R. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) from the shift of the reversal potential using the equation PNMDG/PNa = exp(ΔErevF/RT), where PNMDG is the permeability to NMDG+, PNa is the permeability to Na+, and ΔErev is the shift in reversal potential. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from n experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test. The differences were considered significant if p < 0.02. Identification of the Adaptor Protein Fe65 as an Interaction Partner of the P2X2 Receptor Subunit—To identify proteins that interact with P2X2 receptors, we screened a Y2H brain cDNA library (postnatal day 8) (27.Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) with the cytosolic C-terminal domain of the P2X2 subunit (amino acids 355–472; P2X2CD) as bait (Fig. 1A). Approximately one million clones were screened. Of them, 212 induced transcription of LexA-driven reporter genes for both histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity. The most abundant cDNA isolated was represented by 29 clones (5 independent cDNAs; Fig. 1C) with overlapping sequences identical to the adapter protein Fe65 from the rat (31.Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In the same screening seven clones were isolated (2 independent cDNAs) containing overlapping sequences that were 96% identical to the human Fe65-like 1 (Fe65L1) cDNA (32.Guenette S.Y. Chen J.

The isolation of multiple overlapping clones of two homologous proteins lends additional credibility to their interaction with P2X2 subunits. One of the isolated Fe65 cDNA clones, coding for amino acids 218–479 (Fe65-202), was used to confirm the interaction with the P2X2CD in the Y2H system (Fig. 1B). As evidence of specificity, no interaction was observed when instead of P2X2 the C-terminal domains of P2X4 or P2X7 were used (data not shown). Fe65 is a brain-enriched multidomain protein containing one WW protein interaction domain and two phosphotyrosine binding/interacting domains (PTB/PID). To date, several proteins interacting with the different domains of Fe65 have been identified. Thus, the WW domain interacts with Mena, the mammalian homologue of Drosophila Enabled (34.Ermekova K.S.

The PTB1 domain binds to the transcription factor CP2/LSP/LPB1, to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and to the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (35.Zambrano N.

The PTB2 domain interacts with the NPTY motif located in the intracellular part of the APP (38.Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 39.King G.D. Turner R.S. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All five Fe65 cDNAs isolated in Y2H screening contained the complete WW domain, whereas only three of them also included part of the PTB1 domain, and none the PTB2 domain (Fig. 1C). To further delimit the region of interaction, several deletions of the Fe65-202 cDNA clone were generated and cotransformed in yeast with the P2X2CD. Using this approach, we identified the WW domain of Fe65 as both necessary and sufficient for the interaction evidenced by β-galactosidase activity measurements (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the growth in histidine-deficient medium was accelerated when the sequence N-terminal to the WW domain of Fe65 (amino acids 218–254) was present, indicating that this part of the protein can stabilize the complex. Constructs containing only the PTB1 domain and sequences C-terminal to the WW domain were not able to induce histidine prototophy or β-galactosidase activity, arguing that this part of the sequence cannot sustain the interaction with P2X2 (Fig. 1B). In a reciprocal experiment, no interaction was observed between Fe65-202 and the naturally occurring P2X2 splice variant, P2X2(b), missing 69 amino acids (underlined in Fig. 1A) from the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1D), implicating alternative splicing as a regulatory mechanism of this interaction between Fe65 and the P2X2 subunit. Fe65 Binds Directly to the P2X2 Subunit in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the interaction between P2X2 and Fe65, we used affinity chromatography of GST recombinant fusion proteins on GST fusion proteins immobilized on gluthatione-agarose beads (GST pull-down assays). Both glutathione-agarose beads alone or bound to GST served as negative controls for the assay (Fig. 2A). Using immobilized GST-fused Fe65-202 (GST-Fe65-202), the C-terminal domain of P2X2 (P2X2CD) was detected bound to the agarose beads by Western blot with a commercial antibody specific to P2X2 (Fig. 2A). No P2X2 immunoreactivity was detected in the negative controls, or when the resin was incubated with the C-terminal domain of the P2X2(b) splice variant (40.Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R.

In the pull-down experiment in reverse orientation, Fe65-202 cosedimented with immobilized GST-P2X2CD (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings demonstrate that the interaction between Fe65 and P2X2 is both specific and direct. To determine whether P2X2 subunits associate with Fe65 in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments on crude rat brain membrane fractions. We found that P2X2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate Fe65 as determined by Western blot using the Fe65-32 antibody d"

Here, we report that primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in the murine MMR gene Msh2 (Msh2−/−) showed a significant increase in chromosome aneuploidy, centrosome amplification, and defective mitotic spindle organization and unequal chromosome segregation. Although Msh2−/− mouse tissues or primary MEFs had no apparent change in telomerase activity, telomere length, or recombination at telomeres, Msh2−/− MEFs showed an increase in chromosome end-to-end fusions or chromosome ends without detectable telomeric DNA. These data suggest that MSH2 helps to maintain genomic stability through the regulation of the centrosome and normal telomere capping in vivo and that defects in MMR can contribute to oncogenesis through multiple pathways."

Intracellular glucocorticoid and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathways contribute to aberrant hepatic glucose production through the induction of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Here we show that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is required for cAMP-mediated activation of rate-limiting gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) and glucose-6-phosphatase genes. Mutational analysis showed that CARM1 mediates its effect via the cAMP-responsive element within the PEPCK promoter, which is identified here as a CARM1 target in vivo. In hepatocytes, endogenous CARM1 physically interacts with cAMP-responsive element binding factor CREB and is recruited to the PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase promoters in a cAMP-dependent manner associated with increased promoter methylation. CARM1 might, therefore, represent a critical component of cAMP-dependent glucose metabolism in the liver.

Attempts to elucidate the biological function of CARM1 have been constrained by the perinatal mortality of CARM1 knock-out mice (12Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc.

To elucidate the role of CARM1 on a tissue-specific basis, we explored the consequences of acute CARM1 activity modulation for hepatic gene expression. We have identified CARM1 as a critical component of the cAMP-dependent regulatory complex involved in the control of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Plasmids pSG5-CARM1 containing the CARM1 cDNA cloned into pSG5 (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was kindly provided by M. T. Bedford (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX). Mutant PKA (mutPKA), wild-type PKA (wtPKA), G6Pase-1220, PEPCK-490, PEPCK-355, and PEPCKΔCRE have been described previously (6Herzig S. Long F.

Human HepG2 hepatocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat H4IIE cells were maintained in minimum essential medium including 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids. For transfection, the calcium phosphate precipitation method was used as described previously (100 ng of reporter plasmid/well) (15Herzig S. Fuzesi L. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27989-27999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Where indicated, expression plasmids encoding CARM1 or mutant or wild-type PKA were co-transfected (75 or 100 ng of plasmid/well, respectively). For H4IIE transfections, 1800 ng of indicator plasmid and 500 ng of CARM1 expression vector were delivered by the calcium phosphate method using 6-well cell culture plates. The cells were treated with either Me2SO or forskolin (10 μm) (Sigma) for 18 h and were harvested for luciferase assays. The luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Oligonucleotides targeting human CARM1 (5′-GTAACCTCCTGGATCTGA A-3′) were annealed, cloned into pSuper RNAi vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), and transfected into human HepG2 cells (250 ng of plasmid/well). The effect of RNAi on PEPCK or G6Pase promoter activity was measured after 48 h. Oligonucleotides containing two point mutations within the wild-type CARM1 sequence (5′-GTAGCCTCCTGGATCGGAA-3′) or unspecific oligonucleotides (5′-CATTACAGTATCGATCA GA-3′) with no significant homology to any mammalian gene sequence were used as non-silencing controls in all experiments. RNAi efficiency was determined by Western analysis of human HEK cells transfected with either CARM1-specific or -unspecific RNAi vectors using CARM1- or CREB-specific antibody (provided by M. T. Bedford and Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, respectively). HEK cells were transfected (1000 ng of plasmid/dish) using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In contrast to HepG2 cells, HEK cells were transfected with >80% efficiency (not shown) and are, therefore, useful in establishing RNAi efficiency and specificity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Rat H4IIE hepatocytes were grown to 90% confluence, treated with forskolin (10 μm) as indicated, and the ChIP assay was performed as described previously (6Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies against methylated histone H3 (Arg-17) and acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology) or CARM1 were used for the immunoprecipitation. Normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) served as a negative control. Precipitated DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR amplification using primers directed against the rat PEPCK (forward, 5′-GGCCTCCCAACATTCATTAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTAGCTAGCCCTCCTCGCTTTAA-3′) or G6Pase (forward, 5′-TTATCAGTTGCCAGGTGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAAAGTCGTGGAGCACGTTC-3′) promoter regions. Primers for the ribosomal 36B4 gene were used as negative PCR controls (forward, 5′-GGCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCATCAGCACCACAGCCTTC-3′). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of immunoprecipitates was performed using SYBR green technology (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Co-immunoprecipitation—Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were grown to 90% confluence, treated with forskolin (10 μm) when indicated, and the interaction assay and Western analysis were performed as described elsewhere (16Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates III, J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Antibodies against CREB were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with interaction and logarithmic data. In the ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted comparisons between individual experimental groups were performed as indicated. The significance level was p = 0.05. CARM1 Controls Gluconeogenic Gene Expression—To test whether CARM1 is able to regulate the gluconeogenic gene program, we transfected two different lines of cultured hepatocytes with reporter gene constructs carrying PEPCK and G6Pase proximal promoter regions together with CARM1 or control expression plasmids. In both (human HepG2 as well as rat H4IIE hepatocytes), CARM1 overexpression had no significant effect on PEPCK and G6Pase promoter activities under basal conditions (Fig. 1). However, CARM1 overexpression potentiated cAMP-induced reporter gene activities (Fig. 1, p < 0.05). In contrast, CARM1 had no effect on glucocorticoid-induced PEPCK and G6Pase transcription (data not shown), suggesting that CARM1 is specifically involved in the cAMP/PKA-dependent control of gluconeogenic gene expression. To further confirm this notion, we employed CARM1-specific RNAi constructs to knock down expression of endogenous CARM1 protein in transcriptional activation studies. To this end, Western analysis of human HEK cells using CARM1- or CREB-specific antibodies demonstrated the efficient and specific knockdown of endogenous CARM1 protein levels by CARM1-specific RNAi vectors as compared with two unspecific control vectors (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1A). Because of the extremely low transfection efficiency of H4IIE cells (data not shown) (17Wang X.L. Herzog B. Waltner-Law M. Hall R.K. Shiota M. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar) and the observed qualitatively identical impact of CARM1 on gluconeogenic gene transcription in H4IIE and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1), human HepG2 cells were used for all subsequent promoter studies. As shown in Fig. 2B, RNAi-mediated CARM1 gene ablation strongly inhibited PKA-induced PEPCK and G6Pase promoter activities in human HepG2 hepatocytes (left and right panels; p < 0.001 and p < 0.005 for wtPKA, plus CARM1 RNAi versus wtPKA, plus control RNAi, respectively). Supporting the specificity of the RNAi effects, a point-mutated CARM1 RNAi oligonucleotide had no influence on PKA-stimulated PEPCK activity (supplemental Fig. 1B). In line with a largely signal-dependent function of CARM1, RNAi-mediated gene knockdown had only a relatively mild effect on basal PEPCK promoter activity (Fig. 2B, left panel; p = 0.0468 for mutPKA, plus CARM1 RNAi versus mutPKA, plus control RNAi). In contrast, CARM1 gene ablation also strongly reduced non-stimulated G6Pase promoter activity (Fig. 2B, right panel; p < 0.001 for mutPKA, plus CARM1 RNAi versus mutPKA, plus control RNAi), suggesting that endogenous CARM1 might also play a role in the maintenance of basal G6Pase gene expression.FIGURE 2Effect of CARM1 gene ablation on gluconeogenic gene expression.

Data are means ± S.E. (n = 6). Bonferroni-adjusted two-way ANOVA revealed p < 0.05 (mutPKA plus CARM1 RNAi versus mutPKA plus control RNAi) and p < 0.001 (wtPKA plus CARM1 RNAi versus wtPKA plus control RNAi) for PEPCK and p < 0.001 (mutPKA plus CARM1 RNAi versus mutPKA plus control RNAi) and p < 0.005 (wtPKA plus CARM1 RNAi versus wtPKA plus control RNAi) for G6Pase, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CARM1 Is Recruited to Gluconeogenic Gene Promoters in Vivo—The ability of CARM1 to regulate gluconeogenic gene promoter activity prompted us to examine CARM1 recruitment to endogenous PEPCK and G6Pase chromatin templates. To this end, only weak CARM1 association with the PEPCK promoter could be detected by ChIP analysis in untreated rat hepatocytes (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, αCARM1, lane 1). In contrast, CARM1 occupancy over the PEPCK promoter was readily detected after a 1-h treatment of the cells with the cAMP agonist forskolin (4.2-fold induction as determined by quantitative PCR analysis, Table 1) (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, αCARM1, lane 2), supporting the idea that CARM1 is indeed involved in the cAMP response of the PEPCK gene promoter. Promoter-bound CARM1 levels returned to basal conditions after 4 h of cAMP stimulus (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, αCARM1, lane 3; Table 1). Consistent with the kinetics of CARM1 recruitment, PEPCK promoter histone methylation was increased after 1 h of cAMP stimulus and declined after 4 h of forskolin treatment (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, αH3-Methyl, compare lanes 2 and 3). Similar dynamics of PEPCK promoter histone modification was also observed for histone H4 acetylation (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, αH4-Acetyl, lanes 1–3), further strengthening the assumption that CARM1-dependent PEPCK promoter methylation is indicative of a transcriptionally active chromatin status. Interestingly, analysis of CARM1 occupancy of the G6Pase promoter showed strong CARM1 binding already under basal conditions, confirming the notion that CARM1 might be required not only for signal-dependent but also basal G6Pase activity (Fig. 3A, upper right panel, αCARM1, lane 1; compare with Fig. 2B, right). In analogy to PEPCK, CARM1 binding to the G6Pase promoter also increased (3.4-fold as determined by quantitative PCR, Table 1) after 1 h of forskolin stimulation and declined after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 3A, upper right panel, αCARM1, lanes 2 and 3; Table 1). In correlation with these effects, histone H3 methylation as well as H4 acetylation were also induced after 1 h of forskolin treatment and declined after a 4-h exposure time (Fig. 3A, upper right panel, αH3-Methyl and αH4-Acetyl). Together, these ChIP experiments confirmed the importance of CARM1 for the regulation of multiple steps within the gluconeogenic pathway.TABLE 1Occupancy of the PEPCK and G6Pase gene promoters by CARM1 upon treatment with forskolinPromoter0 h Forskolin1 h Forskolin4 h ForskolinPEPCK1.004.2 ± 0.81.2 ± 0.4G6Pase1.003.4 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab CARM1 Activates the PEPCK Promoter through the CREB-binding Site—The observed kinetics of CARM1 occupancy over the PEPCK and G6Pase promoters was tightly correlated with the phosphorylation status of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein CREB in hepatic cells exposed to cAMP stimulus for the indicated time points (Fig. 3B). Following a typical burst (1 h) attenuation (4 h) pattern, PKA-mediated CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 is closely coupled to the recruitment of histone acetylases CBP/P300 and the subsequent transcriptional activation of cAMP-responsive target genes (5Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). The PEPCK promoter region harbors a conserved CREB-binding site (CRE) around position –80 bp from the transcription start site that is required for the cAMP/PKA-dependent induction of PEPCK gene transcription during fasting (6Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This CRE has been shown to be critical for the synergistic induction of PEPCK transcription through glucagon and glucocorticoids, the latter of which exert their transcriptional impact via the well defined glucocorticoid response unit located between –355 bp and –490 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (20Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the CARM1 target site within the PEPCK promoter, we employed PEPCK promoter deletion constructs in transient assays of cultured human HepG2 hepatocytes. When co-transfected with an expression vector for CARM1, PKA-stimulated activity of reporter constructs containing 490 bp of the PEPCK promoter was robustly induced through CARM1 overexpression as demonstrated above (Fig. 4A, PEPCK-490; compare with Fig. 1; p < 0.001). Deletion of the glucocorticoid response unit had no effect on the CARM1-mediated promoter stimulation (Fig. 4A, PEPCK-355; p < 0.05). Interestingly, in the context of the PEPCK-355 construct, CARM1 also induced basal promoter activity, the effect of which did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). In contrast to PEPCK-490 and PEPCK-355, site-specific mutation of the CRE in the context of the PEPCK-490 parent plasmid completely abolished the stimulatory effect of CARM1 overexpression on PEPCK promoter transcription (Fig. 4A, PEPCKΔCRE, p > 0.05), demonstrating the requirement of the CRE for CARM1 activity. To this end, we finally performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using cell extracts from cultured hepatocytes. As shown by Western analysis, no CARM1 could be recovered from precipitates using CREB-specific antibodies under basal conditions (Fig. 4B, αCREB, lane 1). However, CARM1 was readily detected in CREB precipitates from forskolin-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 4B, αCREB, lane 2), demonstrating the signal-dependent in vivo interaction of both endogenous proteins. In contrast, no CARM1 was recovered by precipitation with unspecific IgG, serving as negative control (Fig. 4B, αIgG, lanes 1 and 2). De novo glucose production, e.g. gluconeogenesis, represents one of the key features of hepatic metabolism under fasting conditions to maintain blood glucose levels and energy substrates for brain function (7Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar). In this report, we have defined the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 as a novel regulatory checkpoint in the cAMP-dependent control of gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. The PEPCK and G6Pase genes have been identified as rate-limiting steps in the gluconeogenic pathway. Their activity is largely controlled on the transcriptional level and predominantly exerted by counter-regulatory hormonal cues. Although insulin efficiently down-regulates expression in the postprandial phase, glucagon acting via cAMP strongly induces promoter activity during fasting (14Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the cAMP-dependent control of PEPCK gene transcription. In this context, CREB binding to the CRE seems to be a prerequisite for maximum cAMP responsivity of the PEPCK promoter. Given its association with CREB and the dependence of its activity on the CRE, CARM1 might, therefore, represent a novel component of the PEPCK cAMP-response unit contributing to the maximum induction of hepatic PEPCK gene transcription in response to hormonal signaling. CARM1 was initially identified as a co-activator for the estrogen receptor, working in combination with members of the p160 family of nuclear receptor co-factors, e.g. SRC-1/TIF2/GRIP1, as well as CREB-binding protein CBP/P300 (25Koh S.S.

Our current studies have identified CREB as a novel, signal-dependent CARM1 binding partner conferring cAMP-dependent recruitment of CARM1 to gluconeogenic gene promoters. However, the observed induction of the PEPCK-355 reporter construct under non-stimulated conditions as well as the significant effect of CARM1 depletion upon basal G6Pase activity suggests that CARM1 might also interact with additional factors in the absence of hormonal stimulation. Both the PEPCK as well as the G6Pase promoter harbor binding sites for members of the C/EBP transcription factor family (24Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Gautier-Stein A. Mithieux G. Rajas F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C/EBP proteins are critically involved in the cAMP-mediated as well as basal transcription of both enzyme genes and are recruited to the G6Pase promoter in a constitutive manner (31Gautier-Stein A.

C/EBP family members, therefore, represent attractive candidates for additional CARM1 interaction partners that might explain the impact of CARM1 on basal gene activities under certain metabolic conditions or promoter arrangements. Previous reports suggested an inhibitory effect of CARM1 on CREB-dependent transcription mediated by methylation of its co-factor CBP within the CREB interaction domain, the so-called KIX domain (37Xu W. Chen H. Du K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies identified more prominent methylation sites within CBP that did not inhibit CREB-dependent transcription but seem to contribute to factor/promoter-specific transcriptional activity of CBP (38Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. Vandel L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The observed stimulatory effect of CARM1 in hepatocytes might, therefore, represent a cell-specific CBP methylation pattern that would allow efficient co-activation by CARM1 of a CREB-CBP transcriptional complex in the context of gluconeogenic gene promoters. PEPCK and G6Pase are overexpressed under diabetic conditions, thereby promoting diabetic hyperglycemia (39Friedman J.E. Sun Y. Ishizuka T. Farrell C.J. McCormack S.E. Herron L.M. Hakimi P. Lechner P.

The critical involvement of CARM1 in the hormone-dependent control of these key regulatory steps in hepatic glucose production raises the intriguing possibility that CARM1 is intrinsically contributing to the aberrant activity of the gluconeogenic pathway under diabetic conditions.

The transcription factor USF-2 was shown to be a negative regulator for rat PAI-1 expression, and therefore it was the aim of this study to evaluate the role of USF-2 for human PAI-1 expression. We found in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) that USF-2 induced human PAI-1 expression via two classical E-boxes and the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) within the promoter. Gel-shift analyses showed that E-box 4 and E-box 5 bound USFs, and although the HRE contributed to the USF-dependent effects, it did not bind them. By contrast, USF-2 inhibited PAI-1 promoter activity in primary rat hepatocytes suggesting that PAI-1 expression depends on either the promoter context or USF activity which might be cell type-specific. Cotransfection of human or rat PAI-1 promoter luciferase constructs with expression vectors for wild-type USF-2 or USF-2 mutants in human HepG2 and rat H4IIE cells as well as in primary rat hepatocytes revealed that the effects of USF on PAI-1 expression depend on the cell type rather than the promoter context and that the USF-specific region domain of USF accounts for the observed cell type-specific effects.

In addition to its inhibitory effect on fibrinolysis (3Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar, 4Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1991; 78: 3114-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PAI-1 appears to be a multifunctional protein modulating proteolytic processes associated with prethrombotic events, hemorrhage and thrombus formation, which are positively correlated with increased PAI-1 plasma levels and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia was shown to induce rat PAI-1 gene expression via binding of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to hypoxia-responsive element-1 (HRE-1) and hypoxia-responsive element-2 (HRE-2) within the rat PAI-1 promoter (5Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While HRE-2 was shown to bind HIF-1 with high affinity, HRE-1 functioned as a low affinity HIF-1 binding site and a high affinity binding site for upstream stimulatory factors (USFs) (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). USF-1 and USF-2 are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor family and were first identified by their ability to bind to the adenovirus major late promoter (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). USFs can function as homodimers consisting of either USF-1 or USF-2 or as heterodimers of USF-1/USF-2 through E-box core sequences thereby acting as transcriptional activators or repressors (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Coulson J.M. Edgson J.L. Marshall-Jones Z.V. Mulgrew R. Quinn J.P. Woll P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously found that USF-2 and HIF-1 had opposite effects on PAI-1 gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes. While HIF-1 induced USF-2 inhibited rat PAI-1 expression by outcompeting HIF-1 from binding to the HREs (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although conservation was observed for HIF-1 binding to the HRE in the human PAI-1 promoter (10Fink T. Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Ebbesen P. Zachar V. Blood. 2002; 99: 2077-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a number of differences between the rat and human promoter exist. Especially, sequence analysis of the human PAI-1 promoter revealed that the USF-2 binding site was absent from the human promoter. Instead, two classical E-box sequences named E4 and E5 (-566/-559 and -681/-674) were found that might function as putative USF binding sites. Thus, due to these differences between the rat and human PAI-1 promoter, it is conceivable that USF-2 might have a distinct effect on human PAI-1 gene transcription. Therefore, we analyzed the function of USF-2 in context of the classical E-boxes and the HRE in human hepatoma (HepG2), rat (H4IIE) hepatoma cells, and primary rat hepatocytes. Our results indicate that USF-2 enhances human PAI-1 expression and that the HRE in the human PAI-1 promoter significantly contributes to USF-mediated PAI-1 expression without binding it directly. We further demonstrate that the classical E-boxes E4 and E5 bind USFs and are required for USF-mediated PAI-1 expression. Furthermore, the inducible effect of USF-2 on human PAI-1 gene transcription is dependent on the presence of the USF-specific region within USF-2 and appears to be cell type-specific. All biochemicals and enzymes were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Animals—Male Wistar rats (200-260 g) were kept on a 12 h day/night rhythm with free access to water and food. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg of body weight) prior to preparation of hepatocytes. Cell Culture—Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion. Cells (1 × 106 per dish) were cultured in a normoxic atmosphere of 16% O2, 79% N2, and 5% CO2 (by volume) in medium M199 containing 0.5 nm insulin, 100 nm dexamethasone as permissive hormones and 4% fetal calf serum for the initial 5 h of culture. Cells were then cultured in serum-free medium from 5 to 24 h at normoxia. Then, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (8% O2, 87% N2, 5% CO2 (by volume)) for the next 24 h. HepG2 and H4IIE cells were cultured under normoxia in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS for 24 h. Then, medium was changed and cells were further cultured under normoxia or hypoxia. Plasmid Constructs—The pGl3-hPAI-806 plasmid, containing the human PAI-1 promoter 5′-flanking region from -806 to +19, pGl3-hPAI-806-HREm, pGl3-hPAI-806-M4, pGl3-hPAI-806-M5, and hPAI-806-M45 have been described previously (11Dimova E.Y.

The pGl3-rPAI-766 plasmid containing the rat PAI-1 promoter was described before (5Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human USF-2 and ΔTDU2 as well as U2ΔUSR and U2ΔE5 plasmids were a kind gifts from Dr. A. Kahn and Dr. M. Raymondjean and Dr. M. Sawadogo, respectively, and all plasmids have been described previously (12Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis—Isolation of total RNA and Northern analysis were performed as described (15Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNAs served as hybridization probes; they were generated by in vitro transcription from pBS-PAI-1 using T3 RNA polymerase and pBS-β-actin using T7 RNA polymerase and RNA labeling mixture containing 3.5 mm 11-digoxigenin-UTP, 6.5 mm UTP, 10 mm GTP, 10 mm CTP, 10 mm ATP. Hybridizations and detections were carried out essentially as described before (15Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Blots were quantified with a videodensitometer (Biotech Fischer, Reiskirchen, Germany). Western Blot Analysis—PAI-1 and USF-2 Western blot analysis was carried out as described (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, media or cell lysates were collected, and 100 μg of protein were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and after electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The primary mouse antibody against human PAI-1 (American Diagnostics, Pfungstadt, Germany), a primary rabbit antibody against USF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), as well as primary mouse antibody against hemagglutinin-tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in a 1:100, 1:200, and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used in a dilution of 1:5000, respectively. The ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) was used for detection. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (about 1 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish), 4 × 105 HepG2, and 4 × 105 H4IIE cells per 60-mm dish were transfected as described (16Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn-Katz S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μg of the appropriate PAI-1 promoter Firefly luciferase (Luc) constructs were transfected together with 500 ng of USF-2a, U2ΔUSR, U2ΔE5, and ΔTDU2 expression vectors or in the controls with 500 ng of an empty vector. After 5 h the medium was changed and the cells were cultured under normoxia for 18 h. Then, medium was changed again and the cells were further cultured for 24 h under normoxia or hypoxia. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared by modification of a standard protocol essentially as described (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 18Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The sequence of the human PAI-1 oligonucleotides used for EMSA are 5′-TCTTACACACGTACACACA-3′ (-199/-181); 5′-ACAATCACGTGGCTGGCT-3′ (-571/-552), and 5′-AGTCTGGACACGTGGGGA-3′ (-689/-670). Equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using the 5′-end labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). They were purified with the nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 7 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After preincubation for 10 min on ice, 1 μl of the labeled probe (104 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min at room temperature. For super-shift analysis 0,4 μg of the USF-1, USF-2, and an ATF-1/CREB cross-reactive antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the EMSA reaction, which was then incubated for 45 min on ice. The electrophoresis was then performed with a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 250 V. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Induction of Human PAI-1 mRNA and Protein Expression by USF-2 under Normoxia and Hypoxia—In HepG2 cells transfected with the empty control vector hypoxia enhanced PAI-1 mRNA by about 3.5-fold (Fig. 1). Transfection of the USF-2 expression vector induced human PAI-1 mRNA by about 6.5-fold under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 1). The hypoxia- and USF-mediated increase of human PAI-1 mRNA was followed by an increase of human PAI-1 protein levels. Hypoxia enhanced PAI-1 protein levels by about 2-fold in accordance with data from a previous study (5Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of USF-2 enhanced PAI-1 protein levels by about 4-fold under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 1). USF-2 Activated Human PAI-1 Promoter Luc Gene Constructs in HepG2 Cells—Sequence analyses of the human PAI-1 promoter revealed five E-box-like sequences from which only four and five are classical E-boxes. Therefore, they were named E4 and E5. To investigate the involvement of the HRE as well as E4 and E5 in the USF-2-dependent induction of human PAI-1 expression, the -806 bp wild-type human PAI-1 promoter Luc construct (pGl3hPAI-806) and its derivatives mutated in the HRE as well as in the classical E-boxes were cotransfected with the USF-2 expression vector or an empty vector into HepG2 cells. When the wild-type PAI-1 promoter construct was cotransfected with the empty vector, hypoxia enhanced Luc activity by about 2-fold. Cotransfection of the wild-type human PAI-1 promoter Luc construct together with the USF-2 vector resulted in an about 20-fold increase of Luc activity under both normoxia and hypoxia. The construct pGl3hPAI-HREm containing the mutated HRE responded neither to USF-2 nor to hypoxia. Mutation of E-boxes E4 and E5 in the constructs pGl3hPAI-M4 and pGl3hPAI-M5 reduced induction under hypoxia and significantly decreased the USF-2-mediated induction of Luc activity to about 4- and 3-fold, respectively, compared with the control (Fig. 2). Double mutation of E5 and E4 in pGl3hPAI-M45 also diminished induction of Luc activity by USF-2 to about 2-fold. Thus, these data indicate an involvement of the HRE as well as E4 and E5 in hypoxia- and USF-2-dependent PAI-1 expression. Binding of USF to E-box Sequences in the Human PAI-1 Promoter—To confirm the conclusion from the transfection experiments that USF-2 interacts with HRE, E4, and E5 within the human PAI-1 promoter, binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides spanning the HRE, E4, and E5 was examined by EMSA. Furthermore, to investigate the presence of USF in these complexes, antibodies against USF-1 and USF-2 were included in the binding reaction (Fig. 3). When the labeled oligonucleotide spanning the HRE was incubated with HepG2 nuclear extracts, three major DNA-protein complexes were detected, but the mobility of these complexes was not affected by incubation with antibodies against USF-1 and USF-2. The oligonucleotides spanning E4 and E5 bound also three major DNA-protein complexes. Addition of either USF-1 or USF-2 antibody supershifted the intermediate DNA-protein complexes bound to E4 and E5, confirming that this complex contains both USF-1 and USF-2. However, since it is known that proteins of the ATF/CREB family bind constitutively to HREs (19Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) it was tested whether the complexes formed with the HRE oligonucleotide contain ATF proteins. Addition of the ATF/CREB anti-body to the reaction mixture resulted in a supershift not only with the HRE but also with E4 and E5 showing that the major DNA-protein complex contains ATF/CREB proteins. Thus, these data indicate that USFs can interact only with E4 and E5 within the human PAI-1 promoter. Regulation of PAI-1 Promoter Luciferase Gene Constructs by Wild-type and Mutant USF-2 in Different Cell Lines—Since our results from the transfection studies and the results of our previous study with the rat PAI-1 promoter (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) implicate that the regulation by USF depends on the promoter context, different domains of USF, or the cell type, we investigated the different regulation of human and rat PAI-1 promoter Luc constructs together with plasmids expressing various USF-2 mutants in human (HepG2), rat (H4IIE) hepatoma cells, and primary rat hepatocytes. The USF mutants included the protein U2ΔUSR (ΔAA 208-230) lacking USF-specific region (USR), the protein U2ΔE5, which does not contain some of the amino acids encoded by exon 5 of the transactivation domain (ΔAA 144-188) and the protein ΔTDU2 (ΔAA 1-198) lacking the transactivation domain but containing the USR. In HepG2 cells cotransfected with either the human promoter construct pGl3hPAI-806 or the rat promoter construct pGl3rPAI-766 and USF-2, Luc activity was increased, and the hypoxia-dependent response of the human and the rat promoter was abolished (Fig. 4). Cotransfection of both promoter constructs pGl3hPAI-806 and pGl3rPAI-766 together with U2ΔUSR no longer enhanced Luc activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). When the human PAI-1 promoter construct was used together with expression vectors for U2ΔE5 or ΔTDU2, Luc activity was decreased compared with USF-2-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). Likewise, in HepG2 cells cotransfected with the rat PAI-1 promoter construct and U2ΔE5 or ΔTDU2 Luc activity was only slightly increased compared with the control (Fig. 4). Similar to HepG2 cells, in H4IIE hepatoma cells cotransfection of the human promoter construct pGl3hPAI-806 or rat promoter construct pGl3rPAI-766 with USF-2 increased Luc activity, whereas cotransfection with U2ΔUSR did not show the inducible effect (Fig. 5). After cotransfection of H4IIE cells with pGl3hPAI-806 and U2ΔE5 or ΔTDU2 vectors, Luc activity did not change significantly compared with the normoxic controls. Furthermore, in H4IIE cells cotransfected with the rat PAI-1 promoter construct and the U2ΔE5 vector, Luc activity was increased (Fig. 5), whereas transfection of ΔTDU2 together with pGl3rPAI-766 in H4IIE cells did not induce Luc activity (Fig. 5). Next, we were interested to find out whether the USR or the part of the transactivation domain encoded by exon 5 is crucial for the observed effects of USF on PAI-1 expression in primary hepatocytes. In primary rat hepatocytes, USF-2 slightly repressed the human PAI-1 promoter Luc activity under normoxia and completely abolished hypoxia-dependent up-regulation. Similarly, when primary rat hepatocytes were cotransfected with human pGl3hPAI-806 and U2ΔUSR, Luc activity was still reduced under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 6). However, transfection with the U2ΔE5 vector again reduced Luc activity (Fig. 6). The rat PAI-1 promoter-dependent Luc activity was repressed by USF-2 in primary rat hepatocytes under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 6). In contrast, Luc activity was not repressed when primary rat hepatocytes were cotransfected with pGl3rPAI-766 and U2ΔUSR. Together, these data support that the USF-dependent induction or repression of the human and rat PAI-1 promoter appears to be cell type-specific. In this study, we have elucidated a complex role of the transcription factor USF-2 in the regulation of the human PAI-1 promoter in hepatoma cells and primary rat hepatocytes. We have demonstrated that in hepatoma cells USF-2 induced PAI-1 expression and that thereby the HRE and the classical E-boxes within the PAI-1 promoter played an essential role. Furthermore, USF-2 repressed PAI-1 expression in primary rat hepatocytes showing that the USF-2 effect on PAI-1 transcription is cell type-specific. In addition, we showed that mainly the USR domain within USF-2 appears to be essential for both the inducible and the repressive effect of USF-2 on PAI-1 expression. USF Modulates PAI-1 Expression via Binding to E-box Motifs—USF was originally identified as a transcription factor activating the adenovirus major late promoter (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). USFs mainly function through E-box core sequences, but their ability to bind non-canonical E-boxes (9Coulson J.M.

Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) has been reported. In our study, we showed that USF-2 activated the human PAI-1 promoter in HepG2 cells via the HRE, which contains a non-canonical E-box sequence and the classical E-boxes, E4 and E5 (Fig. 2). Mutations of E4, E5, or both decreased activation of the PAI-1 promoter by USF-2, while mutation of the HRE alone completely abolished it. In addition, in this study and in our previous one (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we observed that the hypoxia-mediated response of the PAI-1 gene was abolished not only by mutation of the HRE but also after transfection of USF-2. Mutations of E4 and E5 also diminished the response of the PAI-1 promoter to hypoxia, and we have shown that they could be binding sites for HIF-1 under certain conditions (11Dimova E.Y. Moller U. Herzig S. Fink T. Zachar V. Ebbesen P. Kietzmann T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, all these sites are critical for the action of USF and HIF-1 indicating that the competitive action between USF and HIF-1 as shown for the rat PAI-1 promoter (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) appears also to be likely within the human PAI-1 promoter. In all, these results proposed a model in which USF proteins may function as repressors of PAI-1 in certain cell types by binding to E-boxes thus preventing binding of proteins with strong transcriptional activity like HIF-1. A similar concept may hold true for other E-box binding proteins like Myc, which can displace HIF-1 from the p21cip1 promoter (23Koshiji M. Kageyama Y. Pete E.A. Horikawa I. Barrett J.C. Huang L.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1949-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) or vice versa that HIF-1 can regulate the expression of some Myc target genes such as human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 1 (BRCA1) (24Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 25Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5757-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our present data suggested that the HRE is the major USF binding site in human PAI-1 promoter. Interestingly, electrophoretic mobility-shift analyses demonstrated that E4 (-566/-559) and E5 (-681/-674) bind USFs, and although the HRE (-194/-187) contributed to the USF-dependent regulation of the human PAI-1 gene, it did not bind USFs. Thus, these results again emphasize the role of the HRE, E4, and E5 in USF-2-dependent PAI-1 gene transcription and suggest a cooperative interaction among these elements within the promoter via a yet unknown cofactor. Similarly, a recent study proposed a cooperative model showing that E4 as a USF-1 binding site modulates the TGF-1β-dependent PAI-1 expression in human epidermal keratinocytes (26Allen R.R. Qi L. Higgins P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since we showed that a transcription factor from the ATF-1/CREB family binds constitutively to the HRE, it is tempting to speculate that CREB-binding protein is involved as a cofactor. It may then interact via the USR with USF proteins bound to E4 and E5 thus implicating that this complex cooperates with the general transcriptional machinery. This seems to be likely, since USF is related to the basal transcription factor TFII-I and both of them have been implicated in the recruitment of the general transcriptional complexes to TATA-less promoters and in stabilization of the general transcriptional machinery in TATA-box-containing promoters (22Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 28Bungert J. Kober I. During F. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 promoter contains a TATA box, and the USF action might be due to interaction with the basal machinery rather than with its stabilization, since luciferase assays showed that only mutation of the HRE is sufficient to abolish completely the USF effect. Furthermore, the cooperative mode is supported by a study showing that USF can act through both an E-box and a non-canonical E-box as both enhancer and initiator in the regulation of the vasopressin promoter (9Coulson J.M. Edgson J.L. Marshall-Jones Z.V. Mulgrew R. Quinn J.P. Woll P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, it is not known yet whether and to what extent USF, CREB-binding protein/p300, and the general transcriptional machinery interact, although preliminary evidence has been obtained (29Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the details of this interaction need to be clarified in future studies. USFs Act as Activators and Inhibitors—Among the USF-induced genes are those involved in cellular proliferation such as p53 (30Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), cyclin B1 (31Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), L-type pyruvate kinase (12Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J.

Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The inhibitory role of USF was reported for the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer gene (35Carter R.S. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), aortic preferentially expressed gene-1 (APEG-1) (36Chen Y.H. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47658-47663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the CYP1A1 gene (37Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Itoh S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kamataki T. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The findings of this study that USF-2 acted as an inducer of human PAI-1 expression appeared to be contrasted by our previous findings with the rat PAI-1 gene where USF-2 acted as inhibitor. First, we thought that these differences might be due to sequence variabilities within the promoter, since sequence analysis of the human and rat PAI-1 promoter revealed a number of differences. While complete conservation between the HRE in human and rat PAI-1 promoters was found, the two classical E-boxes, named E4 and E5, were found only in the human but not in the rat PAI-1 promoter. In addition, the USF-2 binding site in the rat promoter (6Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is absent from the human PAI-1 promoter. However, our transfection experiments with wild-type human PAI-1 promoter pGl3hPAI-806 or rat PAI-1 promoter pGl3rPAI-766 Luc gene constructs together with a USF-2 expression vector in human (HepG2) and rat (H4IIE) cells as well as in primary rat hepatocytes showed that USF-2 induced both the human and the rat PAI-1 promoter constructs in either the human or the rat hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 4, 5). In addition, we found that USF-2 repressed both promoters to a different extend in primary rat hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Thus, these results show that the action of USF as activator or repressor of PAI-1 expression depends on the cell type rather than on differences between the promoters. The USR Domain as a Critical Part within USF-2—Several functional domains of the USF-2 protein such as the USF specific region (USR) and especially the part of the transactivation domain that is encoded by exon 5 of the USF gene have been proposed to be important for USF activity (14Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The USR has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation by USF-2 of promoters containing both a TATA-box and an initiator element (Inr), whereas the exon 5 is required together with USR for transcriptional activation of promoters containing only the TATA-box but no Inr element (14Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that in hepatoma cells the USR domain appears to contribute predominantly to the activity of USF-2 regulating the PAI-1 promoter, which contains E-box motifs, a TATA-box, but no Inr element. In addition, we obtained results showing that the USR is also required for PAI-1 gene repression by USF-2 in primary rat hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Furthermore, when the sequence corresponding to exon 5 was deleted from USF-2, no effects on the transcriptional activity of USF-2 were observed with one exception; enhanced transcriptional activity with the rat PAI-1 promoter in H4IIE cells (Fig. 5). This suggests that this part can inhibit the activity of USF-2 only in H4IIE cells, i.e. in a cell type-specific manner. Thus, our findings are in line with a study in which the transcriptional activity of USF proteins appeared also to be controlled by an unknown cofactor recognizing the USR domain (39Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which might be either differently expressed or modified in a cell type-specific manner. In summary, we found that the human PAI-1 promoter is regulated by USF via E4, E5, and the HRE. Thereby, the different regulation of the PAI-1 promoter occurred in a cell type-dependent manner where the USR domain of USF plays a crucial role implicating the interaction with a so far unknown cofactor.

Mutations in this enzyme cause a human autosomal recessive disorder called primary metabolic aciduria, which typically kills victims because of an inability to tolerate hypoglycemia. Here we present crystal structures of the HMG-CoA lyases from Bacillus subtilis and Brucella melitensis at 2.7 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. These enzymes share greater than 45% sequence identity with the human orthologue.

Surprisingly, the residues forming this cation-binding site and most of their interaction partners are shared with three other TIM barrel enzymes that catalyze diverse carbon-carbon bond cleavage reactions believed to proceed through enolate intermediates (4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase, 2-isopropylmalate synthase, and transcarboxylase 5S). We propose the name “DRE-TIM metallolyases” for this newly identified enzyme family likely to employ a common catalytic reaction mechanism involving an invariant Asp-Arg-Glu (DRE) triplet.

The enzyme HMG-CoA lyase (HL) 2The abbreviations used are: HL, HMG-CoA lyase; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TIM, triose-phosphate isomerase; hsHL, H. sapiens HL; bsHL, Bacillus subtilis HL; PDB, Protein Data Bank; bmHL, B. melitensis HL.catalyzes the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to form acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). This reaction represents the terminal steps in both the metabolic degradation of dietary leucine and the formation of ketone bodies, which represent an essential alternative energy source for animals under conditions of low serum glucose concentration (hypoglycemia). The enzyme is localized to the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotic cells. It is expressed at some level in a wide variety of human tissues but at the highest levels in the kidneys and especially the liver, which is the primary site of ketone body generation (1Pospisilova E. Mrazova L. Hrda J. Martincova O. Zeman J. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2003; 26: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Primary metabolic aciduria is a autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in human HL (Homo sapiens HL or hsHL). This disease is rare but widely distributed among racial and ethnic populations. It is generally detected based on the presence of highly elevated concentrations of hydroxymethylglutaric acid and related organic acids in blood and urine. Victims of the disease experience episodes of vomiting, malaise, hypotonia, and apnea that can progress to coma. Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration can be prevented by careful restriction of dietary leucine intake, which reduces the toxic accumulation of HMG-related organic acids, but victims frequently die in early childhood because of the inability to manage hypoglycemic shock (2Pie J. Casals N. Puisac B. Hegardt F.G. J. Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 59: 311-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So-called “ketone bodies” represent a set of the following three related compounds that are used to mobilize fat stores into the blood of mammals: acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone. This set of compounds represents an alternative metabolic energy source for brain, heart, and kidneys and plays an important role in diabetes and some forms of epilepsy (3Gibson K.M. Breuer J. Nyhan W.L. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Mitchell G.A. Jakobs C. Gibson K.M. Robert M.F. Burlina A. Dionisi-Vici C. Dallaire L. Prenatal Diagn. 1995; 15: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ketone bodies are essential to maintain physiological viability during hypoglycemia because cells die due to energy deprivation when both glucose and ketone body concentrations fall below critical threshold levels. Acetoacetate, the direct product of HL, is reduced to 3-hydroxybutyric acid in an enzyme-catalyzed equilibrium reaction determined by the NAD/NADH ratio in cells. Acetoacetate also spontaneously decarboxylates to generate acetone, completing the repertoire of compounds comprising ketone bodies. Therefore, HL catalyzes what is effectively the terminal step in the generation of ketone bodies, and patients lacking HL activity can therefore experience a lethal metabolic shock in response to hypoglycemia because of the inability to switch to this alternative circulating energy source. Human genetic studies have revealed the existence of at least 22 different disease-causing point mutations in hsHL (5Cardoso M.L. Rodrigues M.R. Leao E. Martins E. Diogo L. Rodrigues E. Garcia P.

Site-directed mutagenesis results indicate that mutations in any one of these residues reduce the Vmax value of the enzyme by 2-5 orders of magnitude (Table 1). A divalent cation in the form of manganese or magnesium is essential for enzyme activity, with the Km values for these cofactors being 0.34 and 233 μm, respectively (6Roberts J.R. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24604-24609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HL can be considered a metalloenzyme based on the requirement for one of these metal cofactors.TABLE 1Effects of mutations on human HMG-CoA lyase activityH. sapiensB. subtilisB. melitensisGluAsnHisAlaAsp-42Asp-16Asp-140.10(0.67)aHuman disease-causing mutations.0.0017 (0.90)5.2E-6(ND)aHuman disease-causing mutations.5.2E-5 (ND)Asp-204Asp-178Asp-1760.050 (3.46)Asp-280Asp-254Ala-2521.00 (0.35)H. sapiensB. subtilisB. melitensisAspAlaGlu-37Glu-11Glu-90.80 (0.75)Glu-72Glu-46Glu-440.0052 (9.94)Glu-279Glu-253Val-2510.85 (0.56)H. sapiensB. subtilisB. melitensisGlnMetArg-41Arg-15Arg-133.7E-65.2E-8 (ND)(1.29)aHuman disease-causing mutations.H. sapiensB. subtilisB. melitensisArgAspAlaHis-233His-207His-2051.6E-4(0.92)aHuman disease-causing mutations.1.0E-4 (1.13)1.6E-4 (1.54)H. sapiensB. subtilisB. melitensisSerAlaCys-323Lys-2972.2 (1.67)Cys-266Cys-240Cys-2380.0016 (0.73)1.0E-4 (1.08)a Human disease-causing mutations.

Burgner II, J.W. Miziorko H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress down-regulates hsHL activity via formation of a stable intersubunit disulfide linkage. Although the mechanistic basis of the resulting reduction in enzyme activity is not understood, the disulfide bond holding this complex together is believed to be a symmetrical linkage between pairs of Cys-323 residues (11Hruz P.W.

Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) suggest that HL has a TIM barrel fold, with the highest scoring homologue being the TIM barrel domain in DmpG or 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase (13Manjasetty B.A. Powlowski J. Vrielink A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6992-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

In this model, the lipophilic moiety of the CoA passes through the core of the TIM barrel (i.e. plugging the core of the central β-barrel with its adenine moiety on one face and the HMG moiety in the active site on the opposite face).

This homology model accounted for some mutagenesis results but did not identify a binding site for the essential divalent cation cofactor. BLAST searches using the sequence of hsHL (Fig. 2) indicate that likely orthologues with high levels of sequence homology (>45% identity) are present in plants and eubacteria but not in yeast or achaeabacteria. The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium targeted this protein family for structure determination based on the absence of reliable homologues of this fold/function family in the PDB. Three likely orthologues were cloned (as reported at www.nesg.org), but only two were produced in soluble form in E. coli, those from Bacillus subtilis (bsHL) and Brucella melitensis (bmHL) (Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium targets SR181 and LR35, respectively). In this study, we report crystal structures for both of these proteins, which respectively are 46 and 51% identical to hsHL (according to DALI alignment), along with induced fit computational modeling studies of the Michaelis complex of hsHL with HMG-CoA. The crystal structure of this protein was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of bmHL and is reported in the accompanying paper (17Fu Z. Runquist J.A. Forouhar F. Hussain M.

Our results demonstrate a previously unknown but striking similarity in active site structure between HL and several other enzymes cleaving carbon-carbon bonds in metabolic reactions, suggesting that these proteins form a new family of TIM barrel enzymes sharing a common catalytic mechanism. Protein Expression—The bsHL and bmHL enzymes were produced using identical methods following PCR cloning of the corresponding genes (called yngG) from genomic DNA. The full-length coding sequences were cloned into a pET21d (Novagen) derivative for protein expression using a T7 promoter/polymerase system. The resulting recombinant proteins contain eight non-native residues at the C terminus (LEHHHHHH). The constructs were verified by standard DNA sequence analysis and expressed in E. coli BL21λ(DE3) cells containing the rare tRNA expression plasmid pMGK. After colony purification, expression strains were cultured in MJ9 minimal media (18Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) supplemented with selenomethionine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine for the production of selenomethioninelabeled proteins (19Doublie S. Kapp U. Aberg A. Brown K. Strub K. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Initial cell growth was carried out at 37 °C, but the temperature was reduced to 17 °C after induction with 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the absorbance of the cultures at 600 nm reached 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after overnight incubation, and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Protein Purification—After cell lysis by sonication, extracts were clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Following elution with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, fractions containing HL were pooled and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Finally, the protein-containing fractions from the second column were concentrated for crystallization (to final concentrations indicated below). Protein purity and molecular mass were verified by SDS-PAGE and matrixassisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. Process yields were ∼10 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. In an effort to control the aggregation tendencies of the purified proteins, 100 mm NaCl was added to the gel filtration buffer and therefore crystallization stock in some preparations, but this addition had little influence on either aggregation or crystallization properties for either enzyme. Static Light Scattering Measurements—Samples of the crystallization stocks were injected onto a Shodex 802.5 silica-based gel filtration column (Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated at 4 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 0.025% (w/v) NaN3, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The effluent passed through a UV light detector (also at 4 °C), a 15-channel Dawn static light-scattering detector (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) at room temperature, and an Optilab refractive index detector (Wyatt Technologies) with its sample chamber heated to 40 °C. Debye analyses of molecular mass were conducted after scaling the light-scattering data collected at 11 different angles according to the protein concentration as deduced from the refractive index signal. Protein Crystallization—Both bacterial HL proteins were crystallized at 20 °C using 1:1 hanging-drop vapor diffusion reactions. For bsHL, the reservoir contained 22.5% (w/v) PEG 3350, 210 mm sodium iodide, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The bsHL crystals grew to full size in 2 days and were transferred to the mother liquor plus 25% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection and then flash-frozen in liquid propane. Although crystals were consistently obtained from nine different bsHL protein preparations with stock concentrations ranging from 2 to 16 mg/ml, only two crystals were obtained that were large enough for diffraction data to be collected at sufficient resolution for structure determination. One of these decayed during data collection, while the other, which yielded the structure reported in this paper, had a satellite crystal and visible ice rings. The bsHL crystals contain two dimers forming a pseudotetramer per asymmetric unit. The bmHL protein was crystallized using a reservoir containing 19% (w/v) PEG 3350, 200 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals grew to full size in 6 days and were cryoprotected by transfer to paratone and then flash-frozen in liquid propane. Crystals were obtained from three different bmHL protein preparations with stock concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg/ml. Although many crystals were screened for their diffraction properties, all but one of them had severe morphological twinning problems that prevented collection of high quality diffraction data. The bmHL crystals contain four protomers per asymmetric unit. For both bacterial HL crystallizations, the well solution used in vapor diffusion reactions was developed starting from a condition in the unbuffered PEG-Ion Screen from Hampton Research (Laguna Hills, CA), so the pH of the crystallization reactions was controlled by the buffers in the protein crystallization stocks. In both cases, extensive efforts were made to improve the quality of the crystals, including broad additive screens sampling all commonly used monovalent and divalent ions. Over the course of 6 months, it was not possible to find any conditions yielding better crystals or any crystals growing in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. Entire crystallization screens were conducted for both proteins in the presence of Mg2+ plus either HMG-CoA or a substrate analogue, but no viable lead conditions were identified. Mg2+ was observed to reduce significantly the solubility of both bacterial HL proteins, a factor that substantially increases the difficulty of obtaining crystals. Structure Solution and Refinement—For both proteins, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data sets were collected with crystals maintained at 100 K on beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data collected at the peak absorption wavelength of selenium were integrated and scaled (Table 2) using the HKL package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). For the bsHL crystals, the program SnB (21Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) located 21 of 28 selenium sites in the asymmetric unit. These sites were used to initiate iterative phasing and automated model building in SOLVE/RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), which produced a trace for 50% of the residues in the final model with side chains for 30%. Most of the residues in the β-sheet and some in the α-helices were inaccurately modeled by this procedure, but completion of the structure was straightforward using iterative cycles of model building in XtalView (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and computational refinement in CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16965) Google Scholar). For bmHL, 24 of 28 possible selenium sites were found by SnB, and 70% of the final model was built by SOLVE/RESOLVE, including side chains for 45%. Strong 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained using default parameters throughout the models for both crystal structures.TABLE 2Summary of crystallographic data for bacterial HMG-CoA lyasesB. subtilis (bsHL)B. melitensis (bmHL)Space groupP21P21Cell parameters (Å)82.3, 86.4, 87.6 (118.6°)62.7, 104.7, 97.4 (107.4°)Resolution (Å)29.9-2.728.9-2.3No. reflections61,06797,811Mean redundancy4.34.0<I/σI>15.1 (3.7)13.9 (5.6)Rsym (%)aRmerge=∑h∑i|Ihi-〈Ih〉|/∑h∑iIhi.8.2 (37.7)10.0 (24.5)Completeness (%)95.7 (95.8)99.6 (99.3)Rwork (%)bR=∑h|Fho-Fhc|/∑hFho.26.3 (33.2)27.1 (29.6)Rfree (%)bR=∑h|Fho-Fhc|/∑hFho.30.3 (39.5)30.4 (34.6)r.m.s.d. in bond lengths (Å)0.0090.007r.m.s.d. in bond angles (°)1.11.1Model contentsProtein residues4 × 1-2984 × 2-284Heteroatoms403 H2O + 4I−596 H2O + 4 Ca2+Ramachandaran distributionCore83.688.8Additionally allowed15.610.6Generously allowed0.40.5Disallowed0.40.0Mean atomic B-factorsMain chain46.529.8Side chains63.230.8Ions63.327.6Water molecules37.327.1PDB code1YDO1YDNa Rmerge=∑h∑i|Ihi-〈Ih〉|/∑h∑iIhi.b R=∑h|Fho-Fhc|/∑hFho. Open table in a new tab Computational Docking of HMG-CoA—Candidate models for the stereochemistry of the Michaelis complex were produced using `induced fit docking' (25Sherman W. Day T. Jacobson M.P. Friesner R.A. Farid R. J. Med. Chem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar), an automated ligand docking method that accounts for both ligand and protein flexibility. These models were subsequently screened for consistency with published mutagenesis results and qualitative chemical features prioritized through consideration of the structure and chemical reactivity of a series of homologous enzymes (as explained in detail under `Results'). Induced fit docking calculations were performed with the program GLIDE 3.5 (Schrödinger, Inc., Portland, OR) (26Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P.

Frye L.L. Pollard W.T. Banks J.L. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar) using the following parameters aimed at softening the potential: 0.5 van der Waals scaling for both ligand and protein atoms, Coulomb-van der Waals energy cutoff of 100 kcal/mol, and hydrogen bond energy cutoff of -0.05 kcal/mol. The calculations sampled ∼13,000 conformations and orientations for the HMG-CoA substrate. All atoms of the substrate were constrained to remain in a 32 Å box that completely encompassed the active site, whereas the geometric center of the substrate was constrained to remain in a concentric 12 Å box (centered at orthogonal coordinates of 25.7, 40.6, and 75.9 Å in hsHL). Initially, the substrate was docked into a rigid protein model using either the Ca2+-bound structure of bmHL or the Mg2+-bound structure of hsHL (reported in the accompanying paper; see Ref. 17Fu Z. Runquist J.A. Forouhar F. Hussain M. Hunt J.F. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (February 24): 7526-7532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Next, induced fit conformational changes in the receptor were modeled in each of the top 30 ligand-protein complexes ranked according to GLIDE score. PRIME 1.2 (Schrödinger, Inc.) (28Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 29Standley D.M. Eyrich V.A. An Y. Pincus D.L. Gunn J.R. Friesner R.A. Proteins. 2001; 45: 133-139Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used for side chain rotamer prediction and energy minimization of the conformation of residues located within5Åof the substrate in any of poses (26Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6281) Google Scholar). The Ca2+- and the Mg2+-ligating side chains were held fixed during this step. Finally, GLIDE (with default settings) was used to re-dock the substrate into the low energy structures produced by PRIME lying within 60 kcal/mol of the minimum obtained. The resulting models were ranked by a composite score that combines the GLIDE score and 5% of the PRIME energy, and the top 10 of these were evaluated for consistency with the enzymological criteria explained in detail below. Hydrodynamic Properties of Bacterial HL Orthologues—Gel filtration/static light-scattering studies of bsHL (Fig. 3A) indicate that the protein is present in the crystallization stock primarily as a dimer. However, there is also a significant population of tetramers (∼10%) that remain stably associated during gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the distribution of hydrodynamic species formed by bsHL is similar to that previously reported for hsHL. Equivalent studies on bmHL show a mixture of monomers and high order protein aggregates (Fig. 3B). Although only a very small population of large aggregates was detected in hydrodynamic studies of bsHL, both proteins had a tendency to spontaneously form amorphous precipitates in their crystallization stocks, a tendency that was significantly exacerbated by freeze/thaw or by the addition of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and/or substrate analogue (30Hruz P.W. Anderson V.E. Miziorko H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In both cases, crystallization properties deteriorated following the appearance of amorphous precipitate in the protein stock solutions. Crystal Structures of Bacterial HL Orthologues—The bsHL crystal structure was refined to a free R-factor of 30.3% at 2.7 Å, whereas that of bmHL was refined to a free R-factor of 30.4% at 2.3 Å (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Both structures were solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing of selenomethionine-labeled protein crystals. The free R-factor of the latter structure is slightly high, which is probably attributable to modest problems in the diffraction data caused by the presence of a satellite crystal (see “Materials and Methods”). However, the bmHL coordinates were used successfully to solve the crystal structure of hsHL (17Fu Z. Runquist J.A. Forouhar F. Hussain M. Hunt J.F. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (February 24): 7526-7532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by molecular replacement, and the refined structure of hsHL at 2.1 Å resolution (with a free R-factor of 26.5%) agrees in almost all stereochemical details with those of the bacterial homologues except for small conformational differences in the flexible G-loop (see discussion of Fig. 6B, below) and a significant backbone dihedral angle change at just one position elsewhere in the protein (data not shown).FIGURE 6Backbone B-factors and active site loop conformations in HL structures.

Enzyme deficiency may be due to a variety of human mutations and can be fatal. Diminished activity has been explained based on analyses of recombinant human mutant proteins or, more recently, in the context of structural models for the enzyme. We report the experimental determination of a crystal structure at 2.1 Å resolution of the recombinant human mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase containing a bound activator cation and the dicarboxylic acid 3-hydroxyglutarate. The enzyme adopts a (βα)8 barrel fold, and the N-terminal barrel end is occluded. The structure of a physiologically relevant dimer suggests that substrate access to the active site involves binding across the cavity located at the C-terminal end of the barrel. An alternative hypothesis that involves substrate insertion through a pore proposed to extend through the barrel is not compatible with the observed structure. The activator cation ligands included Asn275, Asp42,His233, and His235; the latter three residues had been implicated previously as contributing to metal binding or enzyme activity. Arg41, previously shown to have a major effect on catalytic efficiency, is also located at the active site. In the observed structure, this residue interacts with a carboxyl group of 3-hydroxyglutarate, the hydrolysis product of the competitive inhibitor 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA required for crystallization of human enzyme. The structure provides a rationale for the decrease in enzyme activity due to clinical mutations, including H233R, R41Q, D42H, and D204N, that compromise active site function or enzyme stability. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase is a key enzyme in the ketogenic pathway that supplies metabolic fuel to extrahepatic tissues.

Rev. 1980; 60: 143-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), which maintains the energy requirements of nonhepatic tissues especially during fasting or starvation. The reaction is also an important step in leucine catabolism (3Coon M.J. Robinson W.G. Bachhawat B.K. McElroy W.D. Glass B. Amino Acid Metabolism. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD1955: 431-441Google Scholar). Homologous C-C bond cleavage or condensation reactions are catalyzed by various members of the HMG-CoA lyase family of enzymes, which includes homocitrate synthase, isopropylmalate synthase, and 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase (4Higgins M.J.P. Kornblatt J.A. Rudney H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, New York1972: 407-434Google Scholar). The importance of the ketogenic cycle is underscored in hereditary HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, which can result in hypoketotic hypoglycemia and a marked increase in serum levels of several organic acids. Uncontrolled HMG-CoA lyase deficiency is lethal in about 20% of cases and can result in mental retardation, episodes of seizure, and coma (5Gibson K.M. Breuer J. Nyhan W.L. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several mutations in the HMG-CoA lyase gene correlating with deficiency have been identified (5Gibson K.M. Breuer J. Nyhan W.L. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), including the following missense mutations: H233R (6Roberts J.R. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol.

These mutations have been studied by using our recombinant human lyase protein expression system, providing a more detailed biochemical explanation for the significant consequences of such mutations. The cleavage of HMG-CoA requires the presence of a divalent cation such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, and the reaction has been postulated to involve general acid/base catalysis (see next page Scheme 1). A number of active site residues, including divalent cation ligands, have been proposed on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis and characterization of mutants by kinetic and electron spin resonance studies.

For D42A, Vmax is diminished by 1.3 × 105-fold compared with wild type enzyme. Estimated Vmax values for H233A and C266A indicate reductions of 6.4 × 103- and 1.3 × 104-fold, respectively. An additional important catalytic residue is Arg41. R41Q is reduced in Vmax by 2.7 × 105-fold relative to the wild type enzyme; the enzyme activity for R41M is so low that it could not be determined accurately by a sensitive radioactive assay. A role for Arg41 in stabilization or protonation of the enolate form of the acetyl-CoA has been suggested (12Tuinstra R.L. Wang C.Z. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5287-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in all HMG-CoA lyase sequences reported. Molecular sieve chromatography results and sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that the native enzyme is a dimer in solution (13Tuinstra R.L. Burgner J.W. Miziorko H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A reactive Cys323 has been implicated in regulation of activity that involves the formation of an intersubunit disulfide crosslink (14Hruz P.W. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, a three-dimensional model proposing a substrate binding cavity for human HMG-CoA lyase has been reported (15Casals N. Gomez-Puertas P. Pie J. Mir C. Roca R. Puisac B. Aledo R. Clotet J. Menao S. Serra D. Asins G. Till J. Elias-Jones A.C. Cresto J.C. Chamoles N.A. Abdenur J.E. Mayatepek E. Besley G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29016-29023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This model is interpreted to suggest that HMG-CoA binds through a central pore of the (βα)8 barrel of the enzyme. However, most (βα)8 barrel enzymes do not have a pore running through the middle of the barrel; instead at least one end of the barrel is blocked. The crystal structure of the bifunctional Pseudomonas enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase/acylating acetaldehyde dehydratase was recently published. The structure reveals a bound metal ion and an oxalate molecule (16Manjasetty B.A. Powlowski J. Vrielink A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6992-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities to HMG-CoA lyase prompted use of this information to produce a homology model for HMG-CoA lyase (12Tuinstra R.L. Wang C.Z. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5287-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, a detailed understanding of human clinical mutations and hypotheses concerning enzyme regulation and catalytic activity require experimental determination of a human HMG-CoA lyase structure. We now describe the complete three-dimensional structure of human HMG-CoA lyase determined at 2.1 Å resolution.

Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of the mature human enzyme is threonine 28 (Fig. 1). The recombinant protein retains a Met-Gly sequence, remaining from the transit peptide, encoding an NcoI cleavage site used for cloning the construct into a pTrc99A vector. However, Edman degradation of isolated recombinant human enzyme indicated that the N-terminal methionine has been cleaved from ∼80% of the protein. Therefore, Gly-Thr would be the expected N terminus in the lyase enzyme x-ray structure. The molecular mass for the mature 298-amino acid peptide deduced from the cDNA is 32 kDa (18Mitchell G.A. Robert M.F. Hruz P.W. Wang S. Fontaine G. Behnke C.E. Mende-Mueller L.M. Schappert K. Lee C. Gibson K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4376-4381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human HMG-CoA lyase was expressed and purified as described previously by Roberts et al. (17Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme was purified from the crude Escherichia coli extract using three chromatographic steps as follows: a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column, a phenyl-agarose column, and a Superose 12 column. An ammonium sulfate precipitation step occurs between the first and second columns. Enzyme purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a standard. A subunit molecular mass of 32 kDa, the apparent subunit molecular weight determined on the basis of mobility upon SDS-PAGE and in agreement with the calculated mass deduced from the cDNA sequence, was used to calculate the molar concentration of the enzyme. HMG-CoA lyase enzymatic activity was determined by a citrate synthase-coupled assay (1Stegink L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5272-5279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Kramer and Miziorko (21Kramer P.R. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was concentrated to 8-10 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C (in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) until used for crystallization. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—For crystallization experiments, the enzyme was diluted to the desired concentration, usually 5-6 mg/ml, using filtered water and filtered glycerol. The competitive inhibitor hydroxyglutaryl-CoA (HG-CoA) was added to the diluted protein at an ∼1 mm concentration. The inhibitor was necessary for generation of uniform diffraction quality crystals. Inhibitor studies suggest that HG-CoA is not an efficient substrate for HMG-CoA lyase (22Kramer P.R. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Crystals sufficient for x-ray studies were obtained using an equilibration buffer of 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 mm MgCl2, and 15% polyethylene glycol 8K. The enzyme was mixed 1:1 with the equilibration buffer using sitting drop trays at 19 °C. Crystals in the shape of a distorted cube with approximate dimensions of 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm formed overnight and continued to grow in size for an additional day. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single human lyase crystal to 2.1 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at the Advance Photon Source, BioCARS beamline 14BM-C, at the Argonne National Laboratory. After soaking for about 2 min in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% glycerol in mother liquor, the crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystal-to-detector distance was 200 mm, and for each 0.5° oscillation, a 5-s exposure time was utilized. Diffraction data processing was carried out using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell parameters a = 197.0 Å, b = 117.1 Å, c = 86.8 Å, and β = 112.5°. Six monomers were found in the asymmetric unit, with a corresponding Mathews coefficient of Vm = 2.2 Å3/Da (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar), corresponding to a solvent content of 42%.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), with the monomer structure of Brucella melitensis lyase (Protein Data Bank code 1YDN) as the search model. An initial solution locating all six monomers yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.40 and an R-factor of 0.49 in the resolution range 20.0-4.0 Å. At this point, the bacterial enzyme amino acid residues were replaced with those corresponding to the human enzyme. The structure was further refined using the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) with manual adjustments between refinement cycles. In general, each cycle of refinement consisted of rigid body refinement, positional refinement, simulated annealing, and temperature factor refinement. After each cycle of CNS refinement, both 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc difference Fourier maps were calculated and used for manual fitting and rebuilding of the model using the program TURBO-FRODO (27Roussel A. Inisan A.G. Knoop-Mouthuy A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo, Version OpenGL:1. CNRS/Universitite, Marseille, France1999Google Scholar). At later stages of refinement, water molecules were added at electron densities greater than 3 σ in the Fo-Fc map that were within at least 3.3 Å of a potential hydrogen-bonding partner. The final model gave a crystallographic R-factor of 0.226 and R-free of 0.265. The refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Overview of the Structure—Six monomers, designated as A-F, are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. These six monomers form three dimers (A and B; C and D; and E and F) and can be superimposed onto one another with an r.m.s. deviation of less than 0.5 Å for all main chain atoms. The overall G-factor calculated by Procheck (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar), as a measure of stereochemical quality of the model, was 0.11. At the N terminus of the polypeptide, the first residue Gly27, a remainder from the transit peptide, was not observed in any of the six monomers. However, Thr28, the N terminus of the mature eukaryotic enzyme, was observed in all six monomers of the asymmetric unit. Residues Lys137-Glu144 and Gly265-Gly271 and in monomer D as well as Ile139-Asn140 and Cys266-Gly271 in monomer F are disordered. The last two C-terminal residues Lys324 and Leu325 are disordered and not visible in all polypeptide chains. The Ramachandran plot reveals that more than 88.9% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues in all six monomers fall within the most favored region, and none were in a disallowed region. Monomer Structure—The monomer of human lyase includes 9 β-strands and 12 α-helices (Fig. 1), with the overall polypeptide fold similar to that of the Brucella lyase (42Forouhar F. Hussain M. Farid R. Benach J. Abashidze M. Edstrom W.C. Vorobiev S.M. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Fu Z. Kim J.-J.P. Miziorko H.M. Montelione G.T. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (February 24): 7533-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (r.m.s. deviation, 1.0 Å for 292 C-α atoms). The human monomer structure consists of a (βα)8 TIM barrel motif and an additional polypeptide region made of residues 290-323, which includes β9, α11, and α12 (Fig. 2). The internal cavity, seen from the C-terminal side of the barrel, was constructed by residues from the 8 β-strands (β1-β8) on the inner side of the TIM barrel and was enhanced in size by residues from α1, α5, and the three loops (between β2-α3, β5-α7, and β6-α8). These latter structural elements were around the C-terminal end of the barrel and make the internal cavity deeper and wider at its entrance. The internal cavity is funnel-shaped with approximate dimensions of 10 Å in depth and 9 Å in diameter at its entrance. This cavity is larger than the internal cavities found in many TIM barrel enzymes whose substrates are smaller molecules than a CoA derivative (e.g. triose-phosphate isomerase (29Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar)) but similar to those of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (30Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and malate synthase (31Anstrom D.M. Kallio K. Remington S.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), both of which utilize a CoA derivative as substrate. Dimer Structure—For the six monomers in the asymmetric unit there are two different contact areas. Arranged as three dimers, the buried surface area calculated by CNS showed about 2400 Å2 buried between two monomers, corresponding to 10% of the total surface area. Alternatively, two of the dimers can be arranged as a square-shaped tetramer using symmetry operations. For this second contact area, the buried surface area calculated between two monomers was 1022 Å2, less than 5% of the total surface area. These results indicated that the dimer formed by the first contact area corresponds to the physiological form of HMG-CoA lyase, which solution studies suggest exists as a dimer (13Tuinstra R.L. Burgner J.W. Miziorko H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two different views of the physiological dimer are shown in Fig. 2C with the molecular dyad shown in the left panel. The two monomers ((βα)8 barrels) in the dimer are arranged such that the axes of the two barrels are perpendicular to each other (Fig. 2C, right panel), as seen in the dimeric structures of triose-phosphate isomerase (29Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and flavocytochrome b (32Xia Z.X. Shamala N. Bethge P.H. Lim L.W. Bellamy H.D. Xuong N.H. Lederer F. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2629-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The dimer contacts are made largely by residues in β9, α11, and α12 that are not part of the barrel (colored yellow in Fig. 2, A and B, and magenta and blue in Fig. 2C). In the lyase structure, each monomer forms its own barrel. In contrast, in the structure of TIM, a loop of one monomer crosses over to the other monomer forming part of the entrance to the other barrel. Pseudomonas mevalonii HMG-CoA lyase, which has 52% sequence identity with human lyase, is inactivated by the affinity label 2-butynoyl-CoA (33Hruz P.W. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is protected by the competitive inhibitor hydroxyglutaryl-CoA. These observations have been interpreted to indicate that Cys266, the target of the reagent, maps in the active site. Additional mutagenesis studies on Cys266 (11Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17311-17316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicate that this residue influences catalytic efficiency (Vmax of C266A is 10-4 of wild type) and are consistent with an active site assignment. In the human lyase structure, Cys266 is situated in a loop between β8 and α10 located at the C-terminal side of the TIM barrel and forms a part of the barrel entrance. Residues in the N-terminal half of this loop (residues 259-278) containing Cys266 have the motif G(L/A)GGCP(Y/F), which is found in 47 known or putative HMG-CoA lyase proteins (data not shown). Because this loop is disordered in two of the six monomers in the asymmetric unit, it is most likely a flexible loop in solution. Perhaps, loop movement could occur upon substrate binding and could position Cys266 to influence the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Cys323, located at the C terminus, has been suggested to play a role in mammalian HMG-CoA lyase regulation involving a thiol/disulfide exchange mechanism, based on studies of avian and human lyase using the bifunctional cross-linking reagents dibromopropanone and o-phenylenedimaleimide (13Tuinstra R.L. Burgner J.W. Miziorko H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Hruz P.W. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The regulatory sulfhydryls are proposed to form a disulfide bond that cross-links adjacent subunits and diminishes activity. Elimination of the Cys323 sulfhydryl by mutagenesis blocks covalent dimer formation, supporting the involvement of this residue. Additional support derives from the observation that the P. mevalonii enzyme lacks a corresponding cysteine and is not sensitive to oxidation and covalent dimer formation. However, in the x-ray structure of the human lyase dimer, the distance between two Cys323 residues on adjacent monomers of the dimer is 29 Å, too large to form a disulfide linkage between them. The inter-subunit distance between Cys266 and Cys323 of the adjacent subunit is 14 Å, which also appears to be too distant to support disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, the flexibility of the Cys266 loop as observed in the crystal structure and the possible movement of the C-terminal tail may allow closer juxtaposition of either of these two cysteines in solution. Further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities. Metal-binding Site—Electron density indicated a bound metal ion, most likely a Mg2+ ion (Fig. 3A), as the crystallization medium included 60 mm MgCl2. The metal-binding site is found in the internal bottom of the (βα)8 TIM barrel. Enzyme activity is absolutely dependent upon the presence of metals such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ (21Kramer P.R. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metal ligand-binding site displays octahedral coordination utilizing four conserved amino acid side chains and two water molecules (Fig. 3A), although not all six monomers in the asymmetric unit have both water molecules. The side chain ligands are the imidazole nitrogens of His233 and His235, the carboxylate of Asp42, and the side chain amide oxygen of Asn275, with distances of about 2.2 Å for all coordinating atoms. In the crystal structure of 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase, a member of the HMG-CoA lyase family and a class II metal manganese requiring aldolase, the ligands to bound include His200, His202, Asp18, and a water molecule, liganding similar to that now found in human HMG-CoA lyase (16Manjasetty B.A. Powlowski J. Vrielink A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6992-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of isopropylmalate synthase, another member of the HMG-CoA lyase family exhibiting a TIM barrel structure, also reveals two histidines and an aspartic acid as metal-binding ligands (34Koon N. Squire C.J. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Metal-binding solution studies utilizing the lyase mutants H235A and D42N concluded that His235 and Asp42 are likely metal-binding residues (9Roberts J.R. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7594-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Tuinstra R.L. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37092-37098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), consistent with the observed structure. Additionally, amino acids His233 and Asp42 have been identified in clinical mutations (6Roberts J.R. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24604-24609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Mitchell G.A. Ozand P.T. Robert M.F. Ashmarina L. Roberts J. Gibson K.M. Wanders R.J. Wang S. Chevalier I. Plochl E. Miziorko H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In mutagenesis studies, H233A and D42A exhibit catalytic rates diminished by 6.4 × 103 - and 1.3 × 105-fold, respectively, and thus, these metal liganding residues are clearly important for enzyme activity. Substrate-binding Site—The active site is accessible only from the C-terminal side of the TIM barrel. The solvent-accessible surface of human HMG-CoA lyase shows that the N-terminal face is occluded (Fig. 3B, left), although the C-terminal face is accessible to the active site cavity (Fig. 3B, right). Residues found at the bottom of the barrel, closing off the N-terminal side of the barrel, include Val36, Val38,Glu72, Leu106, Val125, Arg165, Tyr167, Ser201, and Asp257. The substrate-binding cavity does not extend through the monomer as proposed previously by modeling studies (15Casals N. Gomez-Puertas P. Pie J. Mir C. Roca R. Puisac B. Aledo R. Clotet J. Menao S. Serra D. Asins G. Till J. Elias-Jones A.C. Cresto J.C. Chamoles N.A. Abdenur J.E. Mayatepek E. Besley G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29016-29023Abs"
https://openalex.org/W2047746227,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play key roles in the intracellular signaling pathways of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines, which exhibit a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Dysregulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, for example autoimmune diseases and tumors. Type I interferon (IFN) induces the expression of proapoptotic genes and has been used in the clinical treatment of several tumors. In the present study, we found that type I IFN suppressed IL-6/STAT3-mediated transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, a type I IFN-induced protein, Daxx, also suppressed STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation, while overexpression of Daxx inhibited IL-6/STAT3-mediated gene expression. Importantly, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Daxx expression enhanced IL-6/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical interaction between Daxx and STAT3 in transiently transfected 293T cells. We further found that Daxx and STAT3 were co-localized in the nucleus. These results indicate that Daxx may serve as a transcriptional regulator of type I IFN-mediated suppression of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway."

Amyloidosis generating the insoluble fibrillar protein deposition has been considered to be responsible for the cell death observed in the neurodegenerative disorder. In order to develop a controlling strategy toward the amyloid formation, 1,1′-(1,10-decanediyl)-bis-[4-a-mino-2-methylquinolinium] (dequalinium), was selected and examined in terms of its specific molecular interaction with α-synuclein. The protein was self-oligomerized by dequalinium, which gave rise to the ladder formation on N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine/SDS-PAGE in the presence of a coupling reagent of N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The double-headed structure of dequalinium with the two cationic 4-aminoquinaldinium rings was demonstrated to be critical for the protein self-oligomerization. The dequalinium-binding site was located on the acidic C-terminal region of the protein with an approximate dissociation constant of 5.5 μm. The protein self-oligomerization induced by the compound has resulted in the protofibril formation of α-synuclein before it has developed into amyloids. The protofibrils were demonstrated to affect the membrane intactness of liposomes, and they have also been shown to influence cell viability of human neuroblastoma cells. In addition, dequalinium treatment of the α-synuclein-overexpressing cells exerted a significant cell death. Therefore, it is pertinent to consider that dequalinium could be used as a molecular probe to assess toxic mechanisms related to the amyloid formation of α-synuclein.

Two of those resulted in substitutions of alanine at either residue 30 or residue 53 with proline and threonine (A30P and A53T), respectively (6Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E.

The third mutation showed a drastic substitution from acidic glutamate at residue 46 to basic lysine residue (E46K) (8Zarranz J.J. Alegre J. Gomez-Esteban J.C. Lezcano E. Ros R. Ampuero I. Vidal L. Hoenicka J. Rodriguez O. Atares B. Llorens V. Tortosa E.G. Ser T. Munoz D.G. Yebenes J.G. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 55: 164-173Crossref Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). In addition, triplication of the α-synuclein gene was observed in an American family of mixed northern European origin with autosomal dominant young onset PD (9Singleton A.B. Farrer M. Johnson J. Singleton A. Hague S. Kachergus J. Hulihan M. Peuralinna T. Dutra A. Nussbaum R. Lincoln S. Crawley A. Hanson M. Maraganore D. Adler C. Cookson M.R. Muenter M. Baptista M. Miller D. Blancato J. Hardy J. Gwinn-Hardy K. Science. 2003; 302: 841Crossref PubMed Scopus (3541) Google Scholar). Experimentally, overexpression of α-synuclein in mice and flies caused behavioral deficits reminiscent of human PD with selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (10Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 11Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). These facts clearly indicate that α-synuclein is a pathological component of PD. The protein is also related to other neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known α-synucleinopathies including Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy (12Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Dickson D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2001; 14: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein has been known to be a “natively unfolded” protein (14Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 15Kim J. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). When incubated in vitro, however, the protein tends to aggregate and form the fibrils known as amyloids in which the unstructured protein has aligned to form cross-β-sheet conformation (16Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 17Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E.

The underlying mechanism for the amyloid formation remains to be clarified. Amyloid formation of the mutant form of A53T was facilitated as compared with the wild-type α-synuclein, whereas the other A30P was not as effective (19Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 20Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

It has been debated whether the amyloids are responsible for the cell death observed in the degenerative diseases. It was suggested that oligomeric intermediates obtained prior to the amyloid formation would be a culprit for the toxicity by possibly forming the amyloid pores on membranes (22Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.-C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, various forms of protein aggregates from granular to filamentous structures were hypothesized to exert different potentials for the cell death, depending on their morphologies (25Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Lee D. Lee E.-K. Lee J.-H. Chang C.-S. Paik S.R. Eur. J.

Brain Res. 2001; 908: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein could be divided into three regions in its primary structure (28Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 29Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region (residues 1-60) has been demonstrated to form amphipathic α-helices upon membrane interaction (30Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein could be involved in synaptic plasticity by participating in membrane dynamics (31Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Since all of the amino acid substitutions observed in the mutant forms are exclusively localized on this region, deficits in its membrane interaction could have pathological implications, if any (32Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic middle segment (residues 61-95) is also known as the non-Aβ component of AD amyloid, since the peptide fragment has been found in the senile plaques of AD as the second major constituent next to the primary amyloid β/A4 protein (Aβ) (33Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The protein ends with the acidic C terminus (residues 96-140), which is most variable among synuclein isoforms including β- and γ-synucleins (5Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This protein has been demonstrated to experience multiple ligand interactions. This property could be due to its “natively unfolded” structure, which is prone to be stabilized upon various ligand interactions (34Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). In particular, we have been interested in screening for α-synuclein interactive small chemicals that could be used to control the amyloidosis eventually. Recently, phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate, previously proposed as an antiscrapie agent (35Priola S.A. Raines A. Caughey W.S. Science. 2000; 287: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), was shown to interact with α-synuclein via selective binding to the acidic C terminus, and it prevented the cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells caused by the overexpression of α-synuclein in the presence of a proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin (36Lee E.-N. Cho H.-J. Lee C.-H. Lee D. Chung K.C. Paik S.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3704-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The copper complex of phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate-Cu2+, on the other hand, influenced the protein to be self-oligomerized by interacting with the N-terminal region and stimulated the amyloid formation (36Lee E.-N. Cho H.-J. Lee C.-H. Lee D. Chung K.C. Paik S.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3704-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Coomassie Brilliant Blue-G and -R augmented the protein aggregation of α-synuclein and gave rise to two different shapes of the aggregates, such as worm-like and filamentous structures, respectively (26Lee D. Lee E.-K. Lee J.-H. Chang C.-S. Paik S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Their interactions were independent of the acidic C terminus. Eosin was another specific dye for the α-synuclein interaction, which led to the facilitated protein self-oligomerization and fibrillization (37Shin H.-J. Lee E.-K Lee J.-H. Lee D. Chang C.-S. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pesticides such as rotenone, paraquat, and dieldrin also enhanced the fibrillization of α-synuclein (38Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 39Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Di Monte D.A. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Other chemicals including trim-ethylamine N-oxide and diethyl dithiocarbamate also induced the protein to be self-interactive (41Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 1,1′-(1,10-Decanediyl)bis-[4-amino-2-methylquinolinium] (dequalinium (C10-DQ)) is an amphipathic cation that contains two cationic aminoquinaldinium rings separated by a 10-carbon methylene bridge (Fig. 1) (42Qin D. Sullivan R. Berkowitz W.F. Bittman R. Rotenberg S.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dequalinium previously used as a topical antimicrobial agent exhibited anti-tumor activity by selectively accumulating in mitochondria (43Weiss M.J. Wong J.R. Ha C.S. Bleday R. Salem R.R. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5444-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The compound has been demonstrated to interact with several enzymes such as mitochondrial F1-ATPase, protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase, and calcium-activated K+ channel (44Zhuo S.

In this report, dequalinium interaction of α-synuclein has been investigated in terms of its effects on induction of protein self-oligomerization and the stabilization of the protofibrils. Molecular details of the interaction, therefore, could provide a means to assess toxic mechanisms related to the amyloid formation of α-synuclein. Materials—Dequalinium (C10-DQ), dequalinium analogue with C14-linker (C14-DQ), quinaldine, quinaldinium iodide, and decamethonium bromide were purchased from Sigma. Other dequalinium analogues with varying length of the hydrocarbon chain, such as tetramethylene bis-(4-aminoquinaldinium iodide) (C4-DQ), hexamethylene bis-(4-aminoquinaldinium iodide) (C6-DQ), and octamethylene bis-(4-aminoquinaldinium iodide) (C8-DQ), were synthesized. Commercially available diols were converted to diiodides such as 1,4-diiodobutane, 1,6-diiodohexane, and 1,8-diiodooctane. They were alkylated with a 2-3-fold excess of 4-aminoquinaldine in 4-methyl-2-pentanol. After refluxing for 156 h at 170 °C, the precipitates were washed three times with acetone. The precipitates were then dissolved in methanol and treated with charcoal. The products were recrystallized in ethanol and subjected to 1H NMR. C4-DQ: 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ 8.46 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), δ 8.27 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1H), δ 8.05 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), δ 7.75 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), δ 6.75 (s, 1H), δ 4.53 (brt, 2H), δ 2.79 (s, 3H), δ 1.98 (m, 2H). C6-DQ: 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ 8.44 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), δ 8.17 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1H), δ 8.01 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 1H), δ 7.73 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 1H), δ 6.73 (s, 1H), δ 4.48 (brt, 2H), δ 2.74 (s, 3H), δ 1.76 (m, 2H), δ 1.55 (m, 2H). C8-DQ: 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ 8.44 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), δ 8.15 (d, J = 9.3 Hz, 1H), δ 8.02 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), δ 7.73 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), δ 6.73 (s, 1H), δ 4.45 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), δ 2.50 (s, 3H), δ 1.74 (m, 2H), δ 1.46 (m, 2H), δ 1.36 (m, 2H). Recombinant α- and β-synucleins were prepared according to the procedures previously described (49Paik S.R. Lee J.-H. Kim D.-H. Chang C.-S. Kim J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 50Lee D. Lee S.-Y. Lee E.-N. Chang C.-S. Paik S.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Clones of the two mutant forms of α-synuclein (A53T and A30P) were generous gifts from Dr. J. Kim (Yonsei University, Korea). The C-terminally truncated α-syn97 was obtained via an endoproteinase Asp-N treatment of α-synuclein based on the previously described procedure (51Paik S.R. Shin H.-J. Lee J.-H. Chang C.-S. Kim J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The N-terminally truncated α-syn61-140 was prepared from a clone of glutathione S-transferase fusion construct as described elsewhere (52Paik S.R. Lee D. Cho H.-J. Lee E.-N. Chang C.-S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A protein assay kit employing bicinchoninic acid (BCA) was obtained from Pierce. The coupling reagent N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin were from Sigma. S-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Precast gels for 10-20% Tricine/SDS-PAGE were provided from Novex. The carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh) and uranyl acetate were from Ted Pella Inc. and Electron Microscopy Sciences, respectively. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum and Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent were provided by Hyclone and Invitrogen, respectively. Antibodies, such as monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, were from Transduction Laboratories. ECL Western blotting detection reagent was from Amersham Biosciences. Materials for protein purification and reagents used for other purposes in this study were supplied from Sigma, unless otherwise mentioned. Analysis of Self-oligomerization of α-Synuclein in the Presence of Dequalinium and Its Analogues—α-Synuclein (5 μm) was preincubated with various concentrations of C10-DQ and C14-DQ in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.5, for 30 min at 37 °C. The protein was also incubated with dequalinium analogues such as C4-DQ, C6-DQ, and C8-DQ along with quinaldine, quinaldinium iodide, and decamethonium bromide at a fixed concentration of 1.5 mm. Dequalinium and its analogues were prepared in 50% ethanol. The dequalinium-induced protein self-oligomerization was also carried out with various α-synuclein related proteins such as β-synuclein, α-syn97, α-syn61-140, and the two mutant forms (A53T and A30P) at a concentration of 5 μm. Following the addition of 0.3 mm EEDQ originally stocked in Me2SO, the chemical cross-linking reactions proceeded for another 1 h at 37 °C while keeping concentration of the organic solvent less than 10% in the final mixtures (53Lee J.-H. Shin H.-J. Chang C.-S. Paik S.R. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 1427-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated with a sample buffer of Tricine/SDS-PAGE consisting of 8% SDS, 24% glycerol, 0.015% Coomassie Blue G, and 0.005% phenol red in 0.9 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.45, by mixing at an 1:1 (v/v) ratio. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were analyzed with a precast gel for 10-20% Tricine/SDS-PAGE, and the ladder formation was visualized with the silver staining procedure by Morrissey (54Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Analysis of Protein Aggregation—Protein aggregation of α-synuclein was monitored with either turbidity and/or thioflavin-T binding fluorescence (55Han H. Weinreb P.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 56LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein (1 mg/ml) was incubated with either various concentrations of dequalinium or its analogues (C4, C6, and C10) at a fixed concentration of 50 μm in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.5, at room temperature under continuous shaking at 200 rpm with an orbit shaker (Red Rotor; Hoefer Scientific Inc.). Turbidity was estimated by measuring absorbance of the incubation mixture at 405 nm. Amyloid formation of α-synuclein was evaluated with thioflavin-T binding fluorescence at 485 nm with an excitation at 440 nm. During the incubation, aliquots (20 μl) were combined with 5 μm thioflavin-T in 50 mm glycine, pH 8.5, to a final volume of 100 μl. The fluorescence was measured with FL500 Microplate Fluorescence Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). The protein aggregates were visualized with a transmission electron microscope (H7100; Hitachi). Aliquots (5 μl) of the aggregates were adsorbed onto a carbon-coated copper grid (300-mesh) and air-dried for 1 min. After negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate for another 1 min, the aggregates were observed with the electron microscope (27Kim Y.-S. Lee D. Lee E.-K. Sung J.Y. Chung K.C. Kim J. Paik S.R. Brain Res. 2001; 908: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the analysis with atomic force microscope (AFM; XE-150, PSIA), an aliquot (5 μl) was placed on freshly cleaved mica (thickness 0.3 mm). Following adsorption of the protein aggregates (1-2 min), the droplet was displaced with 100 μl of Millipore-filtered water. After removing excess water with a filter paper, the aggregates were examined with AFM. Cytotoxicity—Human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were cultured to 80% confluence on a 60-mm culture dish, and subjected to transient transfection with a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA 3.0) containing human cDNA of α-synuclein. The vector (2 μg) was mixed with Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent according to the manufacturer's procedure and added onto the culture dish in the presence of serum-free medium. The transfection was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. After a change to the medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum, the cells were further incubated for 24 h. Following trypsinization with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA for 1 min at 37 °C, the cells were plated onto a 24-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well). Overexpression of α-synuclein inside the cells was examined with Western blotting. The cell lysates were prepared with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm pepstatin A. The extracts were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with the monoclonal antibody to α-synuclein (1:2,000). Following horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody treatment, the bands were visualized on x-ray film by using the ECL system (50Lee D. Lee S.-Y. Lee E.-N. Chang C.-S. Paik S.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The effect of dequalinium on the α-synuclein-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells was examined. The cells were plated in a 24-well plate at 1.5 × 105 cells/well. After cell growth reached 80-90% confluence, human cDNA of α-synuclein within pcDNA3.0 and a mock plasmid were separately transfected into the cells at 0.5 μg each in the presence and absence of 0.5 μm dequalinium, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell survival was estimated with the tetrazolium salt extraction method (57Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) and trypan blue exclusion assay. Since living cells with active mitochondria cleave the tetrazolium ring into a visible dark blue formazan reaction product, 3-[4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. To measure absorbance at 570 nm, the MTT extraction buffer containing 20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7, was added to each sample (400 μl into 400 μl of medium in a 24-well plate including 80 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT) to dissolve the formazan grains. The cell survival was monitored with absorbance at 570 nm by taking the extraction buffer containing the medium as a blank. In addition, trypan blue exclusion of the viable cell was estimated with 0.4% trypan blue by mixing the cell at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Stained cells were counted in hemocytometer under an inverted microscope. All of the data related to the cytotoxicity were obtained from two sets of three separate experiments. Miscellaneous—Dissociation constant between α-synuclein and dequalinium was obtained by incubating α-synuclein at 8.7 μm with various concentrations of dequalinium (0-25 μm) in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.5, for 30 min at room temperature in a final reaction volume of 200 μl. Protein-bound dequalinium was separated from the unbound form by using a centrifuge column procedure (Penefsky column) packed with Sephadex G-25 (coarse) (58Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preswollen gel packed in a 3-ml syringe was compressed via centrifugation at 600 × g (HA1000-3 by Hanil Industrial Co., Incheon, Korea) for 1 min. The reaction mixture was loaded on the top of the dehydrated gel and centrifuged for an additional 1.5 min at the same speed. The amounts of protein in the collected samples were quantified with a micro-BCA assay, which gave rise to the protein recovery of 52% on average. The amount of dequalinium was estimated by measuring absorbance at 327 nm with an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 2.80 × 104 m-1 cm-1. A saturation curve was drawn between the amounts of total dequalinium and its protein-bound form. A dissociation constant between α-synuclein and dequalinium was obtained from a double-reciprocal plot of the saturation"

To determine whether CREB acts directly on Phox2a transcription induced by BMP2+cAMP-elevating agent IBMX, transient transfections of hPhox2a-reporter constructs were performed in avian NC cultures and murine, catecholaminergic CAD cells. Although BMP2+IBMX increased endogenous Phox2a expression, the 7.5-kb hPhox2a reporters expressing either luciferase or DsRed1-E5 fluorescent protein were unresponsive to BMP2+IBMX, but active in both cell types. Cell sorting of fluorescence-positive NC cells expressing the 7.5-kb hPhox2a fluorescent timer reporter differentiated to equal numbers of catecholaminergic cells as fluorescence-negative cells, suggesting inappropriate transcription from the transfected hPhox2a promoter. NC or CAD cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and BMP2+IBMX display increased endogenous Phox2a transcription and prolonged CREB phosphorylation, indicating Phox2a chromatin remodeling is linked to CREB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitations employing CREB, CREB-binding protein, and acetylated H4 antibodies identified two CRE half-sites at -5.5 kb in the murine Phox2a promoter, which is also conserved in the human promoter. Proximal to the CRE half-sites, within a 170-bp region, are E-box and CCAAT binding sites, also conserved in mouse and human genes. This 170-bp promoter region confers cAMP, BMP2, and enhanced BMP2+cAMP regulation to Phox2a-luciferase reporters. We conclude these CREs are functional, with CREB directly activating Phox2a transcription. Because the E-box binds bHLH proteins like ASH1 induced in NC cells by BMP2, we propose this novel 170-bp cis-acting element is a composite site, mediating the synergistic regulation by BMP2+cAMP on Phox2a transcription.

However, whether cAMP signaling directly regulates transcription of the Phox2a gene remains to be determined. Although the regulation of the human hPhox2a promoter has been studied in human neuroblastoma cell lines expressing the endogenous Phox2a gene (9Hong S.J. Kim C.H. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the direct transcriptional regulation of the Phox2a promoter by BMP2+cAMP signaling has not been investigated.

Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J.

The Cath.a cell line derived from brain tumors of transgenic mice expressing the SV40 T-antigen under control of the TH promoter (22Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), like the catecholaminergic SA cells, expresses TH and DBH, synthesizes catecholamines, and also develops neurites. The CAD cell line used herein is a variant of Cath.a cells that undergoes neuronal differentiation by serum withdrawal (23Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by BMP2+cAMP costimulation (24Bilodeau M.L. Ji M. Paris M. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Herein, Phox2a promoter activity is examined following costimulation with BMP2+cAMP, employing two differentiation models of catecholaminergic neurons, namely, NC-derived SA cells and CNS-derived CAD cells. We report the identification of a novel, composite cis-acting element, located 5.5-kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the murine Phox2a gene. This regulatory element is comprised of two functional CRE half-sites in proximity to putative E-box and CCAAT binding sites. The identification of the functional CRE sites conclusively demonstrates the direct transcriptional involvement of the cAMP pathway in Phox2a gene regulation. Culture Reagents—Vitrogen 100 was purchased from Collagen Corp.; bovine fibronectin and IBMX from Sigma; trichostatin A (TSA) from A. G. Scientific Inc. Calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate buffer solution (CMF-PBS) and 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant human BMP2 (Wyeth Research) was reconstituted to 10 μg/ml as recommended and stored at -80 °C. NC Cultures—Standard NC culture growth medium containing 10% chicken embryo extract, and primary NC cultures of 47.5 h Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) embryos were prepared as previously described (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NC cells were isolated from primary outgrowths of neural tube explants plated for 42 h on Vitrogen 100-coated culture dishes. Adherent NC cells from the primary neural tube outgrowths were harvested by trypsin-EDTA, resuspended in growth medium (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and plated in fibronectin-coated dishes at a density of 320 cells/mm2 resulting in secondary NC cultures. NC cells were allowed to attach for 2 h, and the seeding medium was replaced with 2 ml of growth medium, with or without BMP2 (10 ng/ml) and IBMX (100 μm). NC cultures were fed by exchange of 1 ml of growth medium on day 3 after subculture and every other day thereafter. CAD Cell Culture—CAD cells were grown as described (23Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 5% calf serum (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (100% stocks: 10,000 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 10,000 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate in 0.85% saline, Invitrogen). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein was extracted from NC cultures or CAD cells, grown in 24-well dishes, in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.0% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6). Extracts were sonicated on ice for 15 s, and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Total protein (20 μg) was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with 1 μg/ml CREB antibody or 1 μg/ml of anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) (Upstate). Detection was with 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—NC cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Nonspecific background was blocked using PBS containing 10% goat serum for 40 min. Antibody for P-CREB (1:200, Upstate) was applied overnight at 4 °C followed by three washes in PBS. Undiluted TH antibody or peripherin antibody (1:200, Chemicon) was applied for 40 min followed by three washes in PBT. A 1:400 dilution of Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG was applied for 45 min followed by three washes in PBS. For immunofluorescence of CAD cells the following modifications were included: nonspecific background was blocked using PBS containing 1% goat serum. Antibody was added in PBS containing 1% goat serum and applied 1 h at room temperature. Real-time PCR—Total RNA from NC or CAD cells was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (20 μg) was treated with RNase-free DNase I (20 units) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (40 units). cDNA was synthesized using 2.0 μg of total RNA, 0.2 μg of random hexamers, and Superscript II reverse transcriptase as described (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were designed using Omega 2.0 software (Accelrys). PCR reactions were performed in identical triplicates using 2 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of 20 μm F-/R- primer, and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems), employing an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 Real-Time PCR system and the accompanying Sequence Detection Software version 1.0. Data analysis was carried out as described by Lee et al. (25Lee S. Tarn C. Wang W-H. Chen S. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8730-8740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), employing 18 S rRNA as the internal control. Plasmids and Transfections—hPhox2a promoter-Luc reporter constructs (9Hong S.J. Kim C.H. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing 1 μg of plasmid DNA for a 6-well NC culture or 2 μg for a 6-well of CAD cell culture. Luciferase activity was compared with pGL3-control vector (Promega). CMV-nLacZ plasmid was used to optimize transfections. Several hPhox2a promoter constructs were cloned into the pTimer-1 Vector (BD Biosciences Clontech), encoding the DsRed1-E5 protein, a mutant of Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein, which changes color over time. Shortly after translation, the protein emits green light; its red fluorophore emerges later, hours after translation. Plasmids were purified by CsCl2 equilibrium gradient centrifugation. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity (Luciferase Assay system, Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized per microgram of protein extract. Cells transfected with the pTimer-1 reporter constructs were assayed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the mouse Phox2a upstream element (UE and mtUE) spanning nucleotides -5754 to -5340 in the hPhox2a -32Luc and -515-Luc vectors. The resulting vectors were transiently transfected in NC or CAD cells as described earlier. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described (26Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z. Dixon J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1947-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), employing 250 ng of purified recombinant CREB protein (active motif) per binding reaction and 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes spanning the CRE half-site 1 or 2. The sequence of the oligonucleotides is as follows: CRE site 1: 5′-GGCTGTAGAATTCGTCATCACTCATTACACTGA-3′; CRE site 2: 5′-AGGAGCACATATGGGGCGTCACTCCTCAGTTAGGAT-3′; mutant CRE: 5′-GGCTGTAGAATTATGGTTCACTCATTACACTGA-3′; Wt CRE: 5′-GGCTGTAGAATTTGACGTCATCACTCATTACACTGA-3′. Cell Sorting by Flow Cytometry—NC cells were transfected with 1 μg of hPhox2a-Timer-1 plasmid as described earlier, at 24 h of primary NC outgrowths. At 42 h of primary NC outgrowths, neural tubes were removed; NC cells were then replated and treated with BMP2+IBMX. After 24 h, NC cells were observed every day for 3 days by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence-positive cells were quantified by cell sorting using the Epics Altra flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—CAD cells grown to near confluence in 10-cm dishes were treated for 2 h with BMP2(10 ng/ml), IBMX (100 μm), and/or TSA (100 ng/ml). Cellular proteins were cross-linked to chromatinized DNA for 10 min at 37 °C by addition to the medium of 1% formaldehyde. Cells were washed twice using ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1) and sonicated to reduce DNA length to ∼200-1,000 bp. The chromatin mixture was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of CREB antibody or 5 μg of CBP antibody (Upstate) or 5 μg of IgG or 1 μg of acetylated H4 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. S. Briggs, Purdue University). Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose slurry (Upstate). Following extensive washing and elution in 1% SDS-0.1 m NaHCO3, DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. Released DNA was purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers are as follows: CRE Site 1, 2: F-5′-TGCCTAGCCATTCACATTAG-3′; R-5′-CCTGAGAGGAGAGGCCAAGTG-3′; CRE Site 3: F-5′-TCCTGCCCTGAGAACTCTAT-3′; R-5′-CTCGCAACACTAGCTTTAG-3′; CRE Site 4: F-5′-CCCAGGAGCAGATAGATCCT-3′; R-5′-CATGCTGGGACACTAACAGA-3′; CRE Site 5: F-5′-AATTTGGGAAGATGGGACCC-3′; R-5′-ACCTCTGTCCCACTTCCTCT-3′. In avian NC cultures, moderate activation of cAMP signaling acts synergistically with BMP2 to promote development of the SA lineage (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), by increasing Phox2a and Phox2b transcription via activation and involvement of the transcription factor CREB (8Chen S. Ji M. Paris M. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41025-41036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the downstream effector of the cAMP pathway (27Andrisani O.M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 19-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate the mechanism of the combined BMP2 and cAMP signaling on Phox2a gene transcription, we employed the Phox2a promoter and its deletion constructs in transient luciferase reporter assays in avian NC cells. It is well established from studies of developmentally regulated and differentiation-specific genes, that functionally important cis-acting elements are conserved across species (29Creaser P.C. D'Argenio D.A. Williams T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Ghislain J. Marquet-Trin-Dinh C. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Charnay P. Frain M.

Accordingly, we employed the human Phox2a promoter to investigate its regulation in the developmentally regulated avian primary NC culture model system. Earlier studies by Hong et al. (9Hong S.J. Kim C.H. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have reported the cloning of the hPhox2a promoter and its characterization, studied in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE (2)M17 and SK-N-BE (2)C Phox2a-expressing cell lines. However, Phox2a regulation in response to BMP2 and cAMP signaling has not been examined. Employing the Fugene method of transfection in primary NC cultures, we initially established that 40% transfection efficiency was achieved with the CMV-β-gal reporter, without negative growth effects on the primary culture (data not shown). The hPhox2a-Luc reporter constructs shown in Fig. 1A, spanning sequences from 32 bp to 7.5 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site were transiently transfected in avian NC cells, as a function of cotreatment with BMP2+IBMX (a cAMP-elevating agent). The activity of the hPhox2a promoter tested in the avian NC system is qualitatively identical to that reported by Hong et al. (9Hong S.J. Kim C.H. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Specifically, the highest activity is observed with the 1.3-kb promoter fragment. These results suggest the Phox2a promoter activity is likely conserved between mammalian and avian species. The Activity of hPhox2a Promoter Differs from the Endogenous Phox2a Gene in NC Cultures—Interestingly, the transient transfection results do not demonstrate regulation of the hPhox2a promoter constructs by BMP2 and cAMP in NC cells (Fig. 1A). In our previous studies we have shown that cotreatment of NC cells with BMP2 and cAMP synergistically induces expression of the endogenous Phox2a gene (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Chen S. Ji M. Paris M. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41025-41036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as well as of TH mRNA (Fig. 1B). Thus, there appears to be a discrepancy between the in vivo regulation of the Phox2a gene and the transient transfection results of the hPhox2a promoter. To exclude that the hPhox2a promoter-luciferase reporter constructs might not be suitable for deciphering regulation of the Phox2a promoter (34Hong S.J. Chae H. Kim K.S. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (1240): 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the Phox2a promoter was cloned and studied using the fluorescence-timer (pTimer-1) reporter system (35Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This reporter monitors both the onset of transcription of a given promoter, by monitoring the appearance of green fluorescence, as well as the time of its transcriptional shut off, i.e. when only red fluorescence is observed (35Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Employing the hPhox2a-fluorescence-timer reporter constructs transfected in NC cultures in conjunction with flow cytometry the fluorescence-positive cells were quantified as a function of BMP2+IBMX cotreatment (Fig. 2A). The results demonstrated the promoter is transcriptionally active in the absence of BMP2+IBMX costimulation in NC cultures (Fig. 2A), and that cotreatment with BMP2+IBMX does not mediate any further transcriptional induction (Fig. 2A). Importantly, Phox2a promoter activation starts on day 1 of secondary NC culture (green fluorescence), which is earlier than the known expression pattern of the endogenous Phox2a gene (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and is turned off by day 2 (red fluorescence), when the endogenous Phox2a gene is known to be transcribed (8Chen S. Ji M. Paris M. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41025-41036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Greulich J.D. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2001; 37: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Use of the fluorescent reporter allows cell sorting of the transfected, fluorescence-positive NC cells and thus the study of their phenotype and developmental potential. Following live cell sorting, the Phox2a fluorescence-positive and fluorescence-negative NC cells were placed in culture; 2 h after replating 80% of hPhox2a-fluorescence-positive NC cells remained positive. Likewise, no fluorescence was detected with the sorted fluorescence-negative NC cells (Fig. 2B). The sorted NC cells were then grown either under control conditions or with BMP2+IBMX cotreatment. After 4 days of culture the NC cells were immunostained with TH antibody to monitor TH protein expression, a marker of SA cell development (7Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Chen S. Ji M. Paris M. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41025-41036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We hypothesized, if the transcriptional activity of the transiently transfected hPhox2a were authentic, these hPhox2a-fluorescence-positive NC cells would be expressing the endogenous Phox2a gene. Because Phox2a expression is required for SA development, we predicted that all of the sorted hPhox2a-fluorescence-positive NC cells would give rise to SA progenitors, i.e. they would be TH immunoreactive. However, following cell sorting and replating, both the hPhox2a fluorescence-positive and -negative NC cells cotreated with BMP2+IBMX, resulted in the appearance of similar numbers of TH-immunoreactive cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the appearance of melanocytes was also observed in the fluorescence-positive NC cultures (data not shown). These results suggest the hPhox2a promoter constructs were inappropriately activated in NC cells, other than those that became SA cells, supporting that the expression of the transiently transfected hPhox2a reporters does not reflect the expression of the endogenous Phox2a gene. Taken together with previous results (Fig. 1A), these data demonstrate that the hPhox2a-Luc construct, comprised of 7.5kb of upstream sequence, does not respond similarly to the endogenous promoter, suggesting that its expression is either misregulated or unresponsive to signals known to induce the expression of the endogenous Phox2a mRNA. Three possibilities account for the observed results. 1) Regulation of the human Phox2a promoter in avian cells differs from regulation in mammalian cells. 2) The chromatin context is an important determinant in the synergistic BMP2+IBMX regulation, and 3) cis-acting elements mediating the BMP2 and cAMP regulation reside outside the 7.5-kb hPhox2a promoter fragment. Regulation of Phox2a Promoter in Murine, Catecholaminergic CAD Cells—To address whether regulation of the Phox2a promoter in avian cells is different from the regulation in mammalian cells, we employed the murine CAD cell line (23Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a variant of the CNS-derived catecholaminergic Cath.a cells (22Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cath.a cell line was established"

https://openalex.org/W1967813809,"The adenovirus E1A protein has been shown to be involved in the potentiation of apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, yet the molecular events of E1A-mediated apoptosis are not very clear. A recent report has suggested that deamidation of the Bcl-X(L) protein inhibits its antiapoptotic ability and leads to apoptosis induced by alkylating agents in Rb-deficient tumor cells. Since Rb is known to interact with E1A, which interrupts Rb's normal function, we examined Bcl-X(L) deamidation and cell death induced by cisplatin in E1A transfectants. We found that the E1A transfectants became sensitive to cisplatin-induced apoptosis compared to the parental cells, SKOV3.ip1. Our data show that cisplatin treatment induced the modification of Bcl-X(L) in the E1A transfectants in dosage and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, phosphatase treatment had no effect on the level of Bcl-X(L) modification, whereas alkaline lysis buffer appeared to induce the same modification of Bcl-X(L). Ectopic expression of the deamidated forms of Bcl- X(L) in SKOV3.ip1 cells revealed that the modification to the Bcl- X(L) protein molecules was deamidation. Expression of the E1A mutant (dl1108) which contains deletion at CR2 domain suppressed Bcl-X(L) deamidation and apoptosis induced by cisplatin. We also found that expression of the nondeamidated Bcl-X(L) protected E1A transfectants from apoptosis. These findings suggest that Bcl-X(L) deamidation contributes to E1A-mediated cisplatin sensitization in SKOV3.ip1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984985302,"Cyclin D3 has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of cell cycle progression in lymphocytes. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this protein. We have previously shown that both basal and cAMP-induced degradation of cyclin D3 in Reh cells is dependent on Thr-283 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). We now provide evidence of an alternative mechanism being involved in the regulation of cyclin D3 degradation. Treatment of lymphoid cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), induces rapid phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D3. This degradation is not inhibited by the GSK-3beta inhibitors lithium or Kenpaullone, or by substitution of Thr-283 with Ala on cyclin D3, indicating that cyclin D3 can be degraded independently of Thr-283 phosphorylation and GSK-3beta activity. Interestingly, in vitro experiments revealed that PP1, but not PP2A, was able to dephosphorylate cyclin D3 efficiently, and PP1 was found to associate with His-tagged cyclin D3. These results support the hypothesis that PP1 constitutively keeps cyclin D3 in a stable, dephosphorylated state, and that treatment of cells with OA leads to phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D3 through inhibition of PP1."
