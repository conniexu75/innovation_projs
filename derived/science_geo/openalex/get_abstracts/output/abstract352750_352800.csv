https://openalex.org/W2094850439,"Whereas gamma-band neuronal oscillations clearly appear integral to visual attention, the role of lower-frequency oscillations is still being debated. Mounting evidence indicates that a key functional property of these oscillations is the rhythmic shifting of excitability in local neuronal ensembles. Here, we show that when attended stimuli are in a rhythmic stream, delta-band oscillations in the primary visual cortex entrain to the rhythm of the stream, resulting in increased response gain for task-relevant events and decreased reaction times. Because of hierarchical cross-frequency coupling, delta phase also determines momentary power in higher-frequency activity. These instrumental functions of low-frequency oscillations support a conceptual framework that integrates numerous earlier findings."

This process requires a strong modification of the near-surface region of palladium, in which carbon (from fragmented feed molecules) occupies interstitial lattice sites. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements under reaction conditions indicated that much less carbon was dissolved in palladium during unselective, total hydrogenation. Additional studies of hydrogen content using in situ prompt gamma activation analysis, which allowed us to follow the hydrogen content of palladium during catalysis, indicated that unselective hydrogenation proceeds on hydrogen-saturated β-hydride, whereas selective hydrogenation was only possible after decoupling bulk properties from the surface events. Thus, the population of subsurface sites of palladium, by either hydrogen or carbon, governs the hydrogenation events on the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2039525732,"Autophagy is a major clearance route for intracellular aggregate-prone proteins causing diseases such as Huntington's disease. Autophagy induction with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin accelerates clearance of these toxic substrates. As rapamycin has nontrivial side effects, we screened FDA-approved drugs to identify new autophagy-inducing pathways. We found that L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, the K+ATP channel opener minoxidil, and the G(i) signaling activator clonidine induce autophagy. These drugs revealed a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating autophagy, in which cAMP regulates IP3 levels, influencing calpain activity, which completes the cycle by cleaving and activating G(s)alpha, which regulates cAMP levels. This pathway has numerous potential points where autophagy can be induced, and we provide proof of principle for therapeutic relevance in Huntington's disease using mammalian cell, fly and zebrafish models. Our data also suggest that insults that elevate intracytosolic Ca2+ (like excitotoxicity) inhibit autophagy, thus retarding clearance of aggregate-prone proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1974646727,"The full promise of human genomics will be realized only when the genomes of thousands of individuals can be sequenced for comparative analysis. A reference sequence enables the use of short read length. We report an amplification-free method for determining the nucleotide sequence of more than 280,000 individual DNA molecules simultaneously. A DNA polymerase adds labeled nucleotides to surface-immobilized primer-template duplexes in stepwise fashion, and the asynchronous growth of individual DNA molecules was monitored by fluorescence imaging. Read lengths of &gt;25 bases and equivalent phred software program quality scores approaching 30 were achieved. We used this method to sequence the M13 virus to an average depth of &gt;150Ã and with 100% coverage; thus, we resequenced the M13 genome with high-sensitivity mutation detection. This demonstrates a strategy for high-throughput low-cost resequencing."

https://openalex.org/W2056857562,"Antibiotics are a crucial line of defense against bacterial infections. Nevertheless, several antibiotics are natural products of microorganisms that have as yet poorly appreciated ecological roles in the wider environment. We isolated hundreds of soil bacteria with the capacity to grow on antibiotics as a sole carbon source. Of 18 antibiotics tested, representing eight major classes of natural and synthetic origin, 13 to 17 supported the growth of clonal bacteria from each of 11 diverse soils. Bacteria subsisting on antibiotics are surprisingly phylogenetically diverse, and many are closely related to human pathogens. Furthermore, each antibiotic-consuming isolate was resistant to multiple antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations. This phenomenon suggests that this unappreciated reservoir of antibiotic-resistance determinants can contribute to the increasing levels of multiple antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2079905392,"Purines are synthesized de novo in 10 chemical steps that are catalyzed by six enzymes in eukaryotes. Studies in vitro have provided little evidence of anticipated protein-protein interactions that would enable substrate channeling and regulation of the metabolic flux. We applied fluorescence microscopy to HeLa cells and discovered that all six enzymes colocalize to form clusters in the cellular cytoplasm. The association and dissociation of these enzyme clusters can be regulated dynamically, by either changing the purine levels of or adding exogenous agents to the culture media. Collectively, the data provide strong evidence for the formation of a multi-enzyme complex, the “purinosome,” to carry out de novo purine biosynthesis in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055688390,"Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that catalyze their own excision from precursor transcripts and insertion into new genetic locations. Here we report the crystal structure of an intact, self-spliced group II intron from Oceanobacillus iheyensis at 3.1 angstrom resolution. An extensive network of tertiary interactions facilitates the ordered packing of intron subdomains around a ribozyme core that includes catalytic domain V. The bulge of domain V adopts an unusual helical structure that is located adjacent to a major groove triple helix (catalytic triplex). The bulge and catalytic triplex jointly coordinate two divalent metal ions in a configuration that is consistent with a two–metal ion mechanism for catalysis. Structural and functional analogies support the hypothesis that group II introns and the spliceosome share a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2038528572,The miniaturization of magnetic devices toward the limit of single atoms calls for appropriate tools to study their magnetic properties. We demonstrate the ability to measure magnetization curves of individual magnetic atoms adsorbed on a nonmagnetic metallic substrate with use of a scanning tunneling microscope with a spin-polarized tip. We can map out low-energy magnetic interactions on the atomic scale as evidenced by the oscillating indirect exchange between a Co adatom and a nanowire on Pt(111). These results are important for the understanding of variations that are found in the magnetic properties of apparently identical adatoms because of different local environments.

Using adeno-associated virus 2, we expressed the Drosophila allatostatin receptor in somatostatin (Sst)-expressing neurons in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC). Rapid silencing of these neurons in awake rats induced a persistent apnea without any respiratory movements to rescue their breathing. We hypothesize that breathing requires preBötC Sst neurons and that their sudden depression can lead to serious, even fatal, respiratory failure."
https://openalex.org/W1994349815,"Previous exclosure studies measuring the top-down control of arthropod abundance and herbivory combined the effects of birds and bats. We experimentally partitioned bird predation from bat predation in a lowland tropical forest in Panama and measured the direct effects (arthropod abundance) and indirect effects (herbivory). The exclusion of birds and bats each directly increased arthropod abundance on plants: Bird-exclosed plants contained 65% more, and bat-exclosed plants 153% more, arthropods than controls. Birds and bats also indirectly increased herbivory: Bird-exclosed plants suffered 67% more, and bat-exclosed plants 209% more, herbivory than controls. We conclude that bats have dramatic ecological effects that were previously overlooked."
https://openalex.org/W2051004621,"Exclosure experiments have demonstrated the effects of bird predation on arthropods. In a Mexican coffee plantation, we excluded foliage-gleaning bird and bat predators from coffee plants. Effects of bats and birds were additive. In the dry season, birds reduced arthropods in coffee plants by 30%; birds and bats together reduced arthropods by 46%. In the wet season, bats reduced arthropods by 84%, whereas birds reduced them by only 58%. We conclude that previous ""bird"" exclosure experiments may have systematically underestimated the effects of bats."
https://openalex.org/W2080981566,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated in adipocytes during exercise and other states in which lipolysis is stimulated. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect and its physiological relevance are unclear. To examine these questions, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with cAMP-inducing agents (isoproterenol, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine), which stimulate lipolysis and activate AMPK. When lipolysis was partially inhibited with the general lipase inhibitor orlistat, AMPK activation by these agents was also partially reduced, but the increases in cAMP levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity were unaffected. Likewise, small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of adipose tissue triglyceride lipase inhibited both forskolin-stimulated lipolysis and AMPK activation but not that of PKA. Forskolin treatment increased the AMP:ATP ratio, and this too was reduced by orlistat. When acyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoA, was inhibited with triacsin C, the increases in both AMPK activity and AMP:ATP ratio were blunted. Isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress, an effect that was quintupled in cells incubated with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. The isoproterenol-induced increase in the AMP:ATP ratio was also much greater in these cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that activation of AMPK in adipocytes by cAMP-inducing agents is a consequence of lipolysis and not of PKA activation. They suggest that AMPK activation in this setting is caused by an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio that appears to be due, at least in part, to the acylation of fatty acids. Finally, this AMPK activation appears to restrain the energy depletion and oxidative stress caused by lipolysis."

Here, we report the structure of isoform-1 cytochrome c bound to cytochrome bc1 complex at 1.9Å resolution in reduced state. The dimer structure is asymmetric. Monovalent cytochrome c binding is correlated with conformational changes of the Rieske head domain and subunit QCR6p and with a higher number of interfacial water molecules bound to cytochrome c1. Pronounced hydration and a “mobility mismatch” at the interface with disordered charged residues on the cytochrome c side are favorable for transient binding. Within the hydrophobic interface, a minimal core was identified by comparison with the novel structure of the complex with bound isoform-2 cytochrome c. Four core interactions encircle the heme cofactors surrounded by variable interactions. The core interface may be a feature to gain specificity for formation of the reactive complex.

Electron transfer processes are essential for all living organisms. Most energy equivalents in eukaryotic cells are generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In cellular respiration, the soluble protein cytochrome c (cyt c) 3The abbreviations used are: cyt c, cytochrome c; iso-1, isoform 1; M3L, trimethyllysine. transports electrons from the cytochrome bc1 complex (cyt bc1) to cytochrome c oxidase (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). The interaction of cyt bc1 and cyt c is transient and amazingly efficient, enabling turnover rates higher than 100/s (2Hunte C. Solmaz S. Lange C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenerg. 2002; 1555: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial cyt bc1 is a homodimeric multisubunit integral membrane protein complex with a molecular mass close to 500 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the electron transfer from ubiquinol to cyt c coupled to the net translocation of protons over the membrane (4Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A key feature of the mechanism is the large scale domain movement of the Rieske protein by 20 Å, which facilitates electron transfer from oxidation of ubiquinol at center P to subunit cyt c1 (5Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Cyt c docks onto the latter subunit and takes up the electron. An x-ray structure of yeast cyt bc1 with cyt c and an antibody fragment bound has been previously determined at 2.97 Å resolution (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A single cyt c molecule is bound to the homodimeric complex. Direct and specific interactions of the electron transfer complex visualized in the x-ray structure are mediated by non-polar forces and a cation-π interaction with charged residues positioned peripherally to the interface. These interactions appear to be the dominant features of transient electron transfer complexes and are also observed for the interface of the yeast cyt c peroxidase·cyt c (6Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and the bacterial reaction center·cyt c2 complexes (7Axelrod H.L. Abresch E.C. Okamura M.Y. Yeh A.P. Rees D.C. Feher G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In general, a two-step model for formation of transient electron transfer complexes is today strongly supported. A short-lived, dynamic encounter complex steered by long-range electrostatic interactions precedes a dominant well defined bound state based mainly on non-polar interactions (8Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9Volkov A.N. Worrall J.A.R. Holtzmann E. Ubbink M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18945-18950Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, electron transport proteins such as cyt c do have several structurally unrelated reaction partners, and it is not understood how the high degree of specificity for the reaction partners is achieved in combination with the necessary weak binding and whether redox state-dependent alterations are required to facilitate association and dissociation processes. No large structural changes are known to explain these requirements. These features most likely have their molecular causes in subtle structural differences, including specific contributions of water molecules. Here, the structure of yeast cyt bc1 with its substrate cyt c and an Fν fragment bound was determined at 1.9 Å resolution in reduced state. It is the highest resolution for a cyt bc1 structure so far, and it allows the accurate description of the complex interface, focusing especially on the role of electrostatic and water-mediated interactions as well as on differences related to the monovalent binding mode of cyt c. A second structure of cyt bc1 with isoform-2 cyt c was determined, and comparison of the structures resulted in the identification of common binding interactions, the core interface, important for specificity of binding. Preparation of cyt bc1·cyt c Crystals—The ternary complex of cyt bc1, Fν fragment, and isoform-1 (iso-1) cyt c was prepared as described in Ref. 3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar with the following modifications. To reduce nuclei formation, sucrose was added (1 m) to the buffer of the cyt bc1·Fν fragment complex prior to concentrating the protein to 30 mg/ml. The derivatized yeast cyt c was added in a molar ratio of 2.6/cyt bc1 dimer. An ultracentrifugation step (40 min at 106,000 × g) was introduced. 2 μl of the ternary complex were mixed with 1 μl of precipitant in a microbatch setup under paraffin oil. The crystallization buffer was 1 m sucrose, 10% DMSO, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 66 mm NaCl, 1.67% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.05% n-undecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, and 1 μm stigmatellin (final concentrations). Cyt bc1 is highly active in this buffer if the inhibitor stigmatellin is omitted. Crystal grew up to 0.4 mm within 6 weeks to 6 months at 4 °C. Crystals were soaked for 5 min in crystallization buffer with 1 mm ascorbate, 80 mm NaCl, and 5% polyethylene glycol 4000 prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. The reduced state of the c-type hemes was spectroscopically confirmed (supplemental Fig. S5A). Isoform-2 (iso-2) cyt c was prepared as described (2Hunte C. Solmaz S. Lange C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenerg. 2002; 1555: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the crystals were prepared as for iso-1 cyt c, but ascorbate was omitted. Structure Determination and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected from single crystals at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Facility (Grenoble, France) at beam line ID23EH1 for the high resolution structure (MarmosaicCCD Q225 detector) and at beam line ID14EH1 for the structure with iso-2 cyt c bound (ADSC CCD Q4 detector). Data were processed and scaled with XDS (10Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by molecular replacement as described in Ref. 3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar. For iso-2 cyt c, Protein Data Bank accession code 1YEA (11Murphy M.E.P. Nall B.T. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 160-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as a starting model. The models were refined in CNS (12Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and by manual remodeling in program O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The two monomers were refined independently without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The final statistics are listed in supplemental Table S1. Hydrogen bonds and non-bonded atom contacts were analyzed with the programs LIGPLOT (14Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4368) Google Scholar) and CNS. All binding pairs were checked for well defined electron density. Least-squares superimpositions were performed in LSQMAN, ESCET (25Schneider T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or CNS as indicated. Root mean square deviations were calculated with CNS. For the crystal contact analysis, a model of cyt c bound at the empty binding site was created by superimposition of the two monomers via cyt b with the program O. Figures were created with MolScript (15Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Raster3D (16Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar), and PyMOL (42DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Structure of cyt bc1 with Bound cyt c in Reduced State at 1.9 Å Resolution—The electron transfer complex of cyt c bound to cyt bc1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was crystallized with the antibody fragment Fν18E11, and the structure was determined at 1.9 Å resolution (Rfree = 26.2%, Rcryst = 24.5%, see supplemental Table S1). Optimized crystallization conditions and cryo-cooling for data collection provided the basis for the improved quality as compared with the previously published structure of this complex at 2.97 Å resolution, for which data collection was carried out at 277 K (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In agreement with the initial structure, only one molecule cyt c is bound to the homodimeric cyt bc1. As a result of the higher resolution, 1648 water, 13 lipid, and 2 detergent molecules were included in the model and refined (Fig. 1). A mixed redox state has to be assumed for the initial structure, as the complex was used as isolated with cyt c1 reduction below 25% and oxidized cyt c (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For the high resolution structure, a defined redox state was achieved by soaking the crystals in ascorbate solution prior to flash cooling and data collection at 100 K. Ascorbate reduces cyt c and the high potential chain subunits cyt c1 and the Rieske protein (17Vanneste W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 175-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4905-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced state of the crystals was spectroscopically confirmed (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). The high resolution allows an accurate description of the complex interface present between cyt c and subunit cyt c1 (Fig. 2A, Table 1). At the center of the interface, heme c1 and heme c are in close contact, with 4.1 Å distance only between two carbon atoms in the respective thioether-bonded substituents of the tetrapyrrol rings. Nine pairs of interacting atoms surround the heme clefts separated by 3-4 Å, permitting van der Waals contacts and hydrophobic interactions (Table 1, Fig. 3, A and B). Four contacts including the cation-π interaction Phe-230/Arg-19 of cyt c1/cyt c are the same as in the 2.97 Å structure, for which only a total of five interacting pairs was observed (Table 1). An energy-based analysis with the program CaPTURE (19Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar) indicates that the Phe-230/Arg-19 pair contributes a strong cation-π interaction with a calculated interaction energy of E = -7.07 kcal/mol. Residues Ala-103/Ala-87, Ala-103/M3L78 and Met-233/Gly-89 of cyt c1/cyt c mediate hydrophobic interactions with the respective carbon atoms in van der Waals distance (M3L: trimethyllysine). The contribution of the modified amino acid residue trimethyllysine (M3L78) of cyt c is noteworthy. In addition, Phe-230/Thr-18, Ala-168/Val-34, Gln-170/Gln-22, and Gln-170/Lys-33 of cyt c1/cyt c form van der Waals contacts.TABLE 1Interactions in the cyt bc1 · cyt c interface and heme-to-heme distances for three structures of the electron transfer complex with either iso-1 cyt c or iso-2 cyt ccyt c1cyt bc1·iso-1 cyt cac-type heme groups of the complex reduced (see “Experimental Procedures”).cyt bc1·iso-1 cyt cbRedox state of the complex as isolated.cyt bc1·iso-2 cyt cbRedox state of the complex as isolated.iso-1 cyt cd(Å)iso-1 cyt cd(Å)iso-2 cyt cd(Å)1.9 Å resolution3 Å resolutioncProtein Data Bank accession code 1KYO (3).

The ring of non-polar interactions around the heme clefts does not seal off the interface from the aqueous environment. The hydration of the interface was analyzed for residue pairs from cyt c1/cyt c with an interatom distance of less than 7 Å. 30 water molecules bind within this distance constraint to either surface by hydrogen bonds. The interface is well hydrated, and water molecules are either in hydrogen bond distance to cyt c or to cyt c1 (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 3, D and E). Eight water molecules mediate a hydrogen bond either to cyt c1 or cyt c and are in van der Waals contact distance to atoms of the respective interaction partner. Two water molecules mediate an interaction by hydrogen bonds between the two interaction partners, although the interaction is weak due to the extended bond length: water molecule X1708 is bound to Thr-18 of cyt c (distance 2.9 Å) and to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Arg-227 of cyt c1 (distance 3.2 Å); water molecule X1845 is bound to the main chain nitrogen atom of Ala-226 of cyt c1 (distance 3 Å) and the Gln-22 OE1 atom of cyt c (distance 3.3 Å). Interestingly, most of the water molecules are stabilized by interactions with cyt c1 and not with cyt c (Fig. 3, D and E). Extending the analysis of the interface to a cutoff distance of 10 Å between cyt c1 and cyt c showed that there are no interactions mediated by two water molecules. Considerable rearrangement of water molecules is observed upon binding of cyt c. The simultaneous presence of an occupied and a free cyt c binding site in the cyt bc1 dimer permitted the comparison of water molecule positions between the two sites in the same crystal structure (Fig. 3F). 9 water positions are the same in both sites. 5 and 10 water molecules are only present on the free and occupied surface, respectively. The latter include the two water molecules with hydrogen bonds to both cyt c1 and cyt c. Overall, more crystallographically defined water molecules are located on the surface of cyt c1 with bound cyt c. The Electrostatic Interactions Form a Semicircle around the Non-polar Interface—The non-polar interface is surrounded by oppositely charged residue pairs, which are not in close contact. For the analysis of long-range electrostatic interactions, a cutoff distance of 4-9.6 Å was chosen. The latter is known as Debye length between single-charged ions at an ionic strength of 100 mm (21Wedler G. Lehrbuch der Physikalischen Chemie. 5th Ed. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004Google Scholar). Above this distance, the charge of an ion is shielded by counter ions of the solvent. Eight oppositely charged residue pairs were identified in the structure; they are separated by distances of 4.7-9.2 Å (Table 1). Three of five of the identified cyt c residues have been shown by selective labeling to be important for binding of horse heart cyt c (homologous yeast residues are in parentheses): Lys13 (Arg-19), Lys-86 (Lys-92), and Lys-87 (Lys-93) (22Speck S.H. Ferguson-Miller S. Osheroff N. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whereas the selected residues from cyt c1 are overall well defined by the electron density map, most of the positively charged side chains of cyt c appear to be flexible, indicating that the long-range electrostatic interactions are weak (Table 1). Analysis of the hydration shell clearly showed that there are no electrostatic interactions mediated by one or two bridging water molecules. The charged residue pairs are clustered at one side of the interface and form a semicircle around it (Fig. 3, A-C). Structure of cyt bc1 with Isoform-2 cyt c Bound—Yeast cyt c exists in two isoforms that share 83% sequence identity (supplemental Fig. S6). Depending on growth conditions, yeast cells contain typically 95% iso-1 and 5% iso-2 (23Laz T.M. Pietras D.F. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both the high resolution and the previous structure (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) contain iso-1 cyt c. To challenge the specificity of the binding interaction and the monovalent binding mode, we crystallized the complex of yeast cyt bc1 and iso-2 cyt c with the antibody fragment Fν18E11. The crystals were directly used for x-ray diffraction data collection at cryo conditions without any redox treatment, and the structure was determined at 2.5 Å resolution (Rfree = 25.6%, Rcryst = 22.5%, see supplemental Table S1). As for the complexes with iso-1 cyt c, only one molecule of iso-2 cyt c is bound. A slight shift within the error limits was observed for the position of iso-2 cyt c. The heme c1 to heme c distances of the electron transfer complex are nearly identical to the complexes with iso-1 cyt c bound. Six residue pairs of the non-polar interface are the same for iso-2 and iso-1 cyt c: Ala-103/Ala-91(87), Ala-103/M3L82(78), Ala168/Val38 (34), Phe-230/Thr-22(18), Phe-230/Arg-23(19), and Met-233/Ala-93(Gly-89) of cyt c1/iso-2 cyt c (iso-1 cyt c) (Table 1). This includes the cation-π interaction and the trimethyllysine of cyt c. Only one of these residues differs in iso-2; Ala-93 is substituted with glycine in iso-1 cyt c (Gly-89). Seven additional contacts, including two close (<4Å) electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged residue pairs (Glu-201/Lys-21) were identified; all involve residues that are conserved between the two isoforms. The coinciding monovalent binding mode and the highly similar interfaces could be enforced by protein-protein interactions between neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice. Therefore, crystal contact analysis was carried out using models in which cyt c binding to the second monomer was generated by superimposition. In the occupied binding site of the high resolution structure, atoms of His-45 from iso-1 cyt c are in contact with subunit QCR2p of the neighboring molecule. The strongest interaction is a polar hydrogen bond between His-45 NE2 of cyt c and Leu-368 OT2 of QCR2p with a distance of 2.9 Å. At the second binding site, the nearest atom of the neighboring molecule would be 7 Å apart from cyt c. If both sites were occupied, the two cyt c molecules would be separated by a minimal distance of 18 Å. In conclusion, no steric hindrance impedes the binding at the second binding site. Furthermore, His-49 of iso-2 cyt c (homologous to His-45 of iso-1 cyt c) does not mediate any crystal contacts. In the respective structure, the only contacts present are van der Waals contacts between Asn-66 from cyt c and the neighboring cyt bc1 at the occupied binding site. There is no indication for steric hindrance at the modeled (empty) binding site, but Asn-66 of cyt c could potentially form a polar hydrogen bond with Asp-366 of cyt bc1 that could stabilize cyt c at the empty binding site. Taken together, the contacts of cyt c to neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice are very weak and are mediated by different residues in the two structures. This strongly indicates that the interface, which has a larger contact area, dominates and specifies the binding interaction. The Core Interface Is Defined by Interactions Occurring in Three cyt bc1·cyt c Structures—Three structures of the electron transfer complex have now been determined, the structures with iso-1 cyt c at 1.9 Å and 2.97 Å resolution and with iso-2 cyt c. The structures differ in crystallization conditions, redox state, data collection temperature, and cyt c amino acid sequence. However, when comparing the respective interfaces (see Table 1), four interacting residue pairs of cyt c1/cyt c were identified in all three structures: Ala-103/Ala-87, Ala-168/Val-34, Phe-230/Arg-19, and Phe-230/Thr-18. These pairs are apparently important for the stabilization. They define an area around the heme cleft, which we term the core interface (Fig. 2B). Besides the core interface, the high resolution structure and the structure with iso-2 cyt c bound share two more interacting pairs (Ala-103/M3L78 and Met-233/Gly-89 of cyt c1/cyt c). The 2.97 Å resolution structure and the structure with iso-2 cyt c share one additional interaction (Met-233/Arg-19 of cyt c1/cyt c). Two of the variable interactions appear only in the high resolution structure, and five pairs appear only in the structure with iso-2 cyt c (Table 1). The core interface interactions (orange in Fig. 3, A and B) are all located in close vicinity to the heme clefts whereas the variable interactions are farther away from the hemes and surround the core interface (pale yellow in Fig. 3, A and B). The heme-to-heme distances are consistent between the three structures. The edge-to-edge distances of the porphyrin rings that govern the electron transfer rates range from 9.0 to 9.3 Å (Table 1). The resulting calculated electron transfer rates (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar) are very fast and in the range of 1.0*106 to 2.6*107 s-1, affected by subtle differences in edge-edge distance and packing density. A comparison of the long-range electrostatic interactions for the three complex structures shows that, with few exceptions, the same residues are involved (Table 1). Asp-231, Asp-232, Glu-99, and Glu-235 of cyt c1 and Lys-92 and Lys-93 of cyt c mediate long-range electrostatic interactions in all three structures. The other residue pairs mediate long-range electrostatic interactions in two out of three structures. Comparison of cyt bc1 Monomers with Free and Occupied cyt c Binding Sites Reveals Rigid Body Movement of the Rieske Protein Head Domain—The resolution of 1.9 Å and the independent refinement of the two monomers allowed a detailed comparison of monomer A and B with empty and occupied binding site, respectively. As previously observed (3Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the occupancy of the Qi site with ubiquinone was higher for the monomer with bound cyt c. However, the overall occupancy was too low at both binding sites to refine ubiquinone. No significant structural differences were observed for the structures of the two ubiquinone binding sites at center N. Also, the two binding sites for cyt c do not show significant structural differences, indicating that the cyt c binding site does not rearrange upon substrate binding. The B-factors, and thus also the coordinate error, showed very large differences for the different regions of the dimer, imposing limitations for assigning the significance of conformational changes. Thus, the monomers were compared with the program ESCET (25Schneider T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which uses the diffraction precision index DPI (26Cruickshank D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) that includes B-factors in the error model. For the analysis, a sigma cutoff of two was used. Three rigid bodies were identified (Fig. 4A). The major part of the monomer structure is equivalent between the two monomers and forms the blue rigid body. The second rigid body contains residues of subunit QCR6p (74-104 and 141-174, green in Fig. 4A) and is likely to have a different conformation. QCR6p shows overall increased per-residue root mean"

Brain pathways that control song production are well defined, but little is known about the sites and mechanisms of tutor song memorization. Here we test the hypothesis that molecular signaling in a sensory brain area outside of the song system is required for developmental song learning. Using controlled tutoring and a pharmacological inhibitor, we transiently suppressed the extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling pathway in a portion of the auditory forebrain specifically during tutor song exposure. On maturation, treated birds produced poor copies of tutor song, whereas controls copied the tutor song effectively. Thus the foundation of normal song learning, the formation of a sensory memory of tutor song, requires a conserved molecular pathway in a brain area that is distinct from the circuit for song motor control."
https://openalex.org/W2143830585,"Synaptic dysfunction caused by oligomeric assemblies of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been linked to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Here we found that incubation of primary cortical neurons with oligomeric Abeta decreases the level of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), a phospholipid that regulates key aspects of neuronal function. The destabilizing effect of Abeta on PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism was Ca2+-dependent and was not observed in neurons that were derived from mice that are haploinsufficient for Synj1. This gene encodes synaptojanin 1, the main PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase in the brain and at the synapses. We also found that the inhibitory effect of Abeta on hippocampal long-term potentiation was strongly suppressed in slices from Synj1+/- mice, suggesting that Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction can be ameliorated by treatments that maintain the normal PtdIns(4,5)P2 balance in the brain."

THC is the prototypic cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist and is psychoactive and analgesic. CBD is also analgesic, but it is not a CB1 receptor agonist. Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels, encoded by the CaV3 gene family, regulate the excitability of many cells, including neurons involved in nociceptive processing. We examined the effects of THC and CBD on human CaV3 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and T-type channels in mouse sensory neurons using whole-cell, patch clamp recordings. At moderately hyperpolarized potentials, THC and CBD inhibited peak CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents with IC50 values of ∼1 μm but were less potent on CaV3.3 channels. THC and CBD inhibited sensory neuron T-type channels by about 45% at 1 μm. However, in recordings made from a holding potential of -70 mV, 100 nm THC or CBD inhibited more than 50% of the peak CaV3.1 current. THC and CBD produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the steady state inactivation potentials for each of the CaV3 channels, which accounts for inhibition of channel currents. Additionally, THC caused a modest hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of CaV3.1 and CaV3.2. THC but not CBD slowed CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 deactivation and inactivation kinetics. Thus, THC and CBD inhibit CaV3 channels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

The widespread use of cannabis for self-medication and social purposes and the potential of its constituents as new therapeutic agents make it important that the molecular targets for THC and CBD are well defined. Most of the effects of THC are likely to occur through actions on G protein-coupled CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors (10Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

T-type Ca2+ channels are a family of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with distinctive biophysical characteristics and widespread expression in neuronal and other tissue (26Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Most notably, T-type channels open at membrane potentials significantly more negative than high voltage-activated N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels and inactivate relatively rapidly compared with L-, N-, and P/Q-type channels. Because T-type channels open at potentials between the resting membrane potential and the threshold potential for action potential firing, these channels are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, including low-threshold calcium spiking, cardiac pacemaker activity, and modulation of neuronal excitability (26Perez-Reyes E.

In this study we have examined the effects of THC and CBD on the human CaV3 channel subtypes expressed in HEK293 cells. Both THC and CBD inhibited all three subtypes; but in addition, THC had unique and complex effects on CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents. The actions of THC and CBD at T-type calcium channels may be responsible for some of the non-CB receptor-mediated biological actions of phytocannabinoids. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum or donor bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were stably transfected with plasmids containing cDNA for CaV3.1 (GenBank™ accession number AF190860) (35Cribbs L.L. Gomora J.C. Daud A.N. Lee J.H. Perez-Reyes E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), CaV3.2 (GenBank™ accession number AF051946 (36Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Yang J. Satin J. Zhang Y. Daud A. Barclay J. Williamson M.P.

Lee J.-H. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The stably transfected cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, or donor bovine serum and 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Untransfected HEK293 cells did not express detectable ICa. Isolation of Sensory Neurons—Adult mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons were isolated in a protocol modified from that described previously (38Borgland S.L. Connor M. Christie M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 35-47Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Royal North Hospital Animal Care and Ethics Committee. Briefly, male C57Bl6 mice, at least 8 weeks old, were anesthetized with isofluorane and decapitated, and the trigeminal ganglia were removed. The ganglia were placed in a modified HEPES-buffered saline (mHBS) containing (in mm): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 MgCl2. 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH to 7.3 with NaOH, osmolarity = 330 ± 5 mosmol). The ganglia were minced with iridectomy scissors and incubated in mHBS containing 20 units of ml-1 papain for 25 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with mHBS containing 1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin and 1 mg ml-1 trypsin inhibitor (type II-O). The tissue was then washed with mHBS, and cells were released by gentle trituration through fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated onto tissue culture, dishes, and used within 8 h of isolation. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells expressing CaV3.1, CaV3.2, or CaV3.3 channels were recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp method (39Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Dishes were perfused with HEPES-buffered saline containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH to 7.3 with NaOH, osmolarity = 330 ± 5 mosmol). For recording CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents, cells were bathed in an external solution containing (in mm): 140 tetraethylammonium chloride, 2.5 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 1 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2 (pH to 7.3 with CsOH, osmolarity = 330 ± 5 mosmol). To minimize rundown of CaV3.3 currents, 5 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 5 mm BaCl2, and the pipette solution was modified as outlined below. Recordings were made with fire-polished borosilicate glass pipettes with resistance ranging from 2 to 3 megohms when filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): 130 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 MgATP (pH to 7.3 with CsOH, osmolarity = 285 ± 5 mosmol). For recording of CaV3.3 currents, 10 mm EGTA was replaced by 10 mm BAPTA, and the concentration of MgATP was reduced to 1 mm. A liquid junction potential of -6 mV was corrected for in all reported membrane potentials. Recordings were made with a HEKA EPC 10 amplifier with Patchmaster acquisition software (HEKA Elektronik) or an Axopatch 1D amplifier using pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were sampled at 3-5 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and recorded on hard disk for later analysis. Series resistance ranged from 3 to 10 megohms and was compensated by 80% in all experiments. All currents were leak-subtracted using a P/8 protocol. Cells were exposed to drugs via flow pipes positioned ∼200 μm from the cell. Concentration-response curves were generated by fitting the data to a logistic equation in GraphPad Prism 4. Activation curves were generated by fitting the whole-cell conductance data to a Boltzmann sigmoidal function, Y = 1/(1 + e((V0.5 - Vm)/slope)). Inactivation curves were generated by fitting data to a Boltzmann sigmoidal function, Y = 1-1/(1 + e((V0.5 - Vm)/slope)). T-type calcium channels were recorded from sensory neurons using the same internal solution as used for CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 recordings; however, the external tetraethylammonium solution contained 2.5 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+. Recordings were made from type 2 trigeminal ganglion neurons, identified as outlined previously (38Borgland S.L. Connor M. Christie M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 35-47Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Pharmacological Agents—THC was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Two different batches of THC were used and gave similar results. CBD was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, UK) and the National Measurement Institute of Australia. CBD from both sources gave similar results. AM251 was obtained from Tocris. Drugs were kept in concentrated stock solutions in ethanol (85-100 mm) and stored at -20 °C. Daily dilutions were made from these stocks; the final ethanol concentration in all solutions was 0.1%. Statistics—Data are reported as the mean ± S.E. of at least 6 independent experiments. Statistical significance for comparing the V0.5 values of activation and inactivation was determined using unpaired t tests and comparing values of V0.5 calculated for individual experiments. Changes in the time constant of inactivation and deactivation were assessed with a two-way ANOVA. Both THC and CBD inhibited CaV3 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. The effects of 1 μm THC and CBD on CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 channel currents evoked by a step from -86 to -26 mV are illustrated in Fig. 1. CBD (1 μm) inhibited CaV3.1 by an average of 54 ± 1%, CaV3.2 channels by 59 ± 4%, and CaV3.3 channels 12 ± 4%, whereas THC (1 μm) inhibited CaV3.1 channels by an average of 23 ± 4%, CaV3.2 channels by 32 ± 3%, and CaV3.3 channels by 9 ± 1%. A 5-min wash produced a reversal of CBD inhibition of CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 of 56 ± 5, 58 ± 9, and 63 ± 6%, respectively, and the effects of THC were reversed by 26 ± 3, 21 ± 9, and 29 ± 7%, respectively. The inhibition of CaV3 currents by THC and CBD was concentration-dependent, and currents were completely inhibited by 10-30 μm THC and CBD (Fig. 2, Table 1). The lower potency of THC and CBD on CaV3.3 was not due to the different recording conditions necessary to obtain stable CaV3.3 currents (see “Experimental Procedures”). When recorded using CaV3.3 solutions, THC (1 μm) inhibited CaV3.1 by 25 ± 3% (compared with 23 ± 4% in control), and CBD (1 μm) inhibited CaV3.1 by 53 ± 2% (compared with 54 ± 2% in control).FIGURE 2Concentration-response curve for the effect of THC (A) and CBD (B) on CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 channels. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of 6 cells and is presented as current remaining in the presence of drug compared with predrug current (I/Imax). One concentration of drug was applied per cell.

The degree to which the channels were inhibited was not different at the different frequencies. If cells were not stepped at all during a 3-min THC application, there was no inhibition of the CaV3.1 current evoked by the first step, although the characteristic effect of THC on channel deactivation (e.g. Fig. 1) was fully developed (see below). In contrast, CBD inhibited CaV3.1 channels at the same rate whether currents were evoked at 1 or 0.05 Hz (Fig. 3). After a 3-min application of CBD during which the cells were not depolarized, the inhibition of the CaV3.1 current evoked by the first step (54 ± 9%) was similar to cells that had been continuously stepped. To confirm that CBD was interacting with a rested state of the channel, the experiment was repeated from a holding potential of -106 mV, where all CaV3.1 channels should be closed rather than inactivated. In this experiment the inhibition of the first step evoked after 3 min in CBD was 41 ± 4% of control. The effects of THC and CBD were strongly dependent on the resting membrane potential of the cells. When cells were held at -70 mV, CaV3.1 currents elicited by a repeated step to -26 mV at 1 Hz were inhibited 69 ± 3% by THC (100 nm) and 76 ± 3% by CBD (100 nm) (Fig. 4). This compares with inhibition CaV3.1 currents elicited by a step to -26 mV of 8 ± 2% for THC (1 μm) and 35 ± 10% for CBD (1 μm) when cells were held at -126 mV. Both THC and CBD inhibited the native T-type ICa of mouse trigeminal ganglion sensory neurons (Fig. 5). T-type currents were elicited with a test step from -80 to -40 mV. This test potential was chosen to avoid contamination of the T-type currents by high voltage-activated ICa. THC (1 μm) inhibited the T-type ICa by 42 ± 2%, and the inhibition by CBD (1 μm) was 44 ± 5%. To rule out the involvement of CB1 receptors in the effects of the phytocannabinoids we also tested them in the presence of the CB1 antagonist AM251 (40Lan R. Liu Q. Fan P. Lin S. Fernando S.R. McCallion D. Pertwee R. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). AM251 (3 μm) inhibited the current evoked at -40 mV by 20 ± 2%; however, it did not diminish the effects of a subsequent co-application of THC (inhibition in AM251 was 42 ± 2%) or CBD (inhibition was 46 ± 2% in AM251). THC had no effect on the kinetics of channel inactivation from an open state or the kinetics of deactivation (Fig. 5). To further describe the mechanisms by which THC and CBD inhibit CaV3 channels, we examined the effects of the drugs on channel activation and steady state inactivation. In activation experiments cells were held at -106 mV and stepped to potentials from -86 mV to +54 mV. In the presence of THC (1 μm), the V0.5 values for CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 were shifted to significantly more negative potentials (Fig. 6, Table 2), whereas the activation of CaV3.3 was unaffected by THC (3 μm). At -106 mV, steady state channel inactivation is minimal for CaV3.1 even in the presence of THC (see below), so the shift in activation produced by THC resulted in an increase in the absolute current amplitude at potentials below about -50 mV (Fig. 6). By contrast, CBD did not affect the activation of CaV3 channels (Fig. 7, Table 2).TABLE 2Effects of phytocannabinoids on the parameters of steady state activation and inaction of Cav3 channelsDrugCavChange in V0.5ActivationInactivationmV1 μm THC3.1−7 ± 2**−8 ± 2**1 μm THC3.2−5 ± 2*−9 ± 2**3 μm THC3.3−1 ± 2−11 ± 3**1 μm CBD3.1−2 ± 2−17 ± 7**1 μm CBD3.2−4 ± 5−10 ± 5**3 μm CBD3.3−2 ± 2−12 ± 4**No drug3.1−1 ± 1−2 ± 3No drug3.21 ± 2−2 ± 2No drug3.3−2 ± 2−2 ± 2 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 7CBD affects the inactivation but not activation of CaV3 channels. The effects of CBD on activation and steady state inactivation of CaV3 currents are illustrated: i, CaV3.1; B, CaV3.2; C, CaV3.3. Cells were voltage-clamped at -106 mV. For steady state inactivation, cells were voltage-clamped at the test potential for 2 s before currents were evoked by a step to -26 mV. For steady state inactivation, data are presented as conductance normalized to conductance at -26 mV; for activation curves data are normalized to the maximum conductance. The data are fitted with a Boltzmann equation; the effects of CBD on activation and inactivation parameters are reported in Table 2. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of 6 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of THC and CBD on steady state inactivation were examined by holding cells at -106 mV, where inactivation is absent, and then applying a 2-s prepulse to potentials between -126 and -36 mV before a test step to -26 mV. In the presence of either THC or CBD, the potential at which half the channels were inactivated was shifted to significantly more negative potentials (Figs. 6 and 7, Table 1). An interaction of THC and CBD with inactivated state(s) of the CaV3 channels was further examined by determining the time course of recovery from open state inactivation at -106 mV in the presence and absence of the drugs (illustrated for CaV3.1 in Fig. 8). In these experiments cells were held at -106 mV, stepped to -26 mV for 70 ms (CaV3.1 and CaV3.2) or 350 ms (CaV3.3) to inactivate the channels, and then retested with 10-ms (CaV3.1 and CaV3.2)-or 50-ms (CaV3.3)-long steps at 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2560 ms after the end of the initial depolarization. THC and CBD significantly slowed the t½ for recovery from open state inactivation for each of the channels (Table 3).TABLE 3Effects of phytocannabinoids on recovery from open channel inactivation of Cav3 channelsDrugCaVRecovery from inactivationControlIn drugms1 μm THC3.163 ± 3121 ± 10**1 μm THC3.2224 ± 10430 ± 7**3 μm THC3.3211 ± 5410 ± 20**1 μm CBD3.169 ± 2167 ± 20**1 μm CBD3.2230 ± 10384 ± 58**3 μm CBD3.3184 ± 4436 ± 27** Open table in a new tab THC had significant effects on CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents that were not shared by CBD, as is clear from the traces illustrated in Fig. 1. Most notably, the deactivation of channel currents following repolarization was dramatically slowed in the presence of THC, and the inactivation of the channel from an open state was also slowed. THC did not affect the deactivation or open state inactivation of CaV3.3. We analyzed the effects of THC on CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 in more detail by examining activation, inactivation from open states, and deactivation of these channels in the presence of THC. THC (1 μm) did not affect the time to peak of CaV3.1 or CaV3.2 channels at any potential (data not shown). The effect of THC on the time constant of open state channel inactivation was studied using 300-ms-long test steps to potentials between -56 and +39 mV from a holding potential of -106 mV or -86 mV (Fig. 9). THC (1 μm) produced a significant slowing of channel inactivation (ANOVA, p < 0.01) in both channel types, from both holding potentials (Fig. 9), although the effects were more pronounced at the more depolarized test potentials. THC also produced a significant slowing of channel inactivation from an open state in the experiments in which cells were held at -70 mV and stepped to -26 mV (Fig. 4). The time constant for inactivation in control conditions was 11 ± 1 ms; in the presence of THC (100 nm) it was 14 ± 1.3 ms (n = 6, p = 0.03, paired t test). The time constant for activation of the currents under these conditions was unaffected by THC (2.1 ± 0.2 ms in control versus 2.1 ± 0.3 ms in THC). THC had a significant effect on the deactivation of CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 channels. Interestingly, unlike the THC inhibition of the peak current amplitude, the effect of THC in slowing deactivation of the tail currents was not use-dependent and appeared very rapidly upon THC superfusion (Fig. 10). When CaV3.1 currents were evoked every second, the increase in the time constant of channel decay produced by THC (3 μm) was close to maximal after about 5 s, a time when the inhibition of the peak current was only about 10%.

https://openalex.org/W2124072861,"The generation of new neurons and glia from a precursor stem cell appears to take place in the adult brain. However, new neurons generated in the dentate gyrus decline sharply with age and to an even greater extent in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we raise the question whether peripheral immune mechanisms can generate immunity to such deficits in neuronal repair. We demonstrate that in contrast to primarily innate immunity cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the adaptive immunity cytokine IFN-gamma enhances neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult mice and improves the spatial learning and memory performance of the animals. In older mice, the effect of IFN-gamma is more pronounced in both wild-type mice and mice with Alzheimer's-like disease and is associated with neuroprotection. In addition, IFN-gamma reverses the increase in oligodendrogenesis observed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that limited amounts of IFN-gamma in the brain shape the neuropoietic milieu to enhance neurogenesis, possibly representing the normal function of the immune system in controlling brain inflammation and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2028961849,"Recent experiments with rats suggest that they show episodic-like or what-where-when memory for a preferred food found on a radial maze. Although memory for when a salient event occurred suggests that rats can mentally travel in time to a moment in the past, an alternative possibility is that they remember how long ago the food was found. Three groups of rats were tested for memory of previously encountered food. The different groups could use only the cues of when, how long ago, or when + how long ago. Only the cue of how long ago food was encountered was used successfully. These results suggest that episodic-like memory in rats is qualitatively different from human episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W2064669963,"Oxidative stress appears to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Several different pathways have been identified for the production of oxidative stress conditions in nigral dopaminergic neurons, including a pathological accumulation of cytosolic dopamine with the subsequent production of toxic reactive oxygen species or the formation of highly reactive quinone species. On these premises, tyrosinase, a key copper enzyme known for its role in the synthesis of melanin in skin and hair, has been proposed to take part in the oxidative chemistry related to Parkinson disease. A study is herein presented of the in vitro reactivity of tyrosinase with α-synuclein, aimed at defining the molecular basis of their synergistic toxic effect. The results presented here indicate that, in conformity with the stringent specificity of tyrosinase, the exposed tyrosine side-chains are the reactive centers of α-synuclein. The reactivity of α-synuclein depends on whether it is free or membrane bound, and the chemical modifications on the tyrosinase-treated α-synuclein strongly influence its aggregation properties. On the basis of our results, we propose a cytotoxic model which includes a possible new toxic role for α-synuclein exacerbated by its direct chemical modification by tyrosinase.

It is a progressive disease characterized by the inability to initiate, execute, and control movements. Neuropathologically, PD is characterized by a striking loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by depletion of dopamine in the striatum, and by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Most forms of PD are sporadic, although, in some cases, familiar inheritance is observed. At present, at least 10 genetic loci have been associated to the disease (1Hardy J. Cai H. Cookson M.R. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although the etiopathogenesis of sporadic PD remains elusive, gene-related forms have provided some interesting evidence supporting a model of etiopathogenesis that involves mitochondrial dys-function, increase of oxidative stress, ubiquitin-proteasome system deregulation, and protein misfolding and aggregation (2Corti O. Hampe C. Darios F. Ibanez P. Ruberg M. Brice A. C. R. Biol. 2005; 328: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta contain significant amounts of dopamine (DA), it has been proposed that DA itself or one of its metabolites, especially dopamine-quinones (DAQs), may account for the selective vulnerability of these neurons. DAQs are synthesized by oxidation of the catechol ring of DA (3Bisaglia M. Mammi S. Bubacco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15597-15605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); if this occurs within the neuronal cytosol, DAQs may react with cytosolic components and, specifically, with cysteine residues (4Ito S. Kato T. Fujita K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Weihofen A. Schlossmacher M.G. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These residues are often part of the active site or play a pivotal role in function; as a consequence, covalent modifications of cysteine could lead to function impairment. DAQs have also been shown to increase mitochondrial damage and to inhibit the proteasome (6Berman S.B. Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 7Fornai F. Lenzi P. Gesi M. Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Ruffoli R. Soldani P. Ruggieri S. Alessandri M.G. Paparelli A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8955-8966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the cytoplasmic protein targets, DAQs have been found to react with α-synuclein (αSyn), a protein whose function is poorly understood, although its gene has been associated to familiar forms of PD (8Xu J. Kao S.Y. Lee F.J. Song W. Jin L.W. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). αSyn is a small cytosolic protein of 14 kDa, largely expressed in neurons (9Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It belongs to the natively unfolded protein family (10Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 11Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), but it is also able to bind to membranes adopting a helical conformation (12Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). In agreement with the ability to interact with membranes, increasing evidence suggests that a possible key function of the protein is the modulation of synaptic vesicle recycling, which involves DA storage and release at nerve terminals by maintenance of a subset of presynaptic vesicles in the “reserve” pools (13Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cabin D.E. Shimazu K. Murphy D. Cole N.B. Gottschalk W. McIlwain K.L. Orrison B. Chen A.

When the amount of cytosolic DA exceeds the physiological concentration, DA can be metabolized via monoamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase into the non-toxic metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (16Elsworth J.D. Roth R.H. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), or it can be sequestered into the lysosomes (17Sulzer D. Zecca L. Neurotox. Res. 2000; 1: 181-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it can auto-oxidize to form neuromelanin (NM). NM is a stable polymer responsible for the dark pigmentation of the substantia nigra and is composed of indole, catechol, and benzothiazine rings, also containing lipids, iron, and quinone-like radicals. It has been suggested that NM formation itself may be neuroprotective because of both its scavenging activity toward toxic DAQs and the sequestering of metal ions, including iron, copper, manganese, and cadmium (17Sulzer D.

Nevertheless, the dying neurons in PD have been observed to release NM in the cytoplasm and in the extracellular space, which results in the loss of the protective role of NM and, on the contrary, in the worsening of neurodegeneration (21Zecca L.

The process of NM formation is still debated, and there is no a general agreement on the fact that it derives simply from non-enzymatic oxidative chemistry. The auto-oxidation of catechols to quinones with the subsequent addition of thiol groups has been demonstrated in the brain (22Fornstedt B. Rosengren E. Carlsson A. Neuropharmacology. 1986; 25: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Alternative enzymatic pathways have been suggested for NM synthesis, including tyrosine hydroxylase (23Haavik J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), peroxidase (24Okun M.R. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1996; 28: 91-100PubMed Google Scholar), prostaglandin H synthase (25Mattammal M.B. Strong R. Lakshmi V.M. Chung H.D. Stephenson A.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), xanthine oxidase (27Foppoli C. Coccia R. Cini C. Rosei M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), lipoxygenase (28Rosei M.A. Blarzino C. Foppoli C. Mosca L. Coccia R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and monoamine oxidase (29Rabey J.M. Hefti F. J. Neural Transm. Park. Dis. Dement. Sect. 1990; 2: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enzyme tyrosinase (Ty), which is responsible for melanin synthesis within the melanosomes, has also been suggested to take part in the biosynthesis of NM. This suggestion was based on the observations that Ty mRNA was found in human substantia nigra (30Xu Y. Stokes A.H. Freeman W.M. Kumer S.C. Vogt B.A. Vrana K.E. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and that the Ty promoter is active throughout murine brain development, particularly in the substantia nigra of adult brain (31Tief K. Schmidt A. Beermann F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we demonstrated that Ty is expressed in the human brain (32Greggio E. Bergantino E. Carter D. Ahmad R. Costin G.E. Hearing V.J. Clarimon J. Singleton A. Eerola J. Hellstrom O. Tienari P.J. Miller D.W. Beilina A. Bubacco L. Cookson M.R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found that the mRNA coding for Ty and a detectable protein expression and enzymatic activity are present, although at low levels. Furthermore, in cell culture systems, expression of Ty increases neuronal susceptibility to oxidizing conditions, including dopamine itself. In agreement with our results, another group, using neuronal cell lines that constitutively express αSyn and tetracycline-regulated Ty, demonstrated that co-expression of human αSyn with Ty significantly exacerbated cell death and was associated with the formation of αSyn oligomers induced by quinone derivatives (33Hasegawa T. Matsuzaki-Kobayashi M. Takeda A. Sugeno N. Kikuchi A. Furukawa K. Perry G. Smith M.A. Itoyama Y. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With the purpose of better characterizing the interplay between Ty and αSyn, which can lead to enhanced oxidative conditions, we decided to focus our attention on the structural modifications that may be induced on αSyn by its reaction with Ty. Protein Preparation and Purification—Human αSyn cDNA was amplified by PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma-Genosys) containing NcoI and XhoI restriction sites and designed to obtain the entire sequence of the protein (αSyn140) or the region coding for the first 99 amino acids (αSyn99). After digestion with restriction enzymes, the two PCR products were subcloned into the NcoI-XhoI-linearized pET28b expression plasmid (Novagen) and introduced into an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. Overexpression of proteins was achieved by growing cells in LB medium (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. After boiling the cell homogenate for 15 min, the soluble fraction, containing αSyn140 or αSyn99, was loaded into a Resource Q or Resource S 6-ml column (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, and then eluted using a NaCl gradient. When working with αSyn140, the eluted fractions containing the protein were further purified with a size-exclusion Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the proteins were dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. Streptomyces antibioticus tyrosinase was expressed and purified in our laboratory according to published procedures (34Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B-Enzym. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reaction Mixtures—The samples used in all the spectroscopic analyses contained αSyn140 or αSyn99 to a final concentration of 100 μm in the presence of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and with the addition of the indicated quantity of S. antibioticus tyrosinase. Preparation of Small Unilamellar Vesicles—About 8 mg of a mixture of 50% dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and 50% dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol were used for the preparation of SUVs. In a typical preparation, the lipids were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (4:1), and the solution was evaporated under a nitrogen stream in a glass test tube. The dry lipid film was suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to give a stock solution with a final concentration of 30 mm and mixed for 1 h above the melting temperature. The hydration product was filtered through a large pore size (0.45 μm) filter and subsequently extruded at least 11 times through a 50 nm pore filter, following the manufacturer's protocol (Avanti Lipids). Limited Proteolysis of αSyn99 by Chymotrypsin—A limited proteolysis experiment of αSyn99 in the presence of high purity chymotrypsin (Calbiochem) was carried out at 25 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 μg of protein and 1.5 units of chymotrypsin in 5-50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was terminated by immediate boiling. The chymotryptic cleavage products of αSyn99 were analyzed by 15-20% gradient Tricine SDS-PAGE, containing 6 m urea, and stained by Coomassie R-250. Nitro Blue Tetrazolium/Glycinate Redox-cycling Staining—Quinoproteins and related compounds were detected by redox-cycling staining (35Paz M.A. Fluckiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein samples, separated by SDS-PAGE, were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 50 V for 90 min at 4 °C. Bound quinonoids were detected by immersing the membrane in a solution of 0.24 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 2 m potassium glycinate (pH 10.0) for 45 min in the dark resulting in a bluish purple stain of quinoprotein bands and no staining of other proteins. After washing with 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 10.0, unmodified proteins were stained with Ponceau S (0.1% in 5% acetic acid) resulting in a red stain, whereas the already stained quinoproteins remained bluish purple. UV-visible Spectroscopy and Kinetic Studies—Spectra were recorded on a diode-array Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer interfaced with a personal computer using the Chemstation Software for Windows®. Optical measurement were performed at 25 °C using HELLMA quartz cells with Suprasil® windows and an optical path length of 1 cm. Spectra were recorded every 30 s for the first 5 min; then the time between successive spectra was progressively increased by 25% at every measurement up to 4 h. The wavelength range was of 190-1100 nm. Fluorescence Experiments—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostatted cell compartment and interfaced with a personal computer using the FL-WinLab program for Windows®. Sample measurements were carried out using a HELLMA ultra-micro cell with Suprasil® windows and an optical path length of 10 × 2 mm. Fluorescence spectra were obtained at 25 °C, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 275 and 305 nm, respectively, with excitation bandwidth of 10 nm and emission bandwidth of 8 nm for αSyn140 and 13 nm for αSyn99. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded between 250 and 295 nm and 285 and 340 nm, respectively, at a scan rate of 100 nm/min. NMR Experiments—Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DMX600 spectrometer equipped with a gradient triple resonance probe. Samples were prepared as described above, but the protein was dissolved in 99.9% D2O. Clean-total correlation spectroscopy spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive manner using the TPPI method (36Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 37Griesinger C. Otting G. Wütrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) with a 100-ms mixing time. The experiments were carried out by collecting 128 increments, each one consisting of 32 scans and 2048 data points. The spectral width was 1796 Hz (1H-direct) and 6000 Hz (1H-indirect). The frequency offsets were 4500 Hz (1H-direct) and 2323.8 Hz (1H-indirect) The time domain data were multiplied by a 90° shifted sin function in all dimensions before Fourier transformation. Pseudo two-dimensional experiments were obtained by acquiring a series of 16 one-dimensional experiments, each one consisting of 512 scans and 8192 data points. The spectral width was 7183.9 Hz, and the frequency offset was 2824.8 Hz. CD Experiments—CD measurements were carried out on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter interfaced with a PC. The CD spectra were acquired and processed using the J-700 program for Windows®. All experiments were carried out at room temperature using HELLMA quartz cells with Suprasil® windows and an optical path length of 0.1 cm. All spectra were recorded in the 190-260 nm wavelength range, using a bandwidth of 2 nm and a time constant of 2 s at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. The signal-to-noise ratio was improved by accumulating at least four scans. All spectra are reported in terms of mean residue molar ellipticity [φ]R (deg cm2 dmol-1). Amyloid Fibril Formation—A 500-μl aliquot of αSyn140 (150 μm) was first incubated with Ty (in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with a molar ratio Ty/αSyn = 1/1000) at 25 °C for 4 h and then maintained at 37 °C with continuous shaking for the time span reported in the figures. An equal aliquot of αSyn140 without Ty was incubated under the same experimental conditions for comparison. The same procedure was used for a 150 μm aliquot of the N-terminal fragment αSyn99. AFM Imaging—Every 24 h, a 10-μl aliquot was collected from each experimental solution and blotted onto a freshly cleaved mica surface. Further dilutions (10-10,000 times) were occasionally performed to tune a good sample dispersion on the substrate surface. The droplet was allowed to dry, and then the sample was thoroughly rinsed with milliQ water and blown dry with a nitrogen flux. Images of these samples were recorded using a Multimode AFM (Veeco Metrology Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) operated in tapping mode under ambient conditions. The cantilevers employed were Pointprobes (Nanosensors, Neuchatel, Switzerland) with a nominal tip radius of curvature of <10 nm and a resonance frequency between 310 and 370 kHz. Images were analyzed using the free software WSxM (Nanotec Electronica) (38Horcas I. Fernández R. Gomez-Rodriguez J.M. Colchero J. Gomez-Herrero J. Baro A.M. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2007; 78: 013705Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). The size of the particles was measured using the section analysis tool, and it was estimated from their height relative to the surface, because this parameter is not influenced by the tip convolution effect. α-Synuclein as a Substrate for Tyrosinase—The unfolded state of αSyn in solution and the presence of four tyrosine residues in the sequence suggest the possibility that these residues may act as substrates for the monooxygenase and dioxygenase activity of Ty leading to quinones. The time evolution of the reaction was monitored by recording a series of UV-visible spectra of wild type (wt) αSyn in the presence of Ty in a molar ratio of 1000:1. The results are shown in Fig. 1 (see also supplemental Fig. S1A). The spectrum of αSyn140 before the reaction was subtracted from the spectra collected during the time course of the reaction. The time dependence of the spectral changes in Fig. 1, inset panel, shows at least four peaks with different absorbance maxima and characterized by different kinetic parameters. The time dependence of the optical spectra reveals first the decrease of the peak at ∼280 nm assigned to the starting tyrosine and phenylalanine, partially masked by the raising 294 nm feature. The first reaction product can only be observed as a broad feature at 400 nm in the first two spectra recorded within the first minute of reaction. This absorption band is compatible with the formation of the quinone by tyrosinase (3Bisaglia M. Mammi S. Bubacco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15597-15605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) that first acts as monooxygenase and then converts the diphenol to quinone. The second product generated is characterized by the two features, the first more intense at 294 and the second at 490 nm. These absorption bands are tentatively associated to the formation of aminochrome (3Bisaglia M. Mammi S. Bubacco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15597-15605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The last observable product is associated to the increase in absorbance observed at 354 nm that becomes observable after the 294 and 490 nm features begin to decrease. The key aspect of these results is that the observed reactivity appears to be strongly related to the unfolded state of αSyn, and it is independent on the sequence, because all four tyrosine residues seem to be reactive as will be discussed later in the NMR experiments. Furthermore, by using the protein bovine serum albumin as substrate, in a control experiment, no modification in the UV-visible spectrum was observed (data not shown). It is worth noting that bovine serum albumin has 21 tyrosine residues that, according to the crystal structure of human serum albumin (where 19 of these tyrosine are fully conserved), are all buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein. To unravel the complex reaction of wt αSyn with Ty, we chose to simplify the system by working with the deletion mutant αSyn99. This fragment contains only one tyrosine at position 39 and lacks the three other tyrosine residues (Tyr-125, Tyr-133, and Tyr-136) of the wt protein. In the presence of αSyn99 and Ty in a molar ratio of 1000:1, we observed similar spectroscopic features to those observed for the wt αSyn. The main differences are that the first quinone (400 nm) is probably too low in concentration to be detectable (supplemental Fig. S1B), and the absence of the 650 nm feature that is likely to derive from downstream reactions not feasible in the presence of only one tyrosine residue. As a control, we also tested the reaction in a sample of αSyn without Ty: no reaction was observed (data not shown) confirming that the spectral changes depend on the presence of Ty. α-Synuclein Residues Involved in the Reaction with Tyrosinase—To confirm that tyrosine residues really represent the substrates for Ty, we followed the changes in the fluorescence spectrum of αSyn140 and αSyn99 in the presence of Ty using the excitation (276 nm) and emission (305 nm) wavelengths characteristic of the tyrosine residue. During the time span of the experiment, the peak intensities progressively decreased (Fig. 2); this is compatible with the formation of non-fluorescent species, such as quinones. It is worth noting that the rate of decrease in fluorescence intensity is quite different for the wt protein and the αSyn99 fragment. A further indication of the involvement of tyrosine residues and of the formation of quinone species was obtained by combining a chymotrypsin proteolysis (known to be selective for aromatic residues) and a quinone-specific staining. The complex cleavage pattern expected for αSyn140 before and after the treatment with Ty prompted us to carry out these experiments on the smaller αSyn99 fragment. The expected cleavage pattern for αSyn99 is presented in Table 1. If the tyrosine residue at position 39 is modified by Ty, no recognition by protease can take place, and the cleavage pattern should be modified with respect to the untreated αSyn. The results of the SDS-PAGE separation of untreated and treated samples are shown in Fig. 3A. In the untreated sample (lanes 1 and 2), after digestion of αSyn99 with chymotrypsin (lanes 2), a new band appears corresponding to the expected fragment of 55 residues (αSyn40-94). The fragment of 35 residues is not visible on the gel most likely because of its small size. The sample treated with Ty (lanes 3 and 4) was not cleaved by chymotrypsin at position 39, and the only band that appears in the gel corresponds to αSyn99 protein cleaved at positions 4 and 94, αSyn5-94 (lane 4). It is worth noting that, after Ty treatment, modified αSyn99 also forms a small fraction of dimeric species. In Fig. 3B, the results obtained after transferring the samples to nitrocellulose and staining them with a quinoprotein-specific dye (35Paz M.A. Fluckiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are shown. Although the untreated αSyn99 is stained only by Ponceau red, αSyn99 treated with Ty becomes bluish purple, indicating the formation of tyrosine-derived quinones.TABLE 1Proteolytic pattern of chymotrypsin against αSyn99Sites of proteolytic cleavageFragment sequenceFragment lengthMolecular massDa4MDVF4510.639MKGLSKAKEGVVAAAEKTKQGVAEAAGKTKEGVLY353549.194VGSKTKEGVVHGVATVAEKTKEQVTNVGGAVVTGVTAVAQKTVEGAGSIAAATGF555268.999VKKDQ5616.7 Open table in a new tab The time evolution of the reaction products was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The experiments were carried out in D2O to simplify the analysis of the aromatic region of the spectrum. First, we assigned the peaks corresponding to the aromatic amino acids of αSyn by means of total correlation spectroscopy experiments (data not shown). Then, pseudo-two-dimensional NMR spectra of the reactions between αSyn140 or αSyn99 and Ty, in a substrate to enzyme molar ratio of 1000:1, were recorded for 4 h. The results obtained in the presence of the wt protein are shown in Fig. 4. After the addition of Ty, the intensities of the peaks corresponding to tyrosine residues were strongly reduced in agreement with the previously described decrease of the 282 nm absorbance peak. The fact that the reaction stopped a few minutes after the addition of the enzyme is probably due to the consumption of the oxygen dissolved in solution, which is necessary for Ty. Also the peaks corresponding to histidine 50, the only histidine present in the protein, disappeared indicating that this residue is somehow involved in a later stage of the reaction that may not involve tyrosinase. A possible reaction is represented by the nucleophilic attack of the imidazole ring of the histidine to a quinone ring of the modified tyrosines. Finally, in the spectra recorded after the addition of Ty, some degree of peak broadening can be observed with a general loss of resolution. This is probably due to the formation of dimeric species, most probably dityrosine or histidine-tyrosine cross-linked species. It is worth noting that the integration value of the phenylalanine peaks remains comparable before and after the addition of Ty. This observation confirms the specificity of the reaction observed and indicates that the decreased intensity of the tyrosine signals is not due to the relaxation effects of radicals potentially formed in solution. The results obtained with the fragment αSyn99 are in strong agreement with the previous ones, although the reaction with Ty was slower, as previously observed in our fluorescence experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, after ∼2 h tyrosine peaks completely disappeared while four new peaks in the region of 5.5-6.7 ppm appeared soon after the beginning of the reacti"
https://openalex.org/W2048984757,"Recent discovery of a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite suggests that the physical properties of Earth's lowermost mantle, called the D'' layer, may be different from those of the overlying mantle. We report that the electrical conductivity of (Mg0.9Fe0.1)SiO3 post-perovskite is >10(2) siemens per meter and does not vary greatly with temperature at the conditions of the D'' layer. A post-perovskite layer above the core-mantle boundary would, by electromagnetic coupling, enhance the exchange of angular momentum between the fluid core and the solid mantle, which can explain the observed changes in the length of a day on decadal time scales. Heterogeneity in the conductivity of the lowermost mantle is likely to depend on changes in chemistry of the boundary region, not fluctuations in temperature."

Members of the Actinomycetales family function in diverse and important roles to humans. On the positive side, Streptomyces species produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin (1Demain A.L. Appl. Microbiol.

An intimate knowledge of biochemistry common to all Actinomycetales allows their utilization as chemistry toolboxes while mitigating their pathogenic nature. For most organisms, maintenance of the appropriate reducing environment in the cell is required for proper cellular function, and this is usually achieved through the synthesis and cellular balance of low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione (5Hand C.E. Honek J.F. J. Nat. Prod. 2005; 68: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although glutathione is the predominate thiol in Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes, in the Actinomycetales, the major thiol is instead mycothiol (MSH), 2The abbreviations used are: MSH, mycothiol or 1-d-myoinosityl-2-(n-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside; CgMshA, C. glutamicum MshA; 1-l-Ins-1-P, 1-l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate; GlcNAc-Ins-P, 3-phospho-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-dexoy-α-d-glucopyranoside; GT, glycosyltransferase; Af_INO, inositol-1-phosphate synthase from A. fulgidus; man, mannose; TEA, triethanolamine; CAZy, Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes data base. 1-d-myoinosityl-2-(n-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside (6Newton G.L.

The synthetic pathway for MSH is believed to be conserved in all Actinomycetales species and requires at least four enzymes (MshA through MshD, Fig. 1).

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Erdman strain) mutants blocked in MSH production were not viable (16Sareen D. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Buchmeier N.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Of the four genes, mshA and mshC were found to be critical to the production of MSH and therefore viability of the organism (16Sareen D. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Buchmeier N.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Buchmeier N. Fahey R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 264: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interruption of mshB or mshD was either complemented by a promiscuous cellular activity or the product of interrupted synthesis acted as a poor analog of MSH (14Newton G.L. Ta P. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7309-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6245-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore MshA and MshC are important potential drug targets for treatment of tuberculosis and other Actinomycetales infections. The three-dimensional structures of both MshB (19Maynes J.T. Garen C.

Sci. 2003; 12: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have been determined; however, there have been no reports of structures for MshA or MshC. Glycosyltransferases (GTs), such as MshA, can be grouped based on sequence into what is currently a total of 90 distinct families (CAZy, Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes data base) (22Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V.V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 719Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). GTs can also be grouped based on structure, with most GTs determined to date having one of two folds, termed GT-A and GT-B (24Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently two new GT folds have been described for CAZY family GT51 (25Lovering A.L. de Castro L.H. Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Science. 2007; 315: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and GT66 (26Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Finally GTs can be termed “retaining” or “inverting” based on the configuration of the sugar nucleotide-derived carbohydrate in the final product. There is no absolute correlation between the fold (GT-A or GT-B) and the stereochemical outcome of the reaction as examples of both inverting and retaining GTs have been found in both families; however, all members of a CAZy family are expected to have the same fold (23Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 27Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity MshA is grouped into CAZy family GT4, all of which have been found to be retaining glycosyltransferases and have the GT-B fold. GT4 is the second largest CAZy data base family (6563 CAZY entries at the time of this writing) and have a diverse set of donor and acceptor molecules. Only recently a limited number of GT4 family members have been structural characterized, including WaaG, which transfers glucose from UDP-glucose onto l-glycero-d-mannoheptose II; AviGT4, which is involved in avilamycin A biosynthesis; and PimA, a phosphatidylinositol mannosyltransferase (28Martinez-Fleites C.

Here we present the structure of unliganded MshA from Cornybacterium glutamicum and its complex with UDP and 1-l-Ins-1-P. Enzymatic studies demonstrate that UDP-GlcNAc and 1-l-Ins-1-P are substrates for CgMshA, and that the product is GlcNAc-Ins-P, as was previously determined for MshA from crude lysates of Mycobacterium smegmatis (7Newton G.L. Ta P. Bzymek K.P. Fahey R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33910-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies indicate a sequential mechanism with UDP-GlcNAc almost certainly binding first followed by 1-l-Ins-1-P. The structural and kinetic data are most consistent with a mechanism involving the β-phosphoryl group of the substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, acting as the general base and not a mechanism involving a covalent enzyme-N-acetylglucosamine intermediate. The crystal structure highlights residues involved in binding and catalysis and serves as a starting point for inhibitor design. Cloning—The MshA gene (residues 1–418) was amplified from C. glutamicum genomic DNA (ATCC 13032) using PCR (primers 5-TTTTTCATATGCGCGTAGCTATGATTTCC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCTCGAGTTAGCCGTGATGCGTTTCAC-3′) and blunt-end-cloned into pCR-BLUNT (Invitrogen). An internal Nde1 site was removed using PCR mutagenesis and primers containing the desired alteration (primers, 5′-CCGGATACCTATAGGCAcATGGCAGAGGAACTGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCAGTTCCTCTGCCATgTGCCTATAGGTATCCGG-3′). The CgMshA gene was subcloned into the Nde1 and HindIII sites of pET28a(+) utilizing a HindIII site of the pCR-BLUNT vector as the downstream restriction site. The CgMshA gene was also cloned into the Nde1 and XhoI sites of pET29a(+) utilizing PCR amplification and the CgMshA: pET28a(+) vector as a template (primers 5′-TTTTTCATATGCGCGTAGCTATGATTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATCCCGCTCTCGAGGCCGTGATGCGTTTCACC-3′). Expression—Overexpression vectors containing the CgMshA gene were transformed into Rosetta2 cells (Invitrogen) and grown in 8-ml overnight cultures of MDG media (30Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). These cultures were then made 10% in glycerol and stored at -80 °C in 2-ml aliquots. A 100-ml starter culture of MDG media was inoculated with one 2-ml storage stock and grown at 37 °C to late-log phase. This was used to inoculate 4 liters of ZYP5052 autoinduction media in six 2-liter baffled flasks (30Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 23 °C with 300 rpm shaking and were harvested at saturation (36–48 h, A600 > 12). All growth media contained 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 200 μg/ml kanamycin. Purification—Frozen cell paste was resuspended in three times its volume of buffer A (100 mm TEA, pH 7.8, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 15 mm imidazole), and lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min the cell slurry was disrupted by sonication and was spun at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-Sepharose HP (GE-Healthcare) column equilibrated against buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 15–300 mm imidazole over 10 column volumes. Fractions with greater than 20% of the peak activity were pooled, made 1 m in (NH4)2SO4, and applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose HP (GE-Healthcare) column equilibrated against buffer B (20 mm TEA, pH 7.8, 1 m (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Bound proteins were separated with a 1 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 gradient over 10 column volumes with properly folded CgMshA eluting between 500 and 300 mm (NH4)2SO4. Pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) to a concentration of 20–40 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization and Phasing—Crystallization of CgMshA was by vapor diffusion under silicon oil (Fisher) utilizing 96-well round bottom assay plates stored open to room humidity at 18 °C. Crystals of APO CgMshA with a hexagonal bipyramidal morphology were obtained from drops containing 2 μl of protein (CgMshA:pET28a(+), 15 mg/ml, 400 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 2 μl of precipitant (20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm LiSO4). Crystals were soaked in a stabilization solution of 40% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm LiSO4, prior to vitrification by plunging in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on an MSC R-AXIS-IV++ image plate detector using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R x-ray generator and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA (31Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 32Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P31 with approximate cell dimensions of a = b = 79.7 Å, and c = 148.4 Å. There is a molecular dimer per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 59%. The structure of APO CgMshA was determined by SIRAS using a single mercury derivitized crystal, which was prepared by soaking a crystal for 2 h in the stabilization solution with the addition of saturated p-chloromercuribenzoate. Heavy atom positions and initial phases were determined using PHENIX (33Adams P.D. Gopal K. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Pai R.K. Read R.J. Romo T.D. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Storoni L.C. Terwilliger T.C. J. Synchrotron Rad. 2004; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The solvent flattened SIRAS map was of sufficient quality for ARP/WARP (34Perrakis A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) to autobuild a majority of the structure. Iterative rounds of modeling building within the molecular graphics program COOT (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) followed by refinement against the data using REFMAC (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) were used to build the remainder of the structure. The final rounds included TLS refinement. A second crystal form of CgMshA was obtained in drops that contained 2 μl of protein (CgMshA:pET29a(+), 40 mg/ml, 400 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc) combined with 2 μl of precipitant (0.8 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5). This crystal form was cryoprotected by soaking in 1.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 10% glycerol, and 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 prior to vitrification by plunging in liquid nitrogen. For the UDP·1-l-Ins-1-P dataset the (NH4)2SO4 was replaced with 50 mm 1-l-Ins-1-P, and the crystals were soaked for 1 h. Data were collected at Brookhaven National Laboratories at beamline X25 and processed using MOSFLM (32Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and SCALA (31Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be I422 with approximate cell dimensions of a = b = 223.9 Å, and c = 125.0 Å. This crystal form has two molecules per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 71.5%. Phasing of the UDP dataset utilized the molecular replacement program AMORE (37Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and the APO form of CgMshA as the model. Searches with the complete APO structure and or either of the N- or C-terminal domains did not produce a convincing molecular replacement solution. However, utilizing a dimerized N-terminal domain produced two solutions that were significantly above other solutions despite (or possibly because of) the fact that both of the molecular dimers in this crystal form are acted upon by crystallographic symmetry. Molecular replacement searches for the missing C-terminal domain after placement of the N-terminal domains were unsuccessful. The recently determined structure of PimA (PDB ID: 2GEJ) was used as a guide for the structure of a closed GT-B:GT-4 glycosyltransferase family member (29Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D. Gicquel B. Mikusova K. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20705-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Utilizing electron density maps phased with only the two placed N-terminal domains, and the PimA structure as a guide, there was enough secondary structure visible in a skeletonized map to manually place both C-terminal domains, which were then successfully refined into their correct positions with rigid body refinement. Molecular constraints for UDP and 1-l-Ins-1-P were calculated using the PRODRG server (38Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). Refinement of this crystal form utilized REFMAC with the final rounds incorporating TLS refinement (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). DLS measurements were performed with a 4 mg/ml CgMshA solution in 250 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm TEA, pH 7.8, at 25 °C on a DynaPro MS/X instrument (Protein Solutions). Data collection and deconvolution were performed using the DYMAMICS 6.2.05 software (Protein Solutions). Purified CgMshA was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Superose-12 column (10/300, Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm TEA, pH 7.8, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol. The following proteins were used as molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; bovine γ-globulin, 158 kDa; chicken albumin, 44 kDa; equine myoglobin, 17.0 kDa; and vitamin B12, 1.3 kDa. Production of 1-l-Ins-1-P—The gene for inositol-1-phosphate synthase from the hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af_INO) was cloned as described by a previous group (39Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Af_INO gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and ligated into pET23a(+) vector utilizing Nde1 and HindIII restriction sites. The resultant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3/pLysS, and the cells were grown and protein was expressed by autoinduction in an identical fashion as CgMshA (see above), except that the antibiotic was ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and the cells were grown at 37 °C for 12–18 h. Cells were sonicated in three times the weight/volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5), and spun at 25,000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant, contained in a steel vessel, was heated in an 80 °C water bath, with constant stirring for 5 min. The vessel was then placed on ice and cooled to 4 °C as quickly as possible by constant stirring. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g). The supernatant was applied to a 2.6 × 12 cm Poros-HQ anion exchange (POROS MEDIA) column, equilibrated with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0 to 0.25 m (NH4)2SO4 gradient over ten column volumes. Fractions, which related to peak concentrations of Af_INO, by SDS gels, were pooled, made 1 m in (NH4)2SO4 and applied to a 2.6 × 12 cm phenyl-Sepharose (GE-Healthcare) hydrophobic exchange column equilibrated with buffer A plus 1 m (NH4)2SO4. Bound proteins were eluted with a 1.0–0 m (NH4)2SO4 gradient in buffer A over ten column volumes, pooled based on purity by SDS gels, and dialyzed overnight in buffer A. Purified Af_INO was concentrated to 10 mg/ml by Amicon ultrafiltration, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. 1-l-Ins-1-P was synthesized using Af_INO and glucose 6-phosphate. The starting solution was 125 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.625 mm ZnCl2, 1.25 mm NAD+, and 3.6 mg of Af_INO in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (NH4OH). The reaction was held at 85 °C with a heat block, and every 45 min the NAD was increased by 0.5 mm and another 2 mg of Af_INO was added. The progress of the reaction was monitored utilizing the CgMshA/pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay with substoichiometric 1-l-Ins-1-P (potential from reaction, 0.20 mm) to NADH (0.25 mm). The completed reaction (∼2–3 h) was diluted to 100 mm (taking into account additions during the reaction) and stored at -80 °C to be used directly in assays for MshA activity. Measurement of Enzymatic Activity—The production of UDP was measured using a coupled assay system and monitoring the reaction at 340 nm. Standard conditions were 30 nm enzyme, 50 mm TEA, pH 7.8, 200 μm NADH, 500 μm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 units of pyruvate kinase (ammonium sulfate suspension), and 55 units of lactate dehydrogenase (ammonium sulfate suspension) in a 1-ml reaction at 25 °C. Except for the enzyme, all components were mixed in the cuvette and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. The amount of coupling enzymes was sufficient to not limit the rate of reaction and was required to minimize a lag in the assays. Data Analysis—To determine the basic kinetic parameters for each substrate, initial velocity plots at saturating concentrations of one substrate were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) where Vmax is the maximal velocity, A is the concentration of the varied substrate, and Ka is the Michaelis constant for substrate A. When both substrates were varied, intersecting initial velocity plots were fit to Equation 2. V=Vmax[A]Ka+[A]Eq. 1 V=Vmax[A][B]KiaKb+Kb[A]+Ka[B]+[A][B]Eq. 2 Data described with single variable equations were analyzed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Data described using equations with multiple independent variables were analyzed using GraFit (Erithacus Software). Isolation of GlcNAc-inositol 3-Phosphate—CgMshA (80 μg) was added to a 1-ml solution containing 100 mm TEA, pH 7.8, 100 mm 1-l-Ins-1-P, and 100 mm UDP-GlcNAc. The production of UDP was monitored using a high-performance liquid chromatography-based assay and a UV detector (260 nm). The separation of compounds was accomplished using a 1-ml Mono Q ion-exchange column (GE-Healthcare) with the following programmed gradient: 0–5 min (0% B), 20 min (35% B), 25–30 min (100% B), 33 min (0%B) where Buffer A is 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and Buffer B is 600 mm ammonium bicarbonate and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Retention times for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP were 12 and 20 min, respectively. When the reaction had run to completion (∼5 h), the entire reaction was injected and fractionated using the above high-performance liquid chromatography method. Fractions (1 ml) were treated with alkaline phosphatase and then assayed for inorganic phosphate using a malachite green phosphate assay kit (Bioassay Systems). Fractions 9–12 were found to contain phosphate but did not correlate to a peak at 260 nm. These fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized white powder was analyzed by 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and by mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry yielded a value of m/z 462.36 (M-H)-1 (C14H25NO14P-1 calculated 462.10). Expression and Purification—Initial screens of full-length clones of MshA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coeliclor, Nocardia farcina, and C. glutamicum as N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged constructs all resulted in high overexpression, but only the MshA from C. glutamicum (CgMshA) resulted in large amounts of soluble protein. Typically, yields of soluble, active CgMshA using autoinduction media were 200 mg/liter. After nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, purification on Phenyl Sepharose hydrophobic exchange media was critical to separating active, monodisperse protein from inactive, polydisperse protein. Ammonium sulfate (>100 mm) was required to maintain activity, whereas protein kept in a minimal ionic strength buffer was subject to degradation and loss of activity. The initial construct of MshA utilized an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable 6× His tag to facilitate purification. Attempts at thrombin cleavage resulted in nonspecific degradation, so the N-terminal tag was not removed. The N-terminally tagged protein was utilized for the initial structure determination of unliganded MshA. A second C-terminally tagged MshA was used to determine the structure of MshA in complex with UDP and 1-l-Ins-1-P. Enzymatic Characterization—From the initial velocity plots for 1-l-Ins-1-P and UDP-GlcNAc, both substrates exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and no curvature was seen in the Lineweaver-Burk linear replots (supplemental Fig. S1). The kinetic parameters for each substrate were determined from fits of the data to Equation 1. A value of 12.5 ± 0.2 s-1 was determined for the kcat, and the Michaelis constants for 1-l-Ins-1-P and UDP-GlcNAc were 240 ± 10 and 210 ± 20 μm, respectively. The Km values are consistent with those determined previously for MshA from Mycobacterium smegmatis crude lysates (7Newton G.L. Ta P. Bzymek K.P. Fahey R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33910-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether MshA proceeds through a sequential or ping-pong mechanism, an initial velocity plot was made by varying both substrates. The plot shows intersecting lines, and the data fit well to Equation 2, consistent with a sequential mechanism (supplemental Fig. S2). The pseudo-disaccharide phosphate monoester product of the reaction was purified using ion-exchange chromatography. 31P and 1H NMR spectroscopy of the product was consistent with GlcNAc-Ins-P (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). A coupling constant of 3.3 Hz was determined for the anomeric proton confirming that the product retains the alpha sugar configuration (inset, supplemental Fig. S4). GT-B Fold Monomer Structure—The structure of unliganded CgMshA (APO form) was determined by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering utilizing a CuKα home source and a mercury derivative to 2.1-Å resolution (Table 1). The structure of CgMshA has two domains each exhibiting the β/α/β Rossmann-fold type typical of the GT-B fold superfamily (Fig. 2). The N-terminal domain has an 8-stranded β-sheet (β8, β7, β6, β5, β1, β2, β4, and β3) that is bounded by six α-helices (α1–α5 and α14). The C-terminal d"

In eukaryotic sulfatases, an active site cysteine residue is oxidized to the aldehyde-containing Cα-formylglycine residue by the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). The machinery responsible for sulfatase activation is poorly understood in prokaryotes. Here we describe the identification of a prokaryotic FGE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we solved the crystal structure of the Streptomyces coelicolor FGE homolog to 2.1Å resolution. The prokaryotic homolog exhibits remarkable structural similarity to human FGE, including the position of catalytic cysteine residues. Both biochemical and structural data indicate the presence of an oxidized cysteine modification in the active site that may be relevant to catalysis. In addition, we generated a mutant M. tuberculosis strain lacking FGE. Although global sulfatase activity was reduced in the mutant, a significant amount of residual sulfatase activity suggests the presence of FGE-independent sulfatases in this organism.

Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The FGly residue is located within a ∼13-residue consensus sequence termed the sulfatase motif (4Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that defines this family of enzymes and is highly conserved throughout all domains of life (Fig. 1b). Although FGly is formed from cysteine residues in eukaryotic sulfatases, either cysteine (within the core motif CX[P/A]XR) or serine (SXPXR) can be oxidized to FGly in prokaryotic type I sulfatases. The co- or post-translational machineries necessary for these respective modifications appear to be different; FGE is able to activate CXPXR-type sulfatases (5Cosma M.P. Pepe S. Annunziata I.

Some prokaryotes, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have only CXPXR-type sulfatases (10Mougous J.D. Green R.E. Williams S.J. Brenner S.E. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas other species have only SXPXR-type sulfatases or a combination of type I sulfatases (11Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Some prokaryotes also contain FGly-independent sulfatases. These sulfatases function by distinct enzymatic mechanisms and are divided into two categories, Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase sulfatases (type II sulfatases) and metallo-β-lactamase sulfatases (type III sulfatases) (12Muller I.

Unlike type I sulfatases, which share a high degree of sequence similarity, type II and III sulfatases have highly divergent sequences, complicating the discovery of these proteins by genomic search algorithms. In higher eukaryotes, sulfatases are involved in a variety of essential tasks, including extracellular matrix remodeling and steroid titer regulation (1Hanson S.R. Best M.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 5736-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In humans, FGE deficiency abolishes the activity of all 17 human sulfatases, leading to the fatal disorder multiple sulfatase deficiency (6Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A.

Prokaryotic sulfatases have not been thoroughly investigated but are generally assumed to be used for sulfate scavenging (16Kertesz M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 135-175PubMed Google Scholar). The acquisition and allocation of sulfur-containing compounds, including inorganic sulfate, are critical for many prokaryotes; the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist within human macrophages, in particular, is thought to be dependent on several sulfur-containing molecules such as mycothiol and sulfolipid-1 (17Sareen D. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Buchmeier N.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Zhang L. Goren M.B. Holzer T.J. Andersen B.R.

Several elegant biochemical and crystallographic studies on human FGE have analyzed the novel thiol-to-aldehyde oxidation catalyzed by this enzyme (6Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J.

In this study, we have functionally identified the first prokaryotic FGE from M. tuberculosis and created an FGE-deficient strain in order to probe the function of type I sulfatases in this human pathogen. Additionally, we present the first structural and biochemical data of a prokaryotic FGE to further our understanding of the unique mechanism of this enzyme. Preparation of Protein Expression Vectors—Supplemental Table S1 lists the oligonucleotides used in this study. The gene encoding M. tuberculosis FGE (Rv0712, encoding residues 2–299) was amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA and cloned into pET14b (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The gene encoding Streptomyces coelicolor FGE (SCO7548, encoding residues 2–314) was amplified from S. coelicolor A3(2) genomic DNA and cloned into pET151/d-TOPO (Invitrogen). Open reading frames Rv2407 (encoding residues 2–273), Rv3406 (encoding residues 2–295), and Rv3762c (encoding residues 2–626) were amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA. Rv2407 was ligated into pMAL-C2X (New England Biolabs) using BamHI and PstI restriction sites, and both Rv3406 and Rv3762c were ligated into pET28b (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Rv0484c, Rv0576, Rv1730c, Rv1980c, Rv2837c, Rv3137, Rv3205c, and Rv3849 were all amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA and cloned into pET151/D-TOPO. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the fidelity of each gene product. Protein-encoding plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutations in M. tuberculosis FGE and S. coelicolor FGE were produced with QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pET14b M. tuberculosis FGE or pET151 S. coelicolor FGE plasmids and the appropriate oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1) in the mutagenesis reactions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression as described below. Protein Expression and Purification—Clonal populations of BL21(DE3) cells harboring a His6-tagged protein-encoding plasmid were incubated in Luria Bertani medium with ampicillin or kanamycin with shaking at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5, at which time the temperature was lowered to 18 °C and 250 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. After 12–16 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm methionine, pH 7.5) per liter of culture and lysed by sonication. Cell lysate was treated with DNase I (10 μgml–1), cleared by centrifugation, and applied to a 1-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 35 mm imidazole, and His6-tagged protein was eluted using lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated to <2 ml and further purified on a Sephadex 16/60 S300 column (GE Healthcare) using lysis buffer without imidazole. Purified recombinant protein was subsequently concentrated to ∼20 mg ml–1. The identity and purity of M. tuberculosis and S. coelicolor FGE were assessed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Bruker/Agilent Esquire). Rv2407 was not soluble in His6-tagged form and was alternatively fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). Growth and lysis conditions for MBP-Rv2407-producing cells were the same as above except with the absence of imidazole in the lysis buffer. Cleared lysate was applied to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) in lysis buffer, washed in additional lysis buffer, and MBP-Rv2407 was eluted in lysis buffer with 10 mm maltose and subsequently concentrated. Maltose-binding protein was cleaved and removed from Rv2407 using Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) and amylose resin. S. coelicolor FGE Crystallization—Attempts to crystallize FGE homologs from M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium avium were not successful because of protein instability. S. coelicolor FGE was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.5. Crystals of His6-tagged S. coelicolor FGE were obtained using vapor diffusion by mixing 1 μl of dialyzed protein with 1 μl of crystallization solution (100 mm Tris, 2.4 m ammonium formate, 0.3% β-octylglucoside, 3.2% 2-butanol, pH 8.0) at room temperature. Crystals grew over a period of 2 weeks and were subsequently transferred to cryoprotectant consisting of crystallization solution with 20% glycerol prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. S. coelicolor FGE Structure Determination—Data were collected at beamline 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source using an ADSC Quantum-Q315 CCD detector. Crystal quality was extremely variable, and only one crystal of more than 100 screened diffracted to better than 3.0 Å resolution. Diffraction data from this crystal were reduced and scaled to 2.1 Å resolution using HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar); because of technical difficulties encountered with collection, data could only be collected to 83% overall completeness (Table 1). Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the human FGE (Protein Data Bank entry 1Y1E) as a search model in PHASER (22Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contained five S. coelicolor FGE monomers in space group P3121. Initial stages of model refinement included cycles of simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics and restrained B-factor refinement using CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), followed by manual model rebuilding using O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Model building was aided by using bias-reduced prime-and-switch phased maps (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2144-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Because of small structural differences observed between monomers in the asymmetric unit, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used. The final cycles of refinement were carried out with twin lattice symmetry (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) restraints as implemented in REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using five twin lattice symmetry groups (corresponding to each FGE monomer in the asymmetric unit). Water molecules were added with ARP/WARP (28Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final model contained residues 18–305 in monomer A, residues 19–306 in monomer B, residues 20–306 in monomer C, residues 19–305 in monomer D, and residues 19–307 in monomer E. Final Rwork and Rfree values were 19.5 and 23.3%, respectively. Data collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab FGE Activity Assay—Wild type and mutant FGE from M. tuberculosis and S. coelicolor were purified as described above. The peptide substrate was synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis methods and consisted of the 13-residue sequence LCSPSRGSLFTGR, a sulfatase consensus motif. The N terminus was acetylated, the C terminus was amidated, and the sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Assay conditions were similar to those reported previously by Dierks et al. (6Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) in studies of human FGE. Anaerobic experiments were performed in the same manner except solutions were made anaerobic using an oxygen-scavenged gas manifold and reactions were started by mixing enzyme with substrate in an anaerobic glovebox. EDTA was added to the appropriate reactions at a concentration of 100 mm. Confirmation of FGly formation was performed by incubating 1 μl of desalted product with 1 μl of 5 mm biotin hydrazide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with matrix solution (10 mg ml–1 α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid with 2 mm ammonium citrate) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE Pro). Metal Detection—A multielement standard solution was prepared by appropriate dilution of inductively coupled plasma standards of calcium, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, and zinc (Sigma). Metal content of M. tuberculosis and S. coelicolor FGE was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a PerkinElmer Optima 3000 DV. Absence of iron, copper, and zinc in S. coelicolor FGE was confirmed at beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source. Absorption edges of these metals were examined using a double crystal monochromator and the x-ray fluorescence detector of the beamline. M. tuberculosis FGE-deficient Strain Production—An unmarked, in-frame genetic deletion of the FGE-encoding open reading frame Rv0712 was created in M. tuberculosis H37Rv using allelic replacement (29Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A 2-kb region upstream of Rv0712 was amplified and inserted into the mycobacterial delivery vector p2NILX between HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. p2NILX is derived from pNIL (29Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and modified with the addition of an XbaI restriction site between KpnI and NotI restriction sites. A 2-kb region downstream of Rv0712 was amplified and inserted into p2NILX between XbaI and PacI restriction sites. Selection markers lacZ and sacB were digested from pGOAL17 and ligated into p2NILX using the PacI restriction site. The completed delivery vector was treated with UV light (120 mJ cm–2) and electroporated into electrocompetent M. tuberculosis H37Rv as described previously (30Hatfull, G. F., and Jacobs, W. R., Jr. (eds) (2000) Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria, pp. 313–320, ASM Press, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar). Selection of the mutant was performed as described previously (29Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and genotype was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). The complemented strain was produced by transforming the Δfge strain with the integrating vector pMV306.kan containing the entire Rv0712 open reading frame under the control of the glutamine synthase promoter. Sulfatase/phosphatase Assay—M. tuberculosis H37Rv strains were grown in 7H9 medium supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C until A600 = 1.0. Cells were lysed by mechanical disruption using 0.1 mm zirconia beads (FastPrep; MP Biomedicals), and the crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. Cleared lysate samples were normalized for total protein concentration (Bio-Rad AC/DC protein assay kit), and 50 μgof lysate protein was added to buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 100 μm MgCl2, 100 μm MnCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, pH 7.5), protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor mixture set III; EMD Bioscience), and 8 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4MUS; Sigma). Limpet sulfatase (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 μgml–1 as a positive control. Escherichia coli lysate (strain TOP10; Invitrogen) was prepared in the same manner as M. tuberculosis lysate, and 50 μg of lysate protein was used per reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and stopped by adding 4 volumes of 0.5 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 10.5. Sulfatase activity was measured using a fluorimeter (Gemini XL; Molecular Devices) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. Lysate extracts exhibited steady state behavior. Sulfatase/phosphatase inhibitors were used according to the manufacturer's instructions and included microcystin, cantharidin, p-bromotetramisole, sodium vanadate, sodium molybdate, sodium tartrate, and imidazole (Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixtures 1 and 2; Sigma). Sulfatase activity of recombinant Rv2407, Rv3406, and Rv3762c was determined using the same conditions mentioned above, with the addition of 1 mm α-ketoglutarate, 200 μm ascorbate, and 100 μm FeCl2 to the buffer. Phosphatase activity was monitored as described above except with the substitution of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate for 4MUS. NBD Labeling—His6-tagged S. coelicolor FGE was treated with 1:50 (w/w) tobacco etch virus protease to remove the N-terminal His6 tag before 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) labeling and mass spectrometric analyses. S. coelicolor FGE (45 μm) was incubated in buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) with 1 mm NBD (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature (31Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The sample was desalted by C18 reversed phase chromatography, and protein-NBD adducts were detected by mass spectrometry (Bruker/Agilent Esquire). Mapping of NBD adducts was performed by digesting NBD-reacted S. coelicolor FGE with 1:50 (w/w) trypsin, desalting by C18 reversed phase chromatography, and analyzing the resulting peptide fragments using electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (Bruker 9.4T Apex III). Using BLAST analysis, we identified M. tuberculosis H37Rv's open reading frame Rv0712 to be >30% identical to the human FGE SUMF1 (5Cosma M.P. Pepe S. Annunziata I. Newbold R.F. Grompe M. Parenti G. Ballabio A. Cell. 2003; 113: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recombinant Rv0712 was able to modify a synthetic peptide containing the sulfatase motif as determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2a). The presence of FGly within the substrate was confirmed by treating the modified peptide with biotin hydrazide, which formed a covalent adduct with the peptide via hydrazone formation (Fig. 2b). Together these data implicate Rv0712 as the FGE of M. tuberculosis. Similar to the human genome, the M. tuberculosis genome appears to encode only one functional copy of FGE. Therefore, we expected that the disruption of Rv0712 in M. tuberculosis would produce a sulfatase-deficient strain. Rv0712 was disrupted in M. tuberculosis H37Rv using homologous recombination and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Δfge M. tuberculosis was viable and demonstrated no obvious growth defects in vitro. Sulfatase activity of the Δfge strain was compared with that of wild-type (WT) H37Rv and to the Δfge mutant into which FGE expression was restored by complementation. Crude lysates were generated from these three M. tuberculosis strains, and global sulfatase activity was determined using the general sulfatase substrate 4MUS. The Δfge strain exhibited a substantial, yet surprisingly incomplete, loss of sulfatase activity (Fig. 2c). We considered the possibility that the residual sulfatase activity resulted from phosphatases hydrolyzing 4MUS (32O'Brien P.J. Herschlag D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12369-12370Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, when sulfatase activity was monitored in the presence of a mixture of broad spectrum sulfatase/phosphatase inhibitors, Δfge was not affected (Fig. 2c). Indeed, activity in lysates from WT and complemented Δfge was reduced by ∼40% in the presence of the inhibitor mixture, matching the sulfatase activity of Δfge in the absence of inhibitors. Given that the applied inhibitors are known to inhibit FGE-dependent sulfatases (33Stankiewicz P.J. Gresser M.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), these data suggest that M. tuberculosis possesses FGE-independent sulfatases. To verify further that promiscuous phosphatases were not responsible for the residual sulfatase activity, we monitored phosphatase activity of crude lysates from each strain using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate. All three strains exhibited the same level of phosphatase activity in the absence of inhibitors, and activity was abolished in all strains in the presence of the inhibitors (Fig. 2d). These data further indicate that phosphatases are not accountable for the residual 4MUS hydrolysis activity observed in the Δfge strain and that FGE-dependent sulfatases are responsible for ∼40% of the total 4MUS hydrolysis activity in M. tuberculosis lysate. We next searched the M. tuberculosis genome for potential sources of FGE-independent sulfatase activity. The majority of known or putative prokaryotic sulfatases are of the type I class. However, some prokaryotes also have FGly-independent sulfatases that operate via different enzymatic mechanisms; these enzymes may not be sensitive to broad spectrum sulfatase inhibitors. Based on sequence similarity with known FGly-independent sulfatases from other prokaryotes, M. tuberculosis has three putative FGly-independent sulfatases encoded by open reading frames, Rv2407, Rv3406, and Rv3762c. We expressed recombinant forms of these proteins in E. coli, but the purified proteins exhibited no activity in the 4MUS assay, indicating that these putative sulfatases are probably not responsible for"
https://openalex.org/W2157595247,"A family of engineered endopeptidases has been created that is capable of cleaving a diverse array of peptide sequences with high selectivity and catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM > 104 M−1 s−1). By screening libraries with a selection-counterselection substrate method, protease variants were programmed to recognize amino acids having altered charge, size and hydrophobicity properties adjacent to the scissile bond of the substrate, including Glu↓Arg, a specificity that to our knowledge has not been observed among natural proteases. Members of this artificial protease family resulted from a relatively small number of amino acid substitutions that (at least in one case) proved to be epistatic."
https://openalex.org/W2154882260,"LET-767 from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> belongs to a family of short chain dehydrogenases/reductases and is homologous to 17β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenases of type 3 and 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductases. Worms subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) of <i>let-767</i> displayed multiple growth and developmental defects in the first generation and arrested in the second generation as L1 larvae. To determine the function of LET-767 <i>in vivo</i>, we exploited a biochemical complementation approach, in which <i>let-767</i> (<i>RNAi</i>)-arrested larvae were rescued by feeding with compounds isolated from wild type worms. The arrest was only rescued by the addition of triacylglycerides extracted from worms but not from various natural sources, such as animal fats and plant oils. The mass spectrometric analyses showed alterations in the fatty acid content of triacylglycerides. Essential for the rescue were odd-numbered fatty acids with monomethyl branched chains. The rescue was improved when worms were additionally supplemented with long chain even-numbered fatty acids. Remarkably, <i>let-767</i> completely rescued the yeast 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase mutant (<i>ybr159</i>Δ). Because worm ceramides exclusively contain a monomethyl branched chain sphingoid base, we also investigated ceramides in <i>let-767</i> (<i>RNAi</i>). Indeed, the amount of ceramides was greatly reduced, and unusual sphingoid bases were observed. Taken together, we conclude that LET-767 is a major 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase in <i>C. elegans</i> required for the bulk production of monomethyl branched and long chain fatty acids, and the developmental arrest in <i>let-767</i> (<i>RNAi</i>) worms is caused by the deficiency of the former."

We have cloned, expressed, and purified the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase MbSrc1 from the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. The kinase has the same domain arrangement as mammalian Src kinases, and we find that the individual Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and catalytic domains have similar functions to their mammalian counterparts. In contrast to mammalian c-Src, the SH2 and catalytic domains of MbSrc1 do not appear to be functionally coupled. We cloned and expressed the M. brevicollis homolog of c-Src C-terminal kinase (MbCsk) and showed that it phosphorylates the C terminus of MbSrc1, yet this phosphorylation does not inhibit MbSrc to the same degree seen in the mammalian Src/Csk pair. Thus, Src autoinhibition likely evolved more recently within the metazoan lineage, and it may have played a role in the establishment of intercellular signaling in metazoans.

Thus, Src autoinhibition likely evolved more recently within the metazoan lineage, and it may have played a role in the establishment of intercellular signaling in metazoans. A defining feature of multicellular organisms is the cellular machinery that enables cell-cell interaction and communication. Recent analyses show that an unexpected diversity of cell signaling and adhesion components are present in choanoflagellates, a group of unicellular organisms that are closely related to metazoans (1King N. Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B. Science. 2003; 301: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2King N. Carroll S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The presence of these proteins in choanoflagellates demonstrates that they evolved before the origin of animals and suggests that they may have served as preadaptations for the evolution of multicellularity (3King N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).The genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis contains 128 tyrosine kinase genes. 3G. Manning, personal communication. 3G. Manning, personal communication. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from an M. brevicollis cDNA library demonstrated the expression of members of the receptor-tyrosine kinase and nonreceptor-tyrosine kinase families. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting of M. brevicollis cell lysates confirmed the phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to treatment with nutrients (1King N. Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B. Science. 2003; 301: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). M. brevicollis contains four Src kinase homologs (designated MbSrc1-4) (1King N. Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B.

Src family nonreceptor-tyrosine kinases are widely expressed in animals and are involved in the regulation of many processes including cell growth and differentiation, adhesion, and motility (4Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 5Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J.

Mutation of Src or elevated Src expression or activity can lead to cell transformation and metastasis (7Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 8Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130PubMed Google Scholar) (Src was initially identified as the cellular homolog of the transforming gene from Rous sarcoma virus). For this reason the normal activity of Src in animal cells is tightly regulated. Src kinases possess a conserved domain architecture that is critical for enzymatic regulation; they have an N-terminal myristoylation sequence followed by SH3, SH2, and kinase catalytic domains. The C terminus possesses a tyrosine (Tyr-530) that is phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Csk (4Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 5Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) (human c-Src numbering is used throughout this paper). Phosphorylation at Tyr-530 by Csk produces an intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal tail and the enzyme SH2 domain that inhibits enzyme activity (9Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Src is also maintained in a low activity state by intramolecular interactions involving the SH3 domain. The need to keep Src activity in check may have evolved in parallel with Src expression itself; the Csk-mediated regulatory system is present along with Src in the primitive sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis (10Segawa Y. Suga H. Iwabe N. Oneyama C. Akagi T. Miyata T. Okada M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12021-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in hydra (11Miller M.A. Malik I.A. Shenk M.A. Steele R.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Recent functional studies of Src kinases from the choanoflagellate Monosiga ovata showed that this organism possesses orthologs of Csk and Src (10Segawa Y.

The activity of M. ovata Src, however, was not completely inhibited by co-expression with Csk. Here, we report a biochemical characterization of a choanoflagellate Src, MbSrc1, from M. brevicollis. Despite their shared genus name, M. ovata and M. brevicollis are only distantly related within the choanoflagellates and are derived from distinct clades. 5S. Baldauf, personal communication. 5S. Baldauf, personal communication. Comparison of Src kinases from M. ovata and M. brevicollis, two evolutionarily remote choanoflagellates, provides a deeper understanding of the conservation of Src function within choanoflagellates and provides insight into the state of Src regulation before the origin of metazoans. Furthermore, unlike M. ovata, the genome sequence of M. brevicollis is now available (12King N. Westbrook M.J. Young S.L. Kuo A. Abedin M. Chapman J. Fairclough S. Hellsten U. Isogai Y. Letunic I.

Nature. 2008; 451: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), opening the door for genomic and proteomic approaches for studying choanoflagellate Src signaling. Our mechanistic studies show that the individual domains of MbSrc1 share many functional properties with Src kinases from multicellular animals and yet lack the interdomain communication in MbSrc1 seen in mammalian Src. In particular, direct phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine of MbSrc1 by a Csk homolog from M. brevicollis (MbCsk) fails to shut down the activity of MbSrc1. The tight degree of Csk regulation observed in mammalian Src kinases apparently arose more recently in the evolution of metazoans and may have contributed to the establishment of metazoan cell-cell communication.MATERIALS AND METHODScDNA Cloning—MbSrc1 was originally identified in an EST study (1King N. Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B. Science. 2003; 301: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A BLASTp search within the JGI M. brevicollis v1 genome browser was used to identify and verify the sequence, protein ID 44220, within the M. brevicollis genome (12King N. Westbrook M.J. Young S.L. Kuo A. Abedin M. Chapman J. Fairclough S. Hellsten U. Isogai Y. Letunic I. Marr M. Pincus D. Putnam N. Rokas A. Wright K.J. Zuzow R. Dirks W. Good M. Goodstein D. Lemons D. Li W. Lyons J.B. Morris A.

Nature. 2008; 451: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). MbSrc1 was amplified by PCR from an M. brevicollis cDNA library (2King N. Carroll S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For baculovirus expression, MbSrc1 DNA (encoding residues 36-495) was cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pFastBac-Htb (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged full-length MbSrc1 was expressed in mammalian cells by cloning into the XbaI and BamHI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV (Sigma). The MbSrc1 SH2 domain (residues 107-207) and SH3 domain (residues 45-105) were expressed in Escherichia coli by cloning into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Full-length MbCsk cDNA was amplified by PCR from the M. brevicollis cDNA library and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pXJ-HA for mammalian expression. MbCsk was also cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-1 for bacterial expression. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Alignments and Identity Calculations—Amino acid sequences retrieved from the NCBI Entrez protein data base were aligned and formatted using the ClustalW (13Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar) and BOXSHADE (Boxshade Version 3.3.1 by Kay Hofmann and Michael D.

Percent amino acid identities were calculated using WU-blast (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Purification—GST-tagged proteins (MbSrc1 SH2 and SH3 domains and MbCsk) were expressed in 1-liter E. coli cultures and purified using glutathione-agarose (Molecular Probes) as described (16Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments requiring soluble GST-tagged proteins, the proteins were eluted from glutathione-agarose by incubation with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). His-tagged MbSrc1 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Excel 401 medium (JRH Biosciences) with 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells (600 ml) were infected with recombinant MbSrc1 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for a period of 72 h. MbSrc1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as described previously (17Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purified MbSrc1 was concentrated in an Ultrafree-10 concentrator (Millipore) and stored in 40% glycerol at -20 °C.Tyrosine Kinase Assays—MbSrc1 assays were performed with [γ-32P]ATP using the phosphocellulose paper binding assay (16Garcia P.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm ATP, varying concentrations of peptide substrate, and [γ-32P]ATP (200-400 cpm/pmol). Peptide substrates were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems automated 431A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight mass spectrometry. Screens of MbSrc1 specificity were carried out with the following peptides: protein kinase A, LRRASLG; Src, AEEEIYGEFEAKKKKG; Abl, EAIYAAPFAKKKG; epidermal growth factor receptor, AEEEEYFELVAKKKG; insulin receptor, KKEEEEYMMMMG; Src autophosphorylation site, RRLIEDAEYAARG; SH3 binding substrate, AEEEIYGEFGGRGAAPPPPPVPRGRG; SH3 control substrate, AEEEIYGEFGGRGAAAAAAAVARGRG; SH2 binding substrate, RRLEDAIYAAGGGGGEPPQpYEEIG (pY is phosphotyrosine); SH2 control substrate, RRLEDAIYAAGGGGGEPPQFEEIG. Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed using a continuous spectrophotometric kinase assay (19Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with varying concentrations of ATP and the insulin receptor substrate. For assays of Csk-treated MbSrc, RCM-lysozyme was used as the substrate to minimize Csk activity (21Lee S. Ayrapetov M.K. Kemble D.J. Parang K. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8183-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by spotting onto Whatman No. 3MM paper and washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 55 °C. Phosphorylated RCM-lysozyme was counted by liquid scintillation counting.MbCsk was assayed with [γ-32P]ATP and poly(Glu4-Tyr) as described (22Sun G. Budde R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated poly(Glu4-Tyr) was spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 55 °C, and counted by liquid scintillation counting. To measure the stoichiometry of MbSrc1 phosphorylation by MbCsk, reactions were carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (23Patwardhan P. Shen Y. Goldberg G.S. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20689-20697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—MbSrc1 (15 μm) was dephosphorylated by treatment with immobilized GST-tagged Yersinia tyrosine phosphatase (YOP) for 45 min at room temperature. After removal of GST-YOP by centrifugation, MbSrc1 was incubated with MbCsk (13 μg) and 0.25 mm ATP in kinase buffer for 45 min at 30 °C. A control reaction was carried out without MbCsk. The reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and MbSrc1 bands were excised from the gel, cut into small pieces, and transferred to siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. After washing with 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid, gel fragments were dehydrated by the addition of acetonitrile. Proteins were reduced and alkylated by the addition of dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were extracted by treatment with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 5% (v/v) formic acid in water. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out on a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry work station (ABI). Mapping of the C-terminal phosphotyrosine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) was carried out on an API QSTAR Pulsar LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Protana nanospray source (Protana Engineering A/S, Starmosegardsvej, Denmark) and an UltiMate capillary high pressure liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Calorimetry experiments were performed in a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) in buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl (24Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Protein and peptide solutions were dialyzed against ITC buffer and degassed before use. ITC experiments were performed with 30-60 μm MbSrc1 SH2 or SH3 domain in the ITC cell and 0.3-1.8 mm peptide in the injection syringe. Data for each titration were collected and analyzed by the Origin software package (MicroCal). The peptides used to measure SH2 binding were the pYEEI peptide (EPQpYEEIPIKQ) (19Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the MbSrc1 tail peptide (GSSpYNNPDQM). The peptide used for SH3 binding was a Pro-rich peptide (RGAAPPPPPVPRGRG) derived from the sequence of Sam68 (25Qiu H. Miller W.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Cell Transfection and Western Blotting—SYF cells were cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected at 50% confluency using TransIT polyamine transfection reagent (Mirus) at a ratio of 1:3.5 (DNA:TransIT) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Western blot analysis was performed after 48 h of transfection. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates (25 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins in the membranes were detected with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate), anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma), and anti-Tyr(P)-419 antibody (BIOSOURCE) by ECL (GE Healthcare).For SH2/SH3 pulldown experiments, immobilized GST-SH2, GST-SH3, or GST (25 μg in 50 μl) were incubated with 250 μl of SYF cell lysate (1.6 mg/ml protein) for 1 h at 4 °C. In some experiments competitor peptides (pYEEI or Pro-rich peptide) were added to the reactions. The GST proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed 3× with lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immobilized pYEEI peptide was prepared by coupling 0.5 mg of pYEEI to Affi-Gel 15 resin (Bio-Rad) as described (25Qiu H. Miller W.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lysates from SYF cells were incubated with pYEEI resin for 45 min at 4 °C. Bound MbSrc1 was visualized by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody.Luciferase Reporter Assay—The SYF cells were seeded in 12-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected in triplicate with protein expression plasmids, interferon-gamma activation site luciferase reporter plasmid, or a promoter-less Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-null) as a transfection control (gifts from Dr. Nancy Reich, Stony Brook University). Transfected cells were harvested after 48 h. Preparation of cell lysates and measurement of light units were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) following the manufacturerŉs instructions. Relative light units were calculated as (firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity).RESULTSCloning MbSrc1 from M. brevicollis—A cDNA encoding MbSrc1 was amplified by PCR from an M. brevicollis cDNA library. The domain architecture of MbSrc1 matches that of mammalian Src kinases; the enzyme possesses (from N terminus to C terminus) unique, SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase catalytic domains (Fig. 1). The overall amino acid identity with human c-Src is 57% (additional identities are listed in supplemental Fig. S1). The tyrosine residues involved in mammalian Src regulation are conserved in MbSrc1. Tyrosine 378 of MbSrc1 corresponds to the autophosphorylation site within the activation loop (Tyr-419) of c-Src, which is a site of enzyme activation (9Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 20Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The C-terminal negative regulatory site of c-Src (Tyr-530) is also conserved in MbSrc1 (Tyr-489). In mammalian Src kinases, phosphorylation of Tyr-530 by Csk represses enzymatic activity by promoting an intramolecular SH2-tail interaction (4Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 5Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Two of the three amino acids in c-Src that are important for recognition by Csk are conserved in MbSrc1 (21Lee S. Ayrapetov M.K. Kemble D.J. Parang K. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8183-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the sole exception is the position corresponding to Tyr-514 in c-Src, which is a threonine in MbSrc1 (Fig. 1). In mammalian Src kinases, polyproline sequences in the SH2 kinase linker bind intramolecularly to the SH3 domain and play an important role in enzyme regulation (9Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 27Xu W.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The sequences of the SH2 kinase linker in c-Src and MbSrc1 are divergent, with an extra four residues present in MbSrc1. Proline residues are present in the MbSrc1 linker, but it is not clear whether these sequences have the capacity to serve as SH3 ligands. Trp-263, an important regulatory site within the linker in c-Src (29LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), is conserved between MbSrc1 and c-Src. Thus, MbSrc1 potentially has most (if not all) of the regulatory sequences of mammalian Src kinases.The SH2 and SH3 Domains of MbSrc1 Are Functional—The SH2 and SH3 domains of mammalian Src kinase play dual roles; they are involved in autoinhibitory interactions, and they also have a positive role in targeting the kinases to cellular substrates (4Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 5Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J.

It is not currently known whether these two roles are operational in earlier branching phyla, although the presence of Csk in sponges and in hydra suggests that the autoinhibitory role of the SH2 domain is intact (10Segawa Y. Suga H. Iwabe N. Oneyama C. Akagi T. Miyata T. Okada M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12021-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Miller M.A. Malik I.A. Shenk M.A. Steele R.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both of these roles depend on the ability of the domains to engage in protein-protein interactions. To test whether these binding properties are present in the MbSrc1 domains, we expressed the isolated domains as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli and purified them. We immobilized the GST-SH2 and GST-SH3 proteins and incubated them with lysates from Src-expressing mammalian cells (Fig. 2A). Western blotting experiments showed that the SH2 domain bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the lysates. The SH3 domain also bound to at least one tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Reprobing with a specific antibody showed that one bound protein was p130Cas, which contains C-terminal ligands for the Src SH2 and SH3 domains (31Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). Binding to the MbSrc1 SH2 domain was inhibited by the inclusion of a phosphopeptide containing the optimal binding ligand for the mammalian c-Src SH2 domain (pYEEI) (Fig. 2A). Similarly, a proline-rich synthetic peptide (derived from the sequence of Sam68, an Src SH3 binding partner (33Lukong K.E. Richard S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)) blocked the ability of the MbSrc1 SH3 domain to bind to the phosphorylated protein.FIGURE 2The MbSrc1 SH2 and SH3 domains are functional. A, immobilized GST-SH2, GST-SH3, or GST were incubated with Src-transfected SYF cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. Competitor peptides were added to the incubations as indicated. The GST proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound proteins were visualized by anti-Tyr(P) Western blotting. The left two lanes show 25 μg of Src-transfected and untransfected SYF lysate, respectively, loaded directly onto the gel. B, binding of the MbSrc1 SH2 domain to pYEEI peptide measured by ITC. A representative titration is shown using 60 μm SH2 domain and 5-μl injections of 1.8 mm pYEEI peptide. The dissociation constant determined from this titration was 140 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the binding affinities of the MbSrc1 SH2 and SH3 domains for their ligands. MbSrc1 bound to the pYEEI peptide with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 140 nm (Fig. 2B). This is similar to the value of 200 nm reported for the pYEEI peptide binding to the isolated SH2 domain of mammalian c-Src (34Bradshaw J.M. Grucza R.A. Ladbury J.E. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9083-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ITC experiments on the MbSrc1 SH3 domain gave a Kd value of 2.1 μm for binding to the proline-rich peptide from Sam68 (supplemental Fig. S3); this is in the range of values typically observed for c-Src SH3 domain binding to polyproline peptides (1-10 μm) (35Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Overall, the results of the binding experiments suggest that the MbSrc1 SH2 and SH3 domains share the basic function of their mammalian counterparts and that the ligand specificity is broadly similar.Enzymatic Activity of MbSrc1—We cloned the MbSrc1 sequence (encoding residues 36-495, from the beginning of the SH3 domain to the C terminus of MbSrc1) into a baculovirus expression vector. Similar SH3-SH2 kinase constructs of mammalian Src kinases retain the essential features of regulation and avoid potential complications due to membrane association (9Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We infected Sf9 insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus and purified the protein. MbSrc1 was highly active toward synthetic peptide substrates, with a catalytic efficiency comparable with mammalian Src kinases. We screened MbSrc1 with peptide substrates containing recognit"

These channels display high selectivity for Ca2+, but in the absence of divalent cations they also conduct monovalent ions. TRPV6 channels have been shown to be inactivated by increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Here we studied the mechanism of this Ca2+-induced inactivation. Monovalent currents through TRPV6 substantially decreased after a 40-s application of Ca2+, but not Ba2+. We also show that Ca2+, but not Ba2+, influx via TRPV6 induces depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2) and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Dialysis of DiC8 PI(4,5)P2 through the patch pipette inhibited Ca2+-dependent inactivation of TRPV6 currents in whole-cell patch clamp experiments. PI(4,5)P2 also activated TRPV6 currents in excised patches. PI(4)P, the precursor of PI(4,5)P2, neither activated TRPV6 in excised patches nor had any effect on Ca2+-induced inactivation in whole-cell experiments. Conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P by a rapamycin-inducible PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase inhibited TRPV6 currents in whole-cell experiments. Inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 4 kinases with wortmannin decreased TRPV6 currents and Ca2+ entry into TRPV6-expressing cells.

Calcium signaling orchestrates a myriad of physiological functions such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, bone formation, and fertilization.

Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). The mammalian TRP superfamily comprises six main subfamilies named the TRPC (canonical), TRPM (melastatin), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), and TRPA (ankyrin) groups. Among all TRP channels, TRPV5 and TRPV6, the members of the vanilloid subfamily, are the only ones that exhibit high Ca2+ selectivity (4Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 373-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). TRPV6 is expressed in Ca2+-transporting epithelial cells, and it plays an important role in the active Ca2+ absorption by the intestines (5Vennekens R. Voets T. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). TRPV6 channels have been reported to be expressed in a variety of other tissues such as kidney, prostate, stomach, brain, and lung (7Nijenhuis T. Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2731-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and have also been shown to be expressed aberrantly in human malignancies (8Zhuang L. Peng J.B. Tou L. Takanaga H. Adam R.M. Hediger M.A. Freeman M.R. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1755-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Until now no electrophysiological study has been performed characterizing these channels in native cells that express them endogenously. The physiological importance of these channels is understood from studies with genetically modified mice. Mice lacking TRPV6 have been shown to exhibit reduced intestinal Ca2+ reabsorption, increased urinary Ca2+ excretion, decreased bone density, reduced fertility, and skin abnormalities (9Bianco S.D. Peng J.B. Takanaga H. Suzuki Y. Crescenzi A. Kos C.H. Zhuang L. Freeman M.R. Gouveia C.H. Wu J. Luo H. Mauro T. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 22: 274-285Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of TRPV6 channels in heterologous expression systems reveals that they exhibit strong inward rectification and reverse at positive potentials (10Bodding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36656-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They exhibit high Ca2+ selectivity and conduct monovalent cations in the absence of divalent cations. These monovalent currents through TRPV6 channels are much larger than those carried by Ca2+ at physiological Ca2+ concentrations (11Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Ca2+ that enters through TRPV6 or an increase in intracellular Ca2+ has been reported to cause inactivation of these channels (12Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G.

Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This also inactivates monovalent currents upon subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ (12Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). TRPV6 is also permeable to Ba2+, but Ba2+ influx induces less inactivation than Ca2+ or no inactivation at all depending on the conditions (12Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Derler I. Hofbauer M. Kahr H. Fritsch R. Muik M. Kepplinger K. Hack M.E. Moritz S. Schindl R. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recovery from Ca2+-induced inactivation is quite slow (12Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and it was shown for the closely related TRPV5 that this recovery lags significantly behind restoration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels (15Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRPV6 channels were proposed to function as Ca2+ sensors, i.e. at low cytoplasmic [Ca2+] they open and let more Ca2+ in, and at high [Ca2+] they close and reduce further Ca2+ entry (10Bodding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36656-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that a growing number of mammalian TRP channels are functionally regulated by PI(4,5)P2 (16Rohacs T. Pflugers Arch. Euc. J.

Schilling W.P. J.

In this study we examined the role of phosphoinositides in the Ca2+-induced inactivation of TRPV6. We demonstrate that the activity of TRPV6 depends on PI(4,5)P2, using different approaches including direct activation by PI(4,5)P2 in excised patches, dialyzing DiC8 PI(4,5)P2 via the patch pipette in whole-cell recordings, and dephosphorylating plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 using a rapamycin-inducible PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase. We also show that Ca2+ flowing through TRPV6 activates phospholipase C (PLC), which leads to the depletion of PI(4,5)P2. Taken together, we provide evidence for a model that envisages the activation of PLC by Ca2+, which results in the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2, causing inactivation of TRPV6 channels. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The human TRPV6 tagged with the Myc epitope on the N terminus, subcloned into the expression vector pCMV-Tag3A (Stratagene), was used for the experiments (31Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and cells were transfected using the Effectene reagent. For the intracellular Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology experiments, transfection was confirmed by measuring the fluorescence of co-transfected GFP. For experiments with rapamycin, the cells were transfected with the Myc-tagged TRPV6, the plasma membrane-targeted, CFP-tagged FRB, and the RFP-tagged FKBP12 linked to the phosphatase domain of PIP2 5-phosphatase (32Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For control experiments, RFP-FKBP12-phosphatase domain was replaced with the RFP-tagged FKBP12 without the 5-phosphatase domain. Mammalian Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp measurements were performed using a continuous holding protocol at –60 mV. Recordings were performed 36–72 h post-transfection in HEK293 cells using a bath solution containing, in mm, 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 (designated as nominally divalent free, NDF). The same solution was used for the fluorescence measurements and Ca2+ imaging. Borosilicate glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments) of 2–4-megaohm resistance were filled with a solution containing, in mm, 135 potassium-gluconate, 5 KCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 2 ATP disodium, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2. The cells were kept in NDF solution for 20 min before measurements. After formation of gigaohm resistance seals, whole-cell configuration was established and currents were measured using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Data were collected and analyzed with pCLAMP 9.0 software. All measurements were performed at room temperature, 20–25 °C. For experiments with wortmannin (WMN), cells expressing TRPV6 were preincubated with NDF containing 10 μm WMN for 30 min at room temperature. Control cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) in NDF. All conditions and solutions remain the same for patch clamp, Ca2+ imaging, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments unless otherwise specified. Excised Patch Measurements in Xenopus Oocytes—Macropatch experiments were performed with borosilicate glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments) of 0.8–1.7-megaohm resistance. After establishing gigaohm resistance seals on devitellinized surfaces of Xenopus oocytes, inside-out configuration was established, and currents were measured using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The pipette solution contained, in mm, 96 LiCl, 1 EGTA, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. For the measurements in Fig. 3, the perfusion solution contained, in mm, 96 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4. For the measurements shown in Fig. 7, the perfusion solution contained, in mm, 93 potassium gluconate, 5 HEDTA, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using the MaxChelator program. To result in 10 μm free calcium, 3.85 mm Ca2+ was added (calcium-gluconate) and to result in 43 μm free Mg2+, we added 2.35 mm Mg2+ (magnesium-gluconate). For these measurements the bath was connected with the ground electrode through an agar bridge. Data were analyzed with pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon Instruments) and plotted using Microcal Origin.FIGURE 7The effect of Ca2+ on TRPV6 in excised patches. A, macroscopic currents were measured in excised patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing TRPV6, using the solutions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The applications of 10 μm free Ca2+, 43 μm free Mg2+, and 50 μm diC8 PI(4,5)P2 are indicated with horizontal lines. Holding potential was 0 mV, and then a 150-ms long step to –103 mV, followed by a step to +100 mV, was applied once every second. The changes at +100 mV mainly correspond to the Ca2+-activated Cl– currents (ICl–), whereas the changes at –103 mV correspond exclusively to TRPV6 currents. Note the lack of any current in response to Ca2+ at –103 mV after TRPV6 current rundown at the end of the experiment (third pulse of Ca2+).

Measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International (PTI) (Birmingham, NJ) photomultiplier-based system mounted on an Olympus IX71 microscope, equipped with a DeltaRAM excitation light source. For the FRET measurements, excitation wavelength was 425 nm and emission was detected parallel at 480 and 535 nm using two interference filters and a dichroic mirror to separate the two emission wavelengths. Data were collected using the Felix software (PTI), and the ratio of traces obtained at the two different wavelengths correlating with FRET were plotted (33van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C).

HEK293 cells were transfected with either TRPV6-Myc and GFP or with GFP alone (controls) and incubated with 20 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol overnight in growth medium. Before the experiments the cells were kept in NDF for 20 min and for an additional 10 min in NDF containing 10 mm LiCl. Then the cells were treated with NDF containing no Ca2+ or 2 mm Ca2+ or 2 mm Ba2+ for 25–30 min in the continued presence of LiCl. The cells were scraped, treated with 4% perchloric acid, and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 2–4 min. The supernatants (1.2 ml) were transferred into glass tubes containing 180 μl of 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and to each tube 1.3 ml of a freshly prepared mixture of trioctylamine/Freon was added, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 4 min. The top aqueous layer (∼1.2 ml) was transferred into plastic vials and 3.6 ml of sodium bicarbonate was added. This solution was then added to Dowex columns filled with AG1 × 8 resin (formate form). The columns were washed four times each with 5 ml of distilled water. Fractions 1–4 (5 ml each) 0.4 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid, pH 4.75 (IP2 fraction); fractions 5–8 (5 ml each) 0.7 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid, pH 4.75 (IP3 fraction); and fractions 9–12 (5 ml each) 1.2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid, pH 4.75 (IP4, IP5, and IP6 fraction) were collected. One ml of each of the collected fractions was transferred into a scintillation vial, 10 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and 3H activity was determined in a scintillation counter. Ca2+ Imaging—Cells transfected with TRPV6 and GFP (marker for cell selection) were grown on 25-mm circular coverslips and loaded with fura-2 AM (2 μm) for 30–40 min at room temperature in NDF. The coverslips were then washed in NDF, placed in a stainless steel holder (bath volume, ∼0.8 ml; Molecular Probes), and viewed in a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope coupled to an Attofluor digital imaging system. Cells expressing GFP were selected and monitored simultaneously on each coverslip. Results are presented as the ratio (R) of fluorescence intensities at excitation wavelengths of 334 and 380 nm. Cells were continuously superfused with NDF, and Ca2+ entry was initiated by addition of a solution containing 2 mm CaCl2. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were transfected with TRPV6 and the GFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domain (supplemental Fig. S1) or the components of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase recruitment system (supplemental Fig. S3). Experiments were performed 2 days after transfection. The cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope in the Confocal Imaging Facility of the New Jersey Medical School. Images were saved as TIFF files and were analyzed with IMAGE J software. Materials—Fura-2 AM was obtained from TefLabs (Austin, Texas). Effectene was obtained from Qiagen. Cell culture media, antibiotics, and sera were obtained from Invitrogen. DiC8 phosphoinositides were obtained from Cayman and Echelon. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Data Analysis—Data for all figures were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Studentŉs t test. * stands for p < 0.05, and ** for p < 0.001. Ca2+, but Not Ba2+, Inactivates Na+ Currents through TRPV6—We studied the mechanism of Ca2+-induced inactivation of TRPV6 by measuring monovalent currents before and after exposing the TRPV6-expressing cells to Ca2+ (or Ba2+) -containing solutions in whole-cell configuration at a constant holding potential of –60 mV (Fig. 1). Monovalent currents were initiated by the application of a solution containing 2 mm EGTA and no added divalent ions. After a 40-s application of Ca2+, but not Ba2+, monovalent currents were markedly decreased despite the substantial entry of Ba2+ observed in fluorescence measurements (see Fig. 2D). The average current amplitude during the first pulse of 0 Ca2+ (EGTA) was 2.27 ± 0.65 nA, which was significantly higher than the second (0.86 ± 0.38 nA) and third (0.69 ± 0.27 nA) pulses. When Ba2+ was used instead of Ca2+, the average current amplitude for the first pulse was 1.87 ± 0.48 nA. The average current amplitudes for the second and third pulses were 1.83 ± 0.34 and 1.95 ± 0.32 nA, respectively. The same protocol did not induce any current in cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 1, C and F) or non-transfected HEK cells (data not shown). Monovalent currents through TRPV6 are also blocked by extracellular Mg2+ (11Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); thus we omitted Mg2+ from the extracellular NDF solution throughout the experiments.FIGURE 2Ca2+, but not Ba2+, induces PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in TRPV6-expressing cells. Fluorescence was measured in HEK293 cells expressing TRPV6 and the CFP- and YFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domains as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were kept in NDF solution for 20 min before the experiment. During the measurement, 2 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+ was added at 200 s. A and B represent the time courses of FRET ratio for Ca2+ and Ba2+, respectively. C represents the mean ± S.E. for change in FRET ratio signals, calculated the following way. We divided the value 2 min after the addition of 2 mm Ca2+ (n = 5) or Ba2+ (n = 5) by the value before addition of Ca2+ to result in F and then 100 – (100 × F) was plotted. D represents the mean of change in 340/380 nm ratio ± S.E. for Ca2+ (n = 31) or Ba2+ (n = 36) in fura-2-loaded cells expressing TRPV6.

Lopes C.M.B. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of the differential behavior of Ca2+ and Ba2+ on the inactivation of TRPV6 channels, we used a FRET-based technique (23Rohacs T. Lopes C.M.B. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 33van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to show that Ca2+, but not Ba2+, induces depletion of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2, A and B). This technique is based on the translocation of the CFP/YFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domains from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm upon PIP(4,5)2 depletion, which is shown in the figure as downward deflection of the FRET ratio traces. This technique has been shown to display good correlation with translocation of the GFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domain as measured with confocal microscopy (33van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We also show that Ca2+ induces translocation of the GFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domain using confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). Fig. 2C summarizes the percentage of change in FRET ratio caused by addition of 2 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+. Fig. 2D shows that addition of 2 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+ resulted in similar change in the fluorescence ratio of fura-2-loaded TRPV6 cells, indicating that both Ca2+ and Ba2+ enter through these channels. We have also measured IP3 production in HEK cells in response to Ca2+ and Ba2+ influx through TRPV6. Fig. 2E shows that IP3 production is increased in HEK cells expressing TRPV6 in response to the application of Ca2+, but not Ba2+. HEK cells not expressing TRPV6 did not respond with increased formation of IP3 to the application of Ca2+ (Fig. 2F), but they responded to extracellular ATP, which activates PLC in these cells via P2Y cell surface receptors (35Fischer W. Franke H. Groger-Arndt H. Illes P. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S2 shows that application of extracellular Ca2+ in HEK293 cells not expressing TRPV6 did not significantly increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and did not induce any changes in FRET, demonstrating that Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis depend on the presence of TRPV6 channels. PI(4,5)P2, but Not PI(4)P, Activates TRPV6 Channels and Prevents Ca2+-induced Inactivation—We next examined the direct effects of phosphoinositides on TRPV6 channels. We studied the effects of short acyl chain (diC8) analogues (36Rohacs T. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36065-36072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) of various phosphoinositides in excised patches of Xenopus oocytes expressing TRPV6 (Fig. 3, A and B). PI(4,5)P2, but not PI or PI(4)P, activated TRPV6 channels in excised patches. PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, the products of phosphoinositide 3 kinases, also activated TRPV6, but their effects were smaller than that of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3, A and B). In whole-cell patch clamp experiments, dialysis of DiC8 PI(4,5)P2 via the patch pipette relieved TRPV6 currents from Ca2+-induced inactivation (Fig. 4C), whereas DiC8 PI(4)P had no effect (Fig. 4B). Control cells (Fig. 4, A and D) had current amplitudes of 1.44 ± 0.45 (first pulse), 0.49 ± 0.1 (second pulse), and 0.44 ± 0.12 nA (third pulse). The amplitude of the monovalent currents in cells dialyzed with DiC8 PI(4)P (Fig. 4, B and E) were 1.65 ± 0.35, 0.48 ± 0.16, and 0.34 ± 0.1 nA for the first, second, and third pulses, respectively. In cells dialyzed with DiC8 PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4, C and F), the current amplitude for the first pulse was 1.1 ± 0.14, for the second pulse it was 1.18 ± 0.17, and it was 1.16 ± 0.18 nA for the third pulse. Dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 by a PI(4,5)P2 5-Phosphatase Inhibits TRPV6 Channels—Next we tested the effect of depletion of PI(4,5)P2 by alternate means that do not involve a rise in intracellular [Ca2+]. For this, we employed the recently developed rapamycin-inducible PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase to deplete PI(4,5)P2 in TRPV6-expressing cells (Fig. 5). This technique is based on the translocation of the phosphatase domain of the PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase to the plasma membrane induced by rapamycin, which was shown to cause depletion of PI(4,5)P2 and inhibition of TRPM8 (32Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and KCNQ2/3 channels (37Suh B.C. Inoue T. Meyer T. Hille B. Science. 2006; 314: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Rapamycin (100 nm) inhibited the whole-cell monovalent currents through TRPV6 channels expressing the rapamycin-inducible PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase constructs (Fig. 5A) and had no effect in parallel controls (Fig. 5B). Supplemental Fig. S3 shows the translocation of the RFP-tagged PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2142100612,"Here, we report the identification, cloning, and functional characterization of three Caenorhabditis elegans G protein-coupled pigment dispersing factor (PDF) receptors, which we designated as Ce_PDFR-1a, -b, and -c. They represent three splice isoforms of the same gene (C13B9.4), which share a high degree of similarity with the Drosophila PDF receptor and are distantly related to the mammalian vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors (VPAC2) and calcitonin receptors. In a reverse pharmacological screen, three bioactive C. elegans neuropeptides, which were recently identified as the Drosophila PDF orthologues, were able to activate these receptors in a dose-dependent manner with nanomolar potency (isoforms a and b). Integrated green fluorescent protein reporter constructs reveal the expression of these PDF receptors in all body wall muscle cells and many head and tail neurons involved in the integration of environmental stimuli and the control of locomotion. Using a custom data analysis system, we demonstrate the involvement of this newly discovered neuropeptide signaling system in the regulation of locomotor behavior. Overexpression of PDF-2 phenocopies the locomotor defects of a PDF-1 null mutant, suggesting that they elicit opposite effects on locomotion through the identified PDF receptors. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that the PDF signaling system, which imposes the circadian clock rhythm on behavior in Drosophila, has been functionally conserved throughout the protostomian evolutionary lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2080716570,"The BLAP75 protein combines with the BLM helicase and topoisomerase (Topo) IIIalpha to form an evolutionarily conserved complex, termed the BTB complex, that functions to regulate homologous recombination. BLAP75 binds DNA, associates with both BLM and Topo IIIalpha, and enhances the ability of the BLM-Topo IIIalpha pair to branch migrate the Holliday junction (HJ) or dissolve the double Holliday junction (dHJ) structure to yield non-crossover recombinants. Here we seek to understand the relevance of the biochemical attributes of BLAP75 in HJ processing. With the use of a series of BLAP75 protein fragments, we show that the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal third of BLAP75 mediates complex formation with BLM and Topo IIIalpha and that the DNA binding activity resides in the C-terminal third of this novel protein. Interestingly, the N-terminal third of BLAP75 is just as adept as the full-length protein in the promotion of dHJ dissolution and HJ unwinding by BLM-Topo IIIalpha. Thus, the BLAP75 DNA binding activity is dispensable for the ability of the BTB complex to process the HJ in vitro. Lastly, we show that a BLAP75 point mutant (K166A), defective in Topo IIIalpha interaction, is unable to promote dHJ dissolution and HJ unwinding by BLM-Topo IIIalpha. This result provides proof that the functional integrity of the BTB complex is contingent upon the interaction of BLAP75 with Topo IIIalpha."
https://openalex.org/W2048484328,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is a constitutively expressed gene in endothelium that produces NO and is critical for vascular integrity. Previously, we reported that the 27-nucleotide (nt) repeat polymorphism in eNOS intron 4, a source of 27-nt small RNA, which inhibits eNOS expression, were associated with cardiovascular risk and expression of the eNOS gene. In the current study, we investigated the biogenesis of the intron 4-derived 27-nt small RNA. Using Northern blot, we showed that the eNOS-derived 27-nt short intronic repeat RNA (sir-RNA) expressed only in the eNOS expressing endothelial cells. Cells containing 10 × 27- or 5 × 27-nt repeats produced higher levels of 27nt sir-RNA and lower levels of eNOS mRNA than the cells with 4 × 27-nt repeats. The 27nt sir-RNA was mostly present within the endothelial nuclei. When the splicing junctions of the 27-nt repeat containing intron 4 in the full-length eNOS cDNA vector were mutated, 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis was abolished. Suppression of Drosha or Dicer diminished the biogenesis of the 27nt sir-RNA. Our study suggests that the 27nt sir-RNA derived through eNOS pre-mRNA splicing may represent a new class of small RNA. The more eNOS is transcribed or higher number of the 27-nt repeats, the more 27nt sir-RNA is produced, which functions as a negative feedback self-regulator by specifically inhibiting the host gene eNOS expression. This novel molecular model may be responsible for quantitative differences between individuals carrying different numbers of the polymorphic repeats hence the cardiovascular risk.

Dzau V.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Effects of NO result either directly from reactions between NO and specific biological molecules through S-nitros(yl)ation (2Melino G. Bernassola F. Knight R.A. Corasaniti M.T. Nistico G. Finazzi-Agro A. Nature. 1997; 388: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), or indirectly from reactive nitrogen oxide species through oxidation (3Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These direct or indirect effects can produce both physiological and pathological outcomes (4Hausladen A. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adequate NO production is essential for anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic processes in the normal arterial wall; attenuated NO bioavailability promotes vascular diseases. Reduction in basal NO release may predispose to hypertension, thrombosis, vasospasm, and atherosclerosis (5Oemar B.S. Tschudi M.R. Godoy N. Brovkovich V. Malinski T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2494-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and overproduction of NO can result in excessive oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which promote vascular diseases. Central to all these physiological functions is the proper eNOS expression and adequate eNOS enzyme activity. Over recent years, tremendous research efforts have concentrated on the regulation of eNOS enzyme activities. Comparatively, progress in molecular mechanisms regulating eNOS expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels is relatively slow. Although functional roles of the eNOS DNA variants are not clear, hundreds of studies investigating associations between various eNOS polymorphisms and vascular diseases have been published over the last decade. This is especially so for the 27-nucleotide (nt) repeat polymorphism in the eNOS intron 4, which is highlighted by a meta-analysis of 12,990 subjects showing significant associations with vascular diseases (6Casas J.P. Bautista L.E. Humphries S.E. Hingorani A.D. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although a recent Framingham Study reported no association between 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the eNOS gene and endothelial function (7Kathiresan S. Larson M.G. Vasan R.S. Guo C.Y. Vita J.A. Mitchell G.F. Keyes M.J. Newton-Cheh C. Musone S.L. Lochner A.L. Drake J.A. Levy D. O'Donnell C.J. Hirschhorn J.N. Benjamin E.J. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), others reported positive associations between the promoter T-786C polymorphism, CA repeats in intron 13, E298D at exon 7, and endothelial function and vascular diseases (8Wang X.L. Wang J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Studies of ours and others suggest that the 27-nt repeat polymorphism at eNOS intron 4 is likely functional in regulating eNOS expression. Recently, we have demonstrated that: (a) the 27-nt repeats may act as an enhancer/repressor regulating eNOS expression, the effect is maintained during in vitro cell replication in endothelial cells carrying different genotypes (9Wang J. Dudley D. Wang X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: e1-e4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Senthil D. Raveendran M. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Dudley D. Wang J. Wang X.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); (b) the 27-nt repeats in eNOS intron 4 produce 27-nt small RNA, which appears to inhibit eNOS expression at the transcriptional level (11Zhang M.X.

In the current study, we defined the molecular pathways for the 27-nt small RNA biogenesis, which is distinct from most known classes of small RNAs (13Ambros V.

This short intronic repeat small RNA (sir-RNA) could either be a new class of small RNA or an atypical form of the microRNA. We speculate that the intron 4-derived 27-nt small RNA may function as a negative feedback regulator and maintain the stable transcription of eNOS. Reagents—Restriction enzymes, T4 kinase, DNA ligases, polymerases, and other molecular biology enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmid and DNA gel purification kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by iDNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The mirVana miRNA Isolation kit was from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Sephadex columns for probe purification were from Roche Diagnostics Corp. Anti-eNOS antibody and anti-β-actin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Sigma. Anti-Drosha and Dicer antibodies were from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Human tissue total RNAs were from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Hybond nylon membrane and [32P]ATP were from GE Healthcare and PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein determinations were made with the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Plasmids—We amplified the human eNOS gene from exon 3 to intron 4 (4674 to 6498 bp) or part of intron 4 (5130 to 6430) with the standard PCR technique from genomic DNA extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We cloned the PCR products into pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) re-cloned into human eNOS full-length cDNA/pCMV-2B expression vector at the ScaI site. The correct sequence and orientation of the inserts were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Primers with restriction enzyme site (underlined) for cloning are: sense 5′-AGTACTTACAGCTCCATTAAGAGGTGACAG-3′, antisense 5′-AGTACTCCTGAGCCAGCCGAGGCAGCGGGAGAG-3′, sense, 5′-AGTACTGGTGCGGCTGGCCAGCGACTGAGAG-3′, antisense 5′-AGTACTCCTGAGCCAGCCGAGGCAGCGGGAGAG-3′. For generation of the 10 × 27-nt construct, we carried out two separate PCR. We first amplified the DNA fragment from the 5′ end to the end of the 5th 27-nt repeat. We then amplified the DNA fragment from the beginning of the 1st 27-nt repeat to the 3′ end of the intron 4. These two DNA fragments were end-end annealed for the generation of the 10 × 27-nt fragment and inserted into the pCMV-2B-eNOS cDNA vector. For the assessment of the independent promoter, the region (1953 bp, 4545-6498 bp) spanning from eNOS exon 3 to intron 4 was amplified from HUVEC genomics DNA. Primers with KpnI and XhoI sites were: sense 5′-GGTACCCTCGACCCAGGATGGGCCCTGCACC, antisense 5′-AGATCTCCTGAGCCAGCCGAGGCAGCGGGAGAG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGL3 basic vector by T4 DNA ligase at XhoI and KpnI sites. In addition, the serial deletions of the 1.5-kb region upstream of the 27-nt repeats in the eNOS intron 4 were amplified by PCR before being inserted into the pGL3 basic vector at XhoI and KpnI. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate the splicing-deficient constructs. siRNA-mediated Gene-specific Suppression—Following siRNA duplexes specific for Drosha and Dicer, genes were designed to suppress the expression of Drosha and Dicer. Luciferase gene-specific siRNA was used as a negative control. The target sequences for Drosha, Dicer, and luciferase were: 5′-AACCGAAGAUCACCAUCUCUG-3′, 5′-AAUCUAUUAGCACCUUGAUGU-3′, and 5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACG-3. Before transfection with Lipofectamine 2000, formation of siRNA duplex was performed. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa (human cervical epithelial cancer cell line) and 293 (human embryonic renal epithelial cell line) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human skin fibroblast cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cell Application, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured in smooth muscle cell growth medium (Cell Applications, Inc.). Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were obtained from Cell Application and cultured in EBM-2 endothelial cell basic medium with Bulletkit (Cambrex, Inc., Charles City, IA) containing hydrocortisone, fibroblast growth factor B, vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, epidermal growth factor, GA-1000, heparin, and 2% fetal calf serum. Primary HUVECs were collected from human umbilical cords as described previously (10Senthil D. Raveendran M. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Dudley D. Wang J. Wang X.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine. All types of cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The siRNA duplex and plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol. Northern Blot and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and small RNAs were isolated from the cultured cells using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit. For Northern blots of sir-RNA, 20 μg of RNA was resolved on 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels, and electrophoresized with 130 V for 2 h at room temperature. The resolved RNAs were transferred to the positively charged Nylon membrane. The synthesized antisense 27-nt oligonucleotide probe according to the 27-nt repeat sequence in the eNOS intron 4 was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by the T4 kinase. For eNOS mRNA detection, RNase protection assays were performed by using the RNase Protection Assay III kit from Ambion, Austin, TX, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five to 20 μg of total RNA was used per reaction. Cyclophilin antisense control template was obtained from Ambion and labeled using T7 RNA polymerase. Primer sequences for RT-PCRs were as follows: eNOS, 5′-CGAACAGCGGCTTCAAGAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGATCCGGCCCACGCAGCG-3′; β-actin, 5′-AAAGACCTGTACGCCAACAC-3′ and 5′-GTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGAT-3′. The protocol for quantitative real-time RT-PCR was the same as described previously (17Zhang J. Jin X. Fang S. Wang R. Li Y. Wang N. Guo W. Wang Y. Wen D. Wei L. Dong Z. Kuang G. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1748-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assay, the cultured cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 300 μl of cold cell lysis buffer (Promega), and lysed by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). One microliter of a 1:50 dilution of the lysate was added to 100 μl of luciferase assay regent (Promega), and luciferase activity was detected with a luminometer (TD-20/20 Turner Designs). Protein concentrations of crude lysates were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize activity values. Western Blot—Proteins extracted from the cultured cells were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% milk overnight at 4 °C, the membrane was washed extensively with TBS-T before incubation with secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membrane was visualized with ECL plus reagents for chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Statistic Analyses—All quantitative data were presented as the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments and compared by Student’s t test for between group differences. The p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Association between the Expressions of the 27-nt sir-RNA and eNOS—Because 27nt sir-RNA is likely derived from the eNOS gene, we first evaluated the possible relationship in the expression between the two. Among the HUVECs collected from different individuals (10Senthil D. Raveendran M. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Dudley D. Wang J. Wang X.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we selected HUVECs with the confirmed 5 × 27-nt repeat homozygotes (n = 3) or 4 × 27-nt repeat homozygotes (n = 3) defined by PCR genotyping described earlier (10Senthil D. Raveendran M. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Dudley D. Wang J. Wang X.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We cultured these cells to full confluence. Total RNA and proteins were isolated from the cultured cells. Expression of 27nt sir-RNA was analyzed by Northern blot; expression of eNOS was measured by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR for mRNA and Western blot for the protein levels. As shown in Fig. 1A, HUVECs with 5 × 27-nt repeats had higher 27nt sir-RNA levels than those with 4 × 27-nt repeats (49.8 ± 3.9 versus 39.6 ± 1.6, p < 0.05). However, the levels of eNOS protein (Fig. 1B) and mRNA (Fig. 1C) were significantly reduced in HUVECs with 5 × 27-nt repeats than those with 4 × 27-nt repeats (eNOS protein: 26.1 ± 0.1 versus 40.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.05). Tissue-specific Expression of the 27nt sir-RNA—To explore the cell-specific expression in the 27nt sir-RNA, we isolated or purchased total RNA from 12 different types of human cells or tissues. We measured the 27nt sir-RNA and eNOS mRNA using Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 2, the 27nt sir-RNA was only detectable in HAECs, which corresponded with the expression of eNOS mRNA. Expression of the 27nt sir-RNA by the eNOS cDNA-Intron 4 Constructs—Because the 27nt sir-RNA is co-expressed with the eNOS, we designed experiments to investigate the mechanisms responsible for 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis. We generated three constructs as outlined in Fig. 3A. These constructs were built based on the pCMV-2B-eNOS full-length cDNA plasmid generated in our laboratory (18Gan Y. Shen Y.H. Wang J. Wang X. Utama B. Wang X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16467-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Gan Y. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Wang J. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In Vector 1, the DNA fragment containing the entire intron 4 sequence was inserted. To not disrupt the eNOS coding cDNA, we selected the ScaI site and the insert contained the sequence from part of exon 3 to the entire intron 4 (4674 to 6498 bp) with the ScaI adaptor added at both ends. The vectors with correct sequence and orientation determined by the direct sequencing were selected for the study. Intron 4 spans from 5006 to 6498 bp; the 5 × 27-nt repeat containing the region starts at 5331 to 5446 bp. Vector 2 contained only a part of intron 4 (5130 to 6430 bp), which includes 5 × 27-nt repeats but with intron 4 splicing junctions at 5′ and 3′ ends being removed. Vector 3 had no eNOS cDNA but has the cloned segment of 4674 to 6498 bp inserted at the 3′ end of the vector CMV promoter. All three constructs were then transfected into HeLa cells. We chose HeLa as the host cells because they have the necessary eNOS expression machineries but without endogenous 27nt sir-RNA (11Zhang M.X. Ou H. Shen Y.H. Wang J. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16967-16972Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Ou H. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Wang J. Wang X. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection; 27nt sir-RNA was measured by Northern blot using 32P-labeled 27-nt oligonucleotide probe. As shown in Fig. 3B, only Vector 1, which contains the full-length eNOS cDNA and complete intron 4 with 5′ and 3′ splicing junctions intact, produced the 27nt sir-RNA similarly as the HAECs. Removal of splicing junctions in Vector 2 abolished the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis. This suggests that a splicing process similar to eNOS pre-mRNA splicing may be required for the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis. Lack of 27nt sir-RNA production in Vector 3 indicates that DNA sequences up to exon 3 upstream of 27-nt repeats are not sufficient to drive the expression of the 27nt sir-RNA. To further evaluate the relationship between the numbers of the 27-nt repeats and the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis, we generated the pCMV-eNOS cDNA-intron 4 construct containing 10 × 27-nt repeats based on the design of Vector 1. We transfected the vectors containing either 5 × 27- or 10 × 27-nt repeats into HeLa cells and HAEC total RNA and the protein were extracted 48 h post-transfection. Fig. 3C (upper panel) shows the 27nt sir-RNA in transfection HeLa cells by Northern blot. The 10 × 27-nt repeat construct produced significantly more 27nt sir-RNA (70.3 ± 0.5) than those of the 5 × 27-nt construct (32.9 ± 2.8, p < 0.05). To investigate whether the overexpressed 27-nt RNA suppressed the host cell eNOS expression, we further transfected these two vectors to HAECs. The eNOS expression by Western blot in HAECs transfected with the 10 × 27-nt construct had significantly lower eNOS protein than those transfected with the 5 × 27-nt construct (eNOS protein: 9.6 ± 0.2 versus 80.3 ± 0.4, p < 0.01). Role of eNOS Pre-mRNA Splicing in 27nt sir-RNA Biogenesis—Because deletion analysis showed that splicing junctions of intron 4 were essential for the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis, we further investigated the role of eNOS pre-mRNA splicing in 27nt sir-RNA production by mutating the nucleotides in the splicing junctions. Fig. 4 shows the schematic design of the mutagenesis at the 5′ end GCGA|GTGC and 3′ end GCTCAG|GT splice junctions of the eNOS intron 4. Vector 1 as described in the legend to Fig. 3 was used as the template for mutagenesis. We designed two pairs of specific mutation primers to introduce a mutation at the 5′ end from GT to AT, and at the 3′ end from AG to CG. Vector-a is the wild-type control; Vector-b contains a mutation at the 5′ end; Vector-c contains a mutation at the 3′ end; Vector-d contains mutations at both 5′ and 3′ ends. Forty-eight hours after transfection of these constructs to the HeLa cells, total RNA was extracted for 27nt sir-RNA detection. As shown in Fig. 4, mutations at either splicing junction of intron 4 abolished the biogenesis of the 27nt sir-RNA, and caused accumulation of specific pre-sir-RNA sized ∼150 nt. Possibility of an Independent Promoter Drives 27nt sir-RNA Expression—To study the possibility that an independent promoter may be responsible for the expression of 27nt sir-RNA, we first prepared serial deletion reporter constructs by cloning the 5′-flanking sequence 1.5-kb upstream of the 27-nt repeats at eNOS intron 4 into the luciferase reporter vectors (Fig. 5A), which were then transfected to HeLa cells. At 48 h post-transfection, we measured luciferase activity and luciferase mRNA levels. Our experiment showed no promoter activity of this region. To investigate the possibility that the luciferase reporter vector coding regions for transcription and translation may not be suitable to study the function of the promoter that drives the small RNA expression, we further cloned 766 bp upstream of the 27-nt repeats together with the entire eNOS intron 4 into the pGL3-basic vector at the KpnI and XhoI sites (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5B, the construct produced no 27nt sir-RNA, which suggests no independent promoter exists for the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis, at least not within the 766-bp upstream region. Relevance of MicroRNA Processing Machinery in the 27nt sir-RNA Biogenesis—We next examined the relevance of common processing machineries for small RNAs in the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis. It has generally been assumed that RNase type III Drosha is responsible for the nuclear small RNA, particularly miRNA, process to produce precursor miRNA. Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 and processed into miRNA duplexes through the action of the cytoplasmic type III RNase Dicer. To study whether Dicer or Drosha is also involved in 27nt sir-RNA processing, we suppressed the expression of Dicer or Drosha by transfecting Drosha- or Dicer-specific siRNA to HAECs (Fig. 6A). Total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection and subjected to Northern blot for 27nt sir-RNA detection. We showed that repression of Drosha or Dicer resulted in significant reduction in the 27nt sir-RNA expression (Fig. 6B). The reduced 27nt sir-RNA corresponded with increased host gene eNOS expression (Fig. 6C). In the same RNA extracts, which were extracted 24 h after the respective Drosha- or Dicer-specific siRNA treatment, we also found that whereas the Dicer or Drosha knockdown reduced the expression of 27nt sir-RNA, the 27-nt specific pre-sir-RNA was accumulated (Fig. 6D). Although we have attempted to classify this intronic repeat-derived small RNA as a miRNA (11Zhang M.X. Ou H. Shen Y.H. Wang J. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16967-16972Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), most features in biogenesis, processing, and possible mechanisms of effects on target genes do not meet the criteria as a classical miRNA. Our current study suggests that 27nt sir-RNA is derived from the 27-nt repeat sequence in eNOS intron 4 through the eNOS pre-mRNA splicing. The more the number of 27-nt repeats, the more the 27nt sir-RNA is produced. This association is biologically significant because the number of 27-nt repeats in eNOS intron 4 is reported to be associated with risk of myocardial infarction, especially in smokers (20Wang X.L. Sim A.S. Badenhop R.F. McCredie R.M. Wilcken D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We further discovered that nuclear actin tended to bind to the 27-nt repeat element and partially attenuate the 27-nt RNA-mediated eNOS suppression (12Ou H. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Wang J. Wang X. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currently, several types of small RNAs have been described: miRNA, piwiRNA (21Aravin A. Gaidatzis D. Pfeffer S. Lagos-Quintana M. Landgraf P. Iovino N. Morris P. Brownstein M.J. Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Nakano T. Chien M. Russo J.J. Ju J. Sheridan R. Sander C. Zavolan M. Tuschl T. Nature. 2006; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), siRNA, tiny noncoding RNA, heterochromatic siRNAs, and repeat-associated small RNAs in plants and animals (22Ambros V. Lee R.C. Lavanway A. Williams P.T. Jewell D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 807-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 23Aravin A.A. Lagos-Quintana M. Yalcin A. Zavolan M. Marks D. Snyder B. Gaasterland T. Meyer J. Tuschl T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Some of these small RNAs could be present only during the developmental stage or be responsible for tissue-specific expressions (23Aravin A.A. Lagos-Quintana M. Yalcin A. Zavolan M. Marks D. Snyder B. Gaasterland T. Meyer J. Tuschl T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These small RNAs typically are ∼21-25 nt in length; longer ones are mostly from repeat-associated small RNAs (23Aravin A.A. Lagos-Quintana M. Yalcin A. Zavolan M. Marks D. Snyder B. Gaasterland T. Meyer J. Tuschl T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Although siRNAs are typically from an exogenous source or during virus infection, miRNAs are mainly transcribed through designated genomic sequences (24Cullen B.R. Virus Res. 2004; 102: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In some cases, the miRNAs can also be derived from transcribed introns spliced during the nuclear pre-mRNA process (14Zeng Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6156-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25Kim Y.K. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). There is a clear definition for what qualifies as miRNA, which is a distinct ∼22-nt RNA transcript detected by Northern blot. Biogenesis criteria include existence of 50-80-nt pre-miRNA stem-loops to be processed by the Microprocessor complex of nucleases and associated factors, including the RNase III Drosha and its partner DGCR8/Pasha within the nucleus (26Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 342: 49-56PubMed Google Scholar). Through exportin-5, the pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and processed by Dicer to become mature miRNAs, which will stay in the cytoplasm to either induce target mRNA degradation or directly inhibit translation (24Cullen B.R. Virus Res. 2004; 102: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Contrary to siRNA, which requires a perfect sequence match and initiates gene-specific inhibition, miRNA does not require a perfect match of the target mRNA and can regulate more than 200 target mRNAs (27Rajewsky N. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). A recent description of intronic microRNA pre-miRNAs (mirtrons) was reported (28Ruby J.G. Jan C.H. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 29Berezikov E. Chung W.J. Willis J. Cuppen E. Lai E.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 328-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), which bears the closest resemblance to the sir-RNA we discovered. Unlike the classical miRNA, the biogenesis of mirtrons is processed without the involvement of Drosha-mediated cleavage. Nevertheless, our 27-nt small RNA has the following biological features, which are somehow distinct from most existing small RNAs. They include the exclusive nuclear presence of the 27nt sir-RNA, which is derived from the intronic repeat sequence (11Zhang M.X. Ou H. Shen Y.H. Wang J. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16967-16972Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Ou H. Shen Y.H. Utama B. Wang J. Wang X. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It appears only specifically inhibiting the host eNOS gene rather than several hundred unrelated genes (11Zhang M.X. Ou H. Shen Y.H. Wang J. Coselli J. Wang X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16967-16972Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The regulatory target stays within the nucleus by regulating eNOS gene transcription or pre-mRNA splicing directly. Using the RNA mfold web server, several stem-loop structures can be modeled with the 5 × 27-nt repeat sequence. Fig. 7 shows two examples of the modeling by including only the 27-nt repeat sequence. However, it is not clear how multiple copies of the 27-nt RNA can be cleaved from the repeat sequence of the single stem-loop structure. Our experiments have clearly shown that the number of 27-nt repeats is linearly associated with the amount of 27nt sir-RNA. These biological features suggest that our 27-nt small RNA is either a new class of small RNA, i.e. sir-RNA, or an atypical form of the existing miRNA or mirtrons. However, the fact that Dicer suppression led to decreased 27nt sir-RNA expression suggests that the cytoplasmic process may also be involved. This finding is somewhat inconsistent with the fact of the exclusive nuclear presence of the 27nt sir-RNA. It is possible that the effect of Dicer suppression on the 27nt sir-RNA is an indirect one. It is also possible that protein knockdown did not translate to functional knockdown in which the observed findings are not direct relationships between Drosha and 27nt sir-RNA or Dicer and 27nt sir-RNA. Alternatively, the 27nt sir-RNA biogenesis indeed involves a cytoplasmic process although this appears to be biologically redundant because the 27nt sir-RNA is derived from the nucleus and functions within the nucleus. One of the underlying assumptions in our experiments is that the sequence of the 27-nt sir-RNA is unique and exactly equivalent to the 27-nt intron 4 repeat sequence. However, this may not be exactly correct. The observed 27nt sir-RNA may be a family of closely related sequences. More experiments are clearly needed to resolve these issues. With the genome-wide existence of similar short intronic repeat sequence (30Bennett E.A. Coleman L.E. Tsui C. Pittard W.S. Devine S.E.

With varying numbers of the repeats between individuals, the sir-RNA based regulation could be responsible for individual differences in phenotypic expression, hence disease susceptibility. The more the host gene is transcribed, the more gene-specific sir-RNA will be produced, which forms a negative feedback regulatory loop to fine-tune the host gene expression. Variable numbers of the polymorphic repeats in populations will be responsible for quantitative individual differences in the expressed genes. More specifically, the 27-nt repeats in eNOS intron 4 can be converted to 27nt sir-RNA and functions as a negative feedback regulator of eNOS expression. Individuals with different numbers of 27-nt repeats will have different levels of 27nt sir-RNA, which is responsible for individual differences in eNOS expression, hence susceptibility to vascular diseases."

Takahashi H. Michishita I. Sugano Z. Konoshi K. Clin. Biochem. 2002; 35: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Specifically, uptake of oxLDL into the endothelium is mediated through interaction with the lectin-like oxLDL receptor (LOX-1). This receptor was reported to be overexpressed in human atherosclerotic lesions (2Kataoka H. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Minami M. Moriwaki H. Murase T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Hashimoto N. Kita T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of LOX-1 in an apoE-deficient background increases atherosclerotic plaque incidence (3Inoue K. Arai Y. Kurihara H. Kita T. Sawamura T. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and LOX-1 expression is highly correlated with plaque instability (4Ishino S.

In strong contrast, deletion of LOX-1 reduces atherogenesis in LDLR knockout mice fed a high cholesterol diet (5Mehta J.L. Sanada N. Hu C.P. Chen J. Dandapat A. Sugawara F. Satoh H. Inoue K. Kawase Y. Jishage K. Suzuki H. Takeya M. Schnackenberg L. Beger R. Hermonat P.L. Thomas M. Sawamura T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human genetic studies link LOX-1 polymorphisms to cardiovascular disease susceptibility (6Mango R. Biocca S. del Vecchio F. Clementi F. Sangiuolo F. Amati F. Filareto A. Grelli S. Spitalieri P. Filesi I. Favalli C. Lauro R. Mehta J.L. Romeo F. Novelli G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Mechanistically, oxLDL fosters intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (7Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H.

Res. 2004; 94: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for ROS to cause oxidative DNA damage in endothelium (11Wei Y.H. Lu C.Y. Lee H.C. Pang C.Y. Ma Y.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), which contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and to instability of plaques (13Cai H. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, 14Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 2001; 11: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In patients with cardiovascular disease, the levels of oxLDL and circulating 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) DNA-adducts correlate well (16Inoue T. Inoue K. Maeda H. Takayanagi K. Morooka S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2001; 305: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, 8-OH-dG is an established marker for oxidative DNA damage (17Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and 8-OH-dG is elevated in human atherosclerotic plaques of carotid endarterectomy specimens (18Martinet W. Knaapen M.W. De Meyer G.R. Herman A.G. Kockx M.M. Circulation. 2002; 106: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Specifically, the cellular responses to DNA damage may include regulation of transcription factors, notably, c-Jun (19Jang J.H. Surh Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), p53 (20Nicol C.J. Harrison M.L. Laposa R.R. Gimelshtein I.L. Wells P.G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and NFκB (21Klaunig J.E. Kamendulis L.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). More recently, the homeodomain transcription factor Oct-1 was added to the growing list of transcription factors regulated upon DNA damage (22Zhao H. Jin S. Fan F. Fan W. Tong T. Zhan Q. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6276-6280PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence for Oct-1 to play an essential role in vascular biology and was found to be up-regulated in dedifferentiated endothelium (23Thum T. Haverich A. Borlak J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Oct-1 was shown to regulate, at least in part, LOX-1 receptor activity (24Chen J. Liu Y. Liu H. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Fadel B.M. Boutet S.C. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1247-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As of today, the role of Oct-1 in oxLDL-induced vascular injury is uncertain. This transcription factor recognizes an octamer sequence (ATGTAAAT) in promoters of target genes (27Groenen M.A. Dijkhof R.J. van der Poel J.J. van Diggelen R. Verstege E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4311-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which encode proteins for the regulation of development, immune response, cellular repair, and general metabolism (25Fadel B.M.

Previous studies are suggestive for Oct-1 to function as a repressor for certain endothelial-expressed enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 epoxygenases (23Thum T. Haverich A. Borlak J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Sterling K. Bresnick E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 329-337PubMed Google Scholar). These epoxygenases catalyze production of endogenous vasoactive molecules, including epoxy fatty acids, of which 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) was reported to be an endothelial-derived hyperpolarization factor (EDHF) (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fleming I. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 49: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Oct-1 may therefore provide a missing link between oxidative DNA damage and impaired metabolic function of endothelium upon exposure to oxidized lipoproteins.Here, we studied the effects of oxLDL on oxidative DNA damage and Oct-1 expression in cultures of human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAEC). We evaluated whether Oct-1 up-regulation after oxidative stress may be mechanistically linked to repressed CYP monooxygenases activity and EDHF production. We also studied whether LOX-1 blockade would prevent DNA damage and reverse metabolic impairment of HCAECs when exposed to oxLDL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—HCAECs and EGM-2MV medium were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human atherosclerotic aortae were obtained from cardiac explants (34Thum T. Borlak J. Lancet. 2000; 355: 979-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Healthy control aortic protein extracts were obtained from Biocat (Heidelberg, Germany). In addition, atherosclerotic aortae were explanted from apoE knockout mice fed with a high lipid diet for >4 months, as well as from healthy control mice (C57/BL6, Harlan-Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany). The total RNA Isolation system and the NucleoSpin Tissue kit were from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). Aprotinin, deoxyguanosine (dG), hydrolyzed samples, 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG), and 8-OH-dG standards were from Sigma. Rotiblock, skim milk powder, and Tween-20 was from Roth. Oct-1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany) and the anti-rabbit antibody from Chemicon (Hofheim, Germany). [32P]ATP and Microspin G-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (München, Germany). T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Pefabloc was from Roche Applied Science (Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany). Bovine serum albumin was from PAA (Linz, Austria).Preparation of LDL, oxLDL, and moxLDL—LDL was isolated from human plasma by sequential gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL was prepared by incubation of LDL with 5 μmol of CuSO4 for 24 h at 37 °C. moxLDL was prepared by incubation with 10 μmol of Fe2+(SO4) for 24 h at 37 °C as described (34Thum T. Borlak J. Lancet. 2000; 355: 979-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Oxidation was monitored using the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay with tetraethoxypropane as an internal standard (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation was stopped by addition of butylated hydroxytoluene (100 μm). Note, the level of oxidation strongly differed between fully (Cu2+)-oxidized LDL (35 nm malonedialdeyde/mg protein) versus minimally (Fe2+)-oxidized LDL (3 nm malonedialdeyde/mg protein). For comparison the TBARS assay revealed no detectable concentration of malonedialdeyde in native LDL preparations.Cell Culture—Primary HCAECs were cultured in 75-cm2 plastic flasks in EGM-2MV medium. Confluent cultures were detached by trypsin/EDTA and plated on 6 wells until 90% confluence was reached. Cultured endothelial cells (fourth passage) were checked by reverse phase contrast microscopy before and after treatment with oxLDL (magnification 20-fold). We additionally examined expression of the endothelial-specific surface protein PECAM-1 to control for cellular differentiation using fluorescence-activated flow cytometry, as described previously (23Thum T. Haverich A. Borlak J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Endothelial cells were treated with increasing doses of oxLDL (10–100 μg/ml) for 24 h. Dose selection was based on published and clinically confirmed oxLDL plasma levels (36Holvoet P. Vanhaecke J. Janssens S. Van de Werf F. Collen D. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). As a positive control for the induction of DNA damage, we additionally subjected HCAECs in PBS to UV-C irradiation (wavelength, 254 nm; dose, 10–50 J/m-2), as described (37Tong T. Fan W. Zhao H. Jin S. Fan F. Blanck P. Alomo I. Rajasekaran B. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Zhan Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Then medium was changed from PBS to EGM-2MV, and 8 h later, Oct-1 expression levels were determined as described below.RNA and cDNA—RNA was isolated from endothelial cells using a total RNA Isolation system according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Quality and quantity of isolated RNA was checked using capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of total RNA from each sample were used for reverse transcription, as described previously (34Thum T. Borlak J. Lancet. 2000; 355: 979-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA was frozen at -20 °C until further experimentation.Real-time and Semi-quantitative PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was done with the Lightcycler (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), as described (23Thum T. Haverich A. Borlak J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s, the PCR reaction was initiated with an annealing temperature of 55 °C for 8 s followed by an extension phase for 8 s (GADD45 and GADD153) or 14 s (Oct-1) at 72 °C and a denaturation cycle at 95 °C for 1 s. The PCR reaction was stopped after a total of 40 cycles, and at the end of each extension phase, fluorescence was observed and used for quantitative measurements within the linear range of amplification. Oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-tcagcgcacgatcactgtc (forward primer) and 5′-ccagcaggcacaacaccac (reverse primer) for detection of the GADD45 gene, 5′-tgaccctgcttctctggctt (forward primer) and 5′-ctgggaggtgcttgtgacct (reverse primer) for the GADD153 gene and 5′-gaatcaacccaccaagcagt (forward primer) and 5′-ggagtggaggtggtctgtgt (reverse primer) for the Oct-1 gene. Exact quantification was achieved by a serial dilution with cDNA produced from endothelial total RNA extracts using 1:5 dilution steps. Gene expression levels were then given as the ratio of the gene of interest (nominator) versus a stable expressed housekeeping gene (cyclophilin A, denominator) (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schmid H. Cohen C.D. Henger A. Irrgang S. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 356-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Semi-quantitative gene expression of CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2J2 was performed and analyzed as previously described (Ref. 9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and supplemental Table S2).Quantitative Measurement of 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine—Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured HCAECs treated with oxLDL (10–100 μg/ml) or oxLDL (100 μg/ml) + κ-carrageenan (250 μm), as well as from appropriate controls using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit. DNA (90 μl) was digested with nuclease P1 (5 μg), zinc chloride (3 μl, 20 mmol), and HCl (3 μl, 200 mmol) for 30 min at 45 °C. Then, Tris buffer (3 μl, 500mmol) and 2 μl of alkaline phosphatase were added and further incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to yield free deoxynucleosides. To determine the amount of dG, hydrolyzed samples and 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) and 8-OH-dG standards were injected onto a LiChrochart 250-4 (100RP18, 5 μm) HPLC column (Merck). Deoxyguanosine was detected at 255 nm, and calibration of the system was done with dG and 8-OH-dG as appropriate standards.Production of 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid (EET)—We used an HPLC electrospray MS2 method to detect 11,12-EET production in cultures of HCAECs as described (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCAECs were treated with 100 μg/ml oxLDL for 24 h, and then production of 11,12-EET was analyzed.Intracellular ROS Measurements—After treatment with oxLDL (10, 20, and 100 μg/ml; 24 h) or native LDL (100 μg/ml; 24 h), cells were incubated with 10 μmol of 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The 100 μg/ml oxLDL group was also concomitantly treated with the competitive oxLDL-receptor antagonist κ-carrageenan (250 μmol, 24 h). Endothelial cells were harvested, centrifuged for 5 min, and 1200 rpm at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended with 800 μl of PBS buffer. Fluorescence emission was detected at 530 nm ± 30 nm (fluorescin) after excitation of cells at 488 nm using flow cytometry (FACScan, Beckton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—HCAEC nuclear extracts were prepared by the modified Dignam C method (39Niehof M. Streetz K. Rakemann T. Bischoff S.C. Manns M.P. Horn F. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9016-9027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 24 h after treatment with oxLDL (100 μg/ml), oxLDL (100 μg/ml) + κ-carrageenan (250 μmol), oxLDL (100 μg/ml) + chelerythrine (1 μmol), or nLDL (100 μg/ml), cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1780 × g, and 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mmol of Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmol of MgCl2, 140 mmol of NaCl, 1 mmol of dithiothreitol, 4 mmol of Pefabloc, 40 mmol of β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol of Na3VO4, 10 μl of aprotinin/ml buffer, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4 °C, transferred onto one volume of 50% sucrose in hypotonic buffer (see above), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Nuclei were resuspended in Dignam C buffer (20 mmol of Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmol of NaCl, 1.5 mmol of MgCl2, 0.2 mmol of EDTA, 1 mmol of dithiothreitol, 4 mmol of Pefabloc, 40 mmol of β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol of Na3VO4, and 10 μl of aprotinin/ml buffer) and gently rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and extracts were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined as described (40Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18442) Google Scholar).Western Blotting Experiments—Western immunoblotting was done as follows: Nuclear protein (100 μg) extracts from cultured endothelial cells were denaturated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN, Dreieich, Germany) at 350 mA for 2 h in a buffer containing 400 mmol of glycine, 50 mmol of Tris, pH 8.3. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Rotiblock and 5% skim milk powder (Roth, Germany) in TBS buffer. After electroblotting of proteins, membranes were incubated with a polyclonal antibody for Oct-1 (dilution 1:50; sc-8024, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. For detection of human or murine LOX-1 expression we used a polyclonal LOX-1 antibody (ab60178; dilution 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After washing with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 diluted anti-rabbit antibody (both for Oct-1 and LOX-1) for 1 h at room temperature followed by three successive washes with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Dreieich, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and bands were scanned with the Kodak Image Station CF 440 and analyzed using the Kodak 1D 3.5 imaging software (Eastman Kodak Company).Annealing of Synthetic Oligonucleotides and 32P Labeling—Oligonucleotide sequences can be obtained from supplemental Table S1 and the corresponding 5′,3′ and 3′,5′ sequences were annealed at a concentration of 19.2 pmol/μl in 200 mmol of Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mmol of MgCl2, and 500 mmol of NaCl at 80 °C for 10 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature overnight and were stored at 4 °C. Annealed oligonucleotides were diluted to 1:10 in Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer and labeled using [32P]ATP (250 μCi, 3.000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. End-labeled probes were purified from nonincorporated [32P]ATP by a Microspin G-25 column and eluted in a 100-μl volume.Electromobility Gel Shift Assay (EMSA)—The procedure for EMSA was adapted from a previously described method (39Niehof M. Streetz K. Rakemann T. Bischoff S.C. Manns M.P. Horn F. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9016-9027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of endothelial nuclear extract was incubated with binding buffer consisting of 25 mmol HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mmol of MgCl2, 34 mmol of KCl, 2 mmol of dithiothreitol, 2 mmol of Pefabloc, 0.5 μl of aprotinin (2.2 mg/ml), 50 ng of poly(dl-dC), and 80 ng of bovine serum albumin. The binding reaction was carried out for 20 min on ice and free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Competition studies were done by adding a specified amount (50-fold) of unlabeled oligonucleotides or a specific Oct-1 antibody to the reaction mix 10 min before addition of the labeled oligonucleotides. In addition, we also incubated nuclear extracts with excess addition of mutated Oct-1 consensus binding sites. Gels were blotted to Whatman 3 MM paper, dried under vacuum, exposed to imaging screens (Imaging Screen-K, Bio-Rad) for autoradiography for 24 h at room temperature and analyzed using a phosphorimaging system (Molecular Imager FX pro plus; Bio-Rad) and the Quantity One Version 4.2.2 software (Bio-Rad).Immunohistochemistry—HCAECs were fixed and permeabilized as described (41Thum T. Hoeber S. Froese S. Klink I. Stichtenoth D.O. Galuppo P. Jakob M. Tsikas D. Anker S.D. Poole-Wilson P.A. Borlak J. Ertl G. Bauersachs J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Oct-1 expression was determined after addition of an anti-Oct-1 antibody (Abcam; ab51363; dilution 1:10) for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed and an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was added for 1 h at 37 °C (dilution 1:200). In addition, nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI). Then cells were observed under appropriate fluorescence microscopy conditions as described (41Thum T. Hoeber S. Froese S. Klink I. Stichtenoth D.O. Galuppo P. Jakob M. Tsikas D. Anker S.D. Poole-Wilson P.A. Borlak J. Ertl G. Bauersachs J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Cytochrome P450 Promoters—We searched for Oct-1 binding sites in the promoters of CYP1A1, CYP2A6/7, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2J2, and eNOS using the transcription factor data base TRANSFAC Professional 6.2 and the program Matrix Search for Transcription Factor Binding Sites (MATCH™ 1.7; Biobase). Core and matrix similarities for all binding sites were set to 1.0 and 0.85, respectively, to obtain highly specific results.Small Interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated Knockdown of Oct-1 in HCAECs—HCAECs were cultured to 70–80% of confluence and were transfected with Oct-1-siRNA using the BLOCK-iT™ Transfection kit (Invitrogen). We incubated HCAECs with the siRNA oligonucleotide Oct-1 (50 nm; sc-36119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 48 h to down-regulate Oct-1 expression. FITC-labeled scrambled siRNA (Control-FITC block-it fluorescent Oligo 2013, Invitrogen) was used as a negative and transfection control. Oct-1 expression was monitored by Western blotting (see above).RESULTSOxLDL Induced Oxidative DNA Damage in HCAECs—LOX-1 was highly expressed in atherosclerotic aortic tissue of ApoE-/- mice fed a high lipid diet or humans aortae of patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease when compared with appropriate controls (Fig. 1A). This suggests pathophysiological relevance of LOX-1 up-regulation in atherosclerosis. We next focused on effects of LOX-1-mediated oxLDL uptake in HCAEcs in vitro. Based on microscopic evaluation, there were no signs of altered morphology or cellular toxicity after treatment of cell cultures with increasing doses of oxLDL (10–300 μg/ml; 24 h). LDH leakage was used as a marker for membrane integrity and was assayed after treatment of cell cultures with incremental doses of oxLDL (24 h). Notably, oxLDL induced LDH leakage into culture medium with >40 units/liter at the highest dose (data not shown). Based on LDH activity, we used 100 μg/ml oxLDL as the best tolerable non-cytotoxic dose. We chose the 24-h time point for subsequent studies, because we and others (9Thum T. Borlak J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hu B. Li D. Sawamura T. Mehta J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated enhanced ROS production in HCAECs to be significantly elevated after 24 h of treatment with oxLDL. The expression of PECAM-1 (CD31) served as an endothelial differentiation marker and was expressed by >95% of cultured cells, as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). Treatment of HCAECs with oxLDL (100 μg/ml; 24 h) increased intracellular ROS production by 4.5-fold, whereas native (non-oxidized) LDL had no effect (Fig. 1B). ROS production was attenuated when κ-carrageenan, a competitive LOX-1 inhibitor, was added (Fig. 1B). Treatment of HCAECs with oxLDL resulted in a dose-dependent 4-fold increase of the stress-inducible transcripts GADD45 and GADD153 (Fig. 2A). Both GADDs were additionally up-regulated in atherosclerotic human aortae (Fig. 2B). Likewise, moxLDL increased expression of GADDs (Fig. 3A). Production of 8-OH-dG was up to 3-fold increased after treatment of HCAECs with oxLDL (Fig. 2C). LOX-1 inhibition with κ-carrageenan abrogated induction of GADD transcripts and formation of the 8-OH-dG DNA adduct (Fig. 2). Addition of native LDL (100 μg/ml) had no effect.FIGURE 2A, semiquantitative gene expression of GADD45 and GADD153 in control, nLDL (100 μg/ml), and oxLDL (10–100 μg/ml)-treated endothelial c"

We have focused on the application of BDNF to the regeneration of periodontal tissue and indicated that BDNF promotes the regeneration of experimentally created periodontal defects. Cementoblasts form cementum, mineralized tissue, which is key to establishing a functional periodontium. The application of BDNF to the regeneration of periodontal tissue requires elucidation of the mechanism by which BDNF regulates the functions of cementoblasts. In this study, we examined how BDNF regulates the mRNA expression of bone/cementum-related proteins (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)) in cultures of immortalized human cementoblast-like (HCEM) cells. BDNF elevated the mRNA levels of ALP, OPN, and BMP-2 in HCEM cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for TRKB, a high affinity receptor of BDNF, siRNA for ELK-1, which is a downstream target of ERK1/2, and PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, obviated the increase in the mRNA levels. BDNF increased the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Elk-1, and the blocking of BDNF signaling by treatment with siRNA for TRKB and PD98059 suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1. Furthermore, BDNF increased the levels of phosphorylated c-Raf, which activates the ERK signaling pathway. These findings provide the first evidence that the TrkB-c-Raf-ERK1/2-Elk-1 signaling pathway is required for the BDNF-induced mRNA expression of ALP, OPN, and BMP-2 in HCEM cells.

Elk-1 and c-Raf as well as ERK may be intercellular signaling molecules due to be stimulated by BDNF in cementoblasts.In this study, to clarify the actions of BDNF in bone/cementum-related protein expression in cementoblasts, we investigate the mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and regulatory mechanisms in cultures of HCEM cells. For the first time, we demonstrate that BDNF promotes the mRNA expression of ALP, OPN, and BMP-2 in HCEM cells through a TrkB-c-Raf-ERK1/2-Elk-1 signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—HCEM cells, immortalized by transfection of the hTERT gene, were established by Kitagawa et al. (17Kitagawa M. Tahara H. Kitagawa S. Oka H. Kudo Y. Sato S. Ogawa I. Miyaichi M. Takata T. Bone (N.Y.). 2006; 39: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin G solution (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (medium A). Human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture Ham's F-12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, Sigma) supplemented with 1% MEM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin G solution (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (medium B). HCEM cells and SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Small Interfering RNA (siRNAs)—Chemically synthesized anti-TrkB (Silencer® pre-designed siRNA TRKB 753 and 754), anti-p75NTR (Silencer® pre-designed siRNA nerve growth factor receptor 4804 and 4222), and anti-Elk (Silencer® validated siRNA ELK-1 42384 and Silencer® pre-designed siRNA ELK-1 114510) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Negative control siRNA (Silencer® Negative Control 1 siRNA, Ambion) was used to assess nonspecific gene-silencing effects.Transfection of siRNAs into HCEM Cells—Electroporation with ECM 830® (BTX, Holliston, MA) was used for the transfection of each siRNA into HCEM cells. HCEM cells (1.0 × 105) were suspended in 75 μl of siRNA Electroporation Buffer (Ambion) with 1.5 μg of each siRNA and placed into 1-mm cuvettes. Transfections were performed with 900 V, a 70-μs pulse length, and 2 pulses between 5 s. After the pulses, the cells were incubated for 8 min at 37 °C and suspended in medium A. The transfected cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well culture plates and cultured in medium A. The effectiveness of the knockdown was determined by quantifying the level of the target genes and proteins by real time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, as described below.Isolation of Total RNA—HCEM cells with or without transfection of the siRNAs were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plastic culture plates and maintained in medium A. The HCEM cells were pretreated with or without PD98059 (50 μm, Calbiochem), SB203580 (10 μm, Calbiochem), SP600125 (10 μm, Calbiochem), or PDTC (10 μm, Calbiochem) for 30 min and then exposed to various concentrations of human recombinant BDNF (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for specified periods before the end of incubation in α-MEM supplemented with penicillin G solution (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (medium C). SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plastic culture plates and maintained for 7 days in medium B. Total RNA from each culture was extracted with ISOGEN® (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and quantified by spectrometry at 260 and 280 nm.Real Time PCR—mRNA expressions of ALP, OPN, and BMP-2 and mRNA expression knocked down by the siRNAs were quantified by real time PCR. The PCR was carried out in two steps with a Lightcycler system using SYBR Green (Roche Diagnostics). The sense primers and antisense primers used to detect the mRNA of ALP, BMP-2, OPN, TRKB, p75NTR, ELK-1, and GAPDH are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Sense primers and antisense primers for real time PCRTarget genePrimer sequenceALPForward, 5′-GCGGTGAACGAGAGAATG-3′Reverse, 5′-CGTAGTTCTGCTCGTGCAC-3′BMP-2Forward, 5′-CTGTATCGCAGGCACTCA-3′Reverse, 5′-CTCCGTGGGGATAGAACTT-3′OPNForward, 5′-GATGGCCGAGGTGATAGTGT-3′Reverse, 5′-CCATTCAACTCCTCGCTTTC-3′TRKBForward, 5′-TGTGGCGGAAAATCTTGTA-3′Reverse, 5′-CCCGTTATAGAACCACTGAA-3′p75NTRForward, 5′-AAGACCTCATAGCCAGCACG-3′Reverse, 5′-CTGTTGGCTCCTTGCTTGT-3′ELK-1Forward, 5′-CCTAGCATTCACTTCTGGA-3′Reverse, 5′-ACGCTGATAGAAGGGATGT-3′GAPDHForward, 5′-AACGTGTCAGTGGTGGACCTG-3′Reverse, 5′-AGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGT-3′ Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting of TrkB, p75NTR, Total Raf, and Phosphorylated c-Raf—HCEM cells with or without transfection of the siRNAs were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plastic culture plates and maintained in medium A. The nontransfected cells or transfected cells were pretreated with or without PD98059 (50 μm) and PDTC (10 μm) for 30 min and then exposed to BDNF (20 ng/ml) for specific periods before the end of incubation in medium C. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plastic culture plates and maintained for 7 days in medium B. The HCEM cells and the SH-SY5Y cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.5) and lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 at 25 °C), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue). The lysates were sonicated four times for 5 s each on ice. The samples were then microcentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and then reacted with mouse anti-human TrkB antibody (R & D Systems; 1:250), rabbit anti-human p75NTR antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1:1000), rabbit anti-human phosphorylated c-Raf Ser-338 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; 1:1000), rabbit anti-human total c-Raf antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000); and mouse anti-human β-actin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:2000). After the membrane was washed, it was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.6)) for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing, immunodetection was performed by using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) or a chemiluminescence system (Cell Signaling).Calcification Assay—Calcification was detected by Dahl's method for calcium (26Dahl L.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1952; 80: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HCEM cells were placed in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 10 nm dexamethasone (mineralizing media), including BDNF (20 ng/ml), PD98059 (50 μm), or PDTC (10 μm) at 37 °C. Media were changed every other day, and the cells were maintained for 14 days. The cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde neutral buffer solution and then stained with alizarin red S.Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were fractionated using NE-PER® extraction reagents (Pierce). The HCEM cells were scraped off the dish and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min. Subsequent steps for fractionation were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.ERK1/2 Activity and Total ERK1/2 Expression—To examine ERK1/2 activity, a p44/42 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling) was used. HCEM cells were collected with 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated four times for 5 s each time on ice. The samples were then microcentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. For the assay of ERK activity, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-p44/42 (Thr-202/Thr-204) monoclonal antibody. After an overnight incubation, beads were microcentrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C. The collected beads were washed four times and suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein for p44/42, before being incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 3× SDS sample buffer. From each sample, 30 μl was then loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer, membranes were blocked for 3 h at room temperature in TBS/Tween (0.05%) containing 5% skim milk. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody; 1:1000) diluted in primary antibody buffer (TBS-T, 5% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) in blocking buffer. After further washing, proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Cell Signaling). For total ERK, the supernatant was mixed with 3× SDS sample buffer, and total ERK1/2 expression was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:1000). The levels of total ERK1/2 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in HCEM cells were also examined by the immunoblotting.NF-κB Activity—Activity of NF-κB was assessed by the levels of p65 in the nuclear fractions using an NF-κB/p65-active enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Imgenex, San Diego). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above, and nuclear fractions were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HCEM cells were cultured until low confluence on 35-mm Glass Base Dishes® (IWAKI, Chiba, Japan), washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with TBS containing 0.2% casein and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human TrkB antibody (R & D Systems; IgG1, 1:250), rabbit polyclonal anti-p75NTR antibody (Abcam; IgG, 1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-p44/42 antibody (Cell Signaling; IgG, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody (Cell Signaling; IgG, 1:200), mouse IgG1 (BD Biosciences; 1:250) or rabbit IgG (DAKO; 1:500) at 4 °C overnight.After three washes with PBS for 5 min, the cells were incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen; 1:200), or Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor® 594 phalloidin (1:250). After rinsing with PBS, fluorescence signals were detected with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY).Statistical Analysis—Differences between the two groups were analyzed by analysis of variance or Student's t test.RESULTSExpression of TrkB and p75NTR Receptors in HCEM Cells—Real time PCR indicated that HCEM cells as well as SH-SY5Y cells for a positive control expressed mRNA of TRKB, and p75NTR and p75NTR mRNA levels were higher than TRKB mRNA levels in both cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, the ratio of the TRKB mRNA levels to p75NTR mRNA levels in HCEM cells was similar to that of SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, immunoblotting showed protein expression of TrkB and p75NTR in HCEM cells and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1B). Regarding the expression of TrkB, the typical three-band pattern, three forms of 80, 110, and 140 kDa were detected in both cells. Thus, the expression pattern of TrkB and p75NTR in HCEM cells was similar to that in SH-SY5Y cells. The protein expression of TrkB and p75NTR in HCEM cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, C, left panel, and D, left panel). In addition, TrkB partially co-localized with p75NTR (Fig. 1E). In contrast, no proteins were detected by immunofluorescence with anti-nonimmune isotype-matching IgG (Fig. 1, C, right panel, and D, right panel).TrkB Is Involved in the BDNF-induced Increase in Bone/Cementum-related Protein mRNA Levels in HCEM Cells—The time course experiments showed that BDNF at 20 ng/ml increased mRNA levels of OPN, ALP, and BMP-2 in a time-dependent manner until 12 h (Fig. 2A). The dose-experiment results showed that BDNF at 20 ng/ml caused a 2.2-fold increase in OPN mRNA expression, a 2.9-fold increase in ALP mRNA expression, and a 3.2-fold increase in BMP-2 mRNA expression with a maximal effect (Fig. 2B). To examine which receptor (that of TrkB or p75NTR) is most involved in the BDNF-induced enhancement of bone/cementum-related protein mRNA expression, siRNA of TRKB or p75NTR was transfected into HCEM cells. Two siRNAs for knockdown of TRKB and p75NTR were used. The mRNA expression of TRKB and p75NTR in HCEM cells was markedly down-regulated by transfection of TRKB siRNA and p75NTR siRNA, respectively (Fig. 2, C and E). On the other hand, TRKB siRNA treatment and p75NTR siRNA treatment did not influence mRNA expression of p75NTR (Fig. 2C) and TRKB (Fig. 2E), respectively. Furthermore, depletion of TrkB and p75NTR protein expression in HCEM cells following the treatment of the siRNAs was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The knockdown of TRKB, but not p75NTR, abolished the BDNF-induced increase in bone/cementum-related protein mRNA levels (Fig. 2, D and F). Furthermore, the quite similar results were obtained with a second siRNA for TRKB or p75NTR.FIGURE 2BDNF enhances bone/cementum-related protein mRNA expression in HCEM cells via TrkB.

The ERK inhibitor abolished the increase in OPN, ALP, and BMP-2 mRNA levels induced by BDNF (Fig. 3A), whereas the NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC, 10 μm), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125, 10 μm), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580, 10 μm) did not affect the increase (Fig. 3B and data not shown). BDNF stimulated calcification identified by alizarin red S staining in cultures of HCEM cells. Furthermore, PD98059 but not PDTC suppressed calcification induced by BDNF (Fig. 3C). The effect of PD98059 on the BDNF-induced OPN, ALP, and BMP-2 mRNA expression was reversible. After PD98059 and BDNF were removed from the medium of HCEM cells having been exposed to them for 24 h, newly added BDNF increased mRNA levels of the cementum/bone-related proteins again (data not shown). PD98059, PDTC, SP600125, and SB203580 did not influence the bone/cementum-related protein mRNA expression without BDNF (Fig. 3, A and B and data not shown).FIGURE 3Involvement of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the BDNF-induced enhancement in bone/cementum-related protein mRNA levels and calcification in HCEM cells.

https://openalex.org/W2065493747,"Prenyltransferases are widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and play critical roles in cell signaling, protein trafficking, and elaboration of complex molecules in secondary metabolism. Numerous prenylated natural products have been isolated from diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. These complex metabolites possess a wide range of biological activities, with some showing promise as medicinal agents. On the other hand, many prenylated secondary metabolites have been described as toxins such as ergot alkaloids that have potent psychotropic activity. We have characterized a new prenyltransferase isolated from genomic DNA of Malbranchea aurentiaca RRC1813. Enzyme specificity was investigated with a series of amino acid substrates revealing its function as a 4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase. Polypeptide sequence alignment analysis showed that it groups with a new class of prenyltransferase enzymes that lack the typical (N/D)DXXD motif found in these polypeptides. MaPT activity was not dependent on a divalent cation cofactor, although it was reversibly inactivated by 5 mm EDTA. Analysis of kinetic parameters showed reduced enzyme efficiency upon simple modification of l-Trp. Moreover, d-Trp had 0.5% relative activity and functioned as a competitive inhibitor with a K(i) of 40.41 microm. Finally, Thr-105, Asp-179, Lys-189, and Lys-261 in MaPT were serially mutated, and the resulting lesions displayed low or complete loss of activity. This study provides a detailed characterization of a prenyltransferase in Malbranchea species, reveals two enzyme inhibitors, and through site-directed mutagenesis identified several key amino acid residues in catalysis, yielding new insights into this important yet understudied class of natural product biosynthetic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2022604394,"Phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) exists as two splice variants, PLCbeta1a (150 kDa) and PLCbeta1b (140 kDa), which differ only in their C-terminal sequences of 64 and 31 amino acids, respectively. The 3 C-terminal amino acid residues of PLCbeta1a comprise a PDZ-interacting domain, whereas the PLCbeta1b sequence has no PDZ-interacting domain but contains unique proline-rich domain 5 residues from the C terminus. PLCbeta1a is localized in the cytoplasm, whereas PLCbeta1b targets to the sarcolemma and is enriched in caveolae. Deletion of 3 amino acids from the C terminus of PLCbeta1b did not alter its sarcolemmal localization, but deletion of the entire unique 31 amino acid sequence caused cytosolic localization. A myristoylated 10 amino acid peptide from the C terminus of PLCbeta1b selectively dissociated N-terminally GFP-tagged PLCbeta1b from the sarcolemma and inhibited PLC responses to alpha(1)-adrenergic agonists, with a half maximal effective concentration of 12 +/- 1.6 microM (mean+/-SE, n=3). A similar peptide from PLCbeta1a was without effect at concentrations below 100 microM. Thus, the extreme C-terminal sequences of the PLCbeta1 splice variants determine localization and, thus, function. In cardiomyocytes, responses initiated by alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor activation involve only PLCbeta1b, and the selective targeting of this splice variant to the sarcolemma provides a potential therapeutic target to reduce hypertrophy, apoptosis, and arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2058560513,"Sco1 is implicated in the copper metallation of the Cu(A) site in Cox2 of cytochrome oxidase. The structure of Sco1 in the metallated and apo-conformers revealed structural dynamics primarily in an exposed region designated loop 8. The structural dynamics of loop 8 in Sco1 suggests it may be an interface for interactions with Cox17, the Cu(I) donor and/or Cox2. A series of conserved residues in the sequence motif (217)KKYRVYF(223) on the leading edge of this loop are shown presently to be important for yeast Sco1 function. Cells harboring Y219D, R220D, V221D, and Y222D mutant Sco1 proteins failed to restore respiratory growth or cytochrome oxidase activity in sco1Delta cells. The mutant proteins are stably expressed and are competent to bind Cu(I) and Cu(II) normally. Specific Cu(I) transfer from Cox17 to the mutant apo-Sco1 proteins proceeds normally. In contrast, using two in vivo assays that permit monitoring of the transient Sco1-Cox2 interaction, the mutant Sco1 molecules appear compromised in a function with Cox2. The mutants failed to suppress the respiratory defect of cox17-1 cells unlike wild-type SCO1. In addition, the mutants failed to suppress the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of sco1Delta cells. These studies implicate different surfaces on Sco1 for interaction or function with Cox17 and Cox2."
https://openalex.org/W2093329804,"Rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is a molybdo-flavoprotein that is highly homologous to the homodimeric mammalian xanthine oxidoreductase. However, the bacterial enzyme has an (αβ)2 heterotetrameric structure, and the cofactors were identified to be located on two different polypeptides. We have analyzed the mechanism of cofactor insertion and subunit assembly of R. capsulatus XDH, using engineered subunits with appropriate substitutions in the interfaces. In an (αβ) heterodimeric XDH containing the XdhA and XdhB subunits, the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) was shown to be absent, indicating that dimerization of the (αβ) subunits has to precede Moco insertion. In an (αβ)2 XDH heterotetramer variant, including only one active Moco-center, the active (αβ) site of the chimeric enzyme was shown to be fully active, revealing that the two subunits act independent without cooperativity. Amino acid substitutions at two cysteine residues coordinating FeSI of the two [2Fe-2S] clusters of the enzyme demonstrate that an incomplete assembly of FeSI impairs the formation of the XDH (αβ)2 heterotetramer and, thus, insertion of Moco into the enzyme.

XDH shows a preference for NAD+ reduction at the FAD reaction site, whereas XO exclusively uses dioxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, leading to the formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (5Nishino T.

The oxidation of xanthine takes place at the molybdenum center, and the electrons thus introduced are rapidly distributed to the other centers according to their relative redox potentials (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The re-oxidation of the reduced enzyme by the oxidant substrate, either NAD+ or molecular oxygen, occurs through FAD (7Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of R. capsulatus XDH has a high degree of similarity to eukaryotic XORs (up to 39% identity to bovine milk XOR), however, in contrast to the homodimeric (α)2 structure of eukaryotic XORs, R. capsulatus XDH has an (αβ)2 heterotetrameric structure, and the cofactors were identified to be located on two different polypeptides: the iron-sulfur clusters and the FAD are bound by the XdhA subunit, and the Moco is bound by the XdhB subunit (15Leimkühler S.

Despite differences in subunit composition, the folds of bovine XDH and R. capsulatus XDH are highly similar but differ in important details. The NAD+ binding pocket of the bacterial XDH resembles that of the dehydrogenase (XDH) form of the bovine enzyme rather than that of the oxidase (XO) form, and it was shown that R. capsulatus XDH is a true dehydrogenase that is not converted to an oxidase (14Leimkühler S.

To further characterize the mechanism of assembly and intramolecular electron transfer of R. capsulatus XDH, site-directed mutagenesis was performed modifying the cysteines ligating FeSI and FeSII, and further, the role of GlnA102 for electron transfer from Moco to FeSI was investigated. In addition, amino acid exchanges at the dimer interface of the XdhB subunit were introduced to create an (αβ) dimeric variant of XDH. The influences of the amino acid exchanges on the assembly of the two XDH subunits, cofactor insertion, the kinetic constants, and the EPR properties were investigated. Our results show that the assembly of XDH is a complex process, which occurs in an ordered manner. A model for the assembly and cofactor insertion into R. capsulatus XDH is presented.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—E. coli TP1000(ΔmobAB) cells (20Palmer T.

The resulting plasmid was designated pSS2. For coexpression of wild-type xdhB in conjunction with xdhA and xdhC, the plasmid pACYC-duett-1 (Novagen) was used. Primers were designed that allowed cloning of the xdhAB genes into the NcoI and HindIII sites of MCS1 of pACYC-duett-1. In addition, the 3′-HindIII primer contained the coding sequence for six histidines, resulting in an XdhB fusion protein containing a C-terminal His6 tag. Subsequently, an NdeI-KpnI fragment containing the coding sequence of XdhC was cloned into the MCS2 of this vector. The resulting plasmid was designated pSL239.Expression and Purification of Different XDH Variants—Recombinant R. capsulatus wild-type XDH was purified using the procedure described by Leimkühler et al.

The generated XDH variants were expressed under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic (NTA), Q-Sepharose, and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified enzymes were concentrated by ultrafiltration, gel filtered using a PD10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and stored at -70 °C until used. For expression of chimeric (α)2(β1wt/β2EB730A) XDH E. coli RK4353(DE3)mobAB- cells cotransformed with pSL239 and pSS2 were grown in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 1 mm molybdate, and 0.02 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside until the A600 = 1. These precultures were used 1:500 to start the main culture and subsequently grown at 30 °C until A600 = 0.3 was reached. The cultures were induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the growth was continued for 24 h at a temperature of 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and cell lysis was performed by several passages through a French Pressure cell. The supernatant was incubated with 1.7 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) per 2 liters of cell growth. The slurry was transferred to a column and washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole, followed by a wash with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. His6-tagged XDH was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the ones containing XDH were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. To the dialyzed samples 7 ml of Chitin matrix (New England Biolabs) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The slurry was transferred to a column and washed with 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. To induce the intein-catalyzed self-cleavage reaction, a buffer with 250 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.5, was added and left on the column for 24 h at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. XDH-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at -70 °C until used.Absorption Spectra during Anaerobic Reduction with Xanthine and NADH—XDH in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, was incubated in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Lab Systems) for 2 h at 4 °C before either xanthine or NADH was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Complete reduction was achieved by the addition of 20 mm sodium dithionite. Spectra were recorded in 0.15-ml cuvettes using a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer.Enzyme Assays—Routine enzyme assays were carried out at 25 °C in either 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, or 50 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, monitoring the absorbance change at 340 nm due to reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance at 465 nm using an extinction coefficient of 31.6 mm-1cm-1 (14Leimkühler S. Stockert A.L. Igarashi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40437-40444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). XDH assays were performed using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. 5 nm XDH was incubated with 20–100 μm xanthine as substrate, and 20–100 μm NAD+ or 20–100 μm dichlorphenolindophenol (DCPIP) as electron acceptor.Metal and Moco/MPT Analysis—The molybdenum and iron contents of the purified proteins were quantified by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy analysis with a PerkinElmer Optima 2100 DV. The samples were wet-ashed at a concentration of 10 μm in a volume of 500 μl by the addition of 500 μm 65% nitric acid and incubated overnight at 100 °C. The samples were further diluted by the addition of 4 ml of water. As reference, the multi-element standard solution XVI (Merck) was used.Moco was quantified by conversion to Form A as described earlier (23Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moco was extracted from 0.1 μm XDH by the addition of 50 μl of acidic iodine. Following incubation at room temperature for 14 h, excess iodine was removed by the addition of 55 μm 1% ascorbic acid, and the sample was adjusted with 1 m Tris to pH 8.3. The phosphate monoester of Form A was cleaved by the addition of 16 μl of 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. After the addition of 10 μl of acetic acid, Form A was identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis with a C18 reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (4.6- × 250-mm ODS Hypersil, particle size 5 μm) with 5 mm ammonium acetate, 15% methanol at an isocratic flow rate of 1 ml/min. In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with an excitation at 383 nm and emission at 450 nm.CD Spectroscopy—UV-visible CD spectra of 1.7 mg/ml enzyme samples were recorded in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, using a Jasco J-715 CD spectrophotometer.EPR Spectroscopy—9.5-GHz X-Band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a rectangular microwave cavity in the TE102 mode. For temperature control between 6 K und 100 K the sample was kept in an Oxford ESR 900 helium flow cryostat with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller. The microwave frequency was detected with an EIP frequency counter (Microwave Inc.). The magnetic field was calibrated using an LiLiF standard with a known g-value of 2.002293 ± 0.000002 (24Stesmans A. Vangorp G. Phys. Rev. B Condens. Matter. 1989; 39: 2864-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared as frozen solutions (typically 0.1 mm enzyme) in quartz tubes with 4-mm outer diameter. Chemical reduction, to generate the reduced Fe(II)Fe(III) clusters, has been performed with a 20-fold excess of sodium dithionite. Baseline corrections, if required, were performed by subtracting a background spectrum, obtained under the same experimental conditions from a sample containing only a buffer solution. Simulations of the experimental EPR spectra have been carried out with the program EasySpin (25Stoll S. Schweiger A. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4044) Google Scholar). Second integrals from the simulated FeSI and FeSII spectra were used to estimate the relative amount of both clusters in the respective samples.RESULTSCharacterization of an R. capsulatus XDH Mutant Affecting the Binding Site of FeSI—The two non-identical [2Fe2S] clusters located in the XdhA domain of R. capsulatus XDH are coordinated by the amino acid motifs Cys103-X2-Cys106-Xn-Cys134-Arg-Cys136 for FeSI and Cys39-X4-Cys44-X2-Cys47-Xn-Cys63 for FeSII (Fig. 1). FeSI is the cluster in proximity to the pterin ring of Moco, whereas FeSII is in proximity to the FAD (13Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been reported before that a mutation of ArgA135 in R. capsulatus XDH, being located in-between the two conserved cysteine residues CysA134 and CysA136 of FeSI resulted in the production of two different forms of XDH: an (αβ)2 heterotetrameric form indistinguishable from the wild-type protein and an (αβ) heterodimeric form lacking FeSI (16Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus alterations in FeSI seem to influence the correct assembly of the protein. To characterize alterations in the FeSI binding site on the (αβ)2 heterotetramer formation via the XdhB subunit further, an XDH variant was created exchanging two FeSI-coordinating ligands CysA134 and CysA136 to alanine. The XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant was purified after heterologous expression in E. coli cells and characterized (Fig. 2A). As shown in Table 1, the protein contained an iron complement of 62%, and the molybdenum content of the protein was reduced to 8%. Further analyses revealed that the low molybdenum content of the protein corresponded well with a reduced MPT content, showing that the protein was produced in a form almost free of Moco (Table 1). Size exclusion chromatography identified that the XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant was mainly expressed as an (αβ) heterodimer (Fig. 2B). However, the small shoulder at 11 min might indicate that a small amount of the protein existed as a heterotetramer. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the protein variant in comparison to native XDH showed that the heterodimer displayed diminished absorbance in the visible region, with a shift in the absorbance peak from 465 to 450 nm (Fig. 2A). Also, the absorbance of the FeS clusters and Moco at 320 nm was strongly influenced. However, because the iron content was shown to be 62%, this finding suggests that the protein variant lacks a significant amount of FeSI and contains a modified version of the FeSI cluster in a small amount of the protein. Steady-state kinetics of the XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant showed no xanthine-oxidizing activity with NAD+ or DCPIP as electron acceptor. In contrast to amino acid exchanges in the ligating cysteines for FeSI, it was not possible to purify a double variant of the ligands CysA44 and CysA47 for FeSII substituted by alanine, due to the instability of the protein (data not shown).FIGURE 2Characterization of R. capsulatus XDH wild-type and variants CA134A/CA136A and EB220R/DB517R by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography.A, absorption spectra of 3 μm XDH wild type and 2.2 μm XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant.

To investigate whether Moco insertion into XDH precedes dimerization of the XdhB subunit to form the (αβ)2 heterotetramer, amino acid exchanges in the dimer interface region of XdhB were introduced. The crystal structure of R. capsulatus XDH suggested that introducing positively charged amino acids in the dimer interface region might interrupt dimerization (13Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus a variant of XDH was generated exchanging AspB220 and GluB517 to arginine (Fig. 2C). Size exclusion chromatography identified that the XDH-DB220R/EB517R variant was mainly purified as an (αβ) heterodimer after heterologous expression in E. coli (Fig. 2D). The small peak at 11 min showed that a very small portion of the protein existed as a heterotetramer (Fig. 2D). Compared with native XDH, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the protein variant showed that the heterodimer also displayed a diminished absorbance in the visible region, with a shift in the absorption peak from 465 to 450 nm (Fig. 2C). Also, the absorbance of the FeS clusters and Moco at 320 nm was strongly influenced; however, the absorbance changes differed from the XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant (Fig. 2A). The iron content was shown to be 81%, suggesting an almost full complement of FeS clusters (Table 1). Analysis of the molybdenum and MPT content of the variant indicated that the protein was purified in a form containing only residual amounts of Moco (Table 1), showing similarities to the XDH-CA134A/CA136A variant.Investigations of the FeS Clusters of (αβ) Heterodimeric and (αβ)2 Heterotetrameric XDH Variants Using EPR Spectroscopy—Because of the differences in UV-visible spectra of R. capsulatus XDH and the XDH-CA134A/CA136A and XDH-DB220R/EB517R variants, the EPR properties of the FeS clusters were investigated.

The structure of the carbohydrate domain of these compounds is highly variable, and the genetic bases for these variations remain unknown. We demonstrated that the monoglycosylated PGL formed by Mycobacterium bovis differs from the triglycosylated PGL synthesized by M. tuberculosis (PGL-tb) because of the following two genetic defects: a frameshift mutation within the gene Rv2958c, encoding a glycosyltransferase involved in the transfer of the second rhamnosyl residue of the PGL-tb, and a deletion of a region that encompasses two genes, which encode a GDP-d-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and a GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose-3,5-epimerase/reductase, required for the formation of activated l-fucose. Expression of these three genes in M. bovis BCG allowed synthesis of PGL-tb in this recombinant strain. Additionally, we showed that all M. bovis, Mycobacterium microti, Mycobacterium pinnipedii, and some Mycobacterium africanum strains harbor the same frameshift mutation in their Rv2958c orthologs. Consistently, the structure of PGLs purified from M. africanum (harboring the Rv2958c mutation) and M. pinnipedii strains revealed that these compounds are monoglycosylated PGL. These findings explain the specificity of PGL-tb production by some strains of the M. tuberculosis complex and have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of this complex.

Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). These substances are located in the outermost layers of the mycobacterial envelope where they play a key role in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria. For instance, PGL-1, the major PGL synthesized by Mycobacterium leprae, is important for the unique tropism of this bacterium to peripheral nerves through binding to laminin 2 (2Ng V. Zanazzi G. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Salzer J.L. Brennan P.J. Rambukkana A. Cell. 2000; 103: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, PGL-1 synthesis in the leprosy bacillus affects the resistance to intracellular killing by macrophages (3Neill M.A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and modifies binding to complement receptors (4Schlesinger L.S. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which may be important for the pathogenesis of leprosy. PGL-1 can also modulate the immune response (5Charlab R. Sarno E.N.

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, recent findings reveal that the production of PGL is associated with hypervirulence in mice (7Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N.

Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 3). The lipid core is ω-terminated by an aromatic nucleus that is glycosylated. The sugar moiety of PGL consists of one to four sugar residues, depending on the species, and most are O-methylated deoxysugars (9Daffé M. Lemassu A. Doyle R.J. Glycomicrobiology. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York2000: 225-273Google Scholar, 10Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial Lipids. Academic Press, London1988: 203-298Google Scholar). Only a few M. tuberculosis strains synthesize PGL-tb (11Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In such strains, the carbohydrate domain of the major form of PGL-tb is 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-l-fucopyranosyl-(α1->3)-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(α1->3)-2-O-methyl-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(α1->) (12Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This structure seems specific to the M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium canettii lineages; other members of the M. tuberculosis complex, which gathers mycobacterial strains very closely related to M. tuberculosis, do not produce the same saccharidic domain (1Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, M. bovis and Mycobacterium microti produce a truncated form of PGL-tb, called mycoside B, in which the carbohydrate domain is restricted to 2-O-methylrhamnose (1Daffé M.

In other members of M. tuberculosis complex, such as Mycobacterium africanum and Mycobacterium pinnipedii, production of PGL has not been reported to date.FIGURE 1Identification of the genes required for the production of PGL-tb in M. bovis BCG.A, TLC analysis of lipid extracts from the bacterial cell of recombinant M. bovis BCG. Crude lipid extract was from M. bovis BCG (lane 1), M. bovis BCG::pPET52 (Rv2958c) (lane 2), M. bovis BCG::pPET52:pWM85 (Rv1511, Rv1512, and Rv2958c) (lane 5), M. tuberculosis H37Rv:pPET1 (pks15/1) (lane 6), M. canettii, a natural mycobacterial producer of PGL-tb (lane 7), mycoside B purified from M. bovis BCG (lane 3), PGL-tb purified from M. bovis BCG::pPET52:pWM85 (Rv1511, Rv1512, and Rv2958c) (lane 4). Lipid extracts were dissolved in CHCl3 and run in CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4 followed by heating. PGL-2S corresponds to mono-O-methyl-diglycosyl-phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosate as described previously (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol.

Genes transferred in M. bovis BCG are indicated beside the arrows. Other genes such as Rv2957 (encoding the third glycosyltransferase) and those encoding the methyltransferases are required for the synthesis of the complete saccharide moiety of PGL-tb, but our findings demonstrated that they are all already functional in M. bovis BCG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The biosynthesis of PGL-tb involves more than 25 enzymatic steps. Genes required for PGL biosynthesis and translocation to the mycobacterial cell surface are clustered on a 73-kb fragment of the M. tuberculosis chromosome (14Guilhot C. Chalut C. Daffé M. Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2008: 273-285Google Scholar). The genetic basis for the inability of most M. tuberculosis isolates to synthesize PGL-tb was found to be a mutation within the pks15/1 gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the formation of a precursor of PGL-tb (11Constant P.

However, it is still unknown why other members of the M. tuberculosis complex, with the exception of M. canettii, produce only mycoside B.In this study, we determine the molecular factors explaining why Mycobacterium bovis BCG does not synthesize PGL-tb. We also report the structures of PGL synthesized by additional strains of the M. tuberculosis complex and correlate the structure of these glycolipids with a mutation in a PGL biosynthetic gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—M. africanum strains (RIVM 2005-0479 and RIVM 2005-0419) were obtained from the collection of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Bilthoven, Netherlands).

All the strains used in this study have been extensively characterized using reference typing methods (IS6110 RLFP and spoligotyping), and most of them have been described previously (see Table 1). M. bovis BCG 1173P2 (the Pasteur strain) and the other strains from the M. tuberculosis complex were grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase) and 0.05% Tween 80 where indicated or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.005% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). Kanamycin and hygromycin were added when required to final concentration of 40 and 50 μg/ml, respectively.

Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Rv2958c gene was amplified by PCR and cloned under the control of promoter phsp60 into the mycobacterial integrative vector pMV361H to give the plasmid pPET52 (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).For the cloning of Rv1511 and Rv1512, a 2-kb fragment encompassing these two genes was amplified by PCR using primers 1511A (5′-TTATACATATGAAGCGAGCGCTCATCAC-3′) and 1512A (5′-AATATACTAGTCATTGCCGAACCGTTCCC-3′). The PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Lyon, France), 10% Me2SO, and 1 μm of each primer. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was then applied. The PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. The 2-kb fragment was purified using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). It was digested with NdeI and SpeI and inserted between the NdeI and SpeI sites of pMIP12d vector to give pWM85. Plasmid pMIP12d was derived from plasmid pMIP12 (16Le Dantec C. Winter N. Gicquel B. Vincent V. Picardeau M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2157-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). First, the km cassette in a fragment flanked by DraI and MscI restriction sites was removed from pMIP12 by DraI and MscI digestion and replaced by the km cassette from plasmid pET26b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). This resulted in removal of one HindIII restriction site. The resulting plasmid was then digested by HindIII, filled in, and then religated to eliminate the remaining HindIII restriction site. A polylinker allowing the use of the NdeI restriction site for in-frame insertion of gene was then inserted into the modified pMIP12 vector to give pMIP12d plasmid. In pWM85, genes Rv1511 and Rv1512 were placed under the control of the mycobacterial promoter pblaF*. The two plasmids were used for electrotransformation of M. bovis BCG. Transformants were selected on plates containing either kanamycin, hygromycin, or both.PCR Amplification of the Rv1511/Rv1512 and Rv2958c Regions—Mycobacterial genomic DNA was extracted from each strain of the M. tuberculosis complex as described previously (17Belisle J.T. Sonnenberg M.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 31-44Google Scholar). For the analysis of the Rv1511/Rv1512 locus, PCR amplification was performed using primers 1511A and 1512A as described above. We determined the size of the amplified fragments on a 0.8% agarose gel. The Rv2958c ortholog was amplified from genomic DNA respectively using primers Rv2958A (5′-TATATCATATGGAGGAAACAAGCGTCG-3′) and Rv2958B (5′-TATATACTAGTTAGCAGACGAGCCGCAGC-3′). The PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Lyon, France), 10% Me2SO, and 1 μm of each primer. The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 2 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was then applied. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. The 1.3-kb fragments were purified using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and inserted into pGEM-T vectors (Promega). Inserts were then sequenced using SP6 and T7 primers (Millegen, Labège, France). For sequencing the Rv2958c fragment containing the frameshift mutation, 400 bp was amplified using primers Rv2958D (5′-AGCTGGTGCCGACATACAACC-3′) and Rv2958E (5′-GCCTCCATGTTCAAGTGCTG-3′). The PCR was performed as described above, and the PCR products were sequenced directly using primer Rv2958S (5′-GCCAACCATCGATATCTCGG-3′) (Millegen).Extraction and Purification of Glycolipids—Glycolipids were extracted and analyzed as described previously (11Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, mycobacterial cells obtained from culture on Sautonŉs medium were left in 60 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2 v/v) for 24 h to kill bacteria. Lipids were then extracted once with CHCl3/CH3OH 1:1 (v/v) for 24 h and twice with CHCl3/CH3OH 2:1 (v/v) for 24 h each, washed twice with water (50 ml), and dried.Production of glycolipids by the various strains was examined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Briefly, extracts were dissolved in CHCl3 to give a final lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml. Equivalent volumes of each extract were deposited on Silica Gel G60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) and run in CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5 v/v). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4, followed by heating. Glycolipids were purified as described previously (12Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crude lipid extracts from cells were subjected to chromatography on a Florisil (60–100 mesh) column and eluted with a series of concentrations of CH3OH (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 50%) in CHCl3. Each fraction was analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel G60 using CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) as the solvent system. Glycolipids were visualized as described above. When necessary, glycolipids were additionally purified by preparative chromatography on Silica Gel G60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) using CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) as the developing solvent.Structural Analysis—Purified molecules were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry as described previously (18Laval F. Lanéelle M.-A. Deon C. Montsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The spectra were acquired in reflectron mode with an Applied Biosystems 4700 analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 355 nm; pulse <500 ps; repetition rate 200 Hz). A total of 2500 shots were accumulated in positive ion mode, and mass spectrometry data were acquired using the instrument default calibration. NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out at 295 K on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600,13-MHz with a 5-mm triple resonance TCI 1H 13C 15N pulsed field z-gradient cryoprobe. Samples were dissolved in 99.9% CDCl3. Chemical shifts were expressed in parts/million by using chloroform signal as an internal reference (7.23 ppm).RESULTSIdentification of M. tuberculosis Genes Required for PGL-tb Synthesis in M. bovis BCG—The structure of the saccharidic moiety of PGL-tb was established as 2,3,4-tri-O-methylfucose-(α1->3)-rhamnose-(α1->3)-2-O-methylrhamnose (12Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that M. bovis BCG does not synthesize PGL-tb because of several genetic defects. Indeed, M. bovis contains a frameshift mutation within its ortholog of Rv2958c, which encodes the glycosyltransferase involved in the transfer of the second rhamnosyl residue of PGL-tb in M. tuberculosis (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, transfer of a functional Rv2958c gene in M. bovis BCG led to the production of di-glycosylated PGL but not of PGL-tb (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus additional genetic defects exist that are also responsible for the inability of M. bovis to synthesize PGL-tb.We thus hypothesized that a possible genetic defect may prevent the formation of fucose, the last residue of the PGL-tb carbohydrate domain. l-Fucose is a 6-deoxyhexose synthesized in bacteria from GDP-d-mannose in a three-enzymatic step process (for review, see Ref. 19Mäki M. Renkonen R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: R1-R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GDP-d-mannose is first converted into GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose by a GDP-d-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. This intermediate undergoes epimerization at positions C-3 and C-5 to form GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-galactose from which the keto group at the C-4 position is then reduced, giving GDP-l-fucose. These last two steps are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, a GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose-3,5-epimerase/reductase. To test the hypothesis, we compared the sequenced genomes of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. These are known to differ in several regions deleted in the M. bovis-related strains (20Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Marmiesse M. Buchrieser C. Eiglmeier K. Garnier T. Gutierrez C. Hewinson G. Kremer K. Parsons L.M. Pym A.S. Samper S. van Soolingen D. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3684-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). One of these deleted regions (RD4) contains two genes Rv1511 (gmdA) and Rv1512 (epiA) encoding proteins exhibiting very high similarities to GDP-d-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose-3,5-epimerase/reductase respectively (21Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.-A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the RD4 might be a second genetic defect preventing the formation of PGL-tb in some M. bovis-related strains, including the various M. bovis BCG isolates.To address this question, we cloned the three M. tuberculosis genes, Rv2958c, Rv1511, and Rv1512, and inserted them into two plasmids. The plasmids were then either independently or simultaneously transferred into M. bovis BCG. The PGL produced by the various recombinant BCG strains were then analyzed on TLC plates (Fig. 1).The expression of a functional Rv2958c gene in M. bovis BCG led to the synthesis of two glycoconjugates, a minor one corresponding to 2-O-methyl-rhamnosyl-phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosate (mycoside B) and a major one exhibiting a lower mobility and corresponding to a mono-O-methyl-diglycosyl-phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosate or PGL-2S (Fig. 1, lane 2) in agreement with our previous observations (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When genes Rv1511 and Rv1512 were concomitantly expressed with Rv2958c, the recombinant M. bovis BCG strain now synthesized a new glycoconjugate exhibiting the same mobility on TLC plates as that exhibited by PGL-tb (Fig. 1, lane 5). In contrast, the recombinant BCG strain carrying only plasmid pWM85 (containing Rv1511 and Rv1512) synthesized just mycoside B (data not shown). Therefore, the production of the new compound was dependent on the presence of the glycosyltransferase encoded by gene Rv2958c.Structural Analysis of the New Glycolipid Produced in the Recombinant Strain M. bovis BCG::pPET52:pWM85—The new glycoconjugate produced by the recombinant strain expressing the three genes Rv2958c, Rv1511, and Rv1512 (Fig. 1, lane 4) was purified by chromatography on a Florisil column and structurally characterized.The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of this compound showed a series of pseudomolecular ion (M + Na)+ peaks at 1780, 1794, 1808, 1822, 1836, 1850, 1864, 1878, 1892, and 1906 m/z (Fig. 2A). These mass values were 334 mass units higher than those observed for mycoside B, produced by the parental strain M. bovis BCG (Fig. 2B). This difference corresponded to the mass of the terminal disaccharide composed of tri-O-methyl-deoxyhexosyl linked to an unmethylated deoxyhexosyl as found in PGL-tb, i.e. tri-O-methyl-fucosyl-(1->3)-rhamnosyl. Consistently, the mass values were also 188 mass units higher, i.e. the mass of the terminal tri-O-methyl-deoxyhexosyl moiety, than those observed for the diglycosylated PGL synthesized by M. bovis BCG expressing the glycosyltransferase-encoding gene Rv2958c from the plasmid pPET52 (15Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42574-42583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, these findings were consistent with the new compound produced by M. bovis BCG::pPET52:pWM85 having the same saccharide moiety as PGL-tb. This was confirmed by the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the purified compound, which exhibited the same signal resonances (Fig. 3) as those described for PGL-tb (11Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W.

https://openalex.org/W1965050184,"The amelogenins are the most abundant secreted proteins in developing dental enamel. Enamel from amelogenin (Amelx) null mice is hypoplastic and disorganized, similar to that observed in X-linked forms of the human enamel defect amelogenesis imperfecta resulting from amelogenin gene mutations. Both transgenic strains that express the most abundant amelogenin (TgM180) have relatively normal enamel, but strains of mice that express a mutated amelogenin (TgP70T), which leads to amelogenesis imperfecta in humans, have heterogeneous enamel structures. When Amelx null (KO) mice were mated with transgenic mice that produce M180 (TgM180), the resultant TgM180KO offspring showed evidence of rescue in enamel thickness, mineral density, and volume in molar teeth. Rescue was not observed in the molars from the TgP70TKO mice. It was concluded that a single amelogenin protein was able to significantly rescue the KO phenotype and that one amino acid change abrogated this function during development."
https://openalex.org/W2142409902,"Hyaluronidases have been postulated to be the enzyme acting at the initial step of chondroitin sulfate (CS) catabolism in vivo. Since chondroitin (Chn) but not hyaluronic acid (HA) has been detected in Caenorhabditis elegans, the nematode is a good model for elucidating the mechanism of the degradation of CS/Chn in vivo. Here we cloned the homolog of human hyaluronidase in C. elegans, T22C8.2. The Chn-degrading activity in vitro was first demonstrated when it was expressed in COS-7 cells. The enzyme cleaved preferentially Chn. CS-A and CS-C were also depolymerized but to lesser extents, and HA was hardly degraded. In order of preference, the substrates ranked Chn >> CS-A > CS-C >> HA. The products of the degradation of Chn by the enzyme were characterized by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The structure of the major component in the digest was determined as GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAcbeta1-4GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc, where GlcUA and GalNAc represent D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, respectively, indicating that this enzyme is a Chn hydrolase, an endo-beta-galactosaminidase specific for Chn. Investigation of the effects of pH on the activity revealed the optimum pH of Chn hydrolase to be 6.0. Since Chn in C. elegans has been demonstrated to play critical roles in cell division, Chn hydrolase possibly regulates the function of Chn in vivo. This is the first demonstration of a Chn hydrolase in an animal."
https://openalex.org/W2034714863,"TRPM7 is a divalent cation-permeable channel that is ubiquitously expressed. Recently, mouse TRPM7 has been shown to be sensitive to, and even permeable to, protons when heterologously expressed. Here we have demonstrated that human TRPM7 expressed either heterologously or endogenously also exhibits proton conductivity. The gene silencing of TRPM7 by small interfering RNA suppressed H+ currents in human cervical epithelial HeLa cells. In HEK293T cells transfected with human TRPM7, the inward proton conductance was suppressed by extracellular Mg2+ or Ca2+ with IC50 values of 0.5 and 1.9 mm, respectively. Anomalous mole fraction behavior of H+ currents in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ indicated that these divalent cations compete with protons for binding sites. Systematic mutation of negatively charged amino acid residues within the putative pore-forming region of human TRPM7 into the neutral amino acid alanine was tested. E1047A resulted in non-functional channels, and D1054A abolished proton conductance, whereas E1052A and D1059A only partially reduced proton conductivity. Thus, it is concluded that Asp-1054 is an essential determinant of the proton conductivity, whereas Glu-1047 might be required for channel formation, and the remaining negatively charged amino acids in the pore region (Glu-1052 and Asp-1059) may play a facilitating role in the proton conductivity of human TRPM7.

Protons have been reported to modulate the activity of a variety of ion channels (28Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2003Google Scholar, 29Holzer P. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the study of the effects of protons on the multifunctional, ubiquitously expressed TRPM7 channel is of importance physiologically. Recently, Jiang et al. (30Jiang J. Li M. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) demonstrated that extracellular protons enhance inward cation currents through the mouse TRPM7 channel and even permeate the channel when it was heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. However, it has not yet been determined whether human TRPM7, which exhibits 94% amino acid sequence identity with mouse TRPM7, can conduct protons not only in heterologously expressed cells but also in endogenously expressed cells. Thus, in the present study proton conductivity of the human TRPM7 channel was investigated in HEK293T cells transfected with human TRPM7 and human cervical cancer HeLa cells, which endogenously express TRPM7 (31Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently, there has been accumulating evidence that transmembrane domains other than the putative pore (P or H5) region of voltage-gated ion channels serve as proton conduction pathways. Starace and Bezanilla (32Starace D.M. Bezanilla F. Nature. 2004; 427: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) showed that the fourth transmembrane segment (S4) in the Shaker K+ channel, the voltage-sensing domain, behaves as a proton pore when the first arginine of S4 is replaced with a histidine. Sasaki et al. (33Sasaki M. Takagi M. Okamura Y. Science. 2006; 312: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and Ramsey et al. (34Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 440: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a four-transmembrane domain protein with similarity to the S1-S4 regions of voltage-gated ion channels is the molecule corresponding to a voltage-gated proton channel; this molecule, however, lacks a classical pore domain. Thus, there is a possibility that some transmembrane domain (in particular S4), and not the P region, of TRPM7 is responsible for proton permeation. On the other hand, Li et al. (35Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have recently shown that amino acid residues Glu-1047 and Glu-1052 in the putative pore region of mouse TRPM7 have an essential role in enhancing the effects of protons on inward cation currents. This sensitivity to protons is due to competition of the protons with the divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+, which block the channel, for their binding sites (35Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); it is, therefore, hypothesized that the putative pore region (the P region) is involved in the conduction of protons through TRPM7. In this study we have tested this possibility by observing the effects of mutating negatively charged amino acid residues within the putative pore-forming region of human TRPM7 into the neutral amino acid alanine. Our results have revealed the following: first, human TRPM7, expressed either heterologously or endogenously, exhibits proton conductivity. Second, divalent cations interfere with the conduction of protons through TRPM7. Third, in the putative pore region, the negatively charged amino acid residue Asp-1054 is essential for proton conductivity. This finding shows for the first time that the pore region per se provides the pathway for proton conduction in TRPM7. Our results also suggest that Glu-1047 is required for channel formation and that the remaining negatively charged amino acid residues Glu-1052 and Asp-1059 may facilitate proton conduction. Cell Culture—Human cervix HeLa and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were grown as monolayers in minimum essential medium and Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 40 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For electrophysiological experiments, cells were detached from a plastic substrate and cultured in suspension with agitation for 15–300 min. Recombinant Expression and Small Interfering RNA Transfection—Recombinant expression was performed as previously described (36Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected 24 h after plating with pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for mock-transfected (HEK/Mock) cells or pIRES2-EGFP-TRPM7 for TRPM7-transfected (HEK/TRPM7) cells. pIRES2-EGFP-TRPM7 was prepared by inserting TRPM7 from pCI-neo-TRPM7 (a gift from Y. Mori) into pIRES2-EGFP. The mutations were introduced into hTRPM7 by using the QuikChangeIIXL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire insert region. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. All experiments using these HEK/Mock and HEK/TRPM7 cells were performed between 36–48 h after transfection. HeLa cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) as previously reported (31Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mock siRNA and TRPM7 siRNA, which were both Alexa 488-conjugated, were purchased from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The mock siRNA had a scrambled, nonsilencing sequence. For experiments, successfully transfected cells were selected by their Alexa 488 fluorescence. Suppression of molecular expression of TRPM7 by the siRNA treatment in HeLa cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analyses in our previous study (31Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Patch Clamp Experiments—Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature (22–26 °C). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with a micropipette puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The electrode had a resistance of around 5 megaohms for whole-cell recordings when filled with pipette solution. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Current signals were filtered at 5 kHz using a 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 20 kHz. pClamp software (Version 9.0.2; Axon Instruments) was used for command pulse control, data acquisition, and analysis. Series resistance (<5 megaohms) was compensated (to 70–80%) to minimize voltage errors. The reversal potential was measured by ramp pulses from –100 mV to +100 mV at a speed of 1 mV/ms from a holding potential of 0 mV. To observe the voltage dependence of the current profile, step pulses were applied from a holding potential of 0 mV to test potentials (50 ms duration) up to +100 in 20-mV increments or 0 to –200 mV in 20-mV decrements. The intracellular (pipette) solution (300 mosmol/kg of H2O) contained 100 mm NMDG-aspartate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm HCl (pH 7.4). The control bath solution (320 mosmol/kg of H2O) contained 100 mm NMDG-aspartate, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm HEPES or mm MES, and 30 mm mannitol (pH 2.0–8.0). To observe the effects of Mg2+ and/or Ca2+, varying concentrations (up to 10 mm) of MgSO4 and/or calcium gluconate were added to the control bath solution while maintaining a constant osmolality by reducing the concentration of mannitol. The free Mg2+ or Ca2+ concentration was calculated with CaBuf software (provided by Dr. G. Droogmans, KUL, Belgium). Chemicals—EDTA, EGTA, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of n observations. Statistical differences of the data were evaluated by the paired or unpaired Studentŉs t test and were considered significant at p < 0.05. Proton Conductance of Human TRPM7 Heterologously Expressed in HEK293T Cells—When whole-cell patch clamp was performed using NMDG-aspartate-rich intracellular (pipette) and extracellular (bath) solutions free of divalent cations, small currents were recorded at pH 7.4 (–2.8 ± 0.8 pA/picofarads (pF) at –100 mV, n = 10) and pH 4.0 (–10.2 ± 1.8 pA/pF at –100 mV, n = 10) in HEK/Mock cells. In HEK/TRPM7 cells at pH 7.4, only small currents, like those recorded in HEK/Mock cells, could be observed in response to positive voltage step pulses, but sizable inward currents were observed at negative potentials ≤–60 mV as shown in Fig. 1. The inward currents exhibited time-dependent activation (Fig. 1A, upper left panel) and inward rectification (Fig. 1B, triangles). When extracellular pH was decreased to 4.0, inward (but not outward) currents recorded in HEK/TRPM7 cells prominently increased. The inward currents again exhibited inward rectification (Fig. 1B, circles) and activation kinetics (Fig. 1A, upper right panel), although inactivation followed rapid activation at large negative potentials (≤–100 mV). Because the extracellular and intracellular solutions contained only ions of large size such as NMDG+, aspartate–, HEPES, and MES, it is likely that these inward currents are carried mainly by H+. In fact, the reversal potential (Erev) shifted to positive potentials when extracellular pH decreased from 7.4 to 4.0 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the reversal potential changed little (by –0.1 ± 0.3 mV, n = 6) when 50 mm NMDG-aspartate was replaced with 100 mm mannitol in the extracellular solution at pH 4.0. The slope of changes in Erev (ΔErev) plotted against pH changes between 2.5 and 7.4 was 31.8 mV/pH, as shown in Fig. 1B (inset), indicating that the conductance was that of protons. The peak amplitude of the inward proton currents recorded at –100 mV increased with decreasing extracellular pH (Fig. 2A). The half-maximal pH value was 3.9. For a given pH value, the slope conductance increased with hyperpolarization (Fig. 2B). At pH 4.0, the voltage for half-maximal conductance was estimated to be –75.9 mV by fitting the G-V curve to the Boltzmann equation. Activation kinetics of the inward proton currents recorded at large negative potentials also exhibited voltage and pH dependence. The activation time constant (τ) estimated by single exponential fits decreased with decreasing extracellular pH (Fig. 2C). From the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is concluded that human TRPM7 exhibits voltage-dependent proton currents under divalent cation-free conditions and that these currents are substantially augmented by low pH. Competitive Inhibition of Human TRPM7 Proton Currents by Divalent Cations—When 10 mm Mg2+ was added to the extracellular solution, inward currents recorded upon application of voltage steps from 0 mV to –100 mV in 20-mV decrements at pH 4.0 were prominently suppressed, as shown in Fig. 3A (top and middle traces). Similar suppression was also observed upon the addition of 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of TRPM7 proton currents by both divalent cations was concentration-dependent (bottom panels). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.5 mm for Mg2+ and 1.9 mm for Ca2+. Concentration-dependent inhibition by extracellular Mg2+ or Ca2+ was also observed for proton currents recorded at –200 mV under control pH conditions (pH 7.4), as shown in Fig. 4, A and B). However, divalent cation-induced inhibition took place at much lower concentrations with IC50 values of around 8.8 ± 0.1 and 3.7 ± 0.1 μm for Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively. Minimal current was observed when the divalent cations were applied at a concentration of 0.1 mm. However, further addition of divalent cations to millimolar concentrations was found to increase the inward currents at –200 mV; this is presumably due to the inflow of divalent cations per se because TRPM7 is known to be permeable to Mg2+ and Ca2+ (10Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 37Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J.S. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 121: 49-60Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Such anomalous mole fraction behavior indicates that divalent cations compete with protons for binding and permeation sites. When equimolar Mg2+ and Ca2+ were added together, similar effects on proton currents recorded at –200 mV under acidic conditions (pH 5.5 or 4.75) were observed, as shown in Fig. 4C. At low concentrations, these divalent cations inhibited proton currents with an IC50 of around 0.1 mm each. The minimum currents at pH 5.5 or 4.75 were observed at concentrations of around 0.1 and 1 mm, respectively, of these divalent cations (Mg2+ plus Ca2+). The data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly indicate that proton conduction through human TRPM7 is blocked by Mg2+ and Ca2+ and that this is due to their competition with the protons for binding and permeation sites within the pore region. Determinant Amino Acid Residues for Proton Conduction through Human TRPM7—The half-maximal pH value (pH 3.9; Fig. 2A) is close to the pKa value of free glutamate (4.3) and aspartate (3.7). Also, in the putative pore region of TRPM7, the only negatively charged amino acid residues are two glutamates and two aspartates (38Topala C.N. Groenestege W.T. Thebault S. van den Berg D. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as seen in Fig. 5B. Thus, it is likely that one or more of these four residues serve as sites that determine the proton conductivity of human TRPM7. Therefore, we next examined the effects of sequentially neutralizing these negatively charged residues (Glu-1047, Glu-1052, Asp-1054, Asp-1059) on the proton conductance. Western blot analysis showed molecular expression of not only wild type but also the E1047A, E1052A, D1054A, D1054E, and D1059A mutants in the membrane fraction derived from transfected HEK293T cells (supplemental Fig. 1). By confocal microscopy it was found that a large part of the immunoreactivity to a polyclonal antibody to TRPM7 was localized in the peripheral regions of the cell, presumably the plasma membrane, in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type TRPM7 or any of these mutants (supplemental Fig. 2). The neutralized mutant D1054A, confirmed to be molecularly expressed, abolished proton currents measured at pH 4.0, as shown in Fig. 5, A and B. On the other hand, the negatively charged mutant D1054E exhibited proton currents as large as those of wild-type TRPM7 (WT). Therefore, it is concluded that the Asp-1054 residue serves as a crucial determinant of the proton conductivity of human TRPM7. The neutralized E1047A mutant failed to express any currents (Fig. 5B) despite the fact that there was clear molecular expression of the protein. Furthermore, we were unable to detect functional expression of another neutralized mutant, E1047Q, or of the negatively charged mutant E1047D (data not shown). These results indicate that Glu-1047 in the human TRPM7 protein is required for channel formation or for maintenance of pore integrity. Neutralization of Glu-1052 or Asp-1059 resulted in protein with functional expression but a significantly reduced proton conductance, as summarized in Fig. 5B. This reduced functional expression may be partly due to the less marked molecular expression of E1052A and D1059A in the membrane fraction compared with wild-type TRPM7 (supplemental Fig. 1). However, molecular expression of these mutants in the plasma membrane region looked to be similar to that of wild-type TRPM7 (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, both the E1052A and D1059A mutants were found to exhibit reduced sensitivity to protons with decreasing a half-maximal pH value by around 1.5 (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that Glu-1052 and Asp-1059 are involved in facilitating the conduction of protons through the channel. Proton Conductance of Human TRPM7 Endogenously Expressed in HeLa Cells—To explore whether human TRPM7 can function endogenously as a proton-conducting channel, whole-cell patch clamp studies were performed in human epithelial HeLa cells, which express TRPM7 (31Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), using divalent cation-free, NMDG-aspartate-rich solutions. The inward currents markedly increased when extracellular pH was decreased from 7.4 to 4.0, as shown in Fig. 6A. When extracellular pH was decreased, the Erev value shifted to positive potentials; plotting ΔErev against extracellular pH gave a slope of 42.1 mV/pH (Fig. 6B). When TRPM7 expression in HeLa cells was suppressed by using siRNA specific for TRPM7, as in our previous study (31Numata T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the inward currents recorded at both pH 7.4 and 4.0 were largely abolished (Fig. 6, C and D). In contrast, mock siRNA failed to affect the inward currents (Fig. 6D). These data clearly indicate that human TRPM7 endogenously expressed in HeLa cells serves as a proton-conducting pathway under acidic conditions. Protons are known to modulate the activity of channels from a wide variety of channel superfamilies (28Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.

Voltage-gated proton-selective channels have been reported to be involved in epithelial secretion, muscle contraction, metabolic modulation, fertilization, and phagocyte burst respiration (47Decoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Recently, a four-transmembrane domain protein lacking a putative pore domain has been identified as the molecule corresponding to this particular type of proton channel (33Sasaki M. Takagi M. Okamura Y. Science. 2006; 312: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 440: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). A member of the TRP channel superfamily, TRPML1, has been identified as a lysosomal proton channel (48Soyombo A.A. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Rbaibi Y. Bashllari E. Bisceglia J. Muallem S. Kiselyov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7294-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under acidic conditions, a proton-conductive pathway is also provided by voltage-gated Na+ channels in the absence of Na+ (49Mozhayeva G.N. Naumov A.P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 396: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (50Gilbertson T.A. Avenet P. Kinnamon S.C. Roper S.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 803-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Evidence for proton conduction through heterologously expressed mouse TRPM7 has also been presented by Jiang et al. (30Jiang J. Li M. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated proton conductivity of not only heterologously expressed, but also endogenously expressed, human TRPM7. The TRPM7-mediated conduction of protons was activated by hyperpolarization and exhibited inward rectification, in contrast to the proton current through the voltage-gated proton channel, which was activated by depolarization and was outwardly rectifying (47Decoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In the voltage-gated proton channel, which lacks a P region, the S4 domain was suggested to serve as the proton-conductive pathway (34Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 440: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was shown in the present study that a negatively charged amino acid residue in the P region of human TRPM7, Asp-1054, is essential for its proton conductivity. Here we also showed that Glu-1052 and Asp-1059 facilitate proton conduction but that Glu-1047 may be required for formation of the human TRPM7 channel. The results from a study on the mouse TRPM7 channel by Li et al. (35Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) are distinct from our findings on human TRPM7. First, in that study the E1047Q mutant was functional, exhibiting monovalent cation currents but lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeation and proton sensitivity, whereas in the present study the E1047A, E1047Q, and E1047D mutants resulted in non-functional channels. Second, the D1054A mutation did not produce a significant change, but in the present study the same mutation abolished proton conduction. However, it must be noted that there are distinct differences in the experimental conditions of the two studies; Li et al. (35Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) investigated the effects of neutralizing mutations of negatively charged amino acid residues within the putative pore-forming region of mouse TRPM7 on non-protonic cation conductivity, whereas in this study we have examined the effects of such mutations in human TRPM7 on proton conductivity. Recent preliminary experiments that we carried out showed that the D1054A mutant of human TRPM7 abolishes Ca2+ and Mg2+ conduction as well, 4T. Numata and Y. Okada, unpublished observations. so it is likely that the same mutations result in different effects on the mouse and human TRPM7 channel activities. In this regard it must be noted that five of 61 amino acid residues in the S5-S6 region of human and mouse TRPM7 are different, although the amino acid sequences of the putative pore-forming regions were identical to each other. The present study also demonstrated that the proton conductance of human TRPM7 is competitively inhibited by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Under neutral pH conditions proton currents were inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+. It was found that at an acidic pH (5.5 or 4.75), however, submillimolar to millimolar concentrations of these divalent cations were required to inhibit the proton current (see Fig. 4C). Application of these divalent cations at 0.1–1 mm could not abolish the TRPM7-mediated proton current completely. The proton conductance of this ubiquitously expressed member of the TRP channel family may have a function when extracellular pH falls below 5.5 even in the presence of divalent cations at physiologically relevant concentrations. Because a cervico-vaginal pH between 4.0 and 5.0 is considered normal for women with active menstrual cycles (21Lang W.R. Obstet. Gynecol. Surv. 1955; 10: 546-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Garcia-Closas M. Herrero R. Bratti C. Hildesheim A. Sherman M.E. Morera L.A. Schiffman M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 180: 1060-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the TRPM7 proton conductance, which was shown to be expressed in human cervical HeLa cells in the present study, may be constitutively active in vaginal or cervical epithelial cells in vivo. Similarly high proton concentrations were found in tumor tissues (to pH 5.5), in cardiac ischemia (to pH 5.7), and in the brain during ischemia, seizures, and hyperglycemia (below pH 6) (23Revici E.

Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 522-530PubMed Google Scholar), is known to be associated with the inflammatory loci; the acidosis results from increased lactate production through the glycolytic activity of infiltrated neutrophils and from accumulation of short-chain fatty acids due to bacterial metabolism (54Grinstein S. Swallow C.J. Rotstein O.D. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 24: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TRPM7-mediated proton influx contributes to pain and other symptoms as well as to the modulation of immune cell function in these pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2155476065,"In this study, we determined the regulation and potential function of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) during skin repair in mice. Upon skin injury, healthy mice exhibited a biphasic increase in HMGR expression and activity with elevated levels at days 3 and 13 post-wounding. In situ hybridization revealed wound margin keratinocytes as a cellular source of HMGR expression. In vitro experiments using cultured HaCaT keratinocytes uncovered epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and insulin as potent co-inducers of HMGR activity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cells. Insulin-, but not EGF-mediated VEGF protein expression was functionally connected to co-induced HMGR activity, as simvastatin restrictively interfered only with insulin-induced translation of VEGF mRNA by inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation. Functional ablation of insulin-induced sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 by siRNA abolished HMGR expression and insulin-triggered VEGF protein release from keratinocytes. Simvastatin also blocked proliferation of cultured keratinocytes. The observed inhibitory effects of simvastatin on keratinocyte VEGF expression and proliferation could be reversed by mevalonate, the product of HMGR enzymatic activity. In accordance, simvastatin-mediated inhibition of HMGR activity in acutely regenerating tissue of wounded mice was paralleled by a marked loss of VEGF protein expression and disturbances of normal proliferation processes in wound margin keratinocytes during skin repair."

The synaptic protein interaction (synprint) site found in the II–III loop of CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 mediates a physical association with synaptic proteins that may be crucial for fast neurotransmission and axonal targeting. We report here the use of nested PCR to identify two novel splice variants of rat CaV2.1 that lack much of the synprint site. Furthermore, we compare immunofluorescence data derived from antibodies directed against sequences in the CaV2.1 synprint site and carboxyl terminus to show that channel variants lacking a portion of the synprint site are expressed in two types of neuroendocrine cells. Immunofluorescence data also suggest that such variants are properly targeted to neuroendocrine terminals. When expressed in a mammalian cell line, both splice variants yielded Ca2+ currents, but the variant containing the larger of the two deletions displayed a reduced current density and a marked shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. These results have important implications for CaV2.1 function and for the mechanisms of CaV2.1 targeting in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.

These results have important implications for CaV2.1 function and for the mechanisms of CaV2.1 targeting in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are a family of protein complexes that regulate the influx of Ca2+ into cells. At the center of this complex is a protein known as the α1 subunit, which forms the voltage-dependent, Ca2+ selective pore. Ca2+ channel properties and distribution are determined by the identity of the α1 subunit (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar), by the association of accessory subunits (2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin.

Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and by alternative splicing of the α1 subunit (4Jurkat-Rott K. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Physiol.

The role of different Ca2+ channel types in exocytotic secretion depends on the physical relationship between the channels and the exocytotic apparatus (6Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 269-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Toxins selective for different Ca2+ channel types have been used to show that central neurotransmission is predominantly evoked by the activation of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type channels) and CaV2.2 (N-type channels) (7Takahashi T. Momiyama A. Nature. 1993; 366: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 8Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The ability of these channels to evoke secretion may involve a synaptic protein interaction site (the “synprint” site) 6The abbreviations and trivial names used are: synprint site, synaptic protein interaction site; MNC, magnocellular neurosecretory cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. 6The abbreviations and trivial names used are: synprint site, synaptic protein interaction site; MNC, magnocellular neurosecretory cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. in the intracellular loop between domain II and domain III that interacts with the synaptic proteins syntaxin, SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin (9Sheng Z.H. Westenbroek R.E. Catterall W.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Spafford J.D. Zamponi G.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These interactions influence channel gating (11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and may be important in determining the relationship between Ca2+ influx and exocytotic secretion. A peptide that mimics the interaction site has been shown to inhibit evoked exocytotic secretion from neurons, presumably by displacing syntaxin from its binding site on the Ca2+ channel II–III loop (13Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 781-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The rbA isoform of CaV2.1, which was isolated from rat brain (14Starr T.V. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), binds with SNAP-25 in vitro (15Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Co-expression of SNAP-25 with the rbA isoform causes a negative shift in steady-state inactivation that appears to be relieved through the formation of a complex with syntaxin and synaptotagmin (16Zhong H. Yokoyama C.T. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 939-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CaV2.1 channels exogenously expressed in superior cervical ganglion cells are able to evoke neurotransmission (17Mochida S. Westenbroek R.E. Yokoyama C.T. Itoh K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but expression of channels in which the II–III loop had been deleted had reduced effectiveness (18Mochida S. Westenbroek R.E. Yokoyama C.T. Zhong H. Myers S.J. Scheuer T. Itoh K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this loss of effectiveness was associated with a loss of presynaptic localization, suggesting that the synprint site is important in targeting or anchoring CaV2.1 to the presynaptic terminal (18Mochida S. Westenbroek R.E. Yokoyama C.T. Zhong H. Myers S.J. Scheuer T. Itoh K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Splice variants of human CaV2.2 have been identified that lack a large part of the II–III loop, including a large part of the synprint site (19Kaneko S. Cooper C.B. Nishioka N. Yamasaki H. Suzuki A. Jarvis S.E. Akaike A. Satoh M. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the importance of this site, it is likely that these deletion variants have functions different from those of channels containing the interaction site. Although a deletion variant lacking 348 amino acids in the II–III loop was reported when CaV2.1 was cloned from rabbit brain (20Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), there have been no further characterizations of such deletion variants (4Jurkat-Rott K. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 554: 609-619Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Lipscombe D. Pan J.Q. Gray A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore conducted nested PCR experiments to detect alternative splicing within the II–III loop of rat CaV2.1. We report two novel splice variants that have large deletions within the II–III loop including large portions of the synprint site. PCR experiments on RNA extracted from various brains areas and cell types show that mRNA species coding for these variants are expressed in most brain areas. These mRNA species are also found in two types of neuroendocrine cell, PC12 cells (a rat pheochromocytoma cell line) and the magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamus, acutely isolated from the supraoptic nucleus. To test whether the CaV2.1 variants are expressed in these cell types, we compared the immunostaining of two antibodies directed against different portions of CaV2.1, one that binds to a sequence in the II–III loop (which would therefore not recognize the deletion variants) and one that binds to the carboxyl terminus (which would therefore recognize channels with or without the deletions in the II–III loop). We found that both antibodies (which we will refer to as “selective” and “inclusive,” respectively) stained membranes in the somata and axon terminals of cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that these cells express channels containing an intact II–III loop. In both types of neuroendocrine cells, however, the inclusive antibody showed robust staining of the plasma membrane, whereas the selective antibody failed to show clear plasma membrane staining. Expression in a mammalian cell line revealed that although both splice variants yielded Ca2+ currents, the variant containing the larger deletion resulted in current with a much lower density and with a marked depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. These data support the hypothesis that the predominant form of CaV2.1 expressed in these neuroendocrine cells lacks a portion of the II–III loop and have important implications for Ca2+ channel function and targeting in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. MNC Cultures—Male Long-Evans rats (200–300 g) were anesthetized with halothane and killed with a rodent guillotine following a protocol approved by the University of Saskatchewan Animal Care Committee. The supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus was dissected, and MNCs were isolated following treatment with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (21Oliet S.H. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 455: 291-306Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 571-580Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Zhang W. Star B. Rajapaksha W.R. Fisher T.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 181-193Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MNC axon terminals were isolated from neurohypophyses using a similar protocol, as described previously (24Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 383-388Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Fisher T.E. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hippocampal Neuron Cultures—Hippocampi were isolated from Wistar rats on postnatal day 2 and dissociated using a published protocol (26Rigato, F. (2005) in New Methods for Culturing from Nervous Tissues (Poindron, P., Piguet, P., and Forster, E. eds) pp 82-95, Karger, Basel, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar) involving digestion with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured in Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen). Neurons were plated at a density of 50–60/mm2. Immunocytochemistry was performed within 4 days. PC12 Cultures—PC12 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Ham's F12 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (82.5%; Sigma), horse serum (15%; Sigma), and fetal bovine serum (2.5%; Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Primers and PCR—Rats were killed as described above. The brains were immediately removed, and various parts were dissected for total RNA extraction. RNA from these parts was isolated immediately or stored at -70 °C after being frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Variants with differences in the II–III loop were sought using nested RT-PCR. The sequence of the rat CaV2.1 II–III loop (accession number NM_012918) was used to design two sets of primers (P1 forward, 5′-GGC ATG GTG TTC TCC ATC TA-3′, 2065–2084, and P2 reverse, 5′-GAG CCC TGG CTC TCT TTT CT-3′, 2959–2978) that were then synthesized by the University Core DNA Services, University of Calgary. Initial amplification was carried out by 20 cycles of 95 °C for 35 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min after initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 min and then the final elongation of 72 °C for 10 min using primers P1 and P2. The products were reamplified with nested primers (P3 forward, 5′-ACC CTC TTC GGG AAC TAC AC-3′, 2098–2117, and P4 reverse, 5′-CTC CCC ATC ATC GCC TTC-3′, 2878–2895) using 23 cycles of 95 °C for 35 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min after initial denaturation of 3 min at 95 °C and then a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. A negative control without cDNA was run with each reaction. Gels were visualized under UV light and photographed using Polaroid film, and the band intensities were measured using the NIH Image J software. The housekeeping gene gapdh was used as a positive control (P5 forward, 5′-CAT GAC AAC TTT GGC ATC GT-3′, 1336–1355, and P6 reverse 5′-ATG TAG GCC ATG AGG TCC AC-3′, 1816–1835; 31 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min). Gel bands were cut and DNA was eluted using Quantum Prep™ Freeze 'N Squeeze DNA gel extraction spin columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories). DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and ethanol and sequenced at the Plant Biotechnology Institute, National Research Council, Saskatoon, Canada. For the study of expression of these splice variants in MNCs, acutely isolated MNCs in culture (see above) were aspirated using a micropipette and subjected to single-cell RT-PCR (27Glasgow E. Kusano K. Chin H. Mezey E. Young III, W.S. Gainer H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5391-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Immunofluorescence—An affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody directed against a sequence in domain IV of human CaV2.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against peptide residues 865–881 of rat CaV2.1 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) were used for immunofluorescence experiments on cultured cells. Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% sodium periodate, and 0.34% lysine (28McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar) and permeabilized and blocked for 1 h with digitonin (100 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (4%), normal donkey serum (4%), and sodium azide (0.02%) in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies (1:100) were incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat (1:400, Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit goat (1:200, Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a 40× objective and the appropriate filter sets. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera. The immunoblots were obtained using a standard protocol following solubilization of rat brain tissue. Construction of Deletion Variants—Splice variants were created using overlap extension PCR. The full-length rat CaV2.1 channel (accession number NM_012918) was used to design primers, synthesized by the University Core DNA Services, University of Calgary. Both the large and the small II–III linker deletion variants used outside forward primer (U1BmgBI) 5′-CGA AAC AGA CGT GGA GCA GAG GCA CCC TTT TGA TGG-3′, 1227–1262, and inside reverse primers (L2D1) 5′-GCC GGC CTA GTG GCG TCG CGG GGA CTC ACT TCT GCC ACC T-3′, 2240–2259, and (L2D2) 5′-GCC GGC CTA GTG GCG TCG CGG CTA GCC AGC AGG TTC TGC T-3′, 2357–2376, respectively, to amplify the fragment flanking the upstream portion of the deletion and append a 20-base overlap homologous to the downstream flank. Similarly, the downstream flanking region for the large and small variants were amplified with forward primers (U3D1) 5′-AGG TGG CAG AAG TGA GTC CCC GCG ACG CCA CTA GGC CGG C-3′, 2842–2861, and (U3D2) 5′-AGC AGA ACC TGC TGG CTA GCC GCG ACG CCA CTA GGC CGG C-3′, 2842–2861, respectively, with a downstream reverse primer (L4SgrAI) 5′-CGC CGG TGT CTG CGC TCC CTG TCA TCG TG-3′, 2929–2957. These products similarly possessed a 20-base overlap homologous to the upstream flank. Thermocycling was conducted using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The initial denaturation was carried out at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 2 min) followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. A second round of PCR using upstream and downstream PCR products plus outside forward (U1XhoI) and reverse (L4BmgBI) primers was conducted using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The initial denaturation was carried out at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 45 s), annealing (65 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 4 min) followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Once complete, the two final PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega) and transformed into DH5α-competent cells. This amplified deletion region was then subcloned back into wild-type Cav2.1 channels at restriction endonuclease sites BmgBI and SgrAI. The correct splice variant identity was confirmed by sequencing by the University Core DNA Services, University of Calgary. Electrophysiology—Culturing, maintenance, and transfection of tsA-201 cells via the calcium phosphate method was conducted as described by us previously (29Beedle A.M. McRory J.E. Poirot O. Doering C.J. Altier C. Barrere C. Hamid J. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological characterization, full-length CaV2.1 channels or the two cloned CaV2.1 splice variants were co-transfected into tsA-201 cells with cDNAs encoding rat β1b, rat α2-δ1, and enhanced green fluorescent protein as described by us previously. Whole-cell recordings were conducted using external solution containing 5 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium-chloride, 87.5 mm CsCl, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.7 with tetraethylammonium-OH), and internal solution containing 108 mm cesium-methanesulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, and 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP9 software. Steady-state inactivation curves were obtained by holding cells at different conditioning voltages (starting at -120 mV) for 10 s prior to stepping to a test potential of +10 mV. Data were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Series resistance was compensated by 80%. Currents larger than 2 nA were eliminated from biophysical characterization but were included in the analysis of peak current densities. Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted using the Boltzmann equation. In Fig. 4, all error bars denote standard errors; statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance. Identification of Splice Variants of CaV2.1—Nested PCR primers designed to encompass the RNA sequence coding for much of the CaV2.1 subunit II–III loop were used to probe RNA isolated from rat brain tissue. In addition to the full-length sequence, which generated a band close to the expected size of 797 bp, we identified three bands of smaller size. These three bands were isolated, and the DNA was sequenced. These sequences, which correspond to lengths of 332, 260, and 215 bp, were used to predict the amino acid sequences that would result from the deletions. Although the intermediate band would result in an mRNA containing a stop codon and would thus be unlikely to be physiologically relevant, the smallest and largest bands would result in unchanged reading frames with expected deletions of 194 and 155 amino acids. We will refer to these two deletion mutants as CaV2.1-Δ1 and CaV2.1-Δ2. The predicted structures and sequences of the two variants are shown in Fig. 1. The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the structure of the CaV2.1 α1 subunit. The II–III loop is the intracellular loop between domains II and III. The approximate location of the synprint site is shown by the thicker line, and the sites of the deletions in the identified mutants are shown by the arrows. The sequence coded for by CaV2.1-Δ1 would correspond to a deletion beginning at amino acid 754 and ending at amino acid 947, whereas CaV2.1-Δ2 would predict a deletion between amino acids 793 and 947. The amino acid sequences of the two deletion mutants are compared with the full-length sequence at the bottom of Fig. 1. The upper sequence is that of the full-length protein with the synprint site underlined, the second sequence is that of CaV2.1-Δ1, and the bottom sequence is that of CaV2.1-Δ2. Tissue Distribution of the CaV2.1 Variants—PCR reactions were carried out on RNA isolated from a variety of brain areas, as well as in cultured neuroendocrine cells (see below). The results of such experiments are shown in the images of gels at the top of Fig. 2. The graph at the bottom of Fig. 2 displays the intensity of the bands for CaV2.1-Δ1(Δ1) and CaV2.1-Δ2(Δ2) in the listed brain regions, expressed as a fraction of the intensity of the band for gapdh. Both CaV2.1-Δ1 and CaV2.1-Δ2 are widely expressed in the brain. In all brain areas tested, with the exception of the hippocampus, the relative expression of CaV2.1-Δ1 is greater than that of CaV2.1-Δ2. Expression appears to be highest in the hypothalamus and cortex. Neither variant was seen in tissues from outside the brain (kidney, spleen, pancreas; data not shown). Expression of the CaV2.1 Variants in Neuroendocrine Cells— Since the synprint site is associated with synaptic release, we sought to determine whether the variants are expressed in neuroendocrine cells. Patch clamp and PCR studies of cultured PC12 cells have shown that they express CaV2.1 channels (30Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the results of PCR experiments demonstrating that PC12 cultures express CaV2.1-Δ1. We also tested whether CaV2.1 variants are expressed in the MNCs. Single cell RT-PCR experiments have demonstrated that these cells express CaV2.1, as well as CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and CaV2.2 (27Glasgow E. Kusano K. Chin H. Mezey E. Young III, W.S. Gainer H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5391-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and currents mediated by CaV2.1 have been characterized in both MNC somata (22Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 571-580Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Foehring R.C. Armstrong W.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and axon terminals (24Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 383-388Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies of evoked secretion from isolated MNC terminals suggest that currents mediated by CaV2.1 are important in mediating VP release (32Wang G. Dayanithi G. Kim S. Hom D. Nadasdi L. Kristipati R. Ramachandran J. Stuenkel E.L. Nordmann J.J. Newcomb R. Lemos J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 351-363Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since the MNC somata are highly enriched in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, we first isolated RNA from this tissue to test for the presence of mRNA coding for the CaV2.1 splice variants. These experiments resulted in three bands close in size to those observed in whole brain (Fig. 2). We also probed for expression of the variants in acutely isolated MNCs using single cell RT-PCR. The result of one such experiment is illustrated in Fig. 2. The RNA corresponding to CaV2.1-Δ1 was observed in each of the five cells tested, and three also expressed CaV2.1-Δ2. Immunofluorescence Evidence for the Expression of CaV2.1 II–III Loop Deletion Variants—We used immunocytochemical techniques to test whether cultured cells express channel variants lacking portions of the synprint site as proteins. Antibodies directed against a sequence within the synprint site (the selective antibody) and the carboxyl terminus (the inclusive antibody) of CaV2.1 were used to probe cultured neonatal hippocampal neurons, PC12 cells, and acutely isolated MNCs (Fig. 3). We reasoned that immunoreactivity to the inclusive antibody, in the absence of immunoreactivity to the selective antibody, would suggest the presence of II–III loop deletion variants of CaV2.1. Immunoreactivity to the two antibodies in hippocampal neurons is compared in Fig. 3A. The two antibodies clearly stain both the somatic membrane and the axon terminals of hippocampal neurons, suggesting that CaV2.1 channels including the synprint site are found in both areas. Our data do not, however, provide evidence for expression of CaV2.1 II–III loop deletion variants in hippocampal neurons. The patterns of staining for the two antibodies were clearly different in PC12 cells. Although there was robust membrane staining for the inclusive antibody, there was little or no staining observed on the membrane for the selective antibody. This suggests that a variant lacking a portion of the II–III loop is the predominant form in PC12 cells. Similar results were obtained for isolated MNCs. We compared the staining of the two antibodies both in the MNC somata isolated from the hypothalamus and in the large MNC axon terminals that may be isolated from the neurohypophysis (24Fisher T.E. Bourque C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 383-388Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Fisher T.E. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The inclusive antibody showed clear staining in both locations, whereas the selective antibody showed little membrane staining. The lack of clear immunoreactivity on the MNC terminal membrane using the selective antibody is consistent with a previous report (25Fisher T.E. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and although punctuate staining near the plasma membrane of MNC somata has been observed in a tissue slice preparation, the authors of the report noted that they could not distinguish between membrane staining and staining of synaptic inputs onto the MNC somata (33Joux N. Chevaleyre V. Alonso G. Boissin-Agasse L. Moos F.C. Desarmenien M.G. Hussy N. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 13: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data support the conclusion that the dominant form of CaV2.1 in both neuroendocrine cell types is not immunoreactive to the selective antibody and therefore may lack a portion of the II–III loop. Furthermore, these data suggest that an intact II–III loop is not necessary for the targeting of CaV2.1 to MNC axon terminals. The images at the bottom of Fig. 3 show the results of immunoblots of rat brain tissues using the selective (left) and inclusive (right) antibodies. The selective antibody is directed against the same sequence as an antibody developed by the Catterall laboratory (34Sakurai T. Westenbroek R.E. Rettig J. Hell J. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and appears to recognize a similar pattern of polypeptides, including those with apparent masses of about 210, 190, and 160 kDa. The image at the right shows the pattern of bands recognized by the inclusive antibody, which displays a similar pattern of bands with an additional band just above 175 kDa, which could correspond to one of the splice variants. Biophysical Properties of the Deletion Variants—To determine the functional characteristic of the deletion variants, we used PCR to create the deletions in the rat brain CaV2.1 cDNA (rbA isoform (14Starr T.V. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)) and co-expressed these variants with rat β1b, rat α2-δ1, and enhanced green fluorescent protein in tsA-201 cells followed by whole cell patch clamp recordings. As shown in Fig. 4A, both the full-length CaV2.1 channel, as well as the CaV2.1-Δ1 and CaV2.1-Δ2 constructs, yielded detectable whole cell currents, which were, however, significantly smaller for the CaV2.1-Δ1 isoform (Fig. 4B). The position of the current voltage relation was similar among the three channel subtypes (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the steady-state inactivation curve of the CaV2.1-Δ1 isoform was shifted toward more depolarized voltages (Fig. 4D) in a manner reminiscent of what was observed with synprint deletions in the human CaV2.2 channels (19Kaneko S. Cooper C.B. Nishioka N. Yamasaki H. Suzuki A. Jarvis S.E. Akaike A. Satoh M. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CaV2.1-Δ2 isoform, on the other hand, showed steady-state inactivation properties that were similar to those observed with the full-length channel. These data indicate that there is a functional consequence to alternate splicing of the CaV2.1 synprint region. The Significance of II–III Loop Deletion Variants in CaV2.1— Although several functional splice variants of CaV2.1 have been identified (35Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7214-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), including the optional insertion of a tripeptide sequence (VEA) in the II–III loop (38Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our observations represent the first identification of splice variants of rat CaV2.1 that lack large portions of the II–III loop (4Jurkat-Rott K. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 554: 609-619Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Lipscombe D. Pan J.Q. Gray A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These variants appear to be analogous to two alternatively spliced variants that have deletions within the synprint site in human CaV2.2 (19Kaneko S. Cooper C.B. Nishioka N. Yamasaki H. Suzuki A. Jarvis S.E. Akaike A. Satoh M. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both deletions in CaV2.2 resulted in a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. Although the smaller deletion in CaV2.1 (CaV2.1-Δ2) resulted in currents that were similar in amplitude and biophysical properties to the full-length channel, the variant containing the larger of the two deletions, CaV2.1-Δ1, yielded currents that were of much smaller amplitude, displayed a slight rightward shift (∼6 mV) in the voltage at which the current peaked and a large rightward shift (∼40 mV) in the voltage dependence of inactivation. Although syntaxin causes a hyperpolarizing shift in the half-inactivation voltage of rat (11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) CaV2.2 and does interact with the rabbit isoform of CaV2.1 (15Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), syntaxin does not bind to the rat isoform of CaV2.1 (rbA (15Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)) and does not cause a shift in its voltage dependence of inactivation (16Zhong H. Yokoyama C.T. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 939-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we did not observe a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation of either the full-length CaV2.1 or the two deletion variants upon co-expression with syntaxin (data not shown). Although there is evidence for the binding of a complex of synaptic proteins to CaV2.1 (which includes syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin (16Zhong H. Yokoyama C.T. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 939-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), the loci and large size of the regions deleted in CaV2.1-Δ1 and -Δ2 make binding of such a complex appear unlikely. SNAP-25 has been shown to bind to a motif in CaV2.2 found between residues 781 and 789 (LRASCEALY (40Yokoyama C.T. Myers S.J. Fu J. Mockus S.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 28: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), and a highly homologous site is found in CaV2.1 at residues 790–798 (LLASREALY; Fig. 1). This sequence is completely absent in CaV2.1-Δ1 and is severely truncated in CaV2.1-Δ2. These observations, together with our imaging and electrophysiological data, suggest that the deletion of the synprint region of CaV2.1 may have multiple consequences including altered coupling to the synaptic release machinery, altered subcellular targeting, and altered channel function. The predominance of these deletion variants in neuroendocrine cells suggests that they may have a role in triggering non-synaptic exocytotic release. The lower levels of steady-state inactivation in CaV2.1-Δ1 may indicate that the inactivation of CaV2.1 plays a role in synaptic release that is not important for neuroendocrine release. The observation that a deletion mutant is present in the MNC terminals suggests that the II–III loop is not necessary for axonal targeting of CaV2.1, despite the observation that selective excision of the II–III loop of CaV2.1 appears to inhibit axonal targeting or anchoring in superior cervical ganglion neurons (18Mochida S. Westenbroek R.E. Yokoyama C.T. Zhong H. Myers S.J. Scheuer T. Itoh K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Targeting in MNCs may therefore depend on sequences in a different portion of the channel. One possibility is an interaction site found in the carboxyl terminus of both CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 that interacts with the modular adaptor proteins CASK and Mint1 (41Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that this sequence is necessary and sufficient for axonal targeting of CaV2.2 in hippocampal neurons (41Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 42Maximov A. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6939-6952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homolog of CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in snail neurons lacks the synprint site entirely, and axonal targeting in these neurons was found to require the interaction of the channels with CASK and Mint1 (43Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When CaV2.2 variants lacking the II–III loop were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, they were transported to the axon terminals, suggesting that the synprint site is not necessary for axonal targeting (44Szabo Z. Obermair G.J. Cooper C.B. Zamponi G.W. Flucher B.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These variants were, however, deficient in their ability to form presynaptic clusters, suggesting that the synprint site has a role in the formation of presynaptic structures. The observation that deletion variants of both CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 are found in axon terminals suggests that axonal targeting may be mediated by mechanisms other than those requiring an interaction with synaptic proteins. One possibility is that an interaction with CASK and Mint1 is also important in the axonal targeting of CaV2.1. Expression studies in mice hippocampal cultures, however, suggest that the carboxyl terminus of CaV2.1 is not indispensable for axonal targeting (45Hu Q. Saegusa H. Hayashi Y. Tanabe T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ca2+ channel targeting experiments in a polarized epithelial cell suggest that association with different β subunits can be an important determinant of axonal targeting for CaV2.1 but not CaV2.2 (46Brice N.L. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 685-694Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More work will be required to elucidate the mechanisms of CaV2.1 targeting in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. We have identified two novel splice variants of rat CaV2.1 that lack much of the II–III loop, including the synaptic protein interaction site. Such deletion variants appear to be expressed in two types of neuroendocrine cells, including in the axon terminals of the MNCs. Furthermore, we have shown that one of the variants displays a marked difference in voltage-dependent inactivation. These data have important implications about the function of the II–III loop and the structural components of the CaV2.1 channel that are involved in Ca2+ channel targeting in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.

To understand this unique folding mechanism, we investigated the refolding processes of the P1-P1′-cleaved forms of wild type ovalbumin (cl-OVA) and the R339T mutant (cl-R339T). In the native conditions, cl-OVA is trapped as the stressed conformer, whereas cl-R339T attains the relaxed structure. Under urea denaturing conditions, these cleaved proteins completely dissociated into the heavy (Gly1-Ala352) and light (Ser353-Pro385) chains. Upon refolding, the heavy chains of both proteins formed essentially the same initial burst refolding intermediates and then reassociated with the light chain counterparts. The reassociated intermediates both refolded into the native states with indistinguishable kinetics. The two refolded proteins, however, had a notable difference in thermostability. cl-OVA refolded into the stressed form with Tm = 68.4 °C, whereas cl-R339T refolded into the relaxed form with Tm = 85.5 °C. To determine whether cl-R339T refolds directly to the relaxed state or through the stressed state, conformational analyses by anion-exchange chromatography and fluorescence measurements were executed. The results showed that cl-R339T refolds first to the stressed conformation and then undergoes the loop insertion. This is the first demonstration that the P1-P1′-cleaved serpin peptide capable of loop insertion refolds to the stressed conformation. This highlights that the stressed conformation of serpins is an inevitable intermediate state on the folding pathway to the relaxed structure.

Therefore a central target of serpin studies is how the serpin polypeptide can fold into a metastable structure avoiding thermodynamically more stable conformations.

Ovalbumin contains a disulfide (Cys73-Cys120) and four sulfhydryls (Cys11, Cys30, Cys367, and Cys382), and disulfide rearrangements (dashed arrows) occur in non-native states at neutral pH conditions. DN-SS can be prepared by denaturation of ovalbumin in acidic urea conditions (9 m urea, pH 2.0) where disulfide rearrangements are blocked. IN-SS is formed by dilution of DN-SS with a neutral pH buffer within a time scale of milliseconds. This intermediate folds to NN-SS and concurrently transforms to a non-productive intermediate, Imis-SS, which is capable of refolding to NN-SS via IN-SS. This demonstrates that non-native interactions are produced during the refolding and that these interactions decelerate folding but do not direct misfolding. The importance of non-native interactions in protein folding has been indicated by many folding studies (19Vendruscolo M. Paci E. Dobson C.M. Karplus M.

Biosci. 2005; 10: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Ovalbumin has unique and intriguing characteristics of advantage in investigating metastable folding. The egg white protein is a non-inhibitory serpin that does not undergo the stressed to relaxed transition after P1-P1′ cleavage (25Wright H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14335-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wright H.T. Qian H.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This failure of loop insertion results from bulky Arg339 at position P14 (Fig. 1), whereas typical inhibitory serpins have Thr or Ser. Indeed our crystallographic and biochemical evidence has demonstrated that the Arg339 to Thr mutant of ovalbumin (R339T) is able to undergo RCL insertion (27Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 315: 113-120Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Arii Y. Hirose M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 403-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics imply that P1-P1′-cleaved ovalbumin (cl-OVA) may be capable of RCL insertion in a refolding intermediate state in which structures are not rigidly formed. Furthermore the comparison of the stressed cleaved form (cl-OVA) and the relaxed cleaved form (P1-P1′-cleaved R339T (cl-R339T)) is promising to provide insights into metastable serpin folding.In this study, we analyzed the refolding processes of cl-OVA and cl-R339T from a fully denatured state where these cleaved proteins are completely separated into their heavy (Gly1-Ala352) and light (Ser353-Pro385) chains. We demonstrated that cl-OVA and cl-R339T refold to the stressed and the relaxed forms, respectively, after reassociation of the heavy and light chains in a refolding intermediate state. Furthermore we found that the relaxed structure of refolded cl-R339T is formed via the stressed conformation during refolding. This is the first report that the P1-P1′-cleaved serpin peptide capable of loop insertion refolds to the stressed conformation. On the basis of the observations, we propose a model for the refolding pathways of cleaved serpins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Intact wild type ovalbumin (int-OVA) from egg white (29Søensen S.P.L. Hørup M. C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg. 1915; 12: 12-67Google Scholar, 30Kitabatake N. Ishida A. Doi E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 967-973Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and intact R339T (int-R339T) (31Takahashi N. Orita T. Hirose M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Arii Y. Takahashi N. Tatsumi E. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. cl-OVA and cl-R339T were prepared by incubation of a 225 μm concentration of the intact forms in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 2 h with 60 μg/ml porcine pancreatic elastase Type I (EC 3.4.21.36, purchased from Sigma). The limited proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 0.015 volume of 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 2-propanol solution. After the buffer was replaced by 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, using a Sephadex G-10 column (GE Healthcare NAP-10) at 2 °C, the obtained sample was loaded onto a UNO Q-6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the buffer, and then the bound protein was eluted with a sodium phosphate gradient (50-150 mm). The fractions of the cleaved form were collected and checked by Tricine SDS-PAGE (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the samples were estimated from the absorption at 280 nm by the method of Pace et al. (34Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). For preparation of the disulfide-reduced proteins, 0.3 mm disulfide-bonded proteins were incubated with 15 mm DTT at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.2.Preparation of the Heavy and Light Chains of Cleaved Ovalbumin—The urea-denatured heavy (Gly1-Ala352) and light (Ser353-Pro385) chains were prepared as follows. Disulfide-reduced cl-OVA or cl-R339T was denatured by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in acid/urea solution (0.2 m HCl, 8 m urea, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 2.2) where formation of a disulfide linkage is blocked by acidic pH. The denatured protein was loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Sephacryl S-100 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated with acid/urea solution, and then polypeptides were separated into two distinct peaks as detected by absorbance at 220 nm. The early and late fractions were found by Tricine SDS-PAGE (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) to correspond to the heavy chain (H-OVA or H-R339T) and the light chain, respectively. The N-terminal sequence of the late peptide fraction was analyzed with a sequenator, Procise 492 (Applied Biosystems), and determined to be Ser-Val-Ser, which corresponded to the P1′-P2′-P3′ residues (Ser353-Val354-Ser355) of ovalbumin. For further analyses, the separated heavy and light chains were concentrated with a concentrator (Millipore Centriprep-10 and -3), and the protein concentration was adjusted using acid/urea solution. The molar concentration of the heavy chain was estimated from the absorption at 280 nm by the method of Pace et al. (34Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar), and that of the light chain was estimated on the basis of the molar concentration of the cysteine residues (Cys367 and Cys382) determined by use of 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzonic acid (35Fernandez-Diez M.J. Osuga D.T. Feenay R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The disulfide-bonded H-OVA for the disulfide rearrangement experiment was prepared from the non-reduced cl-OVA in the same manner.Refolding Experiments—Refolding was initiated by 20-fold dilution of 22.5 μm urea-denatured protein with refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.6) giving a final pH of 8.2. The protein was allowed to refold at 25 °C. The partially refolded heavy chain IN-H was prepared by 19.5-fold dilution of the urea-denatured heavy chain with refolding buffer, and the further refolding to the native state was initiated by the addition of 1/39 volume of the urea-denatured light chain to the IN-H sample. CM-OVA, which is an uncleaved ovalbumin derivative with a mispaired disulfide Cys367-Cys382 and carboxymethylated Cys73, was prepared as described previously (10Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). IN-CM-OVA, which is a partially refolded ovalbumin staying in the initial burst refolding intermediate state (10Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was prepared by 20-fold dilution of ureadenatured CM-OVA with non-DTT-containing refolding buffer. The buffers were degassed at reduced pressure and equilibrated under N2 atmosphere prior to the refolding.Intrinsic Trp Fluorescence Measurement—The intrinsic Trp residues in the protein were excited at 295 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco FP-720). For the spectrum measurements at a short refolding time, the time course of fluorescence intensity change was monitored at various emission wavelengths, and the data at a refolding time of 10 s were plotted. The time course of the refolding after the initial burst phase was monitored by the fluorescence intensity change at 338 nm. The fraction of the native form at the refolding time of t,“FN(t),” were calculated by the equation FN(t) = (X0 - Xt)/(X0 - XN) where XN, X0, and Xt are the fluorescence intensity of the native form, the value of the 6-s refolding, and the value at the refolding time t, respectively. All Trp fluorescence measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of 25 °C, and the data were obtained from an average of three to six determinations. The kinetic analysis was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (36Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 683-688Google Scholar).The time course of very early refolding was measured by intrinsic Trp fluorescence (excitation, 295 nm; emission, 338 nm) with a stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). The urea-denatured heavy chain was mixed with a 9-fold volume of refolding buffer, and then the fluorescence change was recorded. For the control, mixing experiments of the urea-denatured heavy chain with acid/urea solution and of the non-denatured cleaved protein with refolding buffer containing 0.8 m urea were carried out. The data were obtained from the average of 10-15 traces. The dead time for mixing was determined to be 4 ms by a model reaction between 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and l-ascorbate (37Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Far-UV CD Measurement—The far-UV CD spectrum was recorded at 25 °C with a spectropolarimeter (Jasco J-720). The path length and slit width were 0.01 cm and 1 nm, respectively. The averages of 10 traces were determined. The samples, except for the urea-denatured proteins, were concentrated and dialyzed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, using a concentrator (Millipore Amicon Ultra-4).ANS Binding Experiments—Anilino-1-naphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) was excited at 350 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco FP-720). The protein samples (1.13 μm) in the various states were mixed with 0.005 volume of 4.02 mm ANS, and the measurements were started after 20 s of mixing.Size Exclusion Chromatography—The refolded samples were obtained by incubation of IN-H in the presence of an equimolar amount of the light chain at 25 °C for 24 h and then concentrated with a concentrator (Millipore Amicon Ultra-4). The obtained samples and non-denatured protein controls were analyzed at 25 °C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a TSK gel column (Tosoh G3000SWXL) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing 1 mm 2-mercapthoethanol. Urea-denatured H-OVA, H-R339T, and the light chain were also subjected to this analysis using the same column equilibrated with the acid/urea solution.Trypsin Resistance Assay—The trypsin resistance assay was carried out as described elsewhere (10Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly the sample was mixed with 0.01 volume of 12.5 mg/ml trypsin and digested at 25 °C for 1 min. The digestion was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Analysis for Disulfide-involved Cysteines—Urea-denatured disulfide-bonded H-OVA in acid/urea solution was refolded by dilution with non-DTT-containing refolding buffer, and the further refolding was initiated by the addition of an equimolar amount of the light chain. Sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges were quenched at various refolding times by mixing the protein samples with 0.24 volume of 2 m HCl. Disulfide-involved cysteines were determined by a peptide mapping analysis with reverse phase HPLC as described elsewhere (10Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data were obtained from the average of quadruplicate determinations.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The refolded samples were prepared in the same manner as described under “Size Exclusion Chromatography” and dialyzed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, using a concentrator (Millipore Amicon Ultra-4). The refolded proteins and the non-denatured protein controls at 11 μm were analyzed with a differential scanning calorimeter (Micro Cal MCS-DSC) at the heating rate of 1 °C·min-1.Analysis for the Stressed and Relaxed Conformations by Anion-exchange HPLC—The mixture of IN-H and the light chain was allowed to refold at 25 °C in the same conditions as described above, and then an aliquot at various refolding times was diluted 5-fold with 0.15 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl buffer, pH 8.0, prechilled at 0.5 °C. The sample was kept at 0.5 °C and applied to Mono Q 5/50 GL or 10/100 GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 0.15 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 0.5 °C. The bound protein was eluted with an NaCl gradient (20-150 mm) and then with 1 m Tris base, 1 m NaCl, pH 10.6. The peaks were analyzed using a Bowin system (Jasco), and the kinetic curve-fitting analysis was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (36Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 683-688Google Scholar). The data were obtained from the average of quadruplicate determinations.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis of the Stressed and Relaxed Forms—The proteins obtained by the HPLC analysis described in the preceding section were concentrated with a concentrator (Millipore Ultrafree-0.5) at 0.5 °C. The protein concentrations of the obtained samples and the non-denatured protein controls were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad) and adjusted to 20 μm with prechilled Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The samples were maintained at 0.5 °C until mixing with ANS or subjected to incubation at 25 °C for 1 h followed by cooling at 0.5 °C for 5 min. The chilled sample was mixed with 19 volumes of 0.105 mm ANS in Tris buffer at 4 °C and then incubated for 20 min at the same temperature. It was confirmed by the CD analysis described in the supplemental data that the protein refolding was quenched at 4 °C at least for 4 h. The Trp residues of the protein were exited at 295 nm, and ANS fluorescence was scanned from 410 to 580 nm at 4 °C within 1 min by use of a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco FP-720) with a temperature control and N2 stream system (Jasco ETC-272). The data were obtained from the average of three determinations.RESULTSRefolding of Cleaved Ovalbumin Detected by Spectroscopic Analyses—Ovalbumin has disulfide bond Cys73-Cys120, but its conformational structure is indistinguishable from that of the disulfide-reduced form (38Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, fully denatured ovalbumin can refold to the native structure without the formation of a disulfide linkage (17Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol.

Thus refolding experiments in this study, except for the refolding of CM-OVA and the disulfide rearrangement analysis (see Fig. 4), were principally carried out under the disulfide-reduced conditions, which give advantages in the refolding yield and in preventing a cross-linkage between the heavy and light chains by a disulfide bond.FIGURE 4Disulfide rearrangements during refolding. Sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges during refolding were quenched by the addition of HCl at various refolding times, and then the disulfide-involved cysteines for Cys11 (open squares), Cys30 (closed squares), Cys73 (closed circles), Cys120 (open circles), Cys367 (open triangles), and Cys382 (closed triangles) were determined by the peptide mapping method (10Onda M.

In the denaturing conditions, H-OVA and H-R339T showed the typical fluorescence and CD spectra of the unfolded protein. After initiating the refolding by dilution with refolding buffer, both H-OVA and H-R339T immediately formed a partially refolded intermediate, IN-H, that had the same maximum fluorescence at 338 nm as native int-OVA and 56% of CD intensity at 222 nm as compared with native int-OVA. IN-H was formed within an instrumental dead time of 4 ms (Fig. 2a, inset), and the fluorescence spectra at 10 s of refolding were almost indistinguishable from those at 2 h of refolding (data not shown). These characteristics are consistent with those of IN-CM-OVA, which is an uncleaved ovalbumin derivative staying in the initial burst refolding intermediate state (10Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Refolding of cleaved ovalbumin monitored by intrinsic Trp fluorescence (a), far-UV CD (b), and ANS fluorescence (c).

IN-H-OVA and IN-R339T were prepared by incubation for 2 h at 25 °C after dilution of the urea-denatured H-OVA and H-R339T, respectively.

Since then, his eldest son and successor, King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, has sought to improve cancer treatment in his country as part of an effort to boost healthcare and technological development. The country's capital, Amman, now boasts a world-class cancer treatment center, which draws patients from throughout the region. To lead that effort, the king tapped Samir Khleif, chief of the cancer vaccine section at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Khleif, who received his medical degree in Jordan, now has an even bigger mandate from the king: to build an internationally renowned institute devoted to cancer research and biotechnology. Construction on The King Hussein Institute for Cancer and Biotechnology is scheduled to begin on the outskirts of Amman this month, with an expected completion in 2010."
