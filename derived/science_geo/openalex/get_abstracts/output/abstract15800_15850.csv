https://openalex.org/W2059433877,"The enzyme ornithine decarboxylase is the key regulator of the synthesis of polyamines which are essential for cell proliferation. Expression of this enzyme is transiently increased upon stimulation by growth factors, but becomes constitutively activated during cell transformation induced by carcinogens, viruses or oncogenes. To test whether ornithine decarboxylase could be a common mediator of transformation and oncogenic itself, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with expression vectors carrying the complementary DNA encoding human ornithine decarboxylase in sense and antisense orientations. The increased expression of the enzyme (50-100-times endogenous levels) induced not only cell transformation, but also anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of M(r) 130K. Expression of ornithine decarboxylase antisense RNA was associated with an epithelioid morphology and reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, blocking the endogenous enzyme using specific inhibitor or synthesizing antisense RNA prevented transformation of rat fibroblasts by temperature-sensitive v-src oncogene. Our results imply that the gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase is a proto-oncogene central for regulation of cell growth and transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1511239607,"We have examined the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent polymerase and ribonuclease H catalytic activities of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase using rapid transient kinetic methods with defined synthetic 25/45-mer DNA/RNA and DNA/DNA primer/templates. The Kd value for interaction of the enzyme with duplex DNA was 4.7 nM, and the value for RNA/DNA heteroduplex was of similar magnitude. A pre-steady state burst of nucleoside triphosphate incorporation was observed for both DNA and RNA templates. Analysis of the dATP concentration dependence of the burst rate provided Kd values for dATP of 4 and 14 microM and maximum rates of single nucleotide incorporation, kpol, of 33 and 74 s-1, for DNA and RNA templates, respectively. Subsequent turnovers were limited by the rate of dissociation of the primer/template from the enzyme at rates of 0.18 and 0.06 s-1 for duplex DNA and RNA/DNA heteroduplex, respectively. Analysis of rates of DNA polymerization and RNA cleavage using the RNA template revealed that the two activities are independent of one another. The polymerization rate (4-70 s-1) was dependent on dATP concentration, whereas the RNA cleavage occurred at a constant rate of 10 s-1 over the 100-fold dATP concentration range (2-200 microM). Examination of the RNA cleavage products resulting from a single turnover indicates that the polymerase and ribonuclease domains of the enzyme are separated by a distance corresponding to 19 bases of RNA/DNA heteroduplex, consistent with the recently published crystal structure (Kohlstaedt, L. A., Wang, J., Friedman, J., Rice, P. A., and Steitz, T. A. (1992) Science 256, 1783-1790). Analysis of the kinetics of processive synthesis suggested that the initial binding of dNTP leads to a faster rate of dissociation of DNA from the enzyme. Further investigation supported a two-step dNTP binding mechanism with the formation of an initial E.DNA.dNTP complex followed by a more stable E'.DNA.dNTP complex. The Kd values for incorporation of incorrect nucleoside triphosphates opposite a DNA template thymidine were 1010 microM for dGTP, 1240 microM for dCTP, and 840 microM for dTTP. The corresponding maximum kpol rates were 4.8 s-1 for dGTP, 0.52 s-1 for dCTP, and 0.41 s-1 for dTTP. These values provide fidelity estimates of 1740 for discrimination against dGTP, 19,700 for dCTP, and 16,900 for dTTP misincorporations at this site."
https://openalex.org/W1994721743,"We have investigated the molecular nature of the high affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors by using cell lines expressing gp75LNGFR and gp140trk. Our results suggest that gp75LNGFR and gp140trk interact with NGF independently and that only gp140trk mediates NGF signaling. NGF binds to gp140trk with picomolar affinity and induces its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues regardless of the presence of gp75LNGFR. NGF-gp140trk complexes display the slow dissociation rate and rapid internalization characteristics of high affinity NGF receptors. Cross-linking studies reveal the existence of gp75LNGFR and gp140trk homodimers. However, we were unable to detect gp75LNGFR-gp140trk heterodimers. Coexpression in COS cells of wild-type and kinase deficient mutants reveals that gp140trk receptors can undergo intermolecular phosphorylation, indicating the formation of functional homodimers. Moreover, these kinase deficient mutants inhibit NGF-induced signaling through wild-type gp140trk receptors. These results indicate that the functional high affinity NGF receptors consist of gp140trk homodimeric (or oligomeric) complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1675755394,"Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is induced in vascular smooth muscle cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) where it appears to mediate a variety of vascular dysfunctions. In some cell types tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis has also been found to be induced by cytokines. Because BH4 is a cofactor for NO synthase, we investigated whether BH4 synthesis is required for LPS-induced NO production in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). The total biopterin content (BH4 and more oxidized states) of untreated RASMC was below our limit of detection. However, treatment with LPS caused a significant rise in biopterin levels and an induction of NO synthesis; both effects of LPS were markedly potentiated by interferon-gamma. 2,4-Diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), a selective inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase I, the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo BH4 synthesis, completely abolished the elevated biopterin levels induced by LPS. DAHP also caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced NO synthesis. Inhibition of NO synthesis by DAHP was reversed by sepiapterin, an agent which circumvents the inhibition of biopterin synthesis by DAHP by serving as a substrate for BH4 synthesis via the pterin salvage pathway. The reversal by sepiapterin was overcome by methotrexate, an inhibitor of the pterin salvage pathway. Sepiapterin, and to a lesser extent BH4, dose-dependently enhanced LPS-induced NO synthesis, indicating that BH4 concentration limits the rate of NO production by LPS-activated RASMC. Sepiapterin also caused LPS-induced NO synthesis to appear with an abbreviated lag period phase, suggesting that BH4 availability also limits the onset of NO synthesis. In contrast to the stimulation of LPS-induced NO synthesis, observed when sepiapterin was given alone, sepiapterin became a potent inhibitor of NO synthesis in the presence of methotrexate. This is attributable to a direct inhibitory action of sepiapterin on GTP cyclohydrolase I, an activity which is only revealed after blocking the metabolism of sepiapterin to BH4. Further studies with sepiapterin, methotrexate, and N-acetylserotonin (an inhibitor of the BH4 synthetic enzyme, sepiapterin reductase) indicated that the BH4 is synthesized in RASMC predominantly from GTP; however, a lesser amount may derive from pterin salvage. We demonstrate that BH4 synthesis is an absolute requirement for induction of NO synthesis by LPS in vascular smooth muscle. Our findings also suggest that pterin synthesis inhibitors may be useful for the therapy of endotoxin- and cytokine-induced shock."
https://openalex.org/W1523151859,"Using conditions that produced chronic inflammation in rat liver, we were able to find a correlation between induction of nitric oxide production and inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12). This enzyme is a tetramer composed of identical M(r) 37,000 subunits. The tetramer contains 16 thiol groups, four of which are essential for enzymatic activity. Our information indicates that four thiol groups are S-nitrosylated by exposure to authentic nitric oxide (NO) gas. Furthermore, NO decreased GAPDH activity while increasing its auto-ADP-ribosylation. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and dithiothreitol are required for the S-nitrosylation of GAPDH caused by the NO-generating compound sodium nitroprusside. Our results suggests that a new and important action of nitric oxide on cells is the S-nitrosylation and inactivation of GAPDH. S-Nitrosylation of GAPDH may be a key covalent modification of multiple regulatory consequences in chronic liver inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1926874813,"We recently demonstrated that human melanocyte proliferation and differentiation could be stimulated by endothelin (ET) derivatives via a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway (Yada, Y., Higuchi, K., and Imokawa, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18352-18357). We show here that the growth factors for human melanocytes are produced and secreted by the surrounding cells, namely human keratinocytes for ET-1 and Big-ET-1. Northern blots have revealed the presence of ET-1 gene transcripts in proliferating human keratinocytes. The ET-1 production by human keratinocytes increased after irradiation with ultraviolet B (UVB) in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by the significant secretion of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Among the cytokines related to UVB-induced cellular reactions and keratinocyte growth, only IL-1 alpha and -1 beta stimulated the secretion of ET-1 and Big-ET-1 but not of ET-3 and Big-ET-3 in a time-dependent manner. Northern blots for IL-1 alpha-stimulated or UVB-exposed human keratinocytes revealed that production of ET-1 gene transcripts markedly increased (by about 300 or 1,200%) with constant levels of beta-actin gene transcripts. In a parallel study, the medium conditioned by UVB-exposed human keratinocytes elicited a significant anti-ET-1 antibody-suppressible increase in DNA synthesis by cultured human melanocytes in a UV dose-dependent manner, which was associated with a marked and rapid (80 s) increase in the intracellular calcium level upon incubation with human melanocytes. These studies suggest that ETs produced and secreted by keratinocytes play an essential role in the maintenance of melanocyte proliferation and UV hyperpigmentation in the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W1975898157,"The Src homology 3 (SH3) region is a protein domain of 55 to 75 amino acids found in many cytoplasmic proteins, including those that participate in signal transduction pathways. The solution structure of the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinase Src was determined by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The molecule is composed of two short three-stranded anti-parallel beta sheets packed together at approximately right angles. Studies of the SH3 domain bound to proline-rich peptide ligands revealed a hydrophobic binding site on the surface of the protein that is lined with the side chains of conserved aromatic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2076171494,"Functional maturation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is executed by its γ-to-ϵ subunit switching. The glycine receptor also has fetal (α2) and adult (α1) isoforms. However, whether subunit switching is responsible for developmental changes in glycine receptor function is not known. We recorded single-channel currents from homomeric glycine receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes with cRNAs encoding the α2 or α1 subunits and compared them with those recorded from native glycine receptors in rat spinal neurons at various ontogenic periods. The mean channel life times of the a1 and mature glycine receptors were equally short, whereas both the α2 and fetal receptors showed a significantly longer open time. Consistent with these results, the decay time of the glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in spinal neurons became shorter during postnatal development. We conclude that developmental switching of a subunits may accelerate the kinetics of IPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1974585341,"The pharmacological and single-channel properties of Ca2+ channels were studied in the somata and dendrites of adult cerebellar Purkinje cells. The Ca2+ channels were exclusively of the high threshold type: low threshold Ca2+ channels were not found. These high threshold channels were not blocked by cu-conotoxin GVIA and were inhibited rather than activated by BAY K 8644. They were therefore pharmacologically distinct from high threshold N- and L-type channels. Funnel web spider toxin was an effective blocker. The channels opened to conductance levels of 9, 14, and 19 pS (in 110 mM Ba2+). These slope conductances were in the range of those reported for N- and L-type channels. Our results are in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Ca2+ channels in Purkinje cells can be classified as P-type channels according to their pharmacology. The results also suggest that distinctions among Ca2+ channel types based on the single-channel conductance are not definitive."

https://openalex.org/W1529637720,"A sensitive immunoblotting assay was developed for the detection of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 from cell extracts and culture medium. HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and human fibroblasts were used as models for the secretion and proteolytic release of pericellular matrix-associated TGF-beta 1. Analysis of the pericellular matrices of the cells indicated that the majority of cell-layer associated TGF-beta 1 was associated with the pericellular matrix. Treatment of the cells with plasmin or thrombin released the matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 to the culture medium. Assays for the biological activity of plasmin-released TGF-beta 1 by Mv1Lu cell growth inhibition assays indicated that the majority was in the latent form. Northern hybridization analyses indicated that the mRNA levels of TGF-beta 1 were not elevated during the proteinase treatment. Experiments using radiolabeled TGF-beta 1 indicated that exogenous active TGF-beta 1 associates mainly with the presumed TGF-beta 1 receptors that were not retained in the extracellular matrix preparations. These results indicate that a major fraction of latent TGF-beta 1 that is produced by the cells is deposited to and remains associated with the pericellular matrices of cultured fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, and that matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 is very susceptible to release by various proteolytic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1546324634,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a key mediator in the migration of neutrophils from the circulation to the site of inflammation in the tissue. IL-8 is secreted by many cell types in response to proinflammatory stimuli such as interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide and is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils. Neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2) and melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (MGSA/GRO) are structurally and functionally related to IL-8 and, like IL-8, bind to specific G protein-coupled receptors on neutrophils. In the present study two closely related cloned IL-8 receptor subtypes are characterized by expression of the cDNA clones in monkey kidney cells (COS-7) or chinese hamster ovary cells and analysis of their ligand binding profiles. Both receptor subtypes bind 125I-labeled IL-8 with similar high affinity, however, the F3R receptor binds IL-8 exclusively, while the 4Ab receptor binds both IL-8 and MGSA/GRO with high affinity and NAP-2 with lesser affinity. Furthermore, we demonstrate with the use of intersubtype chimeric receptors that the specificity of ligand binding to both IL-8 receptor subtypes is dictated by the heterogeneous NH2-terminal domain. The F3R receptor is representative of a restricted IL-8 receptor subtype, and 4Ab represents a nonrestricted receptor subtype. It is proposed that these subtypes be named IL-8 receptors alpha and beta, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1528569669,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major lipolytic enzyme involved in the conversion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to remnants, was found to compete with binding of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M*) to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. Bovine milk LPL displaced both 125I-labeled alpha 2M* and 39-kDa alpha 2M receptor-associated protein (RAP) from the surface of cultured mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors with apparent KI values at 4 degrees C of 6.8 and 30 nM, respectively. Furthermore, LPL inhibited the cellular degradation of 125I-alpha 2M* at 37 degrees C. Because both alpha 2M* and RAP interact with LRP, these data suggest that LPL binds specifically to this receptor. This was further supported by observing that an immunoaffinity-isolated polyclonal antibody against LRP blocked cellular degradation of 125I-LPL in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 125I-LPL bound to highly purified LRP in a solid-phase assay with a KD of 18 nM, and this binding could be partially displaced with alpha 2M* (KI = 7 nM) and RAP (KI = 3 nM). Taken together, these data establish that LPL binds with high affinity to LRP and undergoes LRP-mediated cellular uptake. The implication of these findings for lipoprotein catabolism in vivo may be important if LRP binding is preserved when LPL is attached to lipoproteins. If so, LPL might facilitate LRP-mediated clearance of lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1557819931,"We have previously reported an anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (BC-1) which reacts with an ED-B-containing beta-galactosidase-fibronectin fusion protein but not with an identical beta-galactosidase-fibronectin fusion protein in which the ED-B sequence is omitted. In further experiments aimed at localizing more precisely the epitope recognized by this mAb, we demonstrate that 1) the mAb BC-1 is indeed specific for ED-B-containing fibronectin (FN) molecules even though the epitope recognized by this mAb is localized on the type III homology repeat 7 (the one which precedes the ED-B sequence) and 2) in fibronectin molecules lacking the ED-B sequence, this epitope is masked. We further demonstrate that, to mask the epitope recognized by the mAb BC-1, the presence of at least half of the FN type III homology repeat 9 is necessary. We also report the production of the mAb IST-6 which recognizes only FN molecules in which the ED-B sequence is lacking. These data clearly demonstrate that the presence of the ED-B sequence within FN molecules generates conformational modification in the central part of the molecules that unmasks previously cryptic sequences and masks others."
https://openalex.org/W1581594845,"Cellular uptake of Cd2+ has been monitored using intracellularly trapped dyes, Fura 2 and Quin 2, which bind Cd2+ with extremely high affinity, and digital fluorescence imaging has been used to visualize intracellular free Cd2+. The excitation spectrum of the Cd2+ complex of Fura 2 is similar to that of the Ca2+ complex, whereas Cd2+ displaces Ca2+ from Quin 2 and reduces fluorescence. Fluorescence of Fura 2-loaded cells increased when 50 microM extracellular Cd2+ was added and fluorescence of Quin 2-loaded cells decreased. Cd2+ uptake by GH3 pituitary cells, which occurs in part via voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channels, was increased by BAY K8644 and depolarization and decreased by nimodipine. When Fura 2 and Quin 2 were used to measure Cd2+ uptake by glial C6 cells, which have no L-channel activity, high K+ and BAY K8644 did not change the apparent rate of Cd2+ uptake. GH3 and C6 cells were incubated with Cd2+ for 24 h and loaded with Fura 2, and fluorescence was measured before and after addition of tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), a membrane permeant chelator with extremely high affinity for metals. TPEN had little effect on fluorescence of Fura 2-loaded GH3 and C6 cells not exposed to Cd2+ but decreased fluorescence of cells that had been incubated with 1-10 microM Cd2+. Fluorescence ratio imaging of Fura 2-loaded cells was used to image intracellular free Cd2+ for both GH3 and C6 cells. Cd2+ uptake over 30-180 min could be followed by the increase in 340/380 fluorescence ratio and the increase in fluorescence ratio was reversed within 5 min by TPEN. The results provide further evidence for the importance of voltage-gated calcium channels to Cd2+ uptake of certain cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589578406,"The incubation of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or biologically active phorbol esters promotes the release of nitric oxide to the incubation medium. This process is the result of the induction of the Ca(2+)-and calmodulin-independent form of nitric oxide synthase. Both the release of nitric oxide to the incubation medium and the expression of nitric oxide synthase activity exhibited a lag period of about 45-60 min after cell stimulation. Exposure of hepatocytes to both stimuli produced an antagonistic effect on nitric oxide release, with a half-maximal inhibition obtained with 14 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate at saturating concentration of LPS. Incubation of cells with alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate failed to counteract the effect of LPS or to induce nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C was involved in this process."

https://openalex.org/W1577804622,"The skeletal muscle-specific dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel is a critical component of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. A recessive mutation in mice, muscular dysgenesis (mdg), has previously been described as resulting in defective excitation-contraction coupling. Although the channel-forming subunit (alpha 1) of the skeletal calcium channel is not detectable immunologically, specific mRNA of normal size is present in dysgenic muscle. cDNA for this calcium channel alpha 1 subunit has now been cloned from dysgenic muscle and sequenced in its entirety. A single nucleotide deletion occurs at nucleotide 4010 of the cDNA, resulting in a shift of the translational reading frame. The mutation has been confirmed by direct sequencing of PCR products from homozygous mutant and normal muscle. The mutant polypeptide is predicted to contain the first three repeating domains, five of the normal six transmembrane helices of the last repeating domain, and an altered and truncated C terminus. The mature mRNA encoding the dysgenic alpha 1 subunit appears to be labile. It is possible that premature termination of translation renders the mutant mRNA subject to degradation by nucleases. This work resolves a long-standing controversy on the nature of the primary genetic defect in muscular dysgenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1579538963,"Interferons induce a number of different proteins that mediate the antiproliferative, antiviral, and immunomodulatory functions of interferons. At least three different proteins mediate the antiviral response, and one of them, Mx protein, specifically inhibits the replication of influenza virus and (vesicular stomatitis virus). Mouse and rat Mx1 proteins are nuclear, whereas other presently known Mx proteins are cytoplasmic. The cellular functions of Mx proteins are unknown, but all of them contain a consensus GTP binding site. Very little information is available on the structure and characteristics of the mouse Mx1 protein itself. For biochemical characterization, we expressed mouse Mx1 protein in a baculovirus system and purified it to homogeneity. The purified protein as well as the authentic murine cellular Mx1 protein exists in dimers and trimers in the presence of dissociating solvents, whereas in physiological buffers they form aggregates. Cross-linking experiments done on Mx-expressing cells from various species revealed that mouse, rat, and human Mx proteins exist predominantly in trimers. Amino acid sequence analysis shows that all known Mx proteins have conserved leucine repeats typical for a leucine zipper at their COOH-terminal end. In vitro translation of chimeric catechol O-methyltransferase-Mx1 gene constructs revealed that the leucine zipper domain of Mx1 protein is responsible for the oligomerization. The COOH terminus also functions as a nuclear localization signal. Microinjection of purified oligomers into the cell cytoplasm resulted in a fast accumulation of the protein in the resulted in a fast accumulation of the protein in the nucleus. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that nuclear murine Mx1 protein exists in distinct, electron-dense structures separate from nuclear membrane, and chromatin, or nucleolus. These observations reveal that a COOH-terminal leucine zipper domain is an important structural element of all Mx proteins. Its relevance to the biology and functions of Mx proteins is presently not known."
https://openalex.org/W1992131459,"A synthetic RNA-DNA bubble duplex construct intended to mimic the nucleic acid framework of a functional transcription elongation complex was designed and assembled. The construct consisted of a double-stranded DNA duplex of variable length (the template and nontemplate strands) containing an internal noncomplementary DNA ""bubble"" sequence. The 3' end of an RNA oligonucleotide that is partially complementary to the template DNA strand was hybridized within the DNA bubble to form an RNA-DNA duplex with a non-complementary 5'-terminal RNA tail. The addition of either Escherichia coli or T7 RNA polymerase to this construct formed a complex that synthesized RNA with good efficiency from the hybridized RNA primer in a template-directed and processive manner, and displayed other features of a normal promoter-initiated transcription elongation complex. Other such constructs can be designed to examine many of the functional and regulatory properties of transcription systems."
https://openalex.org/W1571224400,"Cytokine modulation of elastin gene expression was examined by assay of elastin mRNA abundance and by transient transfections of cultured human skin fibroblasts and rat aortic smooth muscle cells with elastin promoter/reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, CAT) constructs. Incubation of cells with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) markedly suppressed the elastin mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner by up to 91%. TNF-alpha also suppressed the expression of the elastin promoter/CAT construct by up to 70% in transiently transfected cells, indicating regulation at the transcriptional level. This suppression was temporally preceded by rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos genes. The down-regulatory effect of TNF-alpha on elastin promoter activity was abolished by co-transfections with a synthetic double-stranded AP-1 oligomer. Furthermore, co-transfection of the elastin promoter construct with c-jun and c-fos expression plasmids resulted in a marked decrease in the promoter activity. Elucidation of the cis-regulatory elements in the elastin promoter by 5' deletion construct analysis implicated a region -290 to -198 containing one AP-1 binding site. The functional role of this AP-1 site was further tested by gel retardation assays which indicated formation of a DNA-protein complex specific for TNF-alpha treated cells. This complex could be partially dissociated by a competing oligomer containing the consensus AP-1 binding site. These observations suggest that the inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on elastin gene expression involve the transcription factor AP-1. Interferon-gamma also suppressed the elastin gene expression at the mRNA level by approximately 52%, but it had no effect on the elastin promoter activity, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms. These results indicate that mediators released from inflammatory cells can modulate elastin gene expression, and such modulation may play a role in diseases characterized by altered accumulation of elastic fibers in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1607095431,"Protein kinases play a pivotal role in the propagation and modulation of transmembrane signaling pathways. Two major classes of receptors, G-protein-linked and tyrosine kinase receptors not only propagate signals but also are substrates for phosphorylation in response to stimulation by agonist ligands. Insulin (operating via tyrosine kinase receptors) and catecholamines (operating by G-protein-linked receptors) are counterregulatory with respect to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. How, on a cellular level, these two distinct classes of receptors may cross-regulate each other remains controversial. In the present work we identify a novel cross-talk between members of two distinct classes of receptors, tyrosine kinase (insulin) and G-protein-linked (beta-adrenergic) receptors. Treatment of DDT1 MF-2 hamster vas deferens smooth muscle cells with insulin promoted a marked attenuation (desensitization) of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of adenylylcyclase. Measured by immune precipitation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors from cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, the basal state of receptor phosphorylation was increased 2-fold by insulin. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that for insulin-stimulated cells, the beta 2-adrenergic receptors showed increased phosphorylation on tyrosyl and decreased phosphorylation on threonyl residues. Phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor was rapid and peaked at 30 min following stimulation of cells by insulin. beta-Adrenergic receptor phosphorylation and attenuation of catecholamine-sensitive adenylylcyclase provide a biochemical basis for the counterregulatory effects of insulin upon catecholamine action."
https://openalex.org/W1569942952,"Incubation of Swiss 3T3 or L929 cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) leads to the rapid stimulation of several cytosolic Ser/Thr kinases active toward myelin basic protein, the S6 peptide (RRLSSLR), the G peptide (SPQPSRRGSESSEE), and Kemptide (LRRASLG). This confirms the hypothesis that kinases other than protein kinases A and C may be involved in the TNF signal transduction. Chromatography on Mono Q resolved multiple kinase peaks with each substrate tested and moreover revealed a TNF-mediated casein kinase-2 activation in both cell lines, measurable with the specific RRREEESEEE peptide or with the G peptide. The TNF-stimulated myelin basic protein kinases-1 and -2 were identified as extracellular signal-regulated kinases-2 and -1, respectively, based on their elution pattern on Mono Q chromatography, their inactivation by protein phosphatase action, their reaction with phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine antibodies, and by their migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as 42- and 44-kDa proteins recognized by anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2030138780,"The developing axons of retinal ganglion cells follow a stereotyped trajectory through the diencephalon to the optic tectum. In Xenopus, this trajectory closely parallels that of a preexisting fiber tract, the tract of the postoptic commissure (TPOC). This tract comprises part of the early CNS scaffold and has been proposed to play a critical role in guiding the later growing optic axons. We have tested this possibility using heterochronic and xenoplastic transplants of eye primordia to force optic axons to enter the brain before scaffold tracts have arisen in the forebrain. We show that optic axons can navigate appropriately in the absence of the TPOC or any other axons, indicating that axonal pathfinding cues are present in the axonless neuroepithelial sheet. We suggest that molecularly distinct heterogeneities within the neuroepithelium are used for pathfinding by early and late developing axons alike in normal development."
https://openalex.org/W1494432265,"The role of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) reverse transcriptase (RT) in the generation of base substitution mutations during retroviral replication was analyzed. To that effect, the in vitro fidelity of the MoMLV RT was compared to the rate of base substitution mutations occurring during the replication of an MoMLV-based retroviral vector. Using the vector in an amber reversion assay, the base substitution mutation rate at a single locus was found to be 2 x 10(-6)/base pair in one cycle of vector virus replication. Analysis of the fidelity of the purified RT using the same template sequence revealed that, of the two mispairs (A.C and T.G) that would lead to reversion of the amber codon during replication, A.C occurs at a rate of 4.0 x 10(-6), and T.G occurs at a rate of 0.7 x 10(-4). While the rate of formation of A.C is very similar to the vector mutation rate, the rate of formation of T.G is more than 30 times higher. This discrepancy in rates suggests that there are other elements in the infected cells that contribute to the fidelity of viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1528393588,"With a recently developed method we detected rapid and sequential reorganization of vitamin D receptors (VDR), including their temporary association with fibers, and we showed that calcitriol induces cGMP accumulation around reorganizing VDRs. In this report we first identified the VDR-associated fibers as microtubules: they show immunoreactivity with tubulin antisera and were sensitive to tubulin-disruptive agents. Tubulin-disruptive agents also prevented calcitriol-induced alignment and intranuclear accumulation of VDR and cGMP, but did not prevent the initial cGMP accumulation in the cytoplasm. Then we studied the effect of molybdate on VDR reorganization and on cGMP accumulation. Sodium molybdate inhibits steroid receptor transformation into a DNA binding form through interaction with the steroid binding region of the receptor. The mechanism of molybdate effect on steroid receptors is not well understood and the interaction of molybdate with guanylate cyclase has not been investigated. We found in cells pretreated with molybdate that the addition of calcitriol resulted in a prolonged and accentuated association of VDR and cGMP with the microtubules. Furthermore, both immunocytology and radioimmunoassay demonstrated that molybdate is a highly potent inducer of guanylate cyclase. Neither calcitriol nor molybdate effect on guanylate cyclase were prevented by methylene blue pretreatment, suggesting that they activate particulate guanylate cyclase. Pretreatment of cells with dibutyryl-cGMP mimicked molybdate effect on VDR reorganization. The effect of molybdate on cGMP may participate in molybdate stabilization of steroid receptors. We suggest that rapid cGMP accumulation after steroid exposure plays a role in facilitation of intracellular transport of the steroid receptor through interaction with microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1497544794,"Abstract A calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase was significantly induced in the liver of rats treated intravenously with heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes and 5 days later with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The apparent calmodulin-dependent and -independent isozymes were separated by Mono Q column chromatography after their partial purification by 2',5'-ADP-agarose affinity chromatography. Both enzymes had a molecular weight of 125,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and required NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and dithiothreitol as cofactors. Their activities were completely inhibited by the specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and N omega-nitro-L-arginine at 80 and 800 microM, respectively. The peptide maps of these two isozymes with lysylendopeptidase and their reverse-phase column chromatographic profiles were indistinguishable. In the presence of bovine calmodulin, the purified calmodulin-dependent isozyme behaved as a calmodulin-independent isozyme on Mono Q column chromatography. The purified calmodulin-independent isozyme was converted to a calmodulin-dependent isozyme by EDTA and EGTA. Calmodulin blot analysis using 125I-calmodulin showed that the two isozymes bound calmodulin equally efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W1564113577,"We have utilized antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to modulate transcriptional activation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) tax gene, the major transcriptional regulator of this virus. 3'-Terminal phosphorothioate-modified antisense ODNs were shown to efficiently inhibit Tax protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Terminal substitution did not affect the affinity of ODNs for their target sequence but conferred a 9-fold increase in tax inhibition in vitro. When delivered into mice by intraperitoneal injection, ODNs inhibited tax expression in established tumors by 90%. Unmanipulated tax-transformed mouse fibroblasts, or HTLV-I-transformed human lymphocytes, showed at least 5-fold higher ODN binding and uptake over control cells. Balb/3T3 cell binding was induced to similar levels by cellular activators. This suggests that constitutive activation by tax transformation may increase susceptibility of HTLV-I-transformed cells to antisense therapy, providing a rationale for the use of antisense ODN therapeutics in HTLV-I-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1544497657,"The effect of a cAMP-dependent secretogogue (VIP) on the phosphorylation of an endogenous, membrane-bound protein (pp170) was assessed in an intact cell preparation from the avian salt gland. The addition of VIP, in the presence of 100 microM isobutylmethylxanthine, resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation of pp170. This effect was rapid and transient with a 3-5-fold increase in phosphorylation occurring 1 min after the addition of VIP. Under similar incubation conditions, VIP stimulated a 4.6-fold increase in cAMP accumulation that paralleled phosphorylation. Exposure of cells to either forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP resulted in a 5-8-fold increase in the phosphorylation of pp170. The effect of forskolin was dose dependent with an EC50 similar to that for stimulation of secretion (35 nM). These results implicate an involvement for a cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the phosphorylation of pp170. The identity of pp170 was assessed utilizing a monoclonal antibody (Q3) directed against pp170. Q3 recognized a single 170-kDa band on Western blots of salt gland membrane protein. Immunoprecipitation of pp170 from salt gland cells resulted in the selective extraction of a single protein whose phosphorylation state was increased approximately 5-fold in response to carbachol or VIP. The identity of pp170 was established using two criteria. First, Q3 recognized affinity-purified Na:K:Cl cotransporter preparations from shark rectal gland membranes. Second, pp170 was selectively immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies (J3, J4, and J7) that recognize different epitopes of the shark transport protein. These results suggest that pp170 is homologous to the shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter, and thus the proteins may be functionally similar."
https://openalex.org/W1525580335,"Dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), a catalytic and structural component of the three functional classes of multienzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids, forms the central core to which the other components are attached. We have imaged by negative stain and cryoelectron microscopy the truncated dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase core (60 subunits; M(r) = 2.7 x 10(6)) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Using icosahedral particle reconstruction techniques, we determined its structure to 25 A resolution. Although the model derived from the negative stain reconstruction was approximately 20% smaller than the model derived from the frozen-hydrated data, when corrected for the effects of the electron microscope contrast transfer functions, the reconstructions showed excellent correspondence. The pentagonal dodecahedron-shaped macromolecule has a maximum diameter, as measured along the 3-fold axis, of approximately 226 A (frozen-hydrated value), and 12 large openings (approximately 63 A in diameter) on the 5-fold axes that lead into a large solvent-accessible cavity (approximately 76-140 A diameter). The 20 vertices consist of cone-shaped trimers, each with a flattened base on the outside of the structure and an apex directed toward the center. The trimers are interconnected by 20 A thick bridges on the 2-fold axes. These studies also show that the highest resolution features apparent in the frozen-hydrated reconstruction are revealed in a filtered reconstruction of the stained molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1572020100,"Abstract Abnormal proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be central to the formation and deposition of beta amyloid peptide in Alzheimer's disease. A putative activity normally releases an amino-terminal APP fragment by cleaving APP at residues within the beta amyloid peptide thereby precluding amyloidogenesis. In order to better understand the requirements for APP cleavage by secretase, we have expressed a modified cDNA construct representing the 751-amino acid isoform of APP (APP-REP) and mutated APP-REP proteins in cultured cells. Here, we show that: (a) APP-REP is predominantly associated with membranes; (b) intracellular turnover and processing of APP-REP is similar to that reported for the intact APP protein; (c) secretion appears unaltered by introduction of the glutamate to glutamine mutation found in the APP gene of patients suffering from hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Dutch origin; (d) a mutation in which the 18 juxtamembranous amino acids encompassing the secretase site are deleted also allows release of an amino-terminal fragment into the conditioned medium; and (e) kinetics of cleavage of APP-REP and its mutated derivatives are similar. These results indicate that the secretory cleavage of the extracellular amino-terminal fragments of APP-REP can occur in the presence of different novel juxtamembranous amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1603868040,"The levels of light, mid-sized, and heavy neurofilament (NF) mRNAs were compared to that of beta-actin mRNA in primary dissociated cultures of adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Decreases in the levels of all three NF mRNAs occur after 24 h in culture, mimicking the down-regulation of NF mRNAs in axotomized DRG neurons. The loss of NF mRNAs in DRG cultures is prevented by actinomycin and, to a lesser extent, by cycloheximide. Based on decay curves in actinomycin-treated cultures, the half-lives of NF mRNAs are at least 4 days in DRG neurons, but < 24 h in PC12 cells. Our data support the view that NF mRNAs are stabilized in DRG neurons and that stabilization prevents destabilization by a transcription-dependent process. We further propose that putative stabilizing factor(s) are able to prevent degradation of NF transcripts in intact neurons, but not in axotomized or cultured neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1010633374,"We have investigated the action of the chemotherapeutic agent Fe(II)-bleomycin on yeast tRNA(Phe), an RNA of known three-dimensional structure. In the absence of Mg2+ ions, the RNA is cleaved preferentially at two major positions, A31 and G53, both of which are located at the terminal base pairs of hairpin loops, and coincide with the location of tight Mg2+ binding sites. A fragment of the tRNA (residues 47-76) containing the T stem-loop is also cleaved specifically at G53. Cleavage of both the intact tRNA and the tRNA fragment is abolished in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ (> 0.5 mM). Since Fe(II) is not displaced from bleomycin under these conditions, we infer that tight binding of Mg2+ to tRNA excludes productive interactions between Fe(II)-bleomycin and the RNA. These results also show that loss of cleavage is not due to Mg(2+)-dependent formation of tertiary interactions between the D and T loops. In contrast, cleavage of synthetic DNA analogs of the anticodon and T stem-loops is not detectably inhibited by Mg2+, even at concentrations as high as 50 mM. In addition, the site specificities observed in cleavage of RNA and DNA differ significantly. From these results, and from similar findings with other representative RNA molecules, we suggest that the cleavage of RNA by Fe(II)-bleomycin is unlikely to be important for its therapeutic action."
https://openalex.org/W1485594950,"Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells express two distinct nerve growth factor receptors (NGFRs), p75NGFR and trkA (p140trk). In addition to these receptors, by using 125I-mNGF affinity labeling and BS3 chemical cross-linking of PC12 cell protein, we have identified two additional trkA protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 220,000 and 300,000. These bands contain trkA, but were not immunoprecipitated by p75NGFR-specific antisera, suggesting that they do not represent trkA/p75NGFR protein complexes. The 220-kDa trkA band apparently represents trkA with alternate post-translational modification. The appearance of the 300-kDa trkA band was dependent on cross-linker concentration and could be diminished in the presence of reducing agents, suggesting that it represents a trkA dimer. All trkA bands were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when bound to mNGF, suggesting that they participate in NGF-induced signal transduction. NGF binding kinetics to all three trkA bands were indistinguishable, with slow dissociation rates, and a slow association rate that required approximately 1 h to reach equilibrium levels at 4 degrees C. All three trkA bands bound the related neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 with a profile characteristic of trkA."
https://openalex.org/W1556655137,"Both parathyroid hormone secretion and cell growth are negatively regulated by extracellular calcium in parathyroid cells. The mechanism of growth regulation by calcium has been unknown. Previously, we reported that clonal parathyroid cells (PT-r cells) bear two high affinity receptors for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and that at least a subpopulation of the receptors with a higher molecular mass carries heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains which give the receptor higher affinity (Sakaguchi, K., Yanagishita, M., Takeuchi, Y., and Aurbach, G. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7270-7278). Here, I have found that the parathyroid cells expressed aFGF and that aFGF receptors with lower affinity apparently translocated in response to changing extracellular calcium concentrations. Expression of both aFGF mRNA and peptide was suppressed by calcium. Cells had more ligand-accessible receptors on the cell surface at lower calcium concentrations. This apparent translocation was temperature-dependent but independent of de novo protein synthesis. Heparin or HS glycosaminoglycans are a prerequisite for the FGF receptor encoded by flg gene to bind basic FGF (Yayon, A., Klagsbrun, M., Esko, J. D., Leder, P., and Ornitz, D. M. (1991) Cell 64, 841-848). In PT-r cells, major cellular HS proteoglycans redistribute between intracellular and extracellular compartments with more HS proteoglycans expressed on the cell surface at lower calcium concentrations (Takeuchi, Y., Sakaguchi, K., Yanagishita, M., Aurbach, G. D., and Hascall, V. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13661-13668). However, this redistribution of HS proteoglycans cannot explain the difference in bindability of radiolabeled aFGF to its receptors in different calcium concentrations, since addition of heparin did not change the binding of radiolabeled aFGF to the receptors either at high or low calcium conditions. In concordance with the apparent translocation of aFGF receptors, thymidine incorporation was stimulated by decreasing extracellular calcium concentrations with further stimulation by added aFGF. Anti-aFGF antibody inhibited thymidine incorporation by more than 32% in the cells exposed to 0.05 mM Ca2+ shortly before adding [3H]thymidine, whereas the incorporation was not significantly affected by the antibody at 0.7 mM Ca2+. Cell growth was also stimulated by low calcium. Anti-aFGF antibody inhibited cell growth significantly only at low calcium concentrations. From these observations, an aFGF autocrine system including the apparent translocation of aFGF receptors may explain, if not entirely, the mechanism by which calcium regulates parathyroid cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2054003244,"The N-myc and the L-myc proto-oncogenes are expressed during embryonal development mainly in the developing brain. Studies of their expression in single neuroepithelial cells revealed that neural precursors not yet committed to the glial or the neuronal lineage expressed both genes, but after lineage commitment they expressed either N-myc or L-myc. Moreover, enforced expression of L-myc in the neural precursor cell line 2.3D caused neuronal differentiation, while the expression of N-myc promoted glial differentiation. These results indicate that L-myc and N-myc play critical roles in lineage determination for the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1524710534,"The leukocyte integrin alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29) is a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and the endothelial adhesion protein VCAM-1. We have analyzed the biosynthesis and post-translational modifications of the two subunits of this receptor complex. The alpha 4 subunit was initially synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide that underwent the formation of complex endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharide side chains and which could be proteolytically cleaved into two noncovalently associated fragments. The level and rate of alpha 4 subunit cleavage was dependent on the cell studied. The T cell tumor line HPB-ALL expressed both intact and fragmented alpha 4 on the cell surface. The interleukin-2-dependent natural killer line NK 3.3 and long term interleukin-2-dependent activated T lymphocytes cleaved the alpha 4 polypeptide earlier and more efficiently than did HPB-ALL cells and did not have detectable levels of intact alpha 4 on the cell surface. The proteolysis of alpha 4 was blocked by treating cells with either the lysosomotrophic amine NH4Cl or the carboxylic ionophore monensin. The presence of complex N-linked oligosaccharides did not seem to be necessary for alpha 4 cleavage or for binding of the alpha 4 beta 1 complex to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the binding site for this receptor on fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1623604188,"We have found that over one-half of the total cell surface 125I-insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) binding to BHK cells represents binding to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) rather than to the IGF-I receptor. In addition to a number of secreted IGFBPs, we have now characterized two cell-associated IGFBPs with unique characteristics. The cell-associated IGFBPs have molecular weights of 30,000 (30K) and 25,000 (25K), as determined by the Western ligand blot technique. IGFBP-30K is located at the cell surface and can be readily labeled by affinity cross-linking with 125I-IGF-I. Surface expression of IGFBP-30K increases 5.4 +/- 1.2-fold (n = 11) with serum starvation. This induction is fully evident by 4 h, plateauing by 24 h, and is completely inhibitable by cycloheximide. The fasting-induced increase in IGFBP-30K is inhibited by IGF-I and by des-IGF-I and, to a lesser extent, by insulin. Unlike cell-associated IGFBP-30K, secretion of IGFBP was stimulated (6.8 +/- 0.5-fold, n = 2) by IGF-I, whereas IGFBP secretion was inhibited 54% by insulin. These results demonstrate coordinate regulation of IGFBP by serum starvation and IGF-I, such that at low concentrations of IGF-I, cell surface binding protein increases whereas binding protein secretion decreases. At high concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP secretion increases and cell surface IGF-I receptor, as well as IGFBP, decreases. Taken together, these regulatory events regulate the availability of IGF-I for biologic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1491134922,"We have investigated several purification strategies for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) based on its structural similarity to other proteins of the traffic ATPase/ABC transporter family. Recombinant CFTR expressed in heterologous cells was readily solubilized by digitonin and initially separated from the majority of other cellular proteins by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. CFTR, with two predicted nucleotide binding domains, bound avidly to several triazine dye columns, although elution with MgATP, MgCl2, or high ionic strength buffers was inefficient. CFTR did not bind to either ATP or ADP coupled to agarose. Because CFTR is a glycoprotein we investigated its binding to lectin columns. CFTR bound readily to wheat germ agglutinin, but poorly to Lens culinaris agglutinin. CFTR was enriched 9-10 times when eluted from wheat germ agglutinin with N-acetylglucosamine. This enrichment was tripled if lectin chromatography followed sucrose gradient centrifugation. Our results suggest the combination of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and lectin chromatography would be a satisfactory approach to initial purification of CFTR expressed in heterologous cells."

https://openalex.org/W2137039391,"Resistance to toxic oxyanions of arsenic and antimony in Escherichia coli is conferred by the conjugative R-factor R773, which encodes an ATP-driven anion extrusion pump. The ars operon is composed of three structural genes, arsA, arsB, and arsC. Although transcribed as a single unit, the three genes are differentially expressed as a result of translational differences, such that the ArsA and ArsC proteins are produced in high amounts relative to the amount of ArsB protein made. Consequently, biochemical characterization of the ArsB protein, which is an integral membrane protein containing the anion-conducting pathway, has been limited, precluding studies of the mechanism of this oxyanion pump. To overexpress the arsB gene, a series of changes were made. First, the second codon, an infrequently used leucine codon, was changed to a more frequently utilized codon. Second, a GC-rich stem-loop (delta G = -17 kcal/mol) between the third and twelfth codons was destabilized by changing several of the bases of the base-paired region. Third, the re-engineered arsB gene was fused 3' in frame to the first 1458 base pairs of the arsA gene to encode a 914-residue chimeric protein (486 residues of the ArsA protein plus 428 residues of the mutated ArsB protein) containing the entire re-engineered ArsB sequence except for the initiating methionine. The ArsA-ArsB chimera has been overexpressed at approximately 15-20% of the total membrane proteins. Cells producing the chimeric ArsA-ArsB protein with an arsA gene in trans excluded 73AsO2- from cells, demonstrating that the chimera can function as a component of the oxyanion-translocating ATPase."
