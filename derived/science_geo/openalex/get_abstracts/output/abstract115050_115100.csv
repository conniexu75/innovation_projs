https://openalex.org/W2083331853,"Viruses that are non- or poorly cytopathic have developed various strategies to avoid elimination by the immune system and to persist in the host. Acute infection of adult mice with the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) normally induces a protective cytotoxic T-cell response that also causes immunopathology. But some LCMV strains (such as DOCILE (LCMV-D) or Cl-13 Armstrong (Cl-13)) derived from virus carrier mice tend to persist after acute infection of adult mice without causing lethal immunopathological disease. Tendency to persist correlates with tropism, rapidity of virus spread and virus mutations. We report here that these LCMV isolates may persist because they induce most of the specific antiviral CD8+ cytotoxic T cells so completely that they all disappear within a few days and therefore neither eliminate the virus nor cause lethal immunopathology. The results illustrate that partially and sequentially induced (protective) immunity or complete exhaustion of T-cell immunity (high zone tolerance) are quantitatively different points on the scale of immunity; some viruses exploit the latter possibility to persist in an immunocompetent host."

https://openalex.org/W2120434953,"The human BTF2 basic transcription factor (also called TFIIH), which is similar to the delta factor in rat and factor b in yeast, is required for class II gene transcription. A strand displacement assay was used to show that highly purified preparation of BTF2 had an adenosine triphosphate-dependent DNA helicase activity, in addition to the previously characterized carboxyl-terminal domain kinase activity. Amino acid sequence analysis of the tryptic digest generated from the 89-kilodalton subunit of BTF2 indicated that this polypeptide corresponded to the ERCC-3 gene product, a presumed helicase implicated in the human DNA excision repair disorders xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome. These findings suggest that transcription and nucleotide excision repair may share common factors and hence may be considered to be functionally related."

https://openalex.org/W2034733986,"A phylogenetic framework inferred from comparisons of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences describes the evolutionary origin and early branching patterns of the kingdom Animalia. Maximum likelihood analyses show the animal lineage is monophyletic and includes choanoflagellates. Within the metazoan assemblage, the divergence of sponges is followed by the Ctenophora, the Cnidaria plus the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens, and finally by an unresolved polychotomy of bilateral animal phyla. From these data, it was inferred that animals and fungi share a unique evolutionary history and that their last common ancestor was a flagellated protist similar to extant choanoflagellates."
https://openalex.org/W2027737365,"Point mutations that activate the Ki-ras proto-oncogene are presented in about 50 percent of human colorectal tumors. To study the functional significance of these mutations, the activated Ki-ras genes in two human colon carcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT 116, were disrupted by homologous recombination. Compared with parental cells, cells disrupted at the activated Ki-ras gene were morphologically altered, lost the capacity for anchorage-independent growth, grew more slowly both in vitro and in nude mice, and showed reduced expression of c-myc. Thus, the activated Ki-ras gene plays a key role in colorectal tumorigenesis through altered cell differentiation and cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2038794308,"Cells maintain the integrity of their genome through an intricate network of repair systems that recognize and remove lesions from DNA. The only known site-directed recombination process in vertebrates is the V(D)J recombination of lymphocyte antigen receptor genes. A large panel of cell lines deficient in DNA repair were tested for the ability to perform V(D)J recombination after introduction of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Two mutants failed to generate normal V(D)J recombination, and further analysis provided evidence for two distinct nonlymphoid-specific genes that encode factors involved in both DNA repair and V(D)J recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2101898282,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan pathogen that produces severe disease in humans and animals. This obligate intracellular parasite provides an excellent model for the study of how such pathogens are able to invade, survive, and replicate intracellularly. DNA encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was introduced into T. gondii and transiently expressed with the use of three vectors based on different Toxoplasma genes. The ability to introduce genes and have them efficiently and faithfully expressed is an essential tool for understanding the structure-function relation of genes and their products."
https://openalex.org/W2054807558,"A major challenge of current neuroscience is to elucidate the brain mechanisms that underlie cognitive function. There is no doubt that cognitive processing in the brain engages large populations of cells. This article explores the logic of investigating these problems by combining psychological studies in human subjects and neurophysiological studies of neuronal populations in the motor cortex of behaving monkeys. The results obtained show that time-varying psychological processes can be visualized in the time-varying activity of neuronal populations. Moreover, the functional interactions between cells in the motor cortex are very similar to those observed in a massively interconnected artificial network performing the same computation."

The sequence of the myotonin-protein kinase gene was determined, and messenger RNA spliced forms were identified in various tissues. Antisera were developed for analytical studies. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay were used to demonstrate that decreased levels of the messenger RNA and protein expression are associated with the adult form of myotonic dystrophy."

https://openalex.org/W1491103665,"Cytochrome P-450dNIR (P-450dNIR), involved in the fungal denitrification by Fusarium oxysporum, was purified to homogeneity. The cytochrome P-450 (P-450) exhibited a potent nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity to form nitrous oxide (N2O) employing NADH but not NADPH as the sole effective electron donor. The apparent maximum turnover rate against NO was estimated as high as 31,500 min-1. The stoichiometry of the reaction between NO:NADH:N2O was 2:1:1. The reaction required neither an artificial electron-carrying mediator nor other proteinaceous components. An anaerobic incubation of ferric P-450dNIR.NO complex, but not of free ferric P-450dNIR, resulted in rapid reduction of the P-450, indicating that P-450dNIR.NO complex was reduced directly by NADH. Spectral changes during catalytic turnover indicated that decomposition of the ferrous P-450.NO complex might be rate-limiting. The reaction was not inhibited by carbon monoxide at all, suggesting that the free ferrous P-450 is not formed during turnover. On the basis of these results a possible reaction mechanism was considered. The present results demonstrated not only the unique reaction catalyzed by P-450, but also the first P-450-dependent reaction where the electron transport from NAD(P)H to P-450 is not supported by other components. Now that the physiological function of P-450 55A1 (P-450dNIR) has been found, we propose to alter the trivial name to P-450nor."
https://openalex.org/W2028594199,"Mackerels, tunas, and billfishes (suborder Scombroidei and Teleostei) provide an ideal taxonomic context in which to examine the evolution of endothermy. Multiple origins and diverse strategies for endothermy exist among these fish. Here a molecular phylogeny of the Scombroidei has been determined by direct sequencing of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The distribution of endothermic species within this proposed genealogy indicates that the ability to warm the brain and retina arose independently in three lineages, each time in association with a movement into colder water. This suggests that the evolution of cranial endothermy in fish was selected in order to permit thermal niche expansion and not selected for increased aerobic capacity."

https://openalex.org/W2063685939,"Electrostatic interactions in proteins are potentially quite strong, but these interactions are mitigated by the screening effects of water, ions, and nearby protein atoms. The early work of Kirkwood and Westheimer on small organic molecules showed that the extent of the screening may depend on whether charged or dipolar groups are involved. The dielectric and ionic screening of the interactions between the dipolar backbone amide groups of monomeric alpha helices and either (i) solvent-exposed charges or (ii) solvent-exposed dipoles at the amino terminus was measured. The dielectric screening effects are an order of magnitude greater for the backbone-charge interactions than for the backbone-dipole interactions, and the ionic strength dependence is substantially different in the two cases. These results suggest that interactions that involve the dipolar groups of proteins may be relatively more important for stability and function than is generally thought."

https://openalex.org/W2083226493,"Gas-to-drop partitioning of hydrogen peroxide and its precursor, the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2.), has been considered the predominant or sole source of hydrogen peroxide in atmospheric water drops. However, atmospheric water can absorb solar ultraviolet radiation, which initiates the photoformation of peroxides (primarily hydrogen peroxide). Measurements of peroxide photoformation rates in authentic atmospheric water samples demonstrate that aqueous-phase photochemical reactions are a significant, and in some cases dominant, source of hydrogen peroxide to cloud and fog drops. This additional source could significantly change the current understanding, and hence, the models, of sulfuric acid deposition because hydrogen peroxide is the limiting reagent in the dominant pathway for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid in the troposphere over eastern North America."
https://openalex.org/W1599419998,"Abstract The mechanism of activation of human plasminogen by recombinant staphylokinase (STAR) was studied using the active site titrant p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB). NPGB prevented active site exposure in equimolar mixtures of plasminogen and STAR but reacted stoichiometrically with mixtures preincubated in the absence of titrant. Active site generation occurred progressively, with a marked initial lag phase followed by an exponential growth phase, and was associated with the conversion of single-chain plasminogen to two-chain plasmin. Incubation of mixtures of plasminogen and STAR with catalytic amounts (< 0.2% molar ratio) of preformed plasmin.STAR complex or of urokinase shortened the lag hase, whereas catalytic amounts (5% molar ratio) of the plasmin inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin delayed active site generation. The following kinetic model for the activation of plasminogen (P) by STAR (S) fits the experimental data, [formula: see text] and is described by [formula: see text] or [formula: see text] In this model, plasminogen and STAR produce an inactive complex (P.S), in which active plasmin.STAR (p.S) is generated in a rate limiting step, which is accelerated by plasminogen activators and delayed by plasmin inhibitors. At room temperature in a 0.1 M Veronal buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.1 M arginine, the data are adequately fitted by the integrated equation with k1 = 4.0 x 10(-7) s-1 and k2 = 1.3 x 10(-2) microM-1 s-1. The k1 value could be explained by contamination of the plasminogen preparation with 3 ppm plasmin, converted by S to p.S. It is concluded that STAR activates plasminogen via a mechanism which differs in several essential aspects from that of streptokinase."

https://openalex.org/W1516705869,"A recombinant mouse cDNA fragment encoding the G domain of the basement membrane laminin A chain was inserted into the eukaryotic baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 modified to produce fusion proteins carrying the rat fibronectin signal. G domain, expressed and secreted as a soluble glycoprotein (rG), was purified to near homogeneity without denaturing conditions. By electron microscopy rG possessed the same globular morphology as found in laminin. rG was cleaved with elastase into two fragments, rG70 and rG50. The latter fragment possessed the identical N terminus as laminin fragment E3 and both shared the same secondary structure by circular dichroism. rG, and rG containing a deletion (residues 2980-3028) rich in basic residues bound to heparin with similar avidity. rG also promoted mouse C2 myoblast cell adhesion and spreading, and evaluation of myoblasts on rG70 and rG50 further revealed that cell spreading was an activity confined to the more proximal sequence of rG70. Antibody specific for rG70 completely blocked cell adhesion to intact laminin in contrast to antibody specific for E3. Finally rG did not inhibit laminin polymerization. These data support the role of G domain in cell and heparin binding, but not laminin self-assembly, and the approach provides a means to further characterize these functions."

https://openalex.org/W1496944285,"The mammalian small intestine contains two related cellular retinol-binding proteins, CRBP and CRBP II, which are thought to have distinct functions. The human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, was used as a model system for testing the hypothesis that intracellular levels of these proteins directly modulate the absorption and subsequent metabolism of retinol in enterocytes. Immunoblot and Northern blot hybridization demonstrated that Caco-2 cells express CRBP II and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I in increasing amounts as the cells become more differentiated but do not express detectable quantities of CRBP. Stably transfected cloned Caco-2 cell lines that over-express CRBP II or coexpress CRBP and CRBP II and a control cell line that contains the expression vector without an insert were established. Retinol uptake and retinyl ester synthesis were increased up to 2-fold by coexpression of CRBP or over-expression of CRBP II. No significant differences were detected in the pattern of retinyl esters synthesized from exogenous [3H]retinol. This suggests that the fatty acid pools utilized for retinol esterification were the same despite differences in the CRBP and CRBP II phenotype of the cell lines. There were no differences between apical and basolateral [3H]retinol uptake or metabolism for filter grown transfected or wild type cell monolayers. Thus, neither CRBP II nor CRBP appear to preferentially interact with luminal- or plasma-derived retinol. Notably, in a cell line which over-expressed CRBP, endogenous CRBP II was reduced by 5-10-fold compared with the wild type and control cell lines. These studies indicate that CRBP and CRBP II levels are determinants of intracellular retinol accumulation and esterification, and they suggest that CRBP-bound retinol or a metabolite can regulate the expression of CRBP II in the mammalian intestine."

https://openalex.org/W1492382046,"Platelets are cytoplasmic fragments of megakaryocytes and, therefore, their membrane proteins cannot be manipulated by expression methods in culture. To overcome this limitation, we have expressed human glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha in transgenic mouse megakaryocytes and found that it was present on the surface of platelets associated with the mouse GP Ib beta subunit. This finding demonstrates that assembly of the heterooligomeric GP Ib complex occurs through mechanisms conserved across species. In contrast, the receptor function of GP Ib exhibited restricted species specificity, since only the chimeric complex containing human GP Ib alpha bound human von Willebrand factor and supported platelet aggregation mediated by ristocetin. These studies demonstrate the transgenic engineering of a platelet adhesion receptor under control of the human GP Ib alpha promoter and illustrate a new approach to manipulate platelet receptors and study structure-function relationships in hemostasis and thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1557189154,"Transcripts of the rat calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) gene are alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner resulting in the production of calcitonin mRNA and peptide in thyroid C cells and CGRP mRNA and peptide in neurons. Transfection studies using calcitonin and chimaeric human beta-globin/calcitonin exon minigene constructs showed that the splice acceptor and exon specific to calcitonin mRNA are spliced much less efficiently in CGRP-producing cells (F9 teratocarcinomas) than in cells that preferentially make calcitonin (HeLa cells). In vitro splicing of chimaeric human beta-globin/calcitonin transcripts in HeLa nuclear extracts were inhibited by the addition of nuclear extract from CGRP-favoring cells or tissues such as rat brain. This inhibition was specific as splicing of human beta-globin first intron transcripts was not affected by comparable amounts of rat brain extract. Fractionation of rat brain nuclear extracts allowed the partial purification of two brain-specific polypeptides of apparent molecular mass of 43 and 41 kDa which preferentially bind RNA containing the calcitonin-specific splice acceptor. Since these polypeptides cofractionate with the calcitonin mRNA-specific splicing inhibition activity, we suggest that they may mediate the inhibition of splicing observed in vitro and underlie, in part, the inefficient calcitonin mRNA production observed in CGRP-favoring cells in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1505455234,"We have isolated genomic clones containing the complete exon 1 and the promoter-regulatory region of the E1 alpha gene (BCKDHA) of human branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The cloning was achieved by amplification of a genomic library in the SRB (P2) host strain that allowed the replication of nonstandard DNA structures. The results of this and previous (Dariush, N., Fisher, C. W., Cox, R. P., and Chuang, D. T. (1991) FEBS Lett. 284, 34-38) studies showed that the human E1 alpha gene contains 9 exons, and spans at least 55 kilobases (kb). Exon 1 is 135 bp in length, and contains multiple transcription initiation sites at bases +1, +18, and +22. The complete human E1 alpha cDNA is, therefore, 1,758 bp in length excluding the poly(A)+ tail, and has 27 nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region. Sequencing of the 5'-flanking region disclosed the absence of a canonical TATA-box in the vicinity of base -30. Several sets of CAAT box-like sequences and Sp1 binding-sites are present. Also present are copies of potential AP-2 binding, fat-specific element 1, fat-specific element 2, glucocorticoid-responsive element, and cAMP-responsive element sequences, as well as multiple sets of direct and inverted repeats. The promoter-regulatory region was characterized using deletion constructs and the luciferase reporter assay. The human hepatoma cells (Hep-G2) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were used as hosts. The results obtained with Hep-G2 cells indicate that the region for high level transcription is located between bases -320 and -115. Extension of the 5'-end of the insert to beyond base -320 markedly reduces promoter activity. The results strongly suggest the presence of inhibitory elements in the region upstream of base -320. Assays in CHO cells show that the region for high level transcription lies between bases -909 and -115. The variation in the region for high level transcription in Hep-G2 and CHO cells may represent cell-type specific differences in the E1 alpha gene promoter function."
