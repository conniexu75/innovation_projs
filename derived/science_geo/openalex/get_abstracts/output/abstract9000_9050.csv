https://openalex.org/W2073620575,"Glucose reacts nonenzymatically with the NH2-terminal amino acid of the beta chain of human hemoglobin by way of a ketoamine linkage, resulting in the formation of hemoglobin AIc. Other minor components appear to be adducts of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-diphosphate. These hemoglobins are formed slowly and continuously throughout the 120-day life-span of the red cell. There is a two- to threefold increase in hemoglobin AIc in the red cells of patients with diabetes mellitus. By providing an integrated measurement of blood glucose, hemoglobin AIc is useful in assessing the degree of diabetic control. Furthermore, this hemoglobin is a useful model of nonenzymatic glycosylation of other proteins that may be involved in the long-term complications of the disease."

By school age the gap in cognitive ability between the treated children and a group of privileged children in the same city had narrowed, the effect being greater the younger the children were when they entered the treatment program. The gains were still evident at the end of the first grade in primary school, a year after the experiment had ended."

https://openalex.org/W1995577111,"Comparative analyses of behavior have an underappreciated potential for revealing the role of ethoecological factors in the origins of higher taxa. Twenty-seven species (13 genera) in the advanced family Colubridae exhibited 19 patterns of coil application; one or two patterns were usually consistent within a genus. Forty-eight species (26 genera) in the primitive families Acrochordidae, Aniliidae, Boidae, and Xenopeltidae usually used a single pattern, despite differences in age, size, shape, habitat, and diet. This implies the shared retention of an action pattern used by their common ancestor no later than the early Paleocene. Constriction must have been used as a prey-killing tactic very early in the history of snakes and might have been a behavioral ""key innovation"" in the evolution of their unusual jaw mechanism."

When conflicting binocular and surface-texture information was minimized, 26- to 30-week-old infants directed their reaching to the apparently closer side of a photograph of a window rotated in depth. Younger infants, from 20 to 22 weeks of age, did not direct their reaching to the pictorially nearer side of the display but did reach with a high degree of directionality when presented with a real window rotated in depth."

https://openalex.org/W1486724935,"The binding of concanavalin A to various structures via hydrophobic interactions has been studied using a variety of physicochemical assays. It was found that concanavalin A binds to nonpolar compounds such as the plant auxin beta-indoleacetic acid and its structural analogue tryptophan and that this binding is independent of the saccharide-binding activity normally associated with the lectin. The results of equilibrium dialysis experiments on the binding of beta-indoleacetic acid were consistent with the presence of a single weak binding site per subunit of protein, having an association constant of about 7 X 10(2) M-1. Competition experiments using various nonpolar compounds such as o-iodobenzoic acid suggested that this hydrophobic binding site is located in the same cavity which binds the iodine-containing ligand as shown by x-ray crystallography. Concanavalin A also binds to lipid vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-O-acetate. This binding to lipid membranes raises the possibility that the synergistic effects of concanavalin A and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate on lymphocyte mitogenesis may be due in part to an interaction between lectin and the phorbol ester."

https://openalex.org/W1971970564,"Orientation toward the sun combined with postural changes minimized the net radiation gain on the adult herring gull during the breeding season. The decrease in absorbed solar radiation was due to reduced surface area exposed to direct sunlight and to reduced absorptivity since, when the bird orients toward the sun, the angle of incidence is such that only the white surfaces receive direct sunlight. At low wind velocities (0 to 0.6 meter per second) and ambient temperatures above the lower critical temperature, the birds rotated 180 degrees during the day, always facing the sun."
https://openalex.org/W1542098362,"The effects of a wide variety of chemical modification reagents on the activity of purified rat liver microsomal epoxide hydrase have been investigated. Alkylating agents, such as the phenacyl bromides and benzyl bromide are potent inhibitors of epoxide hydrase. 2-Bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone (p-nitrophenacyl bromide) specifically and irreversibly inactivates epoxide hydrase. Pseudo-first order kinetics of inhibition is observed at higher inhibitor/enzyme ratios. The rate of inactivation is controlled by a group on the enzyme with an apparent pKa of 7.6. Inactivation of the enzyme with 14C-labeled 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone leads to the incorporation of approximately 1 mol of radioactive inhibitor/mol of protein. Epoxide hydrase can be protected against this inactivation by the substrate phenanthrene-9,10-oxide. These results are consistent with the interpretation that 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone acts as an active site-directed inhibitor. The site of alkylation by 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone is a histidine residue of epoxide hydrase. The N-alkylated histidine derivative has been identified as 1-(p-nitrophenacyl)-4-histidine. A possible mechanism for the enzymatic hydration catalyzed by epoxide hydrase is discussed which involves a histidine residue of the enzyme serving as a general base catalyst for the nucleophilic addition of water."

Drug alone or heat alone killed a minimum number of cells under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. Exposure to drug and hyperthermia selectively increased the number of cells killed under hypoxic conditions at temperatures as low as 40.5 degrees C but had little effect on cells incubated under aerobic conditions. These results suggest that the glycolytic pathways is a primary site of hyperthermic damage leading to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2055851126,"In the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus) the frequency and amplitude of an acoustic signal are represented in the coordinates parallel to the surface of the Doppler-shifted-CF (constant frequency) processing area of the primary auditory cortex. In this area all cortical neurons studied were excited by contralateral stimuli, and almost all of them were either excited or inhibited by ipsilateral stimuli. These are called E-E (ipsilateral and contralateral excitatory) and I-E (ipsilateral inhibitory and contralateral excitatory) neurons, respectively. The I-E neurons are directionally sensitive, while the E-E neurons are not. The E-E neurons are equally sensitive to echoes between 30° contralateral and 30° ipsilateral. Of the electrode penetrations orthogonal to the Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, 57 percent were characterized by either E-E or I-E neurons. Thus, there are at least two types of binaural columns: E-E columns, mainly located in a ventral part of the Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, where neurons are tuned to weak echoes; and IE columns, mainly distributed in a dorsal part, where neurons are tuned to moderate to intense echoes. Therefore, neurons tuned to weaker echoes integrate or even multiply faint signals from both ears for effective detection of a distant small target, while neurons tuned to moderate to intense echoes are suited for processing directional information and are stimulated when a bat approaches a target at short range. The Doppler-shifted-CF processing area may be considered to consist of two functional subdivisions."

Alfatoxicol, however, was not detected in the plasma of similarly dosed mice and monkeys, which are both resistant to aflatoxin B1-induced cardinogenesis. The formation of aflatoxicol both in vitro and in vivo may be an indicatory of species sensitivity to aflatoxin-induced carcinogenesis and may be useful in the prediction of human susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1597640169,"Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of several metalloporphyrin complexes of rabbit and human serum hemopexins in the spectral region of 300 to 650 nm and natural circular dichroism (CD) in the 300 to 450 nm region are reported. The MCD spectra of the heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) complexes of both proteins were essentially identical suggesting similar iron coordination. The Soret region MCD spectrum of ferriheme . hemopexin has a shape and amplitude typical of other completely low spin (S = /sup 1///sub 2/) ferric hemeproteins, and the temperature dependence of the MCD intensity indicates that it is composed predominantly of Faraday C-type, terms. The visible region MCD spectrum of this complex closely resembles those characteristic of cytochrome b/sub 5/ and other bisimidazole-coordinated heme derivatives. Under aerobic conditions, heme . hemopexin is in the fully oxidized state. The ferroheme . hemopexins also exhibit MCD spectra similar to that of ferrocytochrome b/sub 5/, consistent with a low spin state and histidyl side-chain coordination of the heme iorn in the reduced as well as in the oxidized state. The deuteroheme derivatives of rabbit hemopexin exhibit MCD spectra similar to those of the heme complex except for the expected slight differences in wavelength extrema, indicatingmore » that the vinyl side chains of protoporphyrin have little influence on the coordination. In contrast, the natural CD spectra of the heme complexes of rabbit and human hemopexin do not resemble the CD of cytochrome b/sub 5/, reflecting differences in the crevice regions of the different hemeproteins. Furthermore, the CD spectra of the ferroheme complexes of rabbit and human hemopexin point to differences in the local environments of the heme chromophores.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2104539279,"The time course of oxygen-18 exchange between [18O]Pi and normal water, catalyzed by myosin subfragment 1 in the presence of MgADP, was followed using the shift in 31P NMR caused by the presence of oxygen-18 bound to the phosphorus. Essentially all molecules of [18O]Pi that bind to the enzyme undergo complete exchange and are released as [16O4]Pi. Exchange probably occurs by formation of myosin.ATP from a myosin.ADP.Pi complex and is rapid relative to release of Pi from this complex. The kinetics of exchange give a value for the rate constant for binding Pi to myosin.ADP of 0.23 M-1 S-1 (pH 8.0, 22 degrees C). This value is consistent with exchange occurring by reversal of the ATP-ase reaction back to the myosin.ATP complex."

https://openalex.org/W1994899735,"THE effects of the fungal metabolite, cytochalasin B, on lymphocyte transformation induced by mitogenic plant Jectins have been much studied1–7. Results have generally been interpreted in terms of the known effects of cytochalasin B on the microfilaments of the cellular cytoskeleton. A potential site of action which has been largely ignored lies in the inhibitory effects of cytochalasin B on metabolite transport. Cytochalasin B is a potent, competitive inhibitor of erythrocyte glucose transport8, and we have shown that it also inhibits thymocyte glucose transport, and that concanavalin A-stimulated glucose transport is more sensitive to this inhibition9. Glucose transport has been shown to be rate-limiting for thymocyte glycolysis10. Also, glucose has been found to be essential for mitogen-stimulated DNA synthesis in lymphocytes11, and we show here that cytochalasin B can exert its inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis by inhibiting glucose transport."

https://openalex.org/W1483906698,This paper demonstrates that N6-methyladenosine (6-methylaminopurine ribonucleoside) will condense in vitro with homocysteine to form S-N6-methyladenosylhomocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by mouse liver S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Injection of mice with N6-methyladenosine is followed by accumulation of S-N6-methyladenosylhomocysteine in the liver. Studies from other laboratories have shown that S-N6-methyladenosylhomocysteine is nearly as potent an RNA methyltransferase inhibitor as S-adenosylhomocysteine. This indicates that administration of N6-methyladenosine may be a general method for blocking in vivo RNA methylation in studies to determine the role of methylation in RNA processing and translational function.

We found that propionyl-CoA could not be used because both transcarboxylase and the 12 S,, subunit catalyze the deacylation of propionyl-CoA (Equation 4). The rate of hydrolysis was 18 to 30 nmol/min/mg at room temperature and 0.4 to 1 nmol/min/mg at 0 to 5”. This rate is approximately 1000 times slower than the rate of the transcar- boxylation but too fast, even at cold temperatures, for the binding experiments. Likewise, methylmalonyl-Cob could not be used with trans- carboxylase because the biotin of the enzyme is carboxylated by the methylmalonyl-CoA and there is spontaneous decar- boxylation of the enzyme. biotin .

https://openalex.org/W1575544772,"The two green hemoproteins isolated from bovine erythrocytes (form I and form II) have been characterized as to spectral, electrochemical, and chemical properties. The absorption spectra of the isolated hemoproteins are typical of high spin ferric states. Reduction of the hemoproteins yields high spin ferrohemoproteins. Complexation of the ferrohemoproteins with CO and the ferrihemoproteins with cyanide yields low spin complexes, demonstrating the presence of an exchangeable weak field ligand in both the ferrous and ferric states of the hemoproteins. The differences in position and intensity of the absorption peaks of the visible spectra allow the two forms to be distinguished from one another. The midpoint potential of forms I and II were found to be +0.075 and +0.019 V, respectively, at pH 6.4 and +0.038 and -0.005 V, respectively, at pH 7.0. This is consistent with the gaining of 1 proton/electron during the reduction. The Nernst plot reveals an unusual 0.5-electron transfer, whereas a quantitative titration demonstrates a 1-electron transfer. Form I binds cyanide more tightly than form II (KD of 84 and 252 micrometer, respectively). The observed spectral, electrochemical, and ligand-binding differences between forms I and II can be explained in terms of a greater electron-withdrawing ability of the side chains of the heme of form I relative to the heme of form II."
