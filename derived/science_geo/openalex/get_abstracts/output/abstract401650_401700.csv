https://openalex.org/W2106572080,"Tenascin C is an extracellular matrix protein previously linked to breast cancer metastasis. Here the authors uncover how tenascin C promotes the fitness of metastasis-initiating cells by sustaining the stem and survival signaling pathways NOTCH and Wnt through specific regulation of Msi1 and Lgr5, respectively. We report that breast cancer cells that infiltrate the lungs support their own metastasis-initiating ability by expressing tenascin C (TNC). We find that the expression of TNC, an extracellular matrix protein of stem cell niches, is associated with the aggressiveness of pulmonary metastasis. Cancer cell–derived TNC promotes the survival and outgrowth of pulmonary micrometastases. TNC enhances the expression of stem cell signaling components, musashi homolog 1 (MSI1) and leucine-rich repeat–containing G protein–coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). MSI1 is a positive regulator of NOTCH signaling, whereas LGR5 is a target gene of the WNT pathway. TNC modulation of stem cell signaling occurs without affecting the expression of transcriptional enforcers of the stem cell phenotype and pluripotency, namely nanog homeobox (NANOG), POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1), also known as OCT4, and SRY-box 2 (SOX2). TNC protects MSI1-dependent NOTCH signaling from inhibition by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and selectively enhances the expression of LGR5 as a WNT target gene. Cancer cell–derived TNC remains essential for metastasis outgrowth until the tumor stroma takes over as a source of TNC. These findings link TNC to pathways that support the fitness of metastasis-initiating breast cancer cells and highlight the relevance of TNC as an extracellular matrix component of the metastatic niche."
https://openalex.org/W2038866304,"Direct editing of disease-causing mutations has obvious attractions for the treatment of genetic disorders if the many practical obstacles to the technique can be overcome. One promising line of research centres on the development of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) produced by fusing an engineered zinc finger DNA-binding domain to an endonuclease. These artificial enzymes induce efficient gene correction in cultured cells. Li et al. now report that zinc finger nucleases induce double-strand breaks in specifically selected locations on the genome and stimulate genome editing at a clinically meaningful level in vivo. In a proof-of-principle experiment, ZFNs delivered to the liver in a mouse model of haemophilia B achieved a level of gene replacement that was sufficient to correct the clotting defect, and the effect persisted following liver regeneration. Editing of the human genome to correct disease-causing mutations is a promising approach for the treatment of genetic disorders. Genome editing improves on simple gene-replacement strategies by effecting in situ correction of a mutant gene, thus restoring normal gene function under the control of endogenous regulatory elements and reducing risks associated with random insertion into the genome. Gene-specific targeting has historically been limited to mouse embryonic stem cells. The development of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) has permitted efficient genome editing in transformed and primary cells that were previously thought to be intractable to such genetic manipulation1. In vitro, ZFNs have been shown to promote efficient genome editing via homology-directed repair by inducing a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) at a target locus2,3,4, but it is unclear whether ZFNs can induce DSBs and stimulate genome editing at a clinically meaningful level in vivo. Here we show that ZFNs are able to induce DSBs efficiently when delivered directly to mouse liver and that, when co-delivered with an appropriately designed gene-targeting vector, they can stimulate gene replacement through both homology-directed and homology-independent targeted gene insertion at the ZFN-specified locus. The level of gene targeting achieved was sufficient to correct the prolonged clotting times in a mouse model of haemophilia B, and remained persistent after induced liver regeneration. Thus, ZFN-driven gene correction can be achieved in vivo, raising the possibility of genome editing as a viable strategy for the treatment of genetic disease."

https://openalex.org/W1996931025,"Cells that are deficient in homologous recombination, such as those that lack functional breast cancer-associated 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2, are hypersensitive to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, BRCA-deficient tumors represent only a small fraction of adult cancers, which might restrict the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylates BRCA1, and this is essential for efficient formation of BRCA1 foci. Here we show that depletion or inhibition of Cdk1 compromises the ability of cells to repair DNA by homologous recombination. Combined inhibition of Cdk1 and PARP in BRCA-wild-type cancer cells resulted in reduced colony formation, delayed growth of human tumor xenografts and tumor regression with prolonged survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of Cdk1 did not sensitize nontransformed cells or tissues to inhibition of PARP. Because reduced Cdk1 activity impaired BRCA1 function and consequently, repair by homologous recombination, inhibition of Cdk1 represents a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of PARP inhibitors to BRCA-proficient cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2092915328,"Current approaches used to identify protein-binding small molecules are not suited for identifying small molecules that can bind emerging RNA drug targets. By docking small molecules onto an RNA dynamic ensemble constructed by combining NMR spectroscopy and computational molecular dynamics, we virtually screened small molecules that target the entire structure landscape of the transactivation response element (TAR) from HIV type 1 (HIV-1). We quantitatively predict binding energies for small molecules that bind different RNA conformations and report the de novo discovery of six compounds that bind TAR with high affinity and inhibit its interaction with a Tat peptide in vitro (K(i) values of 710 nM-169 μM). One compound binds HIV-1 TAR with marked selectivity and inhibits Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat by 81% in T-cell lines and HIV replication in an HIV-1 indicator cell line (IC(50) ∼23.1 μM)."
https://openalex.org/W2009006896,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ∼80% of all lung cancers. Although some advances in lung cancer therapy have been made, patient survival is still quite poor. Two microRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222, upregulated by the MET proto-oncogene, have been already described to enhance cell survival and to induce TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in NSCLC cell lines, through the downregulation of p27(kip1), PTEN and TIMP3. Here, we further investigated this pathway and showed that miR-130a, expressed at low level in lung cancer cell lines, by targeting MET was able to reduce TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cells through the c-Jun-mediated downregulation of miR-221 and miR-222. Moreover, we found that miR-130a reduced migratory capacity of NSCLC. A better understanding of MET-miR-221 and 222 axis regulation in drug resistance is the key in developing new strategies in NSCLC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2012063163,"Hydroxy fatty acids are critical lipid mediators involved in various pathophysiologic functions. We cloned and identified GPR31, a plasma membrane orphan G protein-coupled receptor that displays high affinity for the human 12-lipoxygenase-derived product 12-(<i>S</i>)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Thus, GPR31 is named 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE receptor (12-HETER) in this study. The cloned 12-HETER demonstrated high affinity binding for 12-(<i>S</i>)-[<sup>3</sup>H]HETE (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> = 4.8 ± 0.12 nm). Also, 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE efficiently and selectively stimulated GTPγS coupling in the membranes of 12-HETER-transfected cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.28 ± 1.26 nm). Activating GTPγS coupling with 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE proved to be both regio- and stereospecific. Also, 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE/12-HETER interactions lead to activation of ERK1/2, MEK, and NFκB. Moreover, knocking down 12-HRTER specifically inhibited 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE-stimulated cell invasion. Thus, 12-HETER represents the first identified high affinity receptor for the 12-(<i>S</i>)-HETE hydroxyl fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2009383015,"Superoxide production from antimycin-inhibited complex III in isolated mitochondria first increased to a maximum then decreased as substrate supply was modulated in three different ways. In each case, superoxide production had a similar bell-shaped relationship to the reduction state of cytochrome b566, suggesting that superoxide production peaks at intermediate Q-reduction state because it comes from a semiquinone in the outer quinone-binding site in complex III (Qo). Imposition of a membrane potential changed the relationships between superoxide production and b566 reduction and between b562 and b566 redox states, suggesting that b562 reduction also affects semiquinone concentration and superoxide production. To assess whether this behavior was consistent with the Q-cycle mechanism of complex III, we generated a kinetic model of the antimycin-inhibited Qo site. Using published rate constants (determined without antimycin), with unknown rate constants allowed to vary, the model failed to fit the data. However, when we allowed the rate constant for quinol oxidation to decrease 1000-fold and the rate constant for semiquinone oxidation by b566 to depend on the b562 redox state, the model fit the energized and de-energized data well. In such fits, quinol oxidation was much slower than literature values and slowed further when b566 was reduced, and reduction of b562 stabilized the semiquinone when b566 was oxidized. Thus, superoxide production at Qo depends on the reduction states of b566 and b562 and fits the Q-cycle only if particular rate constants are altered when b oxidation is prevented by antimycin.

Isolated mitochondria generate superoxide from a number of sites, including the electron transport chain complexes I and III, glycerol 3-phosphate, 2-oxoglutarate, and pyruvate dehydrogenases and perhaps complex II and electron transfer flavoprotein-quinone oxidoreductase (5Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7771-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 6Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5136) Google Scholar, 7Brand M.D. Exp. Gerontol. 2010; 45: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The quinone (Q)-binding sites of NADH:Q oxidoreductase (complex I) and the cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) have the highest maximum rates of superoxide production (7Brand M.D. Exp. Gerontol. 2010; 45: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 8Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Superoxide from complex III is thought to arise from the reaction of oxygen with a semiquinone produced in the Qo site (the quinone binding site on the outer or cytosolic face of the protein) (9Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 10Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M.

Complex III operates by a Q-cycle mechanism (11Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12Trumpower B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 689-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Quinol is oxidized in the Qo site by a bifurcated electron transfer reaction that directs the two electrons down divergent paths. The first electron is passed down the high potential chain from the Rieske Fe-S center through cytochrome c1 to cytochrome c and complex IV. The second electron is passed down the low potential chain from cytochrome b566 through cytochrome b562 to half-reduce a quinone in the Qi site of complex III (located on the inner or matrix face of the protein). In this way, two turns of the Q cycle result in the oxidation of two quinols in the Qo site and the reduction of one quinone in the Qi site. Energy conservation by formation of a protonmotive force is achieved by the net movement of two electrons down the electron transport chain from one quinol to cytochrome c driving the loss of two protons from the matrix and the appearance of four protons in the intermembrane space (setting up a pH gradient), and the transport of two negative charges from the intermembrane space to the matrix (setting up a membrane potential). Complex III produces superoxide at high rates in the presence of the Q-cycle inhibitor, antimycin A (9Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This is because antimycin A binds in the Qi site and blocks the oxidation of the cytochrome b hemes in the low potential chain (14van den Berg W.H. Prince R.C. Bashford C.L. Takamiya K.I. Bonner Jr., W.D. Dutton P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8594-8604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The backup of electrons on the cytochrome b hemes limits the oxidation of semiquinone in the Qo site and allows it sufficient time to interact with and reduce molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (10Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conditions that favor formation of semiquinone in the Qo site should yield the highest rates of superoxide production. Following this logic, one might predict that a fully reduced Q pool in the presence of antimycin should give maximal formation of semiquinone in the Qo site and therefore would result in the highest rates of superoxide production. Remarkably, however, conditions of substrate limitation, which presumably allow partial oxidation of the Q pool, result in significantly higher rates of superoxide production from the antimycin-inhibited bc1 complex (15Erecińska M. Wilson D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Dröse S. Brandt U. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) observed that ROS production from complex III was highest when oxidation of the substrate succinate was restricted by the presence of the competitive inhibitor malonate. They suggested that the mechanism for increased ROS production must be related to the lower reduction state of the Q pool when succinate oxidation was restricted, and they proposed that electron flow from cytochrome b566 to reduce Q may be the mechanism by which semiquinone and superoxide are increased. Recently, Sarewicz et al. (17Sarewicz M. Borek A. Cieluch E. Swierczek M. Osyczka A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) further examined this hypothesis in Rhodobacter capsulatus experimentally and using a kinetic model. They found evidence to support an important role of this pathway. In this study, we investigate, model, and describe the mechanism underlying this phenomenon in isolated mitochondria. We show that it is consistent with a conventional Q-cycle mechanism for complex III, but only if the rate constant for QH2 oxidation is assumed to be very small when antimycin is present (and even smaller when cytochrome b566 is reduced), and the semiquinone is assumed to be stabilized when cytochrome b562 is reduced. Mitochondria were isolated from hind limb skeletal muscle of female Wistar rats aged 5–8 weeks by differential centrifugation (18Chappell J.B. Perry S.V.

Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was measured indirectly as H2O2 production after dismutation by endogenous and exogenous superoxide dismutases. H2O2 production rates were determined by measurement of Amplex UltraRed fluorescence (Invitrogen) in a Shimadzu RF5301-PC spectrofluorometer (Kyoto, Japan) at the wavelength couple excitation = 530 nm and emission = 580 nm. Horseradish peroxidase was added to catalyze the reaction of extramitochondrial H2O2 with Amplex UltraRed to form the fluorescent product resorufin. Mitochondria (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in standard assay medium containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2 at 20 °C), and 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. All assays contained 50 μm Amplex UltraRed, 5 units of horseradish peroxidase/ml, and 12 units of superoxide dismutase/ml. Exogenous superoxide dismutase was added to maximize conversion to H2O2 of extramitochondrial superoxide produced by complex III (20St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission data were collected and translated to H2O2 amounts using H2O2 standard curves obtained under identical conditions (20St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Linear rates of change were measured for 30–60 s for each substrate condition. Superoxide production from the Qo site was defined by sensitivity to the Qo site inhibitor, stigmatellin; all data in this study refer to rates that were inhibitable by stigmatellin, with all stigmatellin-insensitive H2O2 production subtracted before further calculations. All data were corrected for H2O2 consumption by matrix glutathione peroxidase as described previously (21Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The best current estimate of the topology of superoxide production by complex III is that 63% is directed to the matrix (21Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), based on the empirical observation of 50% matrix-directed superoxide production (22Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) and correcting for matrix glutathione peroxidase activity. We therefore corrected the empirical rates of stigmatellin-sensitive H2O2 production using equation 1 (21Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of respiratory chain inhibitors, nigericin, and ATP is equal to the protonmotive force and was determined using an electrode sensitive to methyltriphenylphosphonium as described previously (23Brand M.D. Brown G. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle mitochondria were incubated under the same conditions as for H2O2 production measurements at 37 °C in standard buffer with nigericin. ATP hydrolysis routinely generated a protonmotive force of 130–150 mV, similar to values described previously (24Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in parallel with measurements of H2O2. Mitochondria were suspended at 1 mg/ml in standard assay medium, and absorbance change was measured in an Olis DW-2 dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Bogart, GA). The b566 signal was followed at the wavelength pair 566–575 nm at 37 °C with stirring (25Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 219-230Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reduction of b566 was assumed to be 0% with no added substrate and 100% with saturating substrates plus antimycin A. The contribution of cytochrome b562 to the b566 signal was corrected by subtracting 50% of the signal at 561–569 nm (26Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 219-230Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Where experimental data were normalized to moles of superoxide produced per mol of bc1 complex, calculations used the cytochrome b566 extinction coefficient ϵ = 25 liters·mmol−1·cm−1 (27Pasquali P. Degli Esposti M. Landi L. Cabrini L. Lenaz G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1985; 17: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b562 signal was followed at 561–569 nm (26Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 219-230Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the modeling (see below) the redox state of b562 (b562%red) was calculated as a function of b566 redox state (b566%red in %) by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium between the two b hemes (Equation 2). A function was generated by solution of Equation 2 for the reduction state of b562 shown in Equation 3, where Edifm = Eb566m − Eb562m; R is the molar gas constant (8.314 J·K−1·mol−1); T is the temperature (310 K), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C·mol−1). Nonlinear regression on the b heme reduction data (see Fig. 4) was performed using Equation 3, taking Edifm as a regression parameter Edifm was −60 ± 3 mV in de-energized mitochondria and 2.4 ± 5 mV in the presence of ATP. A similar redistribution of electrons between the b hemes in the presence of ATP was observed previously (28West I.C. Mitchell P. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A kinetic model of the Qo site (Fig. 5) was built in CellDesignerTM 4.01 (29Funahashi A. Jouraku A. Matsuoka Y. Kitano H. In Silico Biol. 2007; 7: S81-S90PubMed Google Scholar), then translated into the Systems Biology Markup Language, and exported to Mathematica 5.2 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). It was solved by numerical differential equation using the SBMLNDSolve function in MathSBML 2.9.0 for a set of 15 QH2/Q ratios. Superoxide production rates and % reduction of cytochrome b566 were calculated in steady state (at t = 10 s). A total Q pool concentration of 7 mm in the lipid phase was assumed (30Lenaz G. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Fato R. Cavazzoni M. Castelluccio C. Parenti Castelli G. Palmer G. Degli Esposti M. Lenaz G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To fit the model to the experimental data, the values of rate constants were optimized within defined boundaries. Ranges of rate constants for complex III from Rhodobacter sphaeroides were taken from Ref. 32Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, with wider ranges of values allowed based on values for bovine submitochondrial particles (35Degli Esposti M. Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) described in Table 1. The fitting algorithm was based on the iterative solution of the model using SBMLNDSolve with varying parameters. A weighted, multiterm least squares error function (Equation 4) that estimated the goodness of fit and penalized deviations from empirical thermodynamic relationships was calculated for each solution and minimized using the “NMinimize” numerical optimization function of Mathematica. The optimization was performed using the “DifferentialEvolution” method with default parameters. To calculate the error function, modeled rates were interpolated, yielding superoxide production rate as a function of b566%red.TABLE 1Qo site reactions and ranges of their rate constants allowed in different modeling trials* See under “Experimental Procedures.”** Value not known therefore arbitrarily constrained as indicated. Open table in a new tab * See under “Experimental Procedures.” ** Value not known therefore arbitrarily constrained as indicated. The first term of the error function estimated the goodness of fit of the interpolated modeled rates (yi) to the experimental data (xi) at corresponding cytochrome b566 redox states (i) (Equation 4). To further constrain the optimization, additional terms were included in the error function. First, the superoxide production rate at fully reduced b566 (x100) was given additional weight, because it was well determined in the experimental data. This term was multiplied by the number of experimental observations (20 data points) to give it equivalent weight to the sum of squares. Second, at 100% Q-reduction, the model was expected to provide close to 100% reduced b566. Third, although the model is kinetic, the results were expected to obey the known thermodynamics in steady state; therefore the known empirical relationship between Q/QH2 and btotalox redox pairs (25Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was assessed. To accommodate this, the average b heme redox state was calculated using the modeled b562%red from Equation 3. Linear regression was performed by taking ln(Q/QH2) as an independent variable and ln(btotalox/btotalred) as dependent. The slope (m) of the fit is the reciprocal of the number electrons passed between QH2 and b566, and its deviations from the observed value of 0.55 (25Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were weighted into the error sum. The ordinate intercept (c) is F/RT times the difference of midpoint potentials of QH2 (EQH2m = 66 mV at pH 7) and the average b (Ebm = 72.5 mV at pH 7) (25Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Squared errors between the expected and modeled c values were added to the error function. Weights were empirically set to obtain a robust fitting. Alternative weightings were also tested, resulting in similar fits (data not shown). The Differential Evolution optimization algorithm initializes optimization with a randomly seeded population of rate constant sets. The “convergent evolution” of this population through a random process to the global minimum of the error function provides the best fit. Therefore, optimization was repeated many times with different seeds to ensure that a global optimum was found. Between seven and nine rate constants were optimized within specified ranges (see Fig. 5 and reactions and ranges in Table 1). We assumed that the redox state of b566 did not affect the binding of Q and QH2 (k1 = k3, k−1 = k−3, k2 = k4, k−2 = k−4). For simplicity, k8 was set at k9/3 (10Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Reactions given no backward rate constant were considered to be physiologically irreversible because of negligible product accumulation: reactions 5 and 7 in Table 1 where no reduced Fe-S protein accumulates, and reaction 9 where superoxide is irreversibly removed by the assay system. The backward rate of reaction 8 in Table 1 was considered to be negligible. Using the same model (Fig. 5), the fitting algorithm was built to increasing complexity in four trials by increasing the number of fit parameters and including dependence of the rate of reaction 6 on the redox state of cytochrome b562 (Table 1). In trial 1, a set of 13 optimization runs on different seeds of the random generator were performed with seven parameters varied as follows: k1, k−1, k2, k−2, k6, k−6, and k8, with fixed k5 = k7 = 1650 s−1. In trial 2, k5 and k7 were allowed to take a wider range of values (Table 1), and the optimization was performed 11 times and typically resulted in convergence within 200 iterations in a 20-h run time on a standard PC at 2.2 GHz (Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo processor). Trial 3 was the same as trial 2, but in addition, k6 and k−6 were assumed to be dependent on the redox state of b562. k6 and k−6 were calculated as an average of rate constants in the presence of reduced and oxidized b562, weighted by the b562 reduction state (calculated by Equation 3 from b566%red). Trial 4 used the same constraints on rate constants as trial 3, but the model was solved for both energized and de-energized mitochondria. The same rate constants, but a different b562 to b566 redox state function (Equation 3), were used, and the error function was calculated as the sum of Equation 4 calculated for the two conditions. Because this added extra constraints, the last two terms in Equation 4 were omitted for trial 4, resulting in a wider range of fitted values. Each run for trials 3 and 4 typically converged within 400 iterations in 22 and 82 h, respectively. The presence or absence of inflections and peaks in the superoxide production rate curves was determined by numerical differentiation and root search to ensure objectivity. Previous work (15Erecińska M. Wilson D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Dröse S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) showed that addition of malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, causes a substantial increase in ROS production from antimycin-inhibited isolated complex III and submitochondrial particles in the presence of a high concentration of succinate. Fig. 1a recapitulates this result in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria (where malonate inhibits both succinate dehydrogenase and succinate transport). At saturating succinate concentration (5 mm), in the absence of malonate and the presence of rotenone to inhibit complex I and antimycin A to inhibit electron flow through the Qi site of complex III, the stigmatellin-sensitive H2O2 production rate was about 2 nmol·min−1·mg protein−1. The sensitivity to stigmatellin defined superoxide generated in the Qo site of complex III, with the reasonable assumption that no other superoxide-generating site changed redox state when stigmatellin was added under these conditions. As malonate was progressively added, the rate of H2O2 production more than doubled, with a peak rate of 5 nmol·min−1·mg protein−1, before decreasing again at higher malonate concentrations as the supply of electrons from succinate was attenuated. To examine previous suggestions that this effect was caused by oxidation of the Q pool, and was not specific to malonate or complex II, we tested whether it could be reproduced in other ways. Fig. 1b shows that the result could be replicated by progressive titration with succinate; H2O2 production increased with succinate concentration, reached a peak at about 1 mm succinate, and then decreased at higher succinate concentrations. Fig. 1c shows that the same was true when complex II was bypassed, and electrons entered the Q pool from complex I instead, during titration with glutamate plus malate in the absence of rotenone. These results show that saturating substrate concentrations do not lead to maximal superoxide production from the Qo site of complex III; instead, the results are consistent with superoxide generation being maximal at an intermediate Q reduction state. Cytochrome b566 receives the second electron during quinol oxidation at the Qo site. In the presence of antimycin, excess substrate, and oxygen to keep cytochrome c1 oxidized, b566 will become maximally reduced because the normal egress of electrons from the system through site Qi is inhibited. Fig. 1 (d–f) shows the redox behavior of cytochrome b566 during the substrate titrations in Fig. 1 (a–c). In each case, as the available substrate increased, b566 became more reduced. When the rates of H2O2 production were plotted against the reduction state of cytochrome b566 (Fig. 2), each substrate combination gave a bell-shaped curve. The three curves were very similar, suggesting that there was a single relationship between H2O2 production and the reduction state of cytochrome b566 under these conditions; in each case maximal H2O2 production occurred at ∼70–80% reduction of b566. In the presence of antimycin, oxidation of succinate (or of glutamate plus malate) is inhibited, and protons are not pumped across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Under these conditions, hydrolysis of added ATP by the F1F0-ATPase can be used to generate a protonmotive force (measured to be 130–150 mV under our conditions). Fig. 3 shows that addition of 2 mm ATP caused a dramatic change in the relationship between superoxide production and cytochrome b566 reduction; the maximum rate of superoxide production was strongly decreased, and the peak at intermediate reduction of b566 was no longer apparent. The suppression of superoxide production at intermediate substrate supply required ATP hydrolysis, because it was prevented by addition of oligomycin to inhibit the F1F0-ATPase (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis generates an electrical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is expected to alter the distribution of electrons between cytochrome b566 (on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane) and cytochrome b562 (on the matrix side) (34Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Because of its more positive midpoint potential, b562 is the preferred electron acceptor when there is no membrane potential (28West I.C. Mitchell P. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of membrane potential, the apparent midpoint potentials become similar, leading to a more equal distribution of electrons. These predictions were checked under the conditions of FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3. Fig. 4a shows that in the presence of rotenone and antimycin, but the absence of a membrane potential, cytochrome b562 initially remained almost fully reduced, but cytochrome b566 became oxidized as malonate concentration was increased, consistent with the more positive midpoint potential of b562. However, Fig. 4b shows that in the presence of rotenone, antimycin, and ATP, the electron distribution between b566 and b562 was more equal, and both became oxidized as malonate increased, indicating that in the presence of a membrane potential b562 was no longer preferentially reduced. Thus, the imposition of a membrane potential markedly changed the relationship between superoxide production and b566 reduction (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). It also markedly changed the relationship between the redox states of cytochromes b562 and b566 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the imposition of a membrane potential affects superoxide production rate from the Qo site of complex III by changing the redox state of cytochrome b562. This suggestion is examined more fully below. To test whether maximum superoxide production at submaximum substrate supply and submaximum cytochrome b566 reduction (Fig. 2) can be quantitatively explained by the Q-cycle mechanism of complex III, we generated a kinetic model of the Qo site of the anti"
https://openalex.org/W2128870952,"GPR56 is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in cortical development. Mutations to GPR56 in humans cause malformations of the cerebral cortex, but little is known about the normal function of the receptor. We found that the large N terminus (NT) of GPR56 is cleaved from the rest of the receptor during processing but remains non-covalently associated with the seven-transmembrane region of the receptor, as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation of the two GPR56 fragments from both transfected cells and native tissue. We also found that truncation of the GPR56 NT results in constitutive activation of receptor signaling, as revealed by increased GPR56-stimulated signaling upon transfection of HEK-293 cells with truncated GPR56, greatly enhanced binding of β-arrestins by truncated GPR56 relative to the full-length receptor, extensive ubiquitination of truncated GPR56, and cytotoxicity induced by truncated GPR56 that could be rescued by cotransfection of cells with β-arrestin 2. Furthermore, we found that the GPR56 NT is capable of homophilic trans-trans interactions that enhance receptor signaling activity. On the basis of these findings, we suggest a model of receptor activation in which the large N terminus of GPR56 constrains receptor activity but N-terminal interactions (GPR56 NT with an extracellular ligand and/or GPR56 NT homophilic trans-trans associations) can remove this inhibitory influence of the N terminus to activate receptor signaling."

High ezrin expression is associated with lung metastasis and poor survival in cancer. We screened small molecule libraries for compounds that directly interact with ezrin protein using surface plasmon resonance to identify lead compounds. The secondary functional assays used for lead compound selection included ezrin phosphorylation as measured by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays, actin binding, chemotaxis, invasion into an endothelial cell monolayer, zebrafish and Xenopus embryonic development, mouse lung organ culture and an in vivo lung metastasis model. Two molecules, NSC305787 and NSC668394, that directly bind to ezrin with low micromolar affinity were selected based on inhibition of ezrin function in multiple assays. They inhibited ezrin phosphorylation, ezrin-actin interaction and ezrin-mediated motility of osteosarcoma (OS) cells in culture. NSC305787 mimicked the ezrin morpholino phenotype, and NSC668394 caused a unique developmental defect consistent with reduced cell motility in zebrafish. Following tail vein injection of OS cells into mice, both molecules inhibited lung metastasis of ezrin-sensitive cells, but not ezrin-resistant cells. The small molecule inhibitors NSC305787 and NSC668394 demonstrate a novel targeted therapy that directly inhibits ezrin protein as an approach to prevent tumor metastasis."

Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). The classic pathway is through transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, which mediate the phosphorylation of receptor-specific SMAD2 and SMAD3. The phosphorylated SMAD2-SMAD3 complex then interacts with the common SMAD4 to form a heteromeric complex, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to Smad-binding elements (SBE) located in the regulatory region of a number of target genes (16Derynck R.

Thus, miR143/145 is part of the molecular signature of SMCs and contributes to the acquisition of an SMC differentiation state. Although the expression and function of many SMC miRs have begun to be elucidated, the upstream signaling pathways that converge upon SMC miR promoter/enhancer elements are less understood. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TGF-β1 modulates several miRs, which in turn control expression of protein-coding genes associated with such cellular programs as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and cell proliferation (39Kong W.

Here, we report initial results of a TGF-β1-responsive miR signature in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASM) and show that the miR143/145 gene is among the more dramatically induced miRs. We further show through gain- and loss-of-function studies that TGF-β1-induced p38MAPK-SRF-MYOCD and SMAD pathways activate miR143/145 transcription in HCASM. Importantly, we show that these TGF-β1-dependent pathways converge upon an upstream region of the miR143/145 gene harboring a previously defined CArG box and a newly identified SBE. These results establish a novel mechanism for TGF-β1-induced SMC differentiation through the transcriptional activation of miR143/145. Multiple independent isolates of HCASM were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained in medium 231 with growth supplements as provided by the manufacturer. Rat aortic SMCs (RASM) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics or antimycotics. RASM within 7 passages were used throughout many studies. For TGF-β1 treatment, growing cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured until 90% confluence. Following serum starvation overnight, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml for HCASM and 4 ng/ml for RASM) for 24 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with the indicated signaling inhibitors 30 min prior to TGF-β1 treatment. SB203580 and SB202190 (specific inhibitors to p38MAPK) and PD98059 (inhibitor to ERK1/2) were from Calbiochem. The concentration of each inhibitor was 10 μm except for the indicated concentrations used in dose-dependent studies. Total RNA was harvested from HCASM treated with and without TGF-β1 for 24 h using RNAeasy (Qiagen). After validating the effect of TGF-β1 on the induction of SMC contractile gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR, RNA samples were applied to a microRNA array provided by LC Sciences (Houston, TX) as indicated (42Wickramasinghe N.S. Manavalan T.T. Dougherty S.M. Riggs K.A. Li Y. Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2584-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 μg of total RNA was used for size fractionation. Only the small RNAs (<300 nucleotides) isolated were 3′-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. Two different tags were randomly used for either control or TGF-β1-treated RNA samples. Hybridization was performed overnight on a Paraflo microfluidic human microRNA chip (MRA-1001 LC Sciences). After RNA hybridization, tag-conjugating Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were circulated through the microfluidic chip for dye staining. Fluorescence images were collected using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000B, Molecular Devices) and digitized using Array-Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). The array contained probes only to mature miRs. Data were analyzed by first subtracting the background and then normalizing the signals using a LOWESS filter. The ratio of the two sets of detected signals (log2 transformed, balanced) and p values of the t test were calculated. Total RNA was extracted from cultured SMCs by miRNeasy as above, and cDNA synthesis was carried out with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). Semiquantitative PCR, SYBR Green-based real-time PCR (MyIQ, Bio-Rad), or Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to measure mRNA or miR levels. Control housekeeping genes were Gapd (for mRNA) and SnoRNA48 or U6 (for miR). We used the 2−ΔΔCt method for normalization of raw data as described (43Long X. Tharp D.L. Georger M.A. Slivano O.J. Lee M.Y. Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33671-33682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The primers used for different target mRNA and miRs are listed in supplemental Table 1. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, and protein was extracted in cold lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) as described (43Long X. Tharp D.L. Georger M.A. Slivano O.J. Lee M.Y. Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33671-33682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After a 1-h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody, specific signals were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were as follows: ACTA2 (Sigma, A2547); CNN1 (DAKO, M3556); CCND1 (BD Pharmingen, 556470); SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-335); p38MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-535); SMAD3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-101154); TUBA (Sigma, T-5168); and SMAD2 (3103), phospho-SMAD2 (3101S), phospho-p38MAPK (9211S), SMAD4 (9515), ERK1/2 (9122), and phospho-ERK1/2 (4376) all from Cell Signaling Technology. The HSP27 and phospho-HSP27 antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Jun-ichi Abe (University of Rochester). HCASM were dispersed under sterile glass coverslips and grown until 90% confluence. After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (1.0 ng/ml) for 24 h. Immunofluorescence was conducted as described (44Long X. Bell R.D. Gerthoffer W.T. Zlokovic B.V. Miano J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS (pH at 7.4) and then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After being rinsed three times with PBS-Tween 20, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. A 1:200 dilution of mouse anti-human CNN1 or a 1:300 dilution of anti-ACTA2 and 1:200 diluted goat anti-mouse IgG Texas Red conjugate (Abcam) were used to detect CNN1 or ACTA2 protein expression. Nuclear profiles were revealed with a brief incubation in DAPI (Molecular Probes) prior to microscopic observation. Fluorescence was visualized with an inverted Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope and photographed for direct importation into Adobe Photoshop. All images were processed in an equivalent manner to faithfully capture the real time images of each sample. siRNA to SRF was purchased from Ambion (4392420). The ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA to human SMAD4 (L-003902–00) and MYOCD (NM_153604) were from Dharmacon siRNA Technologies. A scrambled siRNA duplex was used for negative control. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to deliver siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following overnight siRNA transfection, cells were refed with fresh growth medium for 24 h before treatment as indicated. RNA or protein was extracted 48–72 h after transfection, and qPCR or Western blotting was used to determine knockdown efficiency. The human miR143/145 enhancer encompassing a conserved CArG box and a putative SBE were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA derived from HCASM using high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. The enhancer was then cloned into a BglII site of the pGL3 luciferase reporter containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (Promega). Point mutations of the CArG and SBE sites were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cloned promoter constructs were submitted to Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center to validate nucleotide sequence fidelity. Due to poor efficiency of gene delivery to HCASM, we used RASM and 10T1/2 cells to perform luciferase assays. Gene pulser electroporation (Bio-Rad) was used to deliver miR143/145 reporter and other indicated plasmids. Briefly, growing RASM were trypsinized from culture plates, rinsed twice with PBS, and mixed with transfection buffer before electroporation. The conditions for electroporation were as follows: voltage at 300 V, capacitance at 500 ohms in a 4-mm cuvette. After electroporation, cells were dispersed in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight before refeeding with fresh growth medium. Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect reporters in 10T1/2 cells. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown until 90% confluence. Transfections were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 h after transfection, cells were refed with 10% FBS for 24 h. After serum starvation, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml) for 24 h. Serum starvation lasted 24 h for 10T1/2 cells and 3 h for RASM. To correct for varying transfection efficiency and the side effect of TGF-β1 on cell proliferation, a Renilla reporter gene (Promega) was included as an internal control. Cell lysates were prepared for the luciferase assay as described by the manufacturer (Promega). All transfections were performed in quadruplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism Software (version 4.0, GraphPad Software Inc.) and expressed as the normalized -fold increase over controls ± S.D. Growing HCASM were transfected with 30 nm precursor miR mimics or antisense miR inhibitors (also known as anti-miRs) using siPORT NeoFX (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA or protein was harvested 72 h after transfection, and miR expression level was quantified with TaqMan miR assays (Applied Biosystems). The probes used are listed in supplemental Table 1. Conventional ChIP assays were carried out with EZ-ChIP (Millipore) as described previously (44Long X. Bell R.D. Gerthoffer W.T. Zlokovic B.V. Miano J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HCASM treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h were used. Chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated with SMAD4 or SMAD3 antibody or a rabbit IgG control. Primers for amplifying fragments of the miR143/145 locus containing SBE or a remote downstream region (within primary miR143/145) are included in supplemental Table 1. For quantitative ChIP, we subjected equivalent amounts of total DNA from input and precipitated IgG and SMAD4 samples to qPCR. Raw data for the anti-SMAD4 sample from control and TGF-β1-treated HCASM were normalized to its IgG control, and the normalized control sample was set to 1.

However, there are surprisingly no studies that have examined SMC differentiation genes in TGF-β1-treated HCASM, and nothing is known about the miR profile of these cells. We thus sought to initially characterize the phenotypic response of HCASM to TGF-β1 stimulation. Using quantitative PCR, we found that 24-h TGF-β1 treatment evoked increases in SMC contractile genes, including CNN1, TAGLN, and ACTA2 (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed elevations in the expression of SMC contractile proteins by Western blotting (Fig. 1B) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in independent isolates of HCASM treated with TGF-β1, and the prodifferentiation effects were comparable with those seen with the addition of differentiation medium (data not shown). These results establish HCASM as a reliable in vitro model system for TGF-β1-induced SMC differentiation and the profiling of differentiation-associated miRs. Based on the preceding results, we stimulated HCASM for 24 h with TGF-β1 or vehicle and performed an miR screen. Three independent experiments revealed a consistent array of differentially expressed miRs between vehicle and TGF-β1-treated HCASM, 10 of which showed statistically significant changes (Fig. 2A). Several miRs were shown to be reduced with TGF-β1 and are the subject of ongoing investigation (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a previous report (39Kong W. Yang H. He L. Zhao J.J. Coppola D. Dalton W.S. Cheng J.Q. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6773-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), we found TGF-β1-induced expression of miR155 in HCASM (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, miR145, a highly specific miR for SMC lineages (34Cheng Y. Liu X. Yang J. Lin Y. Xu D.Z. Lu Q. Deitch E.A. Huo Y. Delphin E.S. Zhang C. Circ.

Similar array findings were observed for miR143 (data not shown), which is co-expressed with miR145 as a bicistronic miR gene (35Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N.

https://openalex.org/W2134562578,"The PAH1-encoded phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a pivotal enzyme that produces diacylglycerol for the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) and simultaneously controls the level of PA used for phospholipid synthesis. Quantitative lipid analysis showed that the pah1Δ mutation caused a reduction in TAG mass and an elevation in the mass of phospholipids and free fatty acids, changes that were more pronounced in the stationary phase. The levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the pah1Δ mutant were unaltered, although the ratio of palmitoleic acid to oleic acid was increased with a similar change in the fatty acid composition of phospholipids. The pah1Δ mutant exhibited classic hallmarks of apoptosis in stationary phase and a marked reduction in the quantity of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Cells lacking PA phosphatase were sensitive to exogenous fatty acids in the order of toxicity palmitoleic acid > oleic acid > palmitic acid. In contrast, the growth of wild type cells was not inhibited by fatty acid supplementation. In addition, wild type cells supplemented with palmitoleic acid exhibited an induction in PA phosphatase activity and an increase in TAG synthesis. Deletion of the DGK1-encoded diacylglycerol kinase, which counteracts PA phosphatase in controlling PA content, suppressed the defect in lipid droplet formation in the pah1Δ mutant. However, the sensitivity of the pah1Δ mutant to palmitoleic acid was not rescued by the dgk1Δ mutation. Overall, these findings indicate a key role of PA phosphatase in TAG synthesis for protection against fatty acid-induced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2021395106,"Six1 is a critical regulator of embryonic development that requires interaction with the Eya family of proteins (Eya1-4) to activate the transcription of genes involved in neurogenesis, myogenesis and nephrogenesis. Although expression of Six1 and Eya family members is predominantly observed in development, their overexpression is observed in numerous cancers. Importantly, both Six1 and Eya have independently been shown to mediate breast cancer metastasis, but whether they functionally interact during tumor progression has not been explored. Herein, we demonstrate that knockdown of Eya2 in MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells reverses the ability of Six1 to induce transforming growth factor-β signaling, as well as to induce characteristics associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells, suggesting that Six1 is dependent on Eya2 to mediate numerous pro-metastatic characteristics. The importance of the Six1–Eya interaction in human breast cancer is underscored by the finding that high levels of Six1 correlate with shortened time to relapse and metastasis as well as decreased survival only when co-expressed with high levels of Eya2. Overall, these data implicate Eya2 as a necessary co-factor for many of the metastasis promoting functions of Six1, suggesting that targeting the Six1–Eya interaction may inhibit breast cancer progression. As Six1 and Eya2 are not highly expressed in most adult tissues, the Six1–Eya interaction may be a valuable future therapeutic target whose inhibition would be expected to impair breast cancer progression while conferring limited side effects."

We report that the C-type lectin CLEC14A is a novel TEM. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining of tissue arrays has shown that CLEC14A is strongly expressed in tumor vasculature when compared with vessels in normal tissue. CLEC14A overexpression in tumor vessels was seen in a wide range of solid tumor types. Functional studies showed that CLEC14A induces filopodia and facilitates endothelial migration, tube formation and vascular development in zebrafish that is, CLEC14A regulates pro-angiogenic phenotypes. CLEC14A antisera inhibited cell migration and tube formation, suggesting that anti-CLEC14A antibodies may have anti-angiogenic activity. Finally, in endothelial cultures, expression of CLEC14A increased at low shear stress, and we hypothesize that low shear stress due to poor blood flow in the disorganized tumor vasculature induces expression of CLEC14A on tumor vessels and pro-angiogenic phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2073580257,"Loss of E-cadherin is associated with acquisition of metastatic capacity. Numerous studies suggest that histone deacetylation and/or hypermethylation of CpG islands in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) are major mechanisms responsible for E-cadherin silencing in different tumors and cancer cell lines. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X antigen, HBx, contributes importantly to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma using multiple mechanisms. Experiments were designed to test if in addition to CDH1 hypermethylation HBx promotes epigenetic modulation of E-cadherin transcriptional activity through histone deacetylation and miR-373. The relationships between HBx, E-cadherin, mSin3A, Snail-1 and miR-373 were evaluated in HBx expressing (HepG2X) and control (HepG2CAT) cells by western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin IP as well as by immunohistochemical staining of liver and tumor tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. In HepG2X cells, decreased levels of E-cadherin and elevated levels of mSin3A and Snail-1 were detected. Reciprocal IP with anti-HBx and anti-mSin3A demonstrated mutual binding. Furthermore, HBx–mSin3A colocalization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. HBx downregulated E-cadherin expression by the recruitment of the mSin3A/histone deacetylase complex to the Snail-binding sites in human CDH1. Histone deacetylation inhibition by Trichostatin-A treatment restored E-cadherin expression. Mir-373, a positive regulator of E-cadherin expression, was downregulated by HBx in HepG2X cells and tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. Thus, histone deacetylation of CDH1 and downregulation of miR-373, together with the previously demonstrated hypermethylation of CDH1 by HBx, may be important for the understanding of HBV-related carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995763372,"Co-repressor histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) plays a key role in the development and differentiation of many types of cells, including regulatory T cells. However, the biological function of HDAC9 in T effector cells is unknown. Systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis have dysfunctional effector T cells. To determine the role of HDAC9 in systemic autoimmunity, we created MRL/lpr mice with HDAC9 deficiency that have aberrant effector T cell function. HDAC9 deficiency led to decreased lympho-proliferation, inflammation, autoantibody production, and increased survival in MRL/lpr mice. HDAC9-deficient mice manifested Th2 polarization, decreased T effector follicular cells positive for inducible co-stimulator, and activated T cells in vivo compared with HDAC9-intact MRL/lpr mice. HDAC9 deficiency also resulted in increased GATA3 and roquin and decreased BCL6 gene expression. HDAC9 deficiency was associated with increased site-specific lysine histone acetylation at H3 (H3K9, H3K14, and H3K18) globally that was localized to IL-4, roquin, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ promoters with increased gene expression, respectively. In kidney and spleen, HDAC9 deficiency decreased inflammation and cytokine and chemokine production due to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ overexpression.

https://openalex.org/W2089496934,"Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phytoalexin, is known to induce apoptosis in multiple cancer cell types, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that resveratrol induced p53-independent, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-mediated translocation of Bax to mitochondria where it underwent oligomerization to initiate apoptosis. Resveratrol treatment promoted interaction between Bax and XIAP in the cytosol and on mitochondria, suggesting that XIAP plays a critical role in the activation and translocation of Bax to mitochondria. This process did not involve p53 but required accumulation of Bim and t-Bid on mitochondria. Bax primarily underwent homo-oligomerization on mitochondria and played a major role in release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. Bak, another key protein that regulates the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, did not interact with p53 but continued to associate with Bcl-xL. Thus, the proapoptotic function of Bak remained suppressed during resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9 silencing inhibited resveratrol-induced caspase activation, whereas caspase-8 knockdown did not affect caspase activity, suggesting that resveratrol induces caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Together, our findings characterize the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol-induced caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971032467,"The ROP5 family is a closely related set of polymorphic pseudokinases that are critical to the ability of Toxoplasma to cause disease. Polymorphisms in ROP5 also make it a major determinant of strain-specific differences in virulence. ROP5 possesses all of the major kinase motifs required for catalysis except for a substitution at the catalytic Asp. We show that this substitution in the catalytic loop of ROP5 is part of a motif conserved in other pseudokinases of both Toxoplasma and human origin, and that this motif is required for the full activity in vivo of ROP5. This suggests evolutionary selection at this site for a biochemical function, rather than simple drift away from catalysis. We present the crystal structures of a virulent isoform of ROP5 both in its ATP-bound and -unbound states and have demonstrated that despite maintaining the canonical ATP-binding motifs, ROP5 binds ATP in a distorted conformation mediated by unusual magnesium coordination sites that would not be predicted from the primary sequence. In addition, we have mapped the polymorphisms spread throughout the primary sequence of ROP5 to two major surfaces, including the activation segment of ROP5. This suggests that the pseudoactive site of this class of pseudokinases may have evolved to use the canonical ATP-binding motifs for non-catalytic signaling through allostery."
https://openalex.org/W2013997037,"LKB1 is a tumor susceptibility gene for the Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome and is a target for mutational inactivation in sporadic human malignancies. LKB1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that has critical roles in cell growth, polarity and metabolism. A novel and important function of LKB1 is its ability to regulate the phosphorylation of CREB-regulated transcription co-activators (CRTCs) whose aberrant activation is linked with oncogenic activities. However, the roles and mechanisms of LKB1 and CRTC in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer have not been previously investigated. In this study, we observed altered LKB1-CRTC signaling in a subset of human esophageal cancer cell lines and patient samples. LKB1 negatively regulates esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Mechanistically, we determined that CRTC signaling becomes activated because of LKB1 loss, which results in the transcriptional activation of specific downstream targets including LYPD3, a critical mediator for LKB1 loss-of-function. Our data indicate that de-regulated LKB1-CRTC signaling might represent a crucial mechanism for esophageal cancer progression."

Low-resolution solution models of plutonium-loaded transferrins derived from small-angle scattering show that only transferrin with plutonium bound in the protein's C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) and iron bound in the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) (Pu(C)Fe(N)Tf) adopts the proper conformation for recognition by the transferrin receptor protein. Although the metal-binding site in each lobe contains the same donors in the same configuration and both lobes are similar, the differences between transferrin's two lobes act to restrict, but not eliminate, cellular Pu uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2088012829,"Transcription factor RUNX3 is inactivated in a number of malignancies, including breast cancer, and is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. How RUNX3 functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer remains undefined. Here, we show that about 20% of female Runx3+/− mice spontaneously developed ductal carcinoma at an average age of 14.5 months. Additionally, RUNX3 inhibits the estrogen-dependent proliferation and transformation potential of ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in liquid culture and in soft agar and suppresses the tumorigenicity of MCF-7 cells in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Furthermore, RUNX3 inhibits ERα-dependent transactivation by reducing the stability of ERα. Consistent with its ability to regulate the levels of ERα, expression of RUNX3 inversely correlates with the expression of ERα in breast cancer cell lines, human breast cancer tissues and Runx3+/− mouse mammary tumors. By destabilizing ERα, RUNX3 acts as a novel tumor suppressor in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054948499,"Semaphorins are implicated in glioma progression, although little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We have reported plexin-B3 expression in human gliomas, which upon stimulation by Sema5A causes significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion. The concomitant inactivation of Rac1 is of mechanistic importance because forced expression of constitutively active Rac1 abolishes these inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Sema5A induces prominent cell collapse and ramification of processes reminiscent of astrocytic morphology, which temporally associate with extensive disassembly of actin stress fibers and disruption of focal adhesions, followed by accumulation of actin patches in protrusions. Mechanistically, Sema5A induces transient protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of fascin-1, which can reduce its actin-binding/bundling activities and temporally parallels its translocation from cell body to extending processes. PKC inhibition or fascin-1 knockdown is sufficient to abrogate Sema5A-induced morphological differentiation, whereas the process is hastened by forced expression of fascin-1. Intriguingly, Sema5A induces re-expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which when silenced restricts differentiation of glioma cells to bipolar instead of multipolar morphology. Therefore, we hypothesize complementary functions of fascin-1 and GFAP in the early and late phases of Sema5A-induced astrocytic differentiation of gliomas, respectively. In summary, Sema5A and plexin-B3 impede motility but promote differentiation of human gliomas. These effects are plausibly compromised in high-grade human astrocytomas in which Sema5A expression is markedly reduced, hence leading to infiltrative and anaplastic characteristics. This is evident by increased invasiveness of glioma cells when endogenous Sema5A is silenced. Therefore, Sema5A and plexin-B3 represent potential novel targets in counteracting glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2069318858,"The nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription factor has essential roles in inflammation and oncogenesis. Its ubiquitous RelA subunit is regulated by several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation. Ubiquitination promotes the termination of RelA-dependent transcription, but its regulation is incompletely understood. Through mass spectrometry analysis of ubiquitinated RelA, we identified seven lysines that were attached to degradative and non-degradative forms of polyubiquitin. Interestingly, lysines targeted for acetylation were among the residues identified as ubiquitin acceptor sites. Mutation of these particular sites resulted in decreased polyubiquitination. Acetylation and ubiquitination were found to inhibit each other, consistent with their use of overlapping sites. Reconstitution of rela(-/-) fibroblasts with wild-type and mutant forms of RelA revealed that modifications at these residues can have activating and inhibitory functions depending on the target gene context. Altogether, this study elucidates that ubiquitination and acetylation can modulate each other and regulate nuclear NF-κB function in a gene-specific manner."

Voltage-gated Kv2.1 potassium channels are constitutively maintained in a highly phosphorylated state in neurons. Increased neuronal activity triggers rapid calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation, loss of channel clustering, and hyperpolarizing shifts in voltage-dependent activation that homeostatically suppress neuronal excitability. These changes are reversible, such that rephosphorylation occurs after removal of excitatory stimuli. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a Pro-directed Ser/Thr protein kinase, directly phosphorylates Kv2.1, and determines the constitutive level of Kv2.1 phosphorylation, the rapid increase in Kv2.1 phosphorylation upon acute blockade of neuronal activity, and the recovery of Kv2.1 phosphorylation after stimulus-induced dephosphorylation. We also demonstrate that although the phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 is also shaped by the activity of the PP1 protein phosphatase, the regulation of Kv2.1 phosphorylation by CDK5 is not mediated through the previously described regulation of PP1 activity by CDK5.

PP1 and calcineurin/PP2B have been identified as playing crucial and non-overlapping roles in constitutive and activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Kv2.1, respectively (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P.

However, the specific protein kinases (PKs) responsible for constitutive and activity-dependent phosphorylation of Kv2.1 have not been identified.Among the identified Kv2.1 phosphorylation sites, almost half (including Ser-603) are adjacent to a C-terminal Pro residue, suggesting phosphorylation by Pro-directed Ser/Thr PKs. Among these, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a neuronal PK whose activity depends on association with myristoyl-anchored p35 and p39 cofactors and whose activity underlies diverse aspects of neuronal biology, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration and survival, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration (17Tsai L.H.

Here, we investigate the role of CDK5 in the constitutive and activity-dependent phosphorylation of Kv2.1 and define a new role for CDK5 in regulating neuronal function through direct phosphorylation of a voltage-gated ion channel crucial to activity-dependent plasticity in intrinsic neuronal excitability.DISCUSSIONPlasticity in the intrinsic excitability of neurons is based on dynamic changes in the expression, localization, and/or functional properties of voltage-gated ion channels. Kv channels are the most diverse family of voltage-gated channels and as such are primary determinants of diversity of overall neuronal excitability and of the input-output relationships in mammalian neurons (34Johnston J. Forsythe I.D. Kopp-Scheinpflug C. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 3187-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies have provided valuable insights into the role of specific Kv channel subtypes in the processing and integration of synaptic input within the somatodendritic domain (35Johnston D. Christie B.R. Frick A. Gray R. Hoffman D.A. Schexnayder L.K. Watanabe S. Yuan L.L. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), initiation and propagation of axonal action potentials (36Kress G.J. Mennerick S. Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and regulation of neurotransmitter release (37Dodson P.D. Forsythe I.D. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Modulation of the abundance, subcellular distribution, and gating of Kv channels through reversible multisite phosphorylation has emerged as a common theme for dynamic regulation of neuronal function (34Johnston J. Forsythe I.D. Kopp-Scheinpflug C. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 3187-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Cerda O. Trimmer J.S. Neurosci.

Prominent examples include enhanced excitatory synaptic activity causing PKA-dependent phosphorylation and internalization of Kv4.2 in dendritic spines that results in enhancement of mEPSCs in hippocampal neurons (40Kim J. Jung S.C. Clemens A.M. Petralia R.S. Hoffman D.A. Neuron. 2007; 54: 933-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 41Hammond R.S. Lin L. Sidorov M.S. Wikenheiser A.M. Hoffman D.A. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7513-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and high frequency auditory stimulation causing rapid dephosphorylation of Kv3.1, leading to the enhancement of Kv3.1 activity needed to support high frequency spiking in auditory neurons (42Song P. Yang Y. Barnes-Davies M. Bhattacharjee A. Hamann M. Forsythe I.D. Oliver D.L. Kaczmarek L.K. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As detailed above, Kv2.1 is subjected to extensive bidirectional activity-dependent changes in phosphorylation state, changing its localization and function to homeostatically regulate neuronal excitability.Here we show that CDK5 is the key PK for determining the Kv2.1 phosphorylation state in neurons, including at the Ser-603 site that is key to phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Kv2.1 gating (15Park K.S. Mohapatra D.P. Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and at other sites that regulate Kv2.1 clustering. CDK5 can directly phosphorylate the recombinant Kv2.1 C terminus as well as Kv2.1 purified from mammalian brain. Moreover, we show here that CDK5 is responsible for Kv2.1 phosphorylation under diverse conditions of neuronal activity, including determining the constitutive level of Kv2.1 phosphorylation, the enhanced Kv2.1 phosphorylation that occurs after acute activity blockade, and the recovery of Kv2.1 phosphorylation after activity-dependent dephosphorylation. As such, CDK5 is poised to be a key determinant of the activity-dependent changes in Kv2.1 expression, localization, and function that have been found to underlie certain forms of plasticity in intrinsic excitability. Previous studies have established a clear role for CDK5 activity in nervous system development, such that inhibition, ablation, or knockdown of CDK5 leads to defects in neuronal migration, maturation, and survival (43Jessberger S. Gage F.H. Eisch A.J. Lagace D.C. Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CDK5 has also been implicated as a key player in synaptic plasticity, with actions on both postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and presynaptic neurotransmitter release (19Lai K.O. Ip N.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although CDK5 has been recently implicated in regulating constitutive biosynthetic trafficking of neuronal Kv1 channels to the axon initial segment (44Vacher H. Yang J.W. Cerda O. Autillo-Touati A. Dargent B. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a role for CDK5 in dynamic, reversible modulation of Kv channels or of other neuronal ion channels has not been described previously.We show here that CDK5 activity is required for the recovery of the phosphorylation and clustering of Kv2.1 protein after an episode of activity-induced, calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation. Excitatory stimulation (e.g. glutamatergic stimulation or depolarization) has been found to reduce CDK5 activity in neurons, due to degradation of p35 and p39 regulatory subunits (28Schuman E.M. Murase S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Ohshima T. Asada A. Saito T. Nguyen C. Bibb J.A. Ishiguro K. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. Mikoshiba K. Matsui H. Hisanaga S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequent recovery of the expression level of these subunits and therefore of CDK5 activity begins at 90 min after washout of the stimulus (31Hosokawa T. Saito T. Asada A. Ohshima T. Itakura M. Takahashi M. Fukunaga K. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), similar to the kinetics shown here and elsewhere (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Mulholland P.J. Carpenter-Hyland E.P. Hearing M.C. Becker H.C. Woodward J.J. Chandler L.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8801-8809Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for recovery of Kv2.1 phosphorylation. As such, our findings are consistent with a mechanism whereby de novo synthesis of obligatory p35/p39 subunits and their association in active CDK5 complexes is the rate-limiting step in the recovery of Kv2.1 phosphorylation after calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation in response to excitatory stimulation. Whether changes in the activity of neuronal PPs (PP1 and/or calcineurin) or PKs other than CDK5 are also involved in determining other aspects of the recovery of Kv2.1 phosphorylation is at yet unknown. It is intriguing, given their opposing roles in regulating Kv2.1, that CDK5 and calcineurin also have counteracting activity-dependent effects on synaptic vesicle endocytosis, via phosphorylation of components of the release machinery (45Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat.

Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).We found that the CDK inhibitor roscovitine blocks the increased phosphorylation of Kv2.1 induced by acute neuronal activity blockade. That Kv2.1 is a direct substrate for CDK5 in vitro suggests that the enhanced Kv2.1 phosphorylation upon activity blockade is due to increased CDK5 activity and direct CDK5 phosphorylation of Kv2.1. Whereas the activity of most other PKs is under the control of either second messengers (e.g. cAMP, Ca2+, DAG, etc.) or phosphorylation cascades involving other PKs or PPs, either of which can be rapidly modulated by neuronal signaling pathways, all available evidence suggests that CDK5 activity is exclusively regulated by the levels of its obligatory p35 and p39 subunits, as determined by their de novo synthesis and degradation (47Hisanaga S. Saito T. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rapid activity-dependent down-regulation of CDK5 activity is achieved by triggered degradation of p35/p39 in response to neuronal depolarization (28Schuman E.M. Murase S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and NMDA stimulation (30Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Ohshima T. Asada A. Saito T. Nguyen C. Bibb J.A. Ishiguro K. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. Mikoshiba K. Matsui H. Hisanaga S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Acute up-regulation of CDK5 activity would therefore require rapid de novo synthesis of p35 and/or p39 and their association with plasma membrane-localized CDK5, events unlikely to occur within the short time frame of acute activity blockade (15 min) that we found induces enhanced Kv2.1 phosphorylation. Extensive relocalization of CDK5 in response to excitotoxic stimulation occurs through calpain-mediated cleavage of the myristoylated region from p35, leading to loss of the plasma membrane association of the CDK5 complex and its translocation into the cytoplasm and resulting in phosphorylation of non-physiological CDK5 substrates and neurotoxicity nucleus (48Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Although changes in the subcellular localization of the obligatory subunits or of preexisting active CDK5 complexes to sites of high density Kv2.1 clustering could underlie the rapid increase in Kv2.1 phosphorylation upon acute activity blockade, relocalization of CDK5 and its regulatory subunits to access different plasma membrane substrates has not been described. Interestingly, a previous study revealed a slight increase in DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-75, a known CDK5 phosphorylation site, in response to short (10-min) TTX treatment (49Nishi A. Bibb J.A. Matsuyama S. Hamada M. Higashi H. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), providing additional suggestive evidence for rapid activation of CDK5 in response to acute activity blockade. Future studies will determine the mechanisms whereby CDK5 activity can be rapidly stimulated by acute activity blockade and how it then acts via phosphorylation of Kv2.1 and other substrates to mediate responses to decreased neuronal activity.We found that pharmacological inhibition of PP1 in unstimulated neurons dramatically increases phosphorylation of Kv2.1 at the CDK5-dependent Ser-603 phosphorylation site. This is in sharp contrast to calcineurin inhibitors, which have little effect on constitutive phosphorylation of Kv2.1 but abolish the rapid dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 in response to excitatory stimuli (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Misonou H. Menegola M. Mohapatra D.P. Guy L.K. Park K.S. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13505-13514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that PP1 overexpression leads to decreased Kv2.1 phosphorylation in heterologous cells and that PP1, like calcineurin (7Misonou H. Menegola M. Mohapatra D.P. Guy L.K. Park K.S. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13505-13514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), can directly dephosphorylate immunopurified Kv2.1 in vitro. PP1 is involved in diverse aspects of neuronal plasticity (50Munton R.P. Vizi S. Mansuy I.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and ion channels are prominent targets for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation (51Dai S. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PP1 activity is negatively regulated by CDK5 phosphorylation, via inhibitory phosphorylation at the Thr-320 site on PP1 (32Dohadwala M. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 33Li T. Chalifour L.E. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6619-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As such, inhibition of CDK5 could lead to enhanced PP1 activity, driving the dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 via an indirect mechanism that is not dependent on reduced CDK5-mediated Kv2.1 phosphorylation. We showed here that the effects of expressing a mutant PP1 (PP1-T320A) that is resistant to CDK5-mediated inhibition were indistinguishable from those of WT PP1, supporting a role for direct CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of Kv2.1 as the primary determinant of the rapid increase in Kv2.1 phosphorylation seen upon acute activity blockade and during the recovery period following excitation-induced, calcineurin-mediated, Kv2.1 dephosphorylation. However, because PP1 activity does seem to be important in establishing the steady-state level of Kv2.1 phosphorylation, its possible contributions to regulating Kv2.1 phosphorylation during these other processes cannot be completely discounted. Future studies will reveal the precise interplay between CDK5 and neuronal PPs, such as PP1 and calcineurin, in determining the phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 and of other ion channels whose modulation alters intrinsic excitability and that act as the molecular substrates for intrinsic neuronal plasticity.

However, the specific protein kinases (PKs) responsible for constitutive and activity-dependent phosphorylation of Kv2.1 have not been identified.Among the identified Kv2.1 phosphorylation sites, almost half (including Ser-603) are adjacent to a C-terminal Pro residue, suggesting phosphorylation by Pro-directed Ser/Thr PKs. Among these, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a neuronal PK whose activity depends on association with myristoyl-anchored p35 and p39 cofactors and whose activity underlies diverse aspects of neuronal biology, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration and survival, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration (17Tsai L.H.

https://openalex.org/W2000099335,"Fusion proteins containing the amino terminus of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) are common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) due to translocations. The MLL–AF4 fusion protein is generated by the translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23), and t(4;11)-positive ALL patients (MLL–AF4 ALL), have a notoriously poorer prognosis compared with patients with other MLL-associated leukemias. The detailed role of this fusion protein in leukemogenesis is not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the AF4 3′ untranslated regions may modulate MLL–AF4 fusion protein levels, raising the question of whether regulation of these miRNAs are involved in the progression of MLL–AF4 ALL. In this study, we show that miR-143 was identified as a regulator of MLL–AF4 expression in MLL–AF4 ALL samples. Restoration of miR-143 in MLL–AF4-positive RS4;11 and MV4-11 cells induced apoptosis, negatively contributing to leukemia cell growth by reducing MLL–AF4 fusion protein levels. Furthermore, miR-143 was epigenetically repressed by promoter hypermethylation in MLL–AF4-positive primary blasts and cell lines, but not in normal bone marrow cells and MLL–AF4-negative primary blasts, which was directly associated with expression of the MLL–AF4 oncogene. This is the first study to show that miR-143 functions as a tumor suppressor in MLL–AF4 B-cell ALL. These data reveal the therapeutic promise of upregulating miR-143 expression for MLL–AF4 B-cell ALL."
https://openalex.org/W1968873586,"As invading breast carcinoma cells breach their underlying basement membrane, they become confronted with a dense three-dimensional reactive stroma dominated by type I collagen. To develop metastatic capabilities, invading tumor cells must acquire the capacity to negotiate this novel microenvironment. Collagen influences the fate of epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis. However, the mechanisms used by invading tumor cells to evade collagen-induced apoptosis remain to be defined. We demonstrate that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP-14) confers breast cancer cells with the ability to escape apoptosis when embedded in a collagen gel and after orthotopic implantation in vivo. In the absence of MMP-14-dependent proteolysis, type I collagen triggers apoptosis by inducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-interacting killer in luminal-like breast cancer cells. These findings reveal a new mechanism whereby MMP-14 activity promotes tumor progression by circumventing apoptosis."

Protein quality control mechanisms ensure the fidelity of the proteome by partitioning polypeptides based on conformational states. Correctly folded proteins can proceed to and remain at their sites of function, whereas aberrant molecules are slated for elimination.

Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Although these mechanisms seemed sufficiently comprehensive, reports of aberrant molecules trafficking out of the ER undetected suggest that the “molecular sieve” is somewhat porous (2Spear E.D.

This scenario is averted because analyses of ERAD-independent substrates revealed post-ER quality control mechanisms that efficiently capture the wayward molecules.

The plasma membrane mechanism, called peripheral quality control, is dedicated to the surveillance of membrane proteins (4Apaja P.M. Xu H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Okiyoneda T. Barrière H. Bagdány M. Rabeh W.M. Du K. Höhfeld J Young J.C. Lukacs G.L. Science. 2010; 329: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This mechanism is distinct from the clearance of folded receptor proteins in the early steps due to its reliance on the Hsp70/Hsp90 molecular chaperone systems (4Apaja P.M. Xu H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Okiyoneda T. Barrière H. Bagdány M. Rabeh W.M. Du K. Höhfeld J Young J.C. Lukacs G.L. Science. 2010; 329: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This is notable because the same chaperone classes are employed for the quality control of ER and cytosolic proteins (for a review, see Ref. 14Buchberger A. Bukau B. Sommer T. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 238-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Substrate ubiquitination is used to signal endocytosis and sorting into the multivesicular body (MVB) endosomal pathway for degradation in lysosomes (for a review, see Ref. 15Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The transport route for GQC substrates from the Golgi is not known. In budding yeast, proteins traffic to the vacuole using one of two general routes. The first involves trafficking proteins in Golgi-derived vesicles to an endosomal prevacuolar compartment. This pathway was defined genetically in part by the class E vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutants (16Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 17Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Class E mutants cause formation of exaggerated prevacuolar compartments containing soluble and membrane vacuolar hydrolases, unrecycled Golgi proteins, and endocytosed proteins (16Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 17Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J.

Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Thus, the prevacuolar compartment represents a major trafficking hub for vacuolar/lysosomal transport that also includes the MVB pathway. This pathway is termed the “CPY pathway” because carboxypeptidase Y is a well studied client. A distinct vacuolar transport pathway was defined by the membrane protein alkaline phosphatase (20Piper R.C. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Cowles C.R. Snyder W.B. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2769-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Stepp J.D. Huang K. Lemmon S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1761-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase pathway is not as well understood as the CPY pathway, but there are clear differences. Whereas the alkaline phosphatase pathway is known only to deliver membrane-bound cargo to vacuolar limiting membrane, the CPY pathway can do that and also places membrane proteins entirely into the lumen using the MVB pathway. For membrane-integrated GQC substrates, there is no obvious restriction for the route used. The MVB pathway provides a good mechanism because molecules are transported entirely into the vacuolar lumen on intralumenal vesicles. By contrast, the alternative alkaline phosphatase pathway results in membrane protein insertion into vacuolar limiting membrane. Although this might present a topological problem for degradation, the invagination and hydrolysis of vacuolar membranes and their contents through microautophagy would overcome the limitation if coupled to protein quality control (24Kunz J.B. Schwarz H. Mayer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Dubouloz F. Deloche O. Wanke V. Cameroni E. De Virgilio C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We previously reported that a plasma membrane protein, Wsc1p, is an endogenous, obligate substrate of post-ER quality control (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Wsc1p is a single-spanning integral membrane protein that functions as a sensor for cell wall integrity in budding yeast (27Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Jacoby J.J. Nilius S.M. Heinisch J.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutations disrupting the luminal folding of Wsc1p are not detected by ERAD, in part due to the inability of the ERAD chaperone Kar2p/BiP to recognize the variants (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Instead, the Wsc1p cytoplasmic domain contains a dominant ER export signal that directs its transport regardless of the luminal folding state. For Wsc1p quality control, sorting occurs in the Golgi apparatus. Folded Wsc1p progresses to the plasma membrane, whereas misfolded molecules partition to the vacuole, dependent on the Vps10p cargo-sorting factor (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These characteristics make Wsc1p an ideal model to uncover the mechanisms underlying GQC. Although both soluble and membrane GQC substrates can utilize Vps10p, the subsequent steps of transport are unknown (10Hong E. Davidson A.R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Jørgensen M.U. Emr S.D. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, Wsc1p variants were used to uncover the sorting and transport mechanism from the Golgi apparatus. We show that GQC and peripheral quality control pathways converge at the MVB endosomal sorting compartment. Importantly, we demonstrate that the use of the MVB pathway ensures whole molecule degradation and prevents toxic degradation products that would otherwise form through other vacuolar transport routes. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. All strains are in the W303 background except for strains used in supplemental Figs. S2B and S4, which are in the BY4741 background. Anti-HA mAb (HA.11) and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Covance Research Products and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Anti-V-ATPase 60-kDa subunit and anti-3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK) monoclonal antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Anti-Kar2p and anti-Sec61p antibodies were provided by P.

All plasmid inserts were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. pES67, expressing the HA epitope-tagged CPY* driven by the GAL1 promoter, was described previously (2Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol.

Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Wsc1* contains a point mutation (L63R) in the luminal/extracellular domain of Wsc1p. All substrate constructs were engineered with an HA epitope tag at their C termini except for pSW177, which is fused to GFP. A 1.7-kb fragment containing the PRC1 promoter and Wsc1* was amplified from pSW104 using primers SWN99/SWN5 and digested with NotI and ClaI. Next, a 0.7-kb fragment (GFPS65T,Q80R) was amplified from pDN330 (Ng plasmid collection (31Malkus P. Jiang F. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) with primers SWN38/SWN39 and digested with ClaI and XbaI. The two fragments were ligated into pSW148 digested with NotI and XbaI. pSW252 expresses Wsc1*-6R using the PRC1 promoter. Wsc1*-6R contains six point mutations (K293R, K301R, K308R, K315R, K338R, and K365R) in the cytoplasmic domain made by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (32Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Primers SWN103, SWN104, SWN105, SWN106, SWN107, and SWN108 were used to direct mutagenesis. pSW257 encodes Wsc1*-6R regulated by the GAS1 promoter. A 600-bp fragment containing the GAS1 promoter was amplified from genomic DNA using SWN87/SWN88 primers and digested with NotI and BamHI. Next, a 1.7-kb fragment digested with BamHI/SalI was purified from pSW252. It contains the Wsc1*-6R coding sequence and the ACT1 terminator. The two fragments were ligated into pRS315 digested with NotI and SalI. pSW182 and pSW263 encode Wsc1* and Wsc1*-6R regulated by the GAL1 promoter. A 450-bp fragment containing the GAL1 promoter was amplified from pYES2.1 (Invitrogen) using SWN100/SWN101 primers and digested with NotI and BamHI. A second 1.7-kb fragment containing the Wsc1*-HA or Wsc1*-6R-HA gene followed by the ACT1 terminator sequence was released from pSW148 or pSW252 digested with BamHI and SalI. The fragments were ligated to pRS315 digested with NotI and SalI. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Primary antibody working concentrations were as follows: HA.11 mAb (1:200) or anti-V-ATPase (1:100) in TBS containing 1% BSA. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody was used at 1:500 (Molecular Probes) in TBS containing 1% BSA. Samples were visualized using an Axio Imager M1 microscope with a ×100, 1.4 numerical aperture oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). HA/V-ATPase and DAPI fluorescence was detected with a 488- and 405-nm laser line, respectively. Images were archived using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems). In some cases, linear adjustments were applied to enhance the brightness of images using levels in the image adjustment function of Photoshop. z-Stack images were taken with 0.38-μm intervals, and only a 488-nm argon laser was used during acquisition of z-stack images to minimize signal bleaching. A montage of z-stack images was created using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) with an increment of 1. Cells expressing Wsc1* fused to GFP were harvested at an A600 of 0.4–0.6 and resuspended in the same selective medium for visualization. Vacuolar membrane staining was performed, including FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) in YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose) at 30 °C for 20 min, and chased for 45 min (supplemental Fig. S3) or 90 min (Fig. 7) at 30 °C as described (33Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using an Axio Imager M1 microscope with a ×100, 1.4 numerical aperture oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). GFP and FM4–64 fluorescence was captured with a 488- and 543-nm laser line, respectively. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems). In some instances, image brightness was enhanced using levels and curves in the image adjustment function of Photoshop. One A600 unit of log phase cells was stained by incubation in 0.5 μg/ml LD540 for 5 min at 30 °C (provided by Dr Marcus R. Wenk, National University of Singapore) (34Spandl J. White D.J. Peychl J. Thiele C. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After washing, LD540 fluorescence was visualized using an Axio Imager M1 microscope with a ×100, 1.4 numerical aperture oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and a 488-nm laser line. Sample preparation for electron microscopy analysis was performed as described with minor modifications (35Wright R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One A600 unit of log phase cells grown at 30 °C was collected and fixed with glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Next, cells were treated with 2% potassium permanganate for 1 h at room temperature. After dehydration in ethanol, cells were infiltrated with Spurr's resin and incubated for 24 h at 60 °C to allow polymerization. Thin sections were prepared using an Ultracut UCT (Leica) microtome and stained with lead citrate. Micrographs were taken using a transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM-1230) and archived using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems). Two A600 units of log phase cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1.0 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA; Sigma-Aldrich) followed by the addition of 0.5 cm3 of 0.45-mm zirconium beads. Cells were disrupted by two 30 s cycles in a mini-bead beater (BioSpec Products Inc.). The lysate was transferred to a new tube and combined with a 10% TCA bead wash. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation and vortexed in 80 μl of TCA resuspension buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 11.0, 3% SDS, 1 mm PMSF). The sample was heated to 100 °C for 10 min and given a 16,000 × g spin to separate insolubles. A portion of the extract was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with anti-HA antibody, stripped, and reprobed with anti-PGK antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film (Pierce). For quantitative immunoblotting experiments, proteins were first separated on a 4–15% gradient gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots were subsequently incubated with anti-HA and anti-Sec61p antibodies followed by anti-mouse IRDye 680 and anti-rabbit IRDye 800 secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences). Direst infrared fluorescence was detected and quantified by using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Metabolic pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (36Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. Visualization and quantification was performed using a Typhoon 8600 scanner and ImageQuantTM TL software (GE Healthcare). Plotted data reflect three independent experiments with the mean ± S.D. indicated. Cycloheximide chase experiments were performed as described previously (37Kanehara K. Xie W. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, cycloheximide was added to log phase cultures to initiate the chase (200 μg/ml final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich). 1.8 ml of cell culture was collected at indicated times, pelleted, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of 10% TCA. Detergent lysates were prepared as described above for Western analysis. Blots were probed with anti-HA, stripped, reprobed with anti-PGK antibody, and visualized using the ECL system. Five A600 units of wild type and Δpep4 cells expressing (PGAS1)Wsc1*-6R were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 1.2 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Applied Science). 0.5 cm3 of zirconium beads was added, and cells were disrupted by 4 × 15 s cycles in a mini-bead beater. The collected lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. An equal volume of 0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.0) was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. One-fifth of the mixture was saved, and the remaining fraction was subject to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Pelleted membranes were solubilized in 3% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm DTT and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins in the reserved lysate and high speed supernatant were precipitated in 10% TCA for 30 min on ice. Proteins were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in TCA resuspension buffer, and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting after adjustments to normalize protein concentrations. Primary antibody concentrations were as follows: 1:5000 anti-HA; 1:10,000 anti-Kar2p; and 1:5000 anti-Sec61p. The variant Wsc1-L63R (Wsc1* hereafter) contains a single point mutation in its luminal domain that prevents proper folding (Fig. 1A). Wsc1* traffics efficiently from the ER to Golgi via COPII vesicles and is degraded in the vacuole (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine its transport route to the vacuole, indirect immunofluorescence was performed in wild type and Δpep4 cells. The rapid degradation of Wsc1* in wild type cells results in low steady state levels, making visualization difficult (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For this reason, expression was enhanced using the moderate GAS1 promoter for imaging studies (38Prasad R. Kawaguchi S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Wsc1* intracellular trafficking patterns and degradation are indistinguishable from molecules expressed from the weaker PRC1 promoter (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). In wild type cells, Wsc1p variants localized to small punctate structures reminiscent of Golgi and endosomal membranes (Fig. 1B, a) (39Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol.

Nature. 2006; 441: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Vacuoles, which are visualized as depressions in DIC images (Fig. 1D), are deficient in signal because of rapid substrate degradation there (26Wang S. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In Δpep4 cells, where vacuolar proteases are inactivated, Wsc1* accumulated strongly in vacuoles (Fig. 1B, e–h). This pattern differs from V-ATPase (Fig. 1D), a resident of the vacuolar limiting membrane, suggesting luminal localization. To confirm this notion, sequential z-stack confocal scans of Wsc1* in Δpep4 cells were collected. As shown in Fig. 1C, staining can be seen across the organelle in all of the z-stacks with significant signals. Taken together, these data show that Wsc1* is delivered to the lumen of the vacuole. The most direct route for luminal delivery of Wsc1* is through the MVB pathway. To test this possibility, a panel of class E vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants was analyzed using fluorescence-based imaging. The simple assay takes advantage of the fact that these mutants share the same terminal phenotype. Regardless of the step disrupted in MVB-dependent transport, each mutant forms an aberrant prevacuolar organelle devoid of vesicles called the class E compartment (16Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 17Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J.

Cargo that normally uses the MVB pathway accumulates there with a portion continuing on to the vacuolar limiting membrane (17Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J.

A Wsc1*-GFP fusion protein was constructed for examination in live cells. Wsc1*-GFP behaves indistinguishably from Wsc1* in wild type cells except that the GFP moiety accumulates in the vacuole because it is resistant to proteolysis (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B, WT panel). Among four well characterized endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) involved in cargo clustering (ESCRT-0), membrane budding (ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II), and membrane scission (ESCRT-III) (for review, see Ref. 43Hurley J.H. Hanson P.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), most mutants caused the accumulation of Wsc1*-GFP in class E compartments (seen prominently in the micrographs as a strongly staining structure juxtaposed to the vacuolar membrane) and the vacuolar limiting membrane (supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, Δhse1 cells had no effect, indicating that the Vps27p partner is dispensable for Wsc1*-GFP transport (44Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat.

Among the panel, Δdid2, Δvta1, Δvps60, Δist1, and Δmvb12 strains are described as not displaying prominent class E compartments, and portions of their MVB cargo distribute into the vacuolar lumen (46Shiflett S.L.

https://openalex.org/W1987650536,"The early growth response (EGR) family of transcription factors has been implicated in control of lipid biosynthetic genes. Egr1 is induced by insulin both in vitro and in vivo and is the most highly expressed family member in liver. In this study, we investigated whether Egr1 regulates cholesterol biosynthetic genes in liver. Using an insulin-sensitive liver cell line, we show that localization of Egr1 to cholesterol biosynthetic genes is induced by insulin treatment and that this localization precedes the induction of the genes. Reduction in Egr1 expression using targeted siRNA blunted the insulin-dependent induction of cholesterol genes. A similar reduction in squalene epoxidase expression was also observed in Egr1 null mice. In addition, application of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) samples to tiled gene microarrays revealed localization of Egr1 in promoter regions of many cholesterol gene loci. In vivo ChIP assays using liver tissue show that Egr1 localization to several cholesterol biosynthetic gene promoters is induced by feeding. Finally, analysis of plasma cholesterol in Egr1(-/-) mice indicated a significant decrease in serum cholesterol when compared with wild-type mice. Together these data point to Egr1 as a modulator of the cholesterol biosynthetic gene family in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2142062658,"Apicomplexa are protist parasites that include Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria, and Toxoplasma gondii, responsible for toxoplasmosis. Most Apicomplexa possess a relict plastid, the apicoplast, which was acquired by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Despite being nonphotosynthetic, the apicoplast is otherwise metabolically similar to algal and plant plastids and is essential for parasite survival. Previous studies of Toxoplasma gondii identified membrane lipids with some structural features of plastid galactolipids, the major plastid lipid class. However, direct evidence for the plant-like enzymes responsible for galactolipid synthesis in Apicomplexan parasites has not been obtained. Chromera velia is an Apicomplexan relative recently discovered in Australian corals. C. velia retains a photosynthetic plastid, providing a unique model to study the evolution of the apicoplast. Here, we report the unambiguous presence of plant-like monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol in C. velia and localize digalactosyldiacylglycerol to the plastid. We also provide evidence for a plant-like biosynthesis pathway and identify candidate galactosyltranferases responsible for galactolipid synthesis. Our study provides new insights in the evolution of these important enzymes in plastid-containing eukaryotes and will help reconstruct the evolution of glycerolipid metabolism in important parasites such as Plasmodium and Toxoplasma."

We sought to investigate the role of MMP-9 from sublethally irradiated tumor in accelerated pulmonary metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC-LM) and the corresponding anti-metastasis strategies in C57BL/6 mice. We used Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber assays and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assays to evaluate the invasion capability of irradiated LLC-LM cells (7.5 Gy), reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and the western blot assay to investigate the expression of MMPs by irradiated cells, and small interfering RNA duplexes to inhibit MMP-9 expression. LLC-LM cells differing in MMP-2 or -9 expression were subcutaneously injected into right thighs and the resulting tumors were irradiated (10 Gy × 5) to induce pulmonary metastasis. Radiation significantly enhanced MMP-9 at both the transcriptional and translational levels. MMP-9 siRNA significantly inhibited in vitro radiation-enhanced invasiveness. The number of radiation-accelerated pulmonary metastases was significantly reduced by MMP-9 knockdown and MMP-2/9 knockdown. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of LLC-LM cells in the blood and lung tissue revealed MMP-9 involvement in radiation-enhanced intravasation. Either higher-dose irradiation (30 Gy × 2) or pretreatment with prototypical MMP-9 inhibitor, zoledronic acid, significantly reduced the number of pulmonary metastases. The viability of irradiated tumor was seen on both positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and tumor/serum MMP-9 levels suggested the association of local control of primary tumor and inhibition of time-dependent MMP-9 activities. Our results demonstrate that MMP-9 is crucially involved in radiation-enhanced LLC-LM cell invasiveness in vitro and in pulmonary metastasis from inadequately irradiated primary tumor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1985600706,"Autophagy pathways in eukaryotic cells mediate the turnover of a diverse set of cytoplasmic components, including damaged organelles and abnormal protein aggregates. Autophagy-mediated degradation is highly regulated, and defects in these pathways have been linked to a number of human disorders. The Atg1 protein kinase appears to be a key site of this control and is targeted by multiple signaling pathways to ensure the appropriate autophagic response to changing environmental conditions. Despite the importance of this kinase, relatively little is known about the molecular details of Atg1 activation. In this study we show that Atg13, an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Atg1, promotes the formation of a specific Atg1 self-interaction in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The appearance of this Atg1-Atg1 complex is correlated with the induction of autophagy, and conditions that disrupt this complex result in diminished levels of both autophagy and Atg1 kinase activity. Moreover, the addition of a heterologous dimerization domain to Atg1 resulted in elevated kinase activity both in vivo and in vitro. The formation of this complex appears to be an important prerequisite for the subsequent autophosphorylation of Thr-226 in the Atg1 activation loop. Previous work indicates that this modification is necessary and perhaps sufficient for Atg1 kinase activity. Interestingly, this Atg1 self-association does not require Atg17, suggesting that this second conserved regulator might activate Atg1 in a manner mechanistically distinct from that of Atg13. In all, this work suggests a model whereby this self-association stimulates the autophosphorylation of Atg1 within its activation loop.

https://openalex.org/W2080094420,"Heterotrimeric G protein complexes are conserved from plants to mammals, but the complexity of each system varies. Arabidopsis thaliana contains one Gα, one Gβ (AGB1), and at least three Gγ subunits, allowing it to form three versions of the heterotrimer. This plant model is ideal for genetic studies because mammalian systems contain hundreds of unique heterotrimers. The activation of these complexes promotes interactions between both the Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer with enzymes and scaffolds to propagate signaling to the cytoplasm. However, although effectors of Gα and Gβ are known in mammals, no Gβ effectors were previously known in plants. Toward identifying AGB1 effectors, we genetically screened for dominant mutations that suppress Gβ-null mutant (agb1-2) phenotypes. We found that overexpression of acireductone dioxygenase 1 (ARD1) suppresses the 2-day-old etiolated phenotype of agb1-2. ARD1 is homologous to prokaryotic and eukaryotic ARD proteins; one function of ARDs is to operate in the methionine salvage pathway. We show here that ARD1 is an active metalloenzyme, and AGB1 and ARD1 both control embryonic hypocotyl length by modulating cell division; they also may contribute to the production of ethylene, a product of the methionine salvage pathway. ARD1 physically interacts with AGB1, and ARD enzymatic activity is stimulated by AGB1 in vitro. The binding interface on AGB1 was deduced using a comparative evolutionary approach and tested using recombinant AGB1 mutants. A possible mechanism for AGB1 activation of ARD1 activity was tested using directed mutations in a loop near the substrate-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2080666574,"NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels with a regulatory intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD). In GluN2B, the CTD is the largest domain in the protein but is intrinsically disordered. The GluN2B subunit is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in synapses. Src kinase phosphorylates the GluN2B CTD, but it is unknown how this affects channel activity. In disordered proteins, phosphorylation can tip the balance between order and disorder. Transitions can occur in both directions, so it is not currently possible to predict the effects of phosphorylation. We used single molecule fluorescence to characterize the effects of Src phosphorylation on GluN2B. Scanning fluorescent labeling sites throughout the domain showed no positional dependence of the energy transfer. Instead, efficiency only scaled with the separation between labeling sites suggestive of a relatively featureless conformational energy landscape. Src phosphorylation led to a general expansion of the polypeptide, which would result in greater exposure of known protein-binding sites and increase the physical separation between contiguous sites. Phosphorylation makes the CTD more like a random coil leaving open the question of how Src exerts its effects on the NMDA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2067854511,"Ras is one of the most frequently activated oncogenes in cancer. Two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important for ras transformation: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2). Here we present a downstream signal amplification cascade that is critical for ras transformation in murine embryonic fibroblasts. This cascade is coordinated by ERK and JNK2 MAPKs, whose Ras-mediated activation leads to the enhanced levels of three oncogenic transcription factors, namely, c-Myc, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and ATF3, all of which are essential for ras transformation. Previous studies show that ERK-mediated serine 62 phosphorylation protects c-Myc from proteasomal degradation. ERK is, however, not alone sufficient to stabilize c-Myc but requires the cooperation of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), an oncogene that counteracts protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of c-Myc. Here we show that JNK2 regulates Cip2a transcription via ATF2. ATF2 and c-Myc cooperate to activate the transcription of ATF3. Remarkably, not only ectopic JNK2, but also ectopic ATF2, CIP2A, c-Myc and ATF3 are sufficient to rescue the defective ras transformation of JNK2-deficient cells. Thus, these data identify the key signal converging point of JNK2 and ERK pathways and underline the central role of CIP2A in ras transformation."

A mammalian uncoordinated 119 protein (UNC119), also known as Retina Gene 4 protein (RG4), has been recently implicated in transducin transport to the OS in the dark through its interaction with the N-acylated GTP-bound transducin-α subunit (Gαt1). Here, we demonstrate that the interaction of human UNC119 (HRG4) with transducin is dependent on the N-acylation, but does not require the GTP-bound form of Gαt1. The lipid specificity of UNC119 is unique: UNC119 bound the myristoylated N terminus of Gαt1 with much higher affinity than a prenylated substrate, whereas the homologous prenyl-binding protein PrBP/δ did not interact with the myristoylated peptide. UNC119 was capable of interacting with Gαt1GDP as well as with heterotrimeric transducin (Gt). This interaction of UNC119 with Gt led to displacement of Gβ1γ1 from the heterotrimer. Furthermore, UNC119 facilitated solubilization of Gt from dark-adapted rod OS membranes. Consistent with these observations, UNC119 inhibited rhodopsin-dependent activation of Gt, but had no effect on the GTP-hydrolysis by Gαt1. A model for the role of UNC119 in the IS→OS translocation of Gt is proposed based on the UNC119 ability to dissociate Gt subunits from each other and the membrane. We also found that UNC119 inhibited activation of Go by D2 dopamine receptor in cultured cells.

The light-dependent translocation of transducin is thought to play an important role in light-adaptation and neuroprotection (4Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I.

The current evidence supports a simple diffusion model, whereby the activation of transducin by photoexcited rhodopsin (R*) causes dissociation of transducin-α (Gαt1) and Gβ1γ1 subunits allowing them to diffuse into the inner segment (1Calvert P.D.

This retrograde translocation occurs on a relatively slow time scale with a half-life of 2.5 h (4Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of transducin return to the OS in the dark is not known. Formation of heterotrimeric Gt in the inner segment (IS) appears to be a prerequisite for correct transport of transducin to the OS. Heterotrimeric Gt forms in the IS in the absence of R* following hydrolysis of Gαt1-bound GTP. GTP and GTPγS both caused light-dependent transducin redistribution from the OS in permeabilized retinas, but only GTP-translocated Gt returned to the OS in the dark (8Rosenzweig D.H. Nair K.S. Wei J. Wang Q. Garwin G. Saari J.C. Chen C.K. Smrcka A.V. Swaroop A. Lem J. Hurley J.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5484-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, the time course of the IS→OS transport in the dark was exceedingly slow for the GTPase deficient Gαt1 Q200L mutant (6Kerov V. Chen D. Moussaif M. Chen Y.J. Chen C.K. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41069-41076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Gαt1 and Gβ1γ1 return to the OS in the dark is identical, supporting the transport of Gt as the heterotrimer (4Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I.

In dark-adapted Gαt1 knock-out mice Gβ1γ1 is mislocalized and spread throughout the photoreceptor cells (10Zhang H. Huang W. Zhang H. Zhu X. Craft C.M. Baehr W. Chen C.K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 231-237PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gαt1 is severely down-regulated and mislocalized in Gγ1 knock-out mice (11Lobanova E.S. Finkelstein S. Herrmann R. Chen Y.M. Kessler C.

Transducin may return to the OS in dark by a motor-driven mechanism, diffusion or a combination of the two transport modes. The apparent energy-independence of the Gt return transport suggests diffusion as a primary mode (12Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A.

Gt is modified with two lipid anchors, fatty acyl at the N-terminal Gly of Gαt1 and thioether-linked farnesyl attached to the C terminus of Gγ1 (13Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J.

Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Two lipid anchors are generally thought to be sufficient for stable membrane attachment of a protein that precludes protein dissociation and diffusion in the cytosol (16Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T.

Intriguingly, Gt is capable of significant interdisc transfer in the OS (20Wang Q. Zhang X. Zhang L. He F. Zhang G. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30015-30024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Kerov V. Artemyev N.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the longitudinal diffusion of Gαt1β1γ1, which may allow to “refill” apical discs with Gt during dark adaptation, is facilitated by sequestration of one the lipid anchor(s) via interactions with a binding partner (21Kerov V. Artemyev N.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The same mechanism may underlie the entire IS→OS route of Gt in the dark. Potential partners include phosducin and prenyl-binding protein PrBP/δ also known as PDEδ (22Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

PrBP/δ, in particular, was shown to be critical for the IS→OS transport of a number of prenylated proteins (26Zhang H. Li S. Doan T. Rieke F. Detwiler P.B. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Genetics. 1995; 141: 977-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also known as Retina Gene 4 protein (RG4), has recently emerged as the protein essential for transducin transport in darkness (28Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T. Gerstner C.D. Davis M.W. Inana G. Whitby F.G. Jorgensen E.M. Hill C.P. Tong L. Baehr W. Nat.

McLaren M.J. Inana G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1797-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of UNC119 shares significant sequence and structural homology with PrBP/δ (28Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T.

Roversi P. Wittinghofer A. Hillig R.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). UNC119 is relatively abundant in the photoreceptor synapses and the IS (31Higashide T. McLaren M.J. Inana G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 690-698PubMed Google Scholar), but also is expressed in a number of other tissues (32Swanson D.A. Chang J.T. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J.

Truncation mutation in UNC119 that deletes the PrBP/δ homology domain has been linked to cone-rod dystrophy in human patients (34Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277PubMed Google Scholar). A transgenic mouse model of the human mutation revealed severe synaptic degeneration (34Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a knock-out mouse model of UNC119 (MRG4) revealed a different dysfunction at distal IS/OS regions that caused a slowly progressing retinal degeneration (35Ishiba Y. Higashide T. Mori N. Kobayashi A. Kubota S. McLaren M.J. Satoh H. Wong F. Inana G. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 84: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic study has reported reduction in UNC119 expression as one of the possible culprits contributing to retinal degeneration in a mouse transgenic model (36Posokhova E. Song H.

UNC119 was reported to interact with the N terminus of the GTP-bound Gαt1 in an acylation-dependent manner (28Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T. Gerstner C.D. Davis M.W. Inana G. Whitby F.G. Jorgensen E.M. Hill C.P. Tong L. Baehr W. Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Importantly, the return of Gt to the OS in the dark was impaired in UNC119 knock-out mice (28Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T. Gerstner C.D. Davis M.W. Inana G. Whitby F.G. Jorgensen E.M. Hill C.P. Tong L. Baehr W. Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). UNC119 was found to inhibit the GTPase activity of Gαt1. Hence, the proposed model for transducin return to the OS in darkness is based on diffusion of the stable UNC119-Gαt1GTP complex (28Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T. Gerstner C.D. Davis M.W. Inana G. Whitby F.G. Jorgensen E.M. Hill C.P. Tong L. Baehr W. Nat.

Here, we examined the interaction of human UNC119 with transducin and the lipid specificity of UNC119 in comparison to that of PrBP/δ in order to gain insights into the mechanism of IS→OS transport of Gt in the dark. Myristoylated peptides, [MYR]-GAGASAEEK, and [MYR]-GCGASAEEK were synthesized by Proimmune Ltd. BC (3-(bromo acetyl)-7-diethyl amino coumarine) fluorophore was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. 6-((7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3acetyl)amino)hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (AMCA-X, SE) was purchased from Invitrogen. S-Farnesyl-l-cysteine methyl ester was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. All other chemicals are acquired from Sigma. Bovine ROS membranes were prepared as previously described (37Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Urea-washed ROS membranes (uROS) were prepared according to protocol in Yamanaka et al. (38Yamanaka G.

Bitensky M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant Gβ1γ1 were expressed using the baculovirus/sf9 cell system. The Gβ1 baculoviral stock was obtained from Dr. S. Chen (University of Iowa). To generate Gγ1 baculoviruses, the Gγ1 cDNA was PCR amplified from bovine retinal library with the introduction of the coding sequence for the N-terminal His6 tag, and cloned into the pFast HTb vector using RsrII/NheI sites. Generation of the recombinant bacmids, transfection of Sf9 cells, and viral amplifications were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). For expression of the Gβ1γ1 heterodimer, Sf9 cell cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with Gβ1 and Gγ1 baculoviruses at MOI of 4–6. The Gβ1γ1 heterodimer was purified using affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin (Novagen) as previously described (40Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G.

The Gαti chimera (Gαt1*) with the His6 sequence inserted between Met115 and Pro116 of the helical domain of Ghi8 (41Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was generated to allow the N-terminal myristoylation of the protein. The Gαt11–115 sequence was PCR-amplified from the Chi8 template using a 5′-primer with an NcoI site and a 3′-primer coding the His6 sequence added to Gαt1 specific sequence. The Chi8 116–350 sequence was PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer with the His6-sequence added to the Gαt1-specific sequence, and a 3′-primer containing an XhoI site. The two resulting PCR products were used in the PCR reaction with the flanking primers, and the PCR product was subcloned into the pET15b vector using the NcoI/XhoI sites. Gαt1* was expressed and purified as previously described (41Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To obtain myristoylated Gαt1* (myrGαt1*), BL21-codon plus Escherichia coli cells were co-transformed with kanamycin-resistant plasmid pbb131 expressing yeast N-myristoyl transferase (42Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For expression of the His6-tagged UNC119, UNC11955–240, and PrBP/δ, corresponding cDNAs were PCR amplified from a human retina cDNA library and subcloned into the pET15b vector using NcoI/XhoI sites (UNC119) or NdeI/BamHI sites (PrBP/δ). The N-terminally StrepII-tagged UNC11955–240 was amplified from a human retina cDNA library with a 5′ primer coding an NcoI site and the tag sequence WSHPQFEK with the SGG linker and a 3′ primer containing a XhoI site. The PCR product was subcloned sites into the pET15b vector using NcoI/XhoI sites. Protein expression in BL21-codon plus E. coli cells was induced with the addition of 30 μm IPTG. UNC119 and StrepII-UNC11955–240 were expressed overnight at 16 °C, whereas UNC11955–240 and PrBP/δ were expressed for 5 h at 30 °C. The His6-tagged proteins were purified on Ni-NTA resin (Novagen). StrepII-UNC11955–240 was purified using StrepTactin Superflow Agarose (Novagen). UNC11955–240 and PrBP/δ were additionally purified by gel-filtration on a Superdex 75 Sepharose column, and UNC119 was purified by an ion-exchange chromatography on a Uno-Q1 column (Bio-Rad). To extract native transducin without exposure to photobleached R* and dissociation-reassociation of Gαt1 and Gβ1γ1 (43Goc A. Angel T.E. Jastrzebska B. Wang B. Wintrode P.L. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12409-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), ROS membranes (200 μl, 160 μm R) were washed two times with 2 ml of isotonic buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF and 120 mm KCl) under dim red light. The pellet after centrifugation was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer B (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF) and homogenized in a 2 ml tube using a disposable pestle under dim red light. To obtain GTP or GTPγS extracts of Gt, ROS membranes (200 μl, 160 μm R) were photobleached under fluorescent light for 30 min on ice and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing either 100 μm GTP or GTPγS and homogenized in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube using a disposable pestle. The resulting mixtures were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants of hypotonic, GTP, and GTPγS extracts were collected and dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C for 4 h. Dialyzed extracts were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. ROS membranes washed twice with buffer A were resuspended in 1 ml buffer A containing 5 μm purified UNC119 and incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark. The mixture was homogenized using a disposable pestle and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C for 4 h. Dialyzed UNC119 extract of ROS was cleared by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. StrepII-UNC11955–240 was expressed as described above. Cell pellet was resuspended in Strep-Tactin binding buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and then disrupted by ultrasonication. The cleared supernatant after centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min) was incubated with 200 μl of StrepTactin Superflow Agarose resin for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. StrepII-UNC11955–240-bound resin was washed thoroughly with buffer C to remove unbound proteins. For pull-down assay, 15 μl of StrepII-UNC11955–240-bound resin was incubated with 5 μg each of purified Gαt1GDP, Gαt1*, and myrGαt1* or with hypotonic, GTP, and GTPγS ROS extracts (10 μg protein each) for 30 min at room temperature in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Resin was washed three times with buffer A to remove unbound proteins and 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the resin. The samples were separated on 4–12% gradient Bis-tris NuPage gels (Invitrogen). Samples were prepared by incubating hypotonic, GTP, and GTPγS ROS extracts (typically 10 μg proteins each) with 5 μm His6-tagged UNC119 for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were run in 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) at 25 °C with constant voltage of 150 V for 45 min. Protein samples were prepared in 4× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot Western blot kit (Invitrogen) and analyzed using rabbit anti-Gαt1 K-20 (SCBT)(1:2000 dilution), anti-Gβ1 C-16 (SCBT) (1:250 dilution), anti-recoverin P26 (1:3000), and anti-His probe H-15 (SCBT) (1:3000) antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution) secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents obtained from GE Healthcare. Samples of hypotonic ROS extract containing 2 μm Gt alone or in mixture with 4 μm UNC119 were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and reconstituted with bleached uROS membranes (100 nm rhodopsin). Binding reactions were started with the addition of 5 μm [35S]GTPγS. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times, mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm GTP, passed through Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm), and washed three times with 3 ml of the same buffer without GTP. Bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by scintillation counting. The data were fit with Equation 1. Y=Ymax×(1-exp(-kt))(Eq. 1) GTPase assays were carried out in suspensions of uROS (10 μm R*) reconstituted with hypotonic ROS extract containing 1 μm Gt in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), containing 100 mm NaCl and 8 mm MgSO4 similar as described (44He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The GTPase reactions were initiated by addition of 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP. After a 5-s interval, the reaction was stopped or allowed to proceed with or without the addition of UNC119 (3 or 12 μm) for the indicated time intervals. The reactions were quenched by addition of 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were then precipitated using charcoal, and free 32Pi formed was measured by liquid scintillation counting. After subtraction of fraction of GTP hydrolyzed at 5 s, the data were fit with Equation 1, where k is the rate constant of GTP hydrolysis. Agonist-dependent cellular measurements of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between masGRKct-Rluc8 and Gβ1γ2-Venus were performed to visualize the action of G protein signaling in living cells as previously described with slight modification (45Hollins B.

For transfection, cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. After 4 h, expression constructs (total 5 μg/dish) were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine LTX (8 μl/dish) and PLUS (5 μl/dish) reagents. D2 receptors, Gαo, Venus155–239-Gβ, Venus1–155-Gγ2, masGRKct-Rluc8, myc-tagged UNC119 constructs were transfected at a 1:2:1:1:1:6 ratio. BRET sensor constructs were gifts from Dr. Nevin A. Lambert (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Georgia). Empty vector was used to normalize the amount of transfected DNA. The cells were used for experiments at 16–24 h after transfection. BRET measurements were made using a microplate reader (POLARstar Omega; BMG Labtech) equipped with two emission photomultiplier tubes, allowing us to detect two emissions simultaneously with highest possible resolution of 50 ms for every data point. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Purified [MYR]-GCGASAEEK was dissolved in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) buffer containing 50% acetonitrile (final concentration 0.4 mm), mixed with 5-fold excess of BC and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm DTT. The product, [MYR]-GC[BC]GASAEEK, was purified by reverse phase HPLC and confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Conjugation of AMCA-X to cysteine farnesyl methyl ester was performed using respectively 6 mm and 2 mm solutions of the reagents in 25% acetonitrile, 25% DMF, and 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH7.3). The product, farnesyl-Cys-AMCA, was purified by reverse phase HPLC. Assays were performed on a F-2000 or F-2500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi) in 1 ml of 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). Direct changes in fluorescence of [MYR]-GC[BC]GASAEEK (25 nm) on addition of various concentrations of UNC119, UNC11955–240, and PrBP/δ were monitored with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 490 nm. The concentration of labeled peptide was determined using ϵ445 = 53,000. The Kd values were calculated by fitting the data to Equation 2, FFo=1+FFomax-11+10[LogK-X](Eq. 2) where Fo is a basal fluorescence of [MYR]-GC[BC]GASAEEK, F is the fluorescence after additions of binding protein, F/Fomax is the maximal relative increase of fluorescence, and X is the logarithm of concentration of added protein. Changes in fluorescence of farnesyl-Cys-AMCA (500 nm) on addition of various concentrations of UNC119, UNC11955–240, and PrBP/δ were monitored with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 435 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1995526037,"γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a heterodimeric membrane enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of extracellular glutathione and other γ-glutamyl-containing compounds. GGT is synthesized as a single polypeptide (propeptide) that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage, which results in the formation of the large and small subunits that compose the mature enzyme. GGT is extensively N-glycosylated, yet the functional consequences of this modification are unclear. We investigated the effect of N-glycosylation on the kinetic behavior, stability, and functional maturation of GGT. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we confirmed that all seven N-glycosylation sites on human GGT are modified by N-glycans. Comparative enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that single substitutions are functionally tolerated, although the N95Q mutation resulted in a marked decrease in the cleavage efficiency of the propeptide. However, each of the single site mutants exhibited decreased thermal stability relative to wild-type GGT. Combined mutagenesis of all N-glycosylation sites resulted in the accumulation of the inactive propeptide form of the enzyme. Use of N-glycosylation inhibitors demonstrated that binding of the core N-glycans, not their subsequent processing, is the critical glycosylation event governing the autocleavage of GGT. Although N-glycosylation is necessary for maturation of the propeptide, enzymatic deglycosylation of the mature wild-type GGT does not substantially impact either the kinetic behavior or thermal stability of the fully processed human enzyme. These findings are the first to establish that co-translational N-glycosylation of human GGT is required for the proper folding and subsequent cleavage of the nascent propeptide, although retention of these N-glycans is not necessary for maintaining either the function or structural stability of the mature enzyme."

Thus, complexes of magnesium, aluminum, and beryllium with fluoride (MgFx, AlFx, and BeFx) stabilize analogues of the E2·P product state (E2·MgF42−), the E2∼P transition state (E2·AlF4−), and the E2-P ground state (E2·BeF3−), respectively (reviewed in Ref. 6Toyoshima C.

In Na,K-ATPase similar effects of various fluoride analogues are found (9Robinson J.D. Davis R.L. Steinberg M. J. Bioenerg.

Recently, Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney and shark rectal glands with 2 K+-ions, or Rb+-ions, in the cation binding site, and MgF42− in the phosphorylation site has been crystallized (11Morth J.P.

Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Nature. 2009; 459: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), which is presumed to represent the E2·2K+·Pi state. Cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) like ouabain are specific inhibitors of the Na,K-ATPase (13Schatzmann H.J. Helv. Physiol. Pharmacol. Acta. 1953; 11: 346-354PubMed Google Scholar). This is the basis for the therapeutic action of CTSs like digoxin and digitoxin in treatment of congestive heart failure and arrhythmia (14Lingrel J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Inhibition of myocardial Na,K-ATPase leads to elevated intracellular Na+-concentration, which suppresses NCX, the 3Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, thus increasing intracellular Ca2+ and producing an increase in the contractility of the heart and cardiac output (the inotropic effect). Ouabain binds to the extracellular side of the Na,K-ATPase and mainly to a phosphorylated intermediate (15Yoda A. Yoda S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 700-705PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is still not known to which intermediate ouabain principally binds during enzyme turnover. The ouabain binding site was recently determined for the shark enzyme in an apparent low affinity E2·2K+·Pi form (1Ogawa H. Shinoda T. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A low-resolution (∼5 Å) crystal structure of kidney Na,K-ATPase in the E2P state indicates that ouabain is bound in a similar position, but likely with high affinity (16Yatime L. Laursen M. Morth J.P. Esmann M. Nissen P. Fedosova N.U. J. Struct. Biol. 2011; 174: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the present study interactions of various metal fluorides (MeF), acting as phosphate analogues, with shark Na,K-ATPase are investigated and the binding of ouabain and its aglycone ouabagenin to various fluoride analogues of EP-intermediates of Na,K-ATPase is characterized to elucidate structural constraints for binding of CTS to various EP phosphoforms, especially regarding the importance of the sugar moiety of CTS. The cardiotonic steroids ouabain and ouabagenin (OG), MgCl2, BeSO4, AlCl3, and NaF were from Sigma. 9-Anthroyl ouabain (AO) was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Crude membrane fractions (microsomes) from the rectal gland of the shark Squalus acanthias were prepared by homogenization followed by washing and isolation by centrifugation in 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 6.8. The purified microsomes were activated by a mild DOC treatment (∼0.15% DOC) to extract extrinsic proteins and to open sealed vesicles. After washing and resuspension the purified membrane preparation was obtained by differential centrifugation essential as previously described (17Skou J.C. Esmann M. Methods in Enzymology. 1988; 156: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The preparation was suspended in histidine/EDTA buffer with 25% glycerol and kept at −20 °C. The preparation had a specific hydrolytic activity of ∼30 units/mg at 37 °C and contained the α1-, β1-subunits together with the FXYD10 regulatory subunit (18Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations, ranging from 3–5 mg/ml, were determined using Peterson's modification (19Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) of the Lowry method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific enzyme activity was measured using either the Fiske and SubbaRow method (21Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with Amidol as the reducing agent, or the more sensitive method of Baginsky et al. (22Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 14: 155-158Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The activity was measured at 23 °C in a test medium containing 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Tris-ATP, and 0.33 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Histidine or imidazole (30 mm) was used as buffer, depending on pH. The inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by MgFx by equilibrium binding was characterized by mixing 5 mm MgCl2 and increasing concentrations of NaF (1–100 mm) in imidazole 30 mm pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.5 followed by addition of Na,K-ATPase and preincubation for 10 min. at 23 °C. The inhibition by BeFx and AlFx was performed by mixing 5 mm NaF and increasing concentrations of BeSO4 or AlCl3 (1–200 μm) followed by preincubation with the enzyme, as described above. The reaction with AlFx·ADP was produced by including 1 mm ADP in the AlFx reaction media. Following preincubation, the Na,K- ATPase activity at 23 °C was determined at optimal turnover conditions, i.e. in 130 mm Na+, 20 mm K+, 4 mm Mg2+, 3 mm ATP, and 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). The time course of inhibition at various concentrations of fluorides was determined by varying the time of preincubation with fluorides (15–180 s) as described above, followed by addition of the enzyme activity test medium. After 1 min, the reaction was stopped by 50% TCA and liberated Pi was determined. The rate of inhibition induced by binding of CTS to non-phosphorylated or MgPi-phosphorylated Na,K-ATPase was determined by preincubation of enzyme in 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) with either 5 mm Mg2+, or 5 mm Mg2+ + 1 mm Pi with 1 μm ouabain, ouabagenin, or anthroyl ouabain for varying time periods followed by measurement of hydrolytic activity. The enzyme was first reacted with metal fluoride complexes by incubating in 5 mm NaF (or KF), 30 mm imidazole pH 7.5 and either 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm BeSO4, 200 μm AlCl3, or 200 μm AlCl3 plus 1 mm ADP for 10 min. at 23 °C to obtain maximum inhibition. Then 150 mm NaCl was added to the enzyme and the hydrolytic activity measured at different time intervals (0–60 min). The reactivation of metal fluoride-treated enzyme reacted with ouabain or ouabagenin was tested by including the CTS in the metal fluoride reaction medium for 50 min after the initial 10 min preincubation with metal fluoride followed by addition of 150 mm NaCl and measurement of hydrolytic activity. Fluorescence associated with 9-anthroyl ouabain (AO) binding to the Na,K-ATPase was measured using a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm using a band-pass of 5 nm, and the emission wavelength was 480 nm with band-pass 10 nm. The sample was placed in a thermostated cuvette (20 °C) with magnetic stirring and contained 30 mm Tris-buffer pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm anthroyl ouabain. Before fluorescence measurements the enzyme was incubated with 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Pi to produce the E2P-state, or with different metal fluorides as indicated above to produce the enzyme complexes E·MgFx, E·BeFx, E·AlFx, and E·AlFx·ADP. Enzyme was incubated for 3 min at 20 °C followed by incubation on ice for 1 h before measurements. To measure AO fluorescence ∼60 μg of the incubated enzyme was added to the cuvette in a final volume of 2 ml with 1 μm AO. Baseline fluorescence was measured with enzyme preincubated with 1 mm ouabain. Controlled proteolysis of the shark rectal gland α-subunit was performed in a reaction mixture containing 100 μg of protein suspended in 25 mm histidine pH 7.0, and the following ligands to stabilize the enzyme in specific conformations: 4 mm NaF and 4 mm MgCl2 (E·MgFx), 4 mm NaF, and 50 μl BeSO4 (E·BeFx), 4 mm NaF, and 100 μm AlCl3 (E·AlFx), or 4 mm NaF and 100 μm AlCl3 plus 1 mm ADP (E·AlFx·ADP). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μg of proteinase K for 40 min at 20 °C and terminated with SDS sample buffer containing 1% trichloroacetic acid to irreversibly inhibit the protease. 40 μg of protein was loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Identification of cleavage products was performed by Edman degradation analysis (Alphalyse, Odense, DK). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Inhibition by fluorides was evaluated by fitting to a sigmoid dose-response equation (Hill Equation 1) using the GraphPad program Prism 5,y=y0+ymax−y01+10Log(Ki−X)nH(Eq. 1) where y0 and ymax are baseline and maximum activity and x is the concentration of inhibitor. Ki is the inhibitor concentration that gives 50% inhibition and nH is the Hill coefficient. The time course of fluoride inhibition or AO fluorescence was fitted with one phase exponential Equation 2,y=(y∞−y0)e−kobst+y0(Eq. 2) where kobs is the observed rate constant and y0 and y∞ are the initial and final values. The relative intensity of inhibition or fluorescence is then Equation 3.y∞−y0y0(Eq. 3) Comparison between best-fit values was performed using an F test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Structural figures were prepared using PyMol. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by increasing concentration of NaF at a constant MgCl2 concentration of 5 mm is demonstrated in Fig. 1 at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. The data were fitted with a Hill equation and showed an increase in the NaF inhibitor constant (Ki) as the pH is increased. Thus Ki increased from 1.1 mm to 6.4 mm when pH increased from 6.5 to 8.5. The Hill coefficient (shared at the different pH values) was −2.2 and significantly different from −1. As the Hill coefficient is empirical and provides only lower limits on the binding stoichiometry, this is in accordance with 4 fluorine atoms present in the stable complex MgF42− in the recent crystal structure of shark Na,K-ATPase (12Shinoda T. Ogawa H. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Nature. 2009; 459: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). There was no systematic variation in the Hill coefficient with pH indicating that the coordination number for fluoride did not change within this pH range, as indicated in other nucleotide-binding proteins (23Schlicting I. Reinstein J. Nature. 1999; 6: 721-723Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of MgFx, BeFx, AlFx, and AlFx·ADP to Na,K-ATPase was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of specific ATPase activity after preincubation for 10 min at 23 °C in solutions containing 5 mm NaF and increasing concentrations of MgCl2, BeSO4, AlCl3, or AlCl3 + 1 mm ADP. Fig. 2 shows inhibition by MgCl2 (panel A), BeSO4 (panel B), AlCl3 (panel C), or AlCl3 + ADP (panel D), all at 5 mm NaF and pH 7.5. The data were fitted with a Hill equation and the inhibitor dissociation constant and Hill coefficient evaluated. The Hill coefficient was significantly different from −1 at all conditions indicating inhibition by binding of more than one metal ion in the phosphorylation domain. In the case of MgCl2 this is in accordance with the binding of two Mg2+ ions in the phosphorylation domain, one with MgF42− near D376 and one at the Mg2+ subsite near D717 in shark, Fig. 3 (12Shinoda T. Ogawa H. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Nature. 2009; 459: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). From the present data it seems likely that also beryllium and aluminum will bind to the Mg2+ subsite in the absence of Mg2+. Beryllium and aluminum have not previously been identified in the P-domain (D703) of SERCA crystal structures (see Ref. 8S⊘rensen T.L. M⊘ller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and identification by crystallography will probably be difficult due to lack of strong anomalous signals from these metals. The inhibitor constants measured at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 are given in Table 1. As indicated the inhibitor affinity increased with decreasing pH and the inhibitor affinity was highest for BeFx followed by AlFx, AlFx·ADP, and MgFx. This order did not change with pH. The inhibition by AlFx·ADP was much less pH-sensitive, as seen from Table 1. No systematic variation in the fitted Hill coefficients was present at the different pH values, and the Hill coefficient was therefore shared in the fitting procedure to data at the various pH values.FIGURE 3Coordination of MgF42−, a Pi analog, and of a Mg2+ ion at the phosphorylation site in the crystal structure of Na,K-ATPase from shark rectal gland in a state representing E2·2K+·Pi.

Open table in a new tab In Fig. 4A the time course of Na,K-ATPase inhibition induced by adding enzyme to a premix of 5 mm MgCl2 and increasing concentrations of NaF (1–100 mm) at pH 7.5 is illustrated. The data could be satisfactorily fitted with a mono-exponential relation with an observed rate constants, kobs. In Fig. 4B the kobs is plotted against the concentration of NaF. The relation is steeply sigmoid and the data are compatible with a Hill equation where the K0.5 is 42 mm when nH is set to 4, in accordance with 4 fluorine atoms in the metal fluoride complex, MgF42−, that binds to the phosphorylation site (12 c.f. Fig. 3). At pH 7.5 the observed rate constant at saturating NaF (75 mm) was 0.13 s−1 comparable to an apparent second order rate constant of kapp = 1.7 s−1 m−1. These rather small values indicated that a slow isomerization step follows the initial collision interaction between the Mg2+-bound Na,K-ATPase (denoted E for simplicity) and metal fluoride (MeF), shown in Reaction Scheme I,in which KMeF is the MeF dissociation constant. In Fig. 5 the observed rate constant, kobs, for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by increasing concentrations of BeSO4, AlCl3, and AlCl3 + ADP (1 mm) all in the presence of 5 mm NaF are shown. The concentrations of BeSO4 and AlCl3 were converted to concentrations of the metal fluoride complexes BeF3− and AlF4− as estimated to comprise ∼70 and 60% of the total metal fluoride complexes in the presence of 5 mm fluoride (24Goldstein G. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 243-244Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The relation between the rate of inhibition and concentration of MgCl2 in the presence of 5 mm NaF could not be measured accurately because of very low kobs of this reaction. As seen kobs was a hyperbolic function of the metal fluoride concentration in accordance with Reaction Scheme I, and not linear as expected for a one-step reaction. According to this reaction the following analytical expression, Equation 4, for the observed rate constant is given.kobs−k2[MeF]KMef+[MeF]+k−2(Eq. 4) Using this equation to fit the data shown in Figs. 5A-C KMeF, k2, and k−2 were found. Thus k−2 is the intercept with the y axis, and kobs at saturating metal fluoride concentration equals k−2+k2. The dissociation constants for BeF3−, AlF4−, and AlF4−·ADP at pH 7.5 found from the fits were: 358 μm, 149 μm, and 218 μm, respectively. As indicated all values of KMeF were significantly larger than the half-saturation inhibitor constants (Ki) calculated from equilibrium measurements of metal fluoride inhibition of enzyme activity shown in Fig. 2. This is expected, since KMeF will be larger than Ki by a factor of (k2 + k−2)/k−2 as indicated by the reaction given in scheme I. Taking this into account the calculated K0.5 (Ki) values at pH 7.5 became 9 μm for BeF3−, 17 μm for AlF4−, and 26 μm in the case of AlF4−·ADP, in reasonable agreement with the measured Ki value given in Fig. 2 given the uncertainty in the estimation of k−2.FIGURE 4Time course of NaF inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity at increasing NaF-concentration and a constant MgCl2 concentration of 5 mm at pH 7.5.

In Fig. 6A the PK cleavage patterns of enzyme stabilized by the various fluoride analogues of phosphate are shown and compared with the cleavage pattern of E2P produced by phosphorylation of the enzyme with MgPi. As seen the PK cleavage patterns for E·BeFx and E·MgPi (lanes 3 and 5) were very similar. In both cases a clear band with approximately molecular mass of 95 kDa was observed, which is missing or much weaker in all other conditions. This band is probably equivalent to the p95 band in SERCA obtained after PK cleavage in the absence of Ca2+ arising from cleavage at L119/K120 (25Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. de Gracia A. Denoroy L.

In shark Na,K-ATPase this cleavage site is equivalent to F161/K162 positioned at a similar short helix (M2′) in the connection between M2 and the A-domain (as in SERCA), and previously demonstrated to be a trypsin cleavage site exposed by ouabain binding (27Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10056-10065Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cleavage pattern of E·MgFx and E·AlFx appeared similar, both lacking the 95 kDa band, although the α subunit seemed to be somewhat protected from PK cleavage by AlFx. In Fig. 6 (panels B and C) the time course of PK cleavage of BeFx- and AlFx-treated enzyme is shown. As seen AlFx protected completely the cleavage site producing the 95 kDa band. In the presence of ADP (panel A, lanes 6 and 7) the PK cleavage pattern of enzyme treated with AlFx or MgPi changed, the band migrating at ∼55 kDa was much more prominent than in all other cleavage patterns, whereas the 30 kDa band was weaker. The latter band probably arises from secondary cleavage of the 55 kDa band (see panels B and C) and Edman degradation analysis indicated an N-terminal sequence 376DKTG that could be recognized in the shark Na,K-ATPase sequence as corresponding to the phosphorylation site indicating cleavage at S375 just next to the aspartate D376, the residue phosphorylated. Thus, this fragment seems to be equivalent to the p30 fragment in the PK cleavage of SERCA, which has a cleavage site at S350 immediately before the phosphorylation site and results from secondary cleavage of a p54 fragment containing M3/M4 together with a large part of the cytoplasmic phosphorylation domain (25Juul B.

https://openalex.org/W2055298953,"Checkpoint recovery upon completion of DNA repair allows the cell to return to normal cell cycle progression and is thus a crucial process that determines cell fate after DNA damage. We previously studied this process in Xenopus egg extracts and established Greatwall (Gwl) as an important regulator. Here we show that preactivated Gwl kinase can promote checkpoint recovery independently of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) or Plx1 (Xenopus polo-like kinase 1), whereas depletion of Gwl from extracts exhibits no synergy with that of Plx1 in delaying checkpoint recovery, suggesting a distinct but related relationship between Gwl and Plx1. In further revealing their functional relationship, we found mutual dependence for activation of Gwl and Plx1 during checkpoint recovery, as well as their direct association. We characterized the protein association in detail and recapitulated it in vitro with purified proteins, which suggests direct interaction. Interestingly, Gwl interaction with Plx1 and its phosphorylation by Plx1 both increase at the stage of checkpoint recovery. More importantly, Plx1-mediated phosphorylation renders Gwl more efficient in promoting checkpoint recovery, suggesting a functional involvement of such regulation in the recovery process. Finally, we report an indirect regulatory mechanism involving Aurora A that may account for Gwl-dependent regulation of Plx1 during checkpoint recovery. Our results thus reveal novel mechanisms underlying the involvement of Gwl in checkpoint recovery, in particular, its functional relationship with Plx1, a well characterized regulator of checkpoint recovery. Coordinated interplays between Plx1 and Gwl are required for reactivation of these kinases from the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and efficient checkpoint recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2026496519,"The stress-inducible transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-κB induces genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis. Aberrant NF-κB activity is common in cancer and contributes to therapeutic-resistance. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated during DNA strand break repair and is a known transcriptional co-regulator. Here, we investigated the role of PARP-1 function during NF-κB activation using p65 small interfering RNA (siRNA), PARP siRNA or the potent PARP-1 inhibitor, AG-014699. Survival and apoptosis assays showed that NF-κB p65−/− cells were more sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) than p65+/+ cells. Co-incubation with p65 siRNA, PARP siRNA or AG-014699 radio-sensitized p65+/+, but not p65−/− cells, demonstrating that PARP-1 mediates its effects on survival via NF-κB. Single-strand break (SSB) repair kinetics, and the effect SSB repair inhibition by AG-014699 were similar in p65+/+ and p65−/− cells. As preventing SSB repair did not radio-sensitize p65−/− cells, we conclude that radio-sensitization by AG-014699 is due to downstream inhibition of NF-κB activation, and independent of SSB repair inhibition. PARP-1 catalytic activity was essential for IR-induced p65 DNA binding and NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, whereas for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-treated cells, PARP-1 protein alone was sufficient. We hypothesize that this stimulus-dependent differential is mediated via stimulation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymer, which was induced following IR, not TNF-α. Targeting DNA damage-activated NF-κB using AG-014699 may therefore overcome toxicity observed with classical NF-κB inhibitors without compromising other vital inflammatory functions. These data highlight the potential of PARP-1 inhibitors to overcome NF-κB-mediated therapeutic resistance and widens the spectrum of cancers in which these agents may be utilized."

DYS R11–15 displays an amphiphilic character at the liquid/air interface while maintaining its secondary α-helical structure. The interaction of DYS R11–15 with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) depends on the lipid nature, which is not the case with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). In addition, switching from anionic SUVs to anionic LUVs suggests the lipid packing as a crucial factor for the interaction of protein and lipid. The monolayer model and the modulation of surface pressure aim to mimic the muscle at work (i.e. dynamic changes of muscle membrane during contraction and relaxation) (high and low surface pressure). Strikingly, the lateral pressure modifies the protein organization. Increasing the lateral pressure leads the proteins to be organized in a regular network. Nevertheless, a different protein conformation after its binding to monolayer is revealed by trypsin proteolysis. Label-free quantification by nano-LC/MS/MS allowed identification of the helices in repeats 12 and 13 involved in the interaction with anionic SUVs.

RanGTP binding increases the affinity of CRM1 for NESs. In the absence of RanGTP, the CRM1 C-terminal helix, together with the HEAT repeat 9 loop, modulates its affinity for NESs.

Small angle x-ray scattering indicates that the increased affinity for NESs generated by mutations in the C-terminal helix is not associated with large scale changes in CRM1 conformation, consistent with the modulation of NES affinity being mediated by a local change in CRM1 near the NES binding site. These data also suggest that in the absence of RanGTP, the C-terminal helix lies across the CRM1 toroid in a position similar to that seen in the CRM1-Snurportin crystal structure.

Detailed structural studies of CRM1 with a range of different NESs bound has established a consensus for NESs and accounted for how CRM1 is able to recognize the range of different NESs observed (12Güttler T.

Because the binding and release of NESs in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, is critical for nuclear protein export, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which the affinity of CRM1 for NESs is modulated. In the nucleus when RanGTP is bound, CRM1 has a higher affinity for NESs than in the cytoplasm when Ran has been removed. This change in affinity could be due to changes in the positions of the A-helices of HEAT repeats 11 and 12 that result from a contribution of local changes induced via an autoinhibitory mechanism of the HEAT 9 loop proposed by Koyama and Matsuura (11Koyama M. Matsuura Y. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and/or a larger, global change in CRM1 conformation as proposed by Dong et al. (13Dong X. Biswas A. Chook Y.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Monecke et al. (10Monecke T. Güttler T. Neumann P. Dickmanns A. Görlich D. Ficner R. Science. 2009; 324: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of the HEAT 9 loop in modulating the affinity of CRM1 for NESs, the C-terminal helix also influences NES binding. Although in the absence of RanGTP full-length CRM1 has weak affinity for NESs, deletion of the C-terminal helix increases this affinity to a level that, in pulldown binding studies, appeared comparable with that seen in the presence of RanGTP (13Dong X. Biswas A. Chook Y.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we use a combination of mutagenesis and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate the role of the C-terminal helix in greater detail and show that charged residues at its extreme C terminus are critical to its influence on the affinity of CRM1 for NESs. Deleting the last 9 residues of mouse CRM1 or mutating to alanine either the acidic residues in this region or a cluster of positive residues in the B-helix of HEAT repeat 12 (Lys-594, Arg-596, and Arg-597) increased the affinity of CRM1 for the PKI NES. Moreover, the behavior of a variant in which the charges of both clusters were reversed reverted to the affinity seen with wild type CRM1. SAXS indicated that the C-terminal helix was positioned across the CRM1 toroid and that none of the engineered variants generated a substantial conformational change in the molecule. Based on these results, we propose a model in which the C-terminal helix and the HEAT loop 9 induce local conformational changes that stabilize the closed conformation of the CRM1 NES binding site, which contributes to the release of NES-containing cargoes into the cytoplasm following the removal of Ran and to preventing the return of cargoes to the nucleus. S. cerevisiae Xpo1p was expressed from the pET30TB plasmid (a derivative of pET30a-TEV in which the BamHI site in the TEV sequence has been removed) that adds a His6-S tag followed by a TEV cleavage site to the N terminus (14Matsuura Y.

Mouse CRM1 was expressed as a TEV-cleavable His6-ZZ-tagged construct in a derivative of a pQE80 vector that was obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Dirk Görlich (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). Mutations in CRM1/Xpo1p were introduced via overlapping PCRs with mutagenic primers using the Herculase II fusion system (Stratagene). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium (15Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar). A single colony of BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells that had been transformed with the desired plasmid was used to inoculate a starter culture of 10 ml of LB medium (that contained either 100 ng/ml ampicillin or 25 ng/ml kanamycin as appropriate). The culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm, and was used to inoculate a large-scale 1-liter culture the following morning. Large scale cultures were grown in 2-liter conical flasks that contained ∼1 liter of ZYM-5052 medium. To prepare the final media, a stock of ∼1 liter of ZY medium (10 g of N-Z-amine AS and 5 g of yeast extract dissolved in 1 liter of MilliQ water) was supplemented with 20 ml of 50× 5052 solution (25% (w/v) glycerol, 2.5% (w/v) glucose, and 10% (w/v) α-lactose monohydrate), 20 ml of 50× M solution (1.25 m Na2HPO4, 1.25 m KH2PO4, 2.5 m NH4Cl, and 0.25 m Na2SO4), 2 ml of 1 m MgSO4, and 100 mg of either ampicillin or kanamycin as appropriate. Stocks of the 50× 5052 and 50× M solutions were sterile filtered and stored at 4 °C. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm, for ∼6 h that allowed growth to an A600 ∼ 0.5, at which point the temperature was lowered to 20 °C for a further 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at ∼4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cell pellets were stored at −20 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed at room temperature and resuspended in 10 ml of the appropriate lysis buffer per cell pellet from 1 liter of culture. A CompleteTM Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) was added and dissolved in the lysis mixture. Cell lysis was carried out by high pressure cavitation using an EmulsiFlex C5 homogenizer (Avestin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were purified using a standard Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) affinity purification protocol. Buffers typically contained 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, to prevent nonspecific binding of contaminant proteins. Clarified lysate containing soluble His6-tagged protein was mixed with the Ni-NTA resin and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The resin was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 50 ml of binding buffer. Purified protein was eluted from the resin using binding buffer that contained at least 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. All of the protein constructs used in this work contained a tobacco etch mosaic virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. TEV cleavage was typically conducted overnight at 4 °C using a His6-tagged S219V variant of TEV that is less prone to autocatalysis and is more active at cold temperatures than wild type TEV protease (16Kapust R.B. Tözsér J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Following TEV cleavage, His6 tags and the His6-TEV S129V were removed from cleavage mixtures by a second incubation with fresh Ni-NTA resin. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out as a final protein purification step to remove contaminating proteins and CRM1 oligomers using a HiLoad Superdex 200 26/60 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, and those that contained the target protein of sufficient purity (>95%) were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon-Ultra 15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were concentrated to at least 50 mg/ml and stored at either 4 °C for immediate use or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for longer term use at −80 °C. His-tagged-YFP-PKI-NES was prepared as described (11Koyama M. Matsuura Y. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pulldown assays were used to assess the binding between proteins by immobilizing one protein on affinity resin via its affinity purification tag. A small aliquot (∼100 μl) of affinity resin (Ni-NTA or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare)) was washed with binding buffer (typically 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT). The protein that would act as bait in the binding assay was then loaded onto the beads. Either clarified lysate (∼0.5 ml) or purified protein was added to the resin and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. For GST pulldowns, a negative control was conducted in parallel by performing the assay on resin loaded with GST protein alone. For Ni-NTA pulldowns, resin without bait protein was used as a negative control for nonspecific binding to the beads. After incubation, beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 3 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer to remove excess bait protein. The prey proteins were added to the resin (in quantities that provided a molar excess to the bait protein), and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Unbound fractions were removed, and the resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. After the final wash step, the beads were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye and boiled at 95 °C to release bound proteins from the beads. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The binding of increasing concentrations of wild type and mutant CRM1 protein to 10–50 nm YFP-PKI-NES fusion protein (11Koyama M. Matsuura Y. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was measured by fluorescence anisotropy at 25 °C using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorimeter equipped with a Hamilton Microlab titrator controlled by laboratory software. The reaction was followed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 507 and 526 nm, respectively, were used with both excitation and emission slits set at 5 nm. Using a single-site binding model, the data were fitted to the equation, F=F0+(F1-F0){([PT]+[LT]+Kd)-([PT]+[LT]+KD)2-4[PT][LT]}2[PT](Eq. 1) where F0 and F1 are the anisotropy in the absence of titrating protein and at saturation, respectively; [LT] and [PT] are the total concentrations of protein and YFP-NES, respectively; and Kd is the dissociation constant. The fraction of YFP-NES bound at each concentration of titratant, fb, was calculated using the fitted constants from the equation above using the following. fb=F-F0F1-F0(Eq. 2) The CRM1 variants gave excellent binding isotherms that were fitted well by the model (supplemental Fig. S1). However, low (∼15 μm) affinity of wild type CRM1 for the YFP-NES precluded our being able to attain saturation, which was taken to be the same as that observed for the variants. SAXS data were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline ID14-3 using a fixed wavelength of 0.931 Å. CRM1 or Xpo1p samples were diluted with the original gel filtration buffers to make a series of protein concentrations. The signal from protein scattering was collected in conjunction with a buffer sample measurement taken before and after each protein sample. For mouse CRM1, the detector was a Pilatus 1 m (Dectris), and the sample to the detector distance was 2.425 m. The momentum transfer range measured was 0.05 < s < 6 nm−1. The samples were exposed for 10 frames of 10 s each. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae Xpo1p, the detector was a VÅNTEC-2000 (Bruker AXS Ltd.), and the sample to the detector distance was 1.668 m. The momentum transfer range measured was 0.05 < s < 6 nm−1. The samples were exposed for 10 frames of 30 s each. SAXS data were analyzed using the PRIMUS software suite (17Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Each protein sample frame was inspected for radiation damage, and frames that contained significant damage were omitted. The buffer data were averaged from before and after the protein sample and subtracted from the merged protein dataset to provide a final curve for that protein concentration. The radius of gyration, Rg, was calculated from the slope of the Guinier region with output from the AUTORG program used as a guide to the best data range for this measurement. The pair distribution function, p(r), was calculated using the program GNOM that performs an indirect Fourier transform. An initial estimate of the Dmax was provided to GNOM, and the program was run several times to determine the best Dmax based on the shape of the p(r) function. The program CRYSOL was used to provide a direct comparison between the calculated scattering profile from a given Protein Data Bank coordinate file and an experimental SAXS profile (18Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). CRYSOL calculates the scattering, taking into account the hydration shell of the particle. It has been shown that no two unique protein structures have identical calculated scattering profiles (19Sokolova A.V. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 865-868Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The final output provides a χ2 value to give a measure of the goodness of fit between the calculated and experimental scattering curves. Deletion of the C-terminal 44 residues of human CRM1 (that correspond to the C-terminal helix) has been shown to increase its affinity for NESs in the absence of RanGTP, which, in pulldown binding studies, appeared to be of a level comparable with that of wild type CRM1 in the presence of RanGTP (13Dong X. Biswas A. Chook Y.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of CRM1 from several species shows a strongly conserved pattern within the residues at the distal tip of the C-terminal helix, whereby a single basic residue is followed by a series of acidic residues (Fig. 1). In CRM1 from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Xenopus laevis, there are four acidic residues, but the precise number can vary between three (in S. cerevisiae) and six (in Caenorhabditis elegans). Because there is no electron density corresponding to these acidic residues in any of the current crystal structures of CRM1 or Xpo1p, these residues are not present in any of the structural models (9Dong X. Biswas A. Süel K.E. Jackson L.K. Martinez R. Gu H. Chook Y.M. Nature. 2009; 458: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Monecke T. Güttler T. Neumann P. Dickmanns A. Görlich D.

In the crystal structure of the human CRM1-Snurportin complex (9Dong X. Biswas A. Süel K.E. Jackson L.K. Martinez R. Gu H. Chook Y.M. Nature. 2009; 458: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the C-terminal helix lies across the central cavity of the toroid, bringing the distal tip residues of the helix near to HEAT repeats 11 and 12. These HEAT repeats also form the primary binding site for NESs in a groove formed between their A-helices. The role of the acidic residues at the tip of the CRM1 C-terminal helix in modulating the affinity of CRM1 for NESs was probed using a series of deletion variants, which were evaluated for their affinity for immobilized GST-PKI NES (Fig. 2). Because it could be expressed to higher levels and appeared not to aggregate so extensively in solution, we employed mouse CRM1 rather than the human CRM1 employed previously (9Dong X. Biswas A. Süel K.E. Jackson L.K. Martinez R. Gu H. Chook Y.M. Nature. 2009; 458: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The sequences of these proteins are identical in the final 10 residues of the C-terminal helix (Fig. 1). CRM1 variants were generated in which the entire C-terminal helix was deleted (CRM1-1–1027; as in Dong et al. (13Dong X. Biswas A. Chook Y.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)); the distal half was deleted (CRM1-1–1040) so that it retained the base of the C-terminal helix, which in the CRM1-Snurportin-RanGTP (10Monecke T. Güttler T. Neumann P. Dickmanns A. Görlich D. Ficner R. Science. 2009; 324: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) ternary complex makes contacts with residues in the inter-repeat loops of N-terminal HEAT repeats 3 and 4, or in which the last nine residues, that include the conserved acidic residues, were deleted (CRM1-1–1062). A CRM1 variant (CRM1-tipA) in which the charged residues of the final nine residues of CRM1 were replaced with alanines was also tested. All four of these mouse CRM1 variants bound the PKI NES with a higher affinity than wild type CRM1 (Fig. 2). Determination of binding constants using fluorescence anisotropy (Table 1) indicated that although deleting the entire C-terminal helix produced a larger increase in affinity for the PKI NES, simply removing the negative charge from the tip of the C-terminal helix caused over a 10-fold increase in affinity, consistent with the charged residues at the tip making a substantial contribution to the influence of the C-terminal helix on the affinity of CRM1 for NESs.TABLE 1Affinity of CRM1 and variants for YFP-PKI-NES determined using fluorescence anisotropyCRM1 proteinKdΔΔGμmkcal/molWild-type15.6 ± 2.31–10621.7 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.2VLV > AAA0.20 ± 0.032.6 ± 0.21–10270.30 ± 0.052.3 ± 0.21–1062 + VLV > AAA0.025 ± 0.0023.8 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab The important contribution to modulation of the affinity of CRM1 for the PKI NES made by the highly conserved patch of acidic residues at the tip of the C-terminal helix suggested that complementary positively charged residues on CRM1 might mediate an electrostatic interaction with this cluster. Examination of the electrostatic potential of the inner surface of CRM1 in the structure of the human CRM1-Snurportin complex (9Dong X. Biswas A. Süel K.E. Jackson L.K. Martinez R. Gu H. Chook Y.M. Nature. 2009; 458: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), showed a basic patch located directly adjacent to where the C-terminal helix terminates (Fig. 3A). This patch is formed by a series of conserved basic residues, which sit at the ends of the B-helices of HEAT repeats 11 and 12 that are closest to the end of the C-terminal helix (Figs. 3B and 4). These conserved residues are Arg-553 and Arg-556 of HEAT 11B and Lys-594, Arg-596, and Arg-597 of HEAT 12B. Lys-590 is also conserved and has been shown to bind to residue Glu-429 from the HEAT 9 loop in the Xpo1p-RanGTP-RanBP1 crystal structure (11Koyama M. Matsuura Y. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the mouse CRM1-Snurportin-RanGTP structure (10Monecke T. Güttler T. Neumann P. Dickmanns A. Görlich D. Ficner R. Science. 2009; 324: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Lys-590 binds to Glu-428 of the HEAT 9 loop rather than Glu-429, which instead binds to Tyr-155 of RanGTP. The proximity of the acidic C-terminal helix tip to the conserved basic patch located on the HEAT 11/12 B helices was consistent with an electrostatic interaction between these two sets of residues having the potential to contribute to the influence of the C-terminal helix of CRM1 on its affinity for NESs in the absence of RanGTP.FIGURE 4Conserved basic residues on HEAT 11B/12B of CRM1. The conserved basic residues (Arg-553, Arg-556, Lys-590, Lys-594, Arg-596, and Arg-597) shown in dark blue lie at the end of the HEAT 11B/12B helices closest to the end of the C-terminal helix (as modeled by Dong et al.

https://openalex.org/W2084825244,"Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3 (Oaz3) is expressed in spermatids, makes up the antizyme family of Oaz genes with Oaz1 and Oaz2, and was proposed to encode a 22 kDa antizyme protein involved in polyamine regulation similar to the 22 kDa OAZ1 and OAZ2 proteins. Here we demonstrate however that the major product encoded by Oaz3 is a 12 kDa protein, p12, which lacks the antizyme domain that interacts with ornithine decarboxylase. We show that p12 does not affect ornithine decarboxylase levels, providing an explanation for the surprising observation made in Oaz3 knock-out male mice, which do not display altered testis polyamine metabolism. This suggested a novel activity for Oaz3 p12. Using immuno-electron microscopy we localized p12 to two structures in the mammalian sperm tail, viz. the outer dense fibers and fibrous sheath, as well as to the connecting piece linking head and tail. We identified myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 3 (MYPT3), a regulator of protein phosphatase PP1β, as a major p12-interacting protein, and show that MYPT3 is present in sperm tails and that its ankyrin repeat binds p12. We show that MYPT3 can also bind protein phosphatase PP1γ2, the only protein phosphatase present in sperm tails, and that p12- MYPT3 interaction modulates the activity of both PP1β and PP1γ2. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a novel activity for an Oaz-encoded protein."
https://openalex.org/W2032446627,"Chromosomal replication is initiated from the replication origin oriC in Escherichia coli by the active ATP-bound form of DnaA protein. The regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA) system, a complex of the ADP-bound Hda and the DNA-loaded replicase clamp, represses extra initiations by facilitating DnaA-bound ATP hydrolysis, yielding the inactive ADP-bound form of DnaA. However, the mechanisms involved in promoting the DnaA-Hda interaction have not been determined except for the involvement of an interaction between the AAA+ domains of the two. This study revealed that DnaA Leu-422 and Pro-423 residues within DnaA domain IV, including a typical DNA-binding HTH motif, are specifically required for RIDA-dependent ATP hydrolysis in vitro and that these residues support efficient interaction with the DNA-loaded clamp·Hda complex and with Hda in vitro. Consistently, substitutions of these residues caused accumulation of ATP-bound DnaA in vivo and oriC-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Leu-422 plays a more important role in these activities than Pro-423. By contrast, neither of these residues is crucial for DNA replication from oriC, although they are highly conserved in DnaA orthologues. Structural analysis of a DnaA·Hda complex model suggested that these residues make contact with residues in the vicinity of the Hda AAA+ sensor I that participates in formation of a nucleotide-interacting surface. Together, the results show that functional DnaA-Hda interactions require a second interaction site within DnaA domain IV in addition to the AAA+ domain and suggest that these interactions are crucial for the formation of RIDA complexes that are active for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2037932554,"Renin is essential for blood pressure control. Renin is stored in granules in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, located in the pole of the renal afferent arterioles. The second messenger cAMP stimulates renin release. However, it is unclear whether fusion and exocytosis of renin-containing granules is involved. In addition, the role of the fusion proteins, SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins), in renin release from JG cells has not been studied. The vesicle SNARE proteins VAMP2 (vesicle associated membrane protein 2) and VAMP3 mediate cAMP-stimulated exocytosis in other endocrine cells. Thus, we hypothesized that VAMP2 and/or -3 mediate cAMP-stimulated renin release from JG cells. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we isolated JG cells expressing green fluorescent protein and compared the relative abundance of VAMP2/3 in JG cells versus total mouse kidney mRNA by quantitative PCR. We found that VAMP2 and VAMP3 mRNA are expressed and enriched in JG cells. Confocal imaging of primary cultures of JG cells showed that VAMP2 (but not VAMP3) co-localized with renin-containing granules. Cleavage of VAMP2 and VAMP3 with tetanus toxin blocked cAMP-stimulated renin release from JG cells by ~50% and impaired cAMP-stimulated exocytosis by ~50%, as monitored with FM1-43. Then we specifically knocked down VAMP2 or VAMP3 by adenoviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin silencing RNA. We found that silencing VAMP2 blocked cAMP-induced renin release by ~50%. In contrast, silencing VAMP3 had no effect on basal or cAMP-stimulated renin release. We conclude that VAMP2 and VAMP3 are expressed in JG cells, but only VAMP2 is targeted to renin-containing granules and mediates the stimulatory effect of cAMP on renin exocytosis."

This paper investigates the regulation of IRAK-1 degradation in primary hepatocytes and in HEK cells overexpressing the IL-1β receptor. We provide evidence that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a negative regulator of the phosphorylation, Lys48-linked ubiquitination, and degradation of IRAK-1. PP2A catalytic activity increased within 30 min of stimulation with IL-1β. siRNA against PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) or treatment with pharmacological inhibitor, okadaic acid, enhanced IRAK-1 Lys48-linked ubiquitination and degradation. Direct interaction between PP2Ac and IRAK-1 was observed, suggesting that IRAK-1 might be a PP2A substrate. The mechanisms of PP2A activation by IL-1β involved neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSMase-2) and an accumulation of ceramide. Overexpression of NSMase-2 delayed IRAK-1 degradation in a PP2A-dependent manner, whereas NSMase-2 silencing had the opposite effect. The addition of sphingomyelinase, ceramide, or a proteasome inhibitor all led to retention of IRAK-1 at the cell membrane and to increased JNK phosphorylation.

The serine-threonine protein kinase Akt binds to PI(3,4,5)P3, resulting in its activation. Active Akt promotes spatially regulated actin cytoskeletal remodeling and thereby directed cell migration. The inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-ptases) degrade PI(3,4,5)P3 to form PI(3,4)P2, which leads to diminished Akt activation. Several 5-ptases, including SKIP and SHIP2, inhibit actin cytoskeletal reorganization by opposing PI3K/Akt signaling. In this current study, we identify a molecular co-chaperone termed silencer of death domains (SODD/BAG4) that forms a complex with several 5-ptase family members, including SKIP, SHIP1, and SHIP2. The interaction between SODD and SKIP exerts an inhibitory effect on SKIP PI(3,4,5)P3 5-ptase catalytic activity and consequently enhances the recruitment of PI(3,4,5)P3-effectors to the plasma membrane. In contrast, SODD−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit reduced Akt-Ser473 and -Thr308 phosphorylation following EGF stimulation, associated with increased SKIP PI(3,4,5)P3-5-ptase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2083064154,"Trask/CDCP1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in epithelial tissues whose functions are just beginning to be understood, but include a role as an anti-adhesive effector of Src kinases. Early studies looking at RNA transcript levels seemed to suggest overexpression in some cancers, but immunostaining studies are now providing more accurate analyses of its expression. In an immuno-histochemical survey of human cancer specimens, we find that Trask expression is retained, reduced or sometimes lost in some tumors compared with their normal epithelial tissue counterparts. A survey of human cancer cell lines also show a similar wide variation in the expression of Trask, including some cell types with the loss of Trask expression, and additional cell types that have lost the physiological detachment-induced phosphorylation of Trask. Three experimental models were established to interrogate the role of Trask in tumor progression, including two gain-of-function models with tet-inducible expression of Trask in tumor cells lacking Trask expression, and one loss-of-function model to suppress Trask expression in tumor cells with abundant Trask expression. The induction of Trask expression and phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells and in 3T3v-src cells was associated with a reduction in tumor metastases while the shRNA-induced knockdown of Trask in L3.6pl cancer cells was associated with increased tumor metastases. The results from these three models are consistent with a tumor-suppressing role for Trask. These data identify Trask as one of several potential candidates for functionally relevant tumor suppressors on the 3p21.3 region of the genome frequently lost in human cancers."

Here we have characterized the interaction between ezrin and Dbl. We show that binding of Dbl with ezrin involves positively charged amino acids within the region of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain comprised between β1 and β2 sheets. In addition, we show that Dbl forms a complex with the tuberous sclerosis-1 (TSC-1) gene product hamartin and with ezrin. We demonstrate that hamartin and ezrin are both required for activation of Dbl. In fact, the knock-down of ezrin and hamartin, as well as the expression of a mutant hamartin, unable to bind ezrin, inhibit Dbl transforming and exchange activity. These results suggest that Dbl is regulated by hamartin through association with ezrin.

Thus Rho, upon activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, may act as an upstream activator of ERMs. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that ERM proteins can act as upstream regulators of Rho GTPases by binding to the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). This association is thought to displace RhoGDI from Rho GTPases, allowing them to be activated by their specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (2Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In this regard, a functional dependence of Rho GEFs on ezrin has been shown (27Tran Quang C. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the association of ERM proteins with Rho GEF Dbl has been demonstrated (28Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Hotta I. Takaishi K.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4098-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, association of ezrin with a novel GEF that activates the small GTPase RhoG has been reported (8D'Angelo R. Aresta S. Blangy A. Del Maestro L. Louvard D. Arpin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4780-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERM proteins may act as upstream activators of Rho GTPases not only through their association with Rho GDI but also through their interaction with Rho GEFs. Link between ERM proteins and the GTP-binding protein Rho has also been reported by Lamb et al. (31Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), who provided evidence that activation of Rho by ERM proteins requires the interaction of the TSC-1 gene product hamartin with ERM proteins. In their model ERM proteins are first activated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and serum, allowing hamartin to associate with the ERM N-terminal domain, causing the subsequent activation of Rho through the N-terminal domain of hamartin by an unknown mechanism. Activation of Rho, in response to LPA, is thought to involve stimulation of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G12/G13 proteins that act on a family of highly related Rho-specific GEFs, including p115-RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG (32Hart M.J.

Moreover, we have shown that activated Gα13 induces activation of the GEF Dbl stimulating its association with ezrin (14Vanni C. Mancini P. Ottaviano C. Ognibene M. Parodi A. Merello E. Russo C. Varesio L. Zheng Y. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2058-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two mechanisms by which Rho acts both upstream and downstream of ERM proteins are compatible with a system that creates a positive feedback loop which promotes activation of Rho by ERM association with hamartin and/or by inhibition of Rho GDI. In this study, we further characterized the interaction of the Rho GEF Dbl with ezrin. We show here that interaction of ezrin with a specific region of Dbl PH domain is necessary for Dbl-induced cell transformation and activation of Cdc42 and Rac GTPases. We also show that hamartin binds to Dbl, stimulating ezrin-Dbl interaction and Dbl activity. Finally, we show that knock-out of both ezrin and hamartin inhibit Dbl activity. Our results indicate that ezrin and hamartin work in concert to activate the Rho GEF Dbl. pCEFL-GST-onco-Dbl, pCEFL-GST-PH, and pCEFL-GST-DH constructs were previously described (35Russo C. Gao Y.

The pLVX-DsRed-Monomer-C1 vector (Clontech-Mountain View) was utilized to obtain a lentiviral construct expressing Dbl conjugated with a red fluorescent protein. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced in HEK-293T cells using the Lenti-X Lentiviral Expression kit (Clontech-Mountain View) as described by the manufacturer. MEF cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing the Dbl product fused to the red fluorescent protein (Red-Dbl) or the red fluorescent protein alone (Red) in the presence of 10 μg/ml of polybrene. The GST-PAK-CRIB domain fusion protein (residues 56–141) containing the Cdc42 and Rac binding region of human PAK1, was expressed and purified as described previously (39Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

MEF-WT and MEF-KO were infected with Red-Dbl or the Red recombinant lentiviruses, plated onto glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by treatment with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 20 min at 25 °C, and with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for additional 5 min at 25 °C to allow permeabilization. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with anti-ezrin monoclonal antiboby (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Alexa Fluor 350-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 25 °C, and for 1 h at 25 °C with anti-hamartin polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Organon Teknica Corp.) for 30 min at 25 °C. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem) for observation. Fluorescence signals were analyzed by recording and merging stained images using an ApoTome system (Zeiss-Ober Kochen, Germany), connected with an Axio Observer inverted microscope (Zeiss), and Axiovision software (Zeiss). We have previously demonstrated that ezrin binds through its N-terminal region to Dbl pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (30Vanni C. Parodi A. Mancini P. Visco V. Ottaviano C. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4098-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To map the binding site of ezrin on Dbl PH domain we fused to pCEFL-GST expression vector six different fragments of the DH-PH domain carrying progressive truncations (Fig. 1A). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with each construct. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot with anti-GST antibody to verify the proper expression of each mutant protein (Fig. 1B). To assess the ability of each truncated Dbl products to bind ezrin COS7 cells were transfected with each of these constructs or with onco-Dbl and the coimmunoprecipitation pattern of Dbl proteins with ezrin was determined by anti-GST immunoprecipitation and anti-ezrin Western blot. All the Dbl products truncated up to residue 724 formed a stable complex with ezrin (Fig. 2A) indicating that the binding site for ezrin is located upstream of residue 724. In fact, binding of Dbl with ezrin was strongly reduced when the construct DH-PH VI, truncated up to residue 710, was used. Therefore the stretch of amino acids between residues 704 and 724 represents the binding site for ezrin. It has been reported that different ERM substrates contain positively charged amino acids in their binding sites (1Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 40Stanasila L. Abuin L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To assess whether positively charged amino acids are involved in Dbl binding to ezrin, we generated four DH-PH fragments containing 2, 3, 5, and 7 substitutions of positively charged amino acids with neutral ones (Fig. 1A). Each fragment was subcloned into pCEFL-GST vector and transiently transfected in COS7 cells. Expression of the mutant proteins was verified by anti-GST Western blot (Fig. 1B). COS7 cells were transfected with each DH-PH mutant constructs or with onco-Dbl, and cell lysates were subjected to an in vivo binding assay by anti-GST immunoprecipitation and anti-ezrin Western blot. While up to three mutations did not affect binding, five mutations strongly reduced it and the presence of seven mutations completely abolished the interaction of Dbl with ezrin (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the positively charged amino acids within residues 707 and 724 are necessary for Dbl-PH interaction with ezrin.FIGURE 2Mapping of the binding site for ezrin on Dbl PH domain. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with (A) onco-Dbl, DH-PH-I, DH-PH-II, DH-PH-III, DH-PH-IV, DH-PH-V, or DH-PH-VI and with (B) onco-Dbl, DH-PH-2M, DH-PH-3M, DH-PH-5M, or DH-PH-7M.

Gautreau A. Arpin M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further evaluated the effects of ezrin on Dbl activity by using silencing RNA approach to determine whether Dbl-mediated activation of Cdc42 and Rac is dependent on a functional ezrin. NIH-3T3 cells were stably cotransfected with onco-Dbl and a retroviral construct expressing an antisense RNA targeted against ezrin (sh-ezrin) or with a retroviral construct expressing a non-silencing control RNA (sh-ns). Stable mass cultures were generated by double selection with G418 and puromycin. We achieved a knockdown of ezrin of ∼75% (Fig. 3A). Transfected cells were harvested 18 h after incubation in serum-free medium and the active Cdc42 and Rac were collected on GST-PAK-CRIB domain. As shown in Fig. 3B, knockdown of ezrin reduced the ability of Dbl to activate both Rac and Cdc42 by ∼60% (Fig. 3C), indicating that activation of these GTPases by Dbl is dependent on ezrin. We then evaluated whether Dbl-induced serine-threonine kinase activation is dependent on ezrin expression. NIH-3T3 cells cotransfected with onco-Dbl and sh-ezrin or sh-ns were lysed after 18 h incubation in serum-free medium. p38 and JNK activation was then determined by Western blot with phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the activation of both p38 and JNK in cells depleted of ezrin was reduced by ∼50 and ∼60%, respectively. No significant inhibition of Rac, Cdc42, p38, and JNK activation was observed when cells were cotransfected with onco-Dbl and sh-ns constructs. These results were confirmed by performing similar experiments on MEF-WT and MEF-KO transiently transfected with onco-Dbl and harvested 18 h after incubation in serum-free medium. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, Dbl expression in MEF-WT induced ∼4.0- and ∼3.0-fold of activation of p38 and JNK, respectively, in comparison with control cells. No activation of these kinases can be detected in Dbl expressing MEF-KO. The oncogenic form of another GEF, Vav (41Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), was used as control in these experiments. Onco-Vav expression in MEF-WT induced ∼1.7- and ∼1.5-fold of activation of p38 and JNK, respectively, while no activation could be observed in MEF-KO, indicating that ezrin affects Vav activity as well. We determined the effects of the lack of ezrin on Dbl transforming activity. MEF-WT and MEF-KO were transfected with onco-Dbl and foci of transformed cells were scored 15–21 days later. As shown in Table 1, lack of ezrin expression caused the inability of Dbl to transform cells and induce foci. Overall these results indicate that expression of ezrin is critical for Dbl-induced transformation and exchange activity on Rac and Cdc42.TABLE 1Knock-down of ezrin inhibits Dbl-transforming activityMEF-WTDNAF.f.u.

We examined two ezrin-binding proteins, RhoGDI, the GDP dissociation inhibitor of Rho family proteins (2Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol.

As controls, we used the construct expressing the Dbl PH domain (Fig. 1A), that binds ezrin, or the construct expressing the DH-PH-7M that, as shown above, does not interact with ezrin. As expected, overexpression of the Dbl PH domain inhibited the binding, while overexpression of DH-PH-7M did not. Overexpression of GDI strongly reduced the formation of a stable complex between Dbl and ezrin, as revealed by the anti-Dbl Western blot of the anti-ezrin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). It has been reported that the ERM protein radixin interacts with Rho GDI displacing Dbl from radixin (28Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Hotta I. Takaishi K. Imamura H. Nakano K. Kodama A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3279-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). While a direct interaction of Dbl with radixin in vivo has not been demonstrated, we have shown that Dbl protein can effectively bind in vivo with ezrin (30Vanni C. Parodi A. Mancini P. Visco V. Ottaviano C. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4098-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, ezrin, like radixin, may sequester Rho GDI for release of GDP-bound form of the Rho family members to be converted to GTP-bound form by a Rho GEF-like Dbl. On the other hand, when FL-ham (FL) (Fig. 1, A and B) was coexpressed in COS7 cells with onco-Dbl, we observed a stimulation of the association of ezrin to hamartin (Fig. 4B). Similarly, expression of onco-Dbl alone stimulated the interaction of ezrin with endogenous hamartin (end). Moreover, a larger amount of Dbl bound to ezrin could be immunoprecipitated in the presence of overexpression of exogenous hamartin (Fig. 4B). It is possible that the overexpression of hama"
https://openalex.org/W2074324995,"The PICALM (CALM) gene, whose product is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, has been identified in two recurring chromosomal translocations, involving either MLL or MLLT10 (AF10). We developed a mouse model of CALM-AF10(+) leukemia to examine the hypothesis that disruption of endocytosis contributes to leukemogenesis. Exclusion of the C-terminal portion of CALM from the fusion protein, which is required for optimal binding to clathrin, resulted in the development of a myeloproliferative disease, whereas inclusion of this domain led to the development of acute myeloid leukemia and changes in gene expression of several cancer-related genes, notably Pim1 and Crebbp. Nonetheless, the development of leukemia could not be attributed directly to interference with endocytosis or consequential changes in proliferation and signaling. In leukemia cells, full-length CALM-AF10 localized to the nucleus with no consistent effect on growth factor endocyctosis, and suppressed histone H3 lysine 79 methylation regardless of the presence of clathrin. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we show that CALM-AF10 has a propensity to homo-oligomerize, raising the possibility that the function of endocytic proteins involved in chimeric fusions may be to provide dimerization properties, a recognized mechanism for unleashing oncogenic properties of chimeric transcription factors, rather than disrupting the internalization of growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2062656844,"In eukaryotic cells, Ca2+-triggered signaling pathways are used to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. Calcineurin, a highly conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, plays key roles in the regulation of diverse biological processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. We isolated a mutant of the SIR3 gene, implicated in the regulation of life span, as a suppressor of the Ca2+ sensitivity of zds1Δ cells in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we investigated a relationship between Ca2+ signaling and life span in yeast. Here we show that Ca2+ affected the replicative life span (RLS) of yeast. Increased external and intracellular Ca2+ levels caused a reduction in their RLS. Consistently, the increase in calcineurin activity by either the zds1 deletion or the constitutively activated calcineurin reduced RLS. Indeed, the shortened RLS of zds1Δ cells was suppressed by the calcineurin deletion. Further, the calcineurin deletion per se promoted aging without impairing the gene silencing typically observed in short-lived sir mutants, indicating that calcineurin plays an important role in a regulation of RLS even under normal growth condition. Thus, our results indicate that Ca2+ homeostasis/Ca2+ signaling are required to regulate longevity in budding yeast.
