https://openalex.org/W1992926763,"The independent growth of the various branches of the earth sciences in the past two decades has led to a divergence of geophysical, geochemical, geological, and planetological models for the composition and evolution of a terrestrial planet. Evidence for differentiation and volcanism on small planets and a magma ocean on the moon contrasts with hypotheses for a mostly primitive, still undifferentiated, and homogeneous terrestrial mantle. In comparison with the moon, the earth has an extraordinarily thin crust. The geoid, which should reflect convection in the mantle, is apparently unrelated to the current distribution of continents and oceanic ridges. If the earth is deformable, the whole mantle should wander relative to the axis of rotation, but the implications of this are seldom discussed. The proposal of a mantle rich in olivine violates expectations based on evidence from extraterrestrial sources. These and other paradoxes force a reexamination of some long-held assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2066457145,"Higher concentrations of phenolic compounds were found in the reproductive fronds (sporophylls) of the intertidal kelp Alaria marginata than were found in the vegetative blades. The sporophylls were consumed by herbivorous snails at a lower rate than were the vegetative blades, in both field and laboratory studies. These results indicate that differential internal production of defensive compounds in a marine alga can significantly affect the pattern of herbivory on the plant."

https://openalex.org/W2022512340,"The ratio of the flux density of Titan was measured in two 200-megahertz bands, one centered on the (1-0) rotation line of carbon monoxide at 115.3 gigahertz and the other 2600 megahertz lower. The measurements were made with a complex-correlation technique on the new millimeter-wavelength interferometer at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, Big Pine, California. The excess flux in the carbon monoxide band is interpreted as a strong detection of carbon monoxide and a mixing ratio, assumed constant, of 6 x 10(-5). The brightness temperature of Titan at 112.6 gigahertz is 69 +/- 10 kelvins, consistent with atmospheric emission from just below the tropopause."
https://openalex.org/W2077693506,"Earth-based telescopic observations indicate that Saturn's rings are about 1 kilometer thick, while spacecraft measurements and theoretical considerations give an upper bound of about 100 meters. Analysis of a shielding effect present in radio occultation provides a sensitive new measure of the ring thickness. On the basis of this effect, Voyager 1 microwave measurements of near-forward scatter imply a thickness ranging from less than 10 meters in ring C to about 20 and 50 meters in the Cassini division and ring A, respectively. Monolayer models do not fit the observations in the latter two regions. The discrepancy between the Earth-based and spacecraft measurements may be due to warps in the ring plane or effects of tenuous material outside the primary ring system."
https://openalex.org/W2017585108,"Recent advances in our understanding of electronic conduction have pointed up deficiencies in traditional thinking. For a metal at a sufficiently low temperature, it is known both theoretically and experimentally that the conventional picture in terms of the Boltzmann theory breaks down. Improved understanding of both electron localization and the effects of electron-electron interactions in a disordered medium has led to experimentally verifiable predictions. These effects have an important influence on the nature of the metal-insulator transition."
