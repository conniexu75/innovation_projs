https://openalex.org/W1967465227,"A rapid, sensitive method is described for measuring C14-aminoacyl-sRNA interactions with ribosomes which are specifically induced by the appropriate RNA codewords prior to peptide-bond formation. Properties of the codeword recognition process and the minimum oligonucleotide chain length required to induce such interactions are presented. The trinucleotides, pUpUpU, pApApA, and pCpCpC, but not dinucleotides, specifically direct the binding to ribosomes of phenylalanine-, lysine-, and proline-sRNA, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2052346468,"The distal nerve process of hair plate sensilla and campaniform sensilla contains a special terminal structure in the form of a bundle of tubules herein designated the ""tubular body."" Physiological and morphological results indicate that compression at the site of this body probably acts as the stimulus at the cellular level. A ciliary structure separates an outer segment of the distal nerve process from the remaining distal fiber."
https://openalex.org/W2038270947,Specific adherence and mutual immunologic destruction occurred after contact in vitro of immune peritoneal macrophages from C57BI/6K mice with homograft target cells from A/Jax mice. Cell destruction apparently resulted from a nonphagocytic mechanism involving cell contact rather than humoral antibody. Cell destruction was determined by a plaque technique with either immunecells or target cells as monolayers.
https://openalex.org/W2009243871,A brief course of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine prevented conversion of 19S to 7S antibodies during the immune response of rabbits to bovine gamma globulin. Specific reactive homologous 7S antibodies given intravenously to animals with such incompletely developed humoral reactions led to an abrupt fall in 19S antibodies. After a lag period the synthesis of 7S antibodies was apparently normal. These results suggest that the concentration of 7S antibodies controls the synthesis of 19S antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W1966863061,"Within a given species (rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit) the histones of brain, liver, and kidney are indistinguishable on disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. However, characteristic species differences were observed. In the immature rat, the histones of brain and liver, while very similar to each other, differ from those of the adult. The histones of the thymus of the immature and adult rat exhibited a pattern corresponding to that of the immature brain and liver."
https://openalex.org/W2028216014,"Penicillium puberulum Bainer was found growing on a sample of moldy peanuts. It also grows on shredded wheat, potatoes, and laboratory culture media such as wort, potato dextrose, and Sabouraud agars, and synthesizes aflatoxin on these substrates. Thin-layer chromatograms of the chloroform-soluble toxin produced by the mold when grown on shredded wheat show fluorescent bands with R(F) values identical with those of the fractions B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2) of the toxin produced by Aspergillus flavus. This extract produces typical bile duct proliferation type of liver damage in 2-to 3-day-old Peking white ducklings."
https://openalex.org/W2074885576,"A new inherited variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase having both a lowered enzyme activity and an altered electrophoretic mobility was discovered in two unrelated American families, one of Irish and the other of German ancestry. Family studies of the trait indicate that it is due to a sexlinked gene."
https://openalex.org/W4229960113,"Anthropological inferences, made possible by advances in techniques for collecting data in archeological field work and the processing of data with a computer, permit a comparison to be made between the modern western Pueblos and their prehistoric background. One point in the development of Pueblo social organization (approximately A.D. 1200) is examined and compared with the present."
https://openalex.org/W1978311629,"Amantadine (or 1-adamantanamine) hydrochloride, a compound reported to be active against influenza viruses and Sendai virus, inhibited the growth of rubella virus in tissue culture. The antiviral activity appears at an early phase of the infection and is not due to direct inactivation of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2000287319,"Predictable, cyclic patterns of activity were obtained from 30 male rats. Seventeen of these were subjected to physical immobilization just as they were approaching their period of peak activity and thirteen animals were restrained during the inactive phase of their cycle. Eight animals were found to have gastric erosions following the immobilization. All of these came from the group immobilized during the time they would have been in the active phase of their particular cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2002901418,"The extent to which the A-chain of gamma-globulin reacted with antibody against an allotypic specificity controlled by the b locus was about that expected from the contamination of A-chain with B-chain; the a locus specificity was confined only to A-chain. Thus, data were consistent with complete separation of allotypic specificities, a locus with A-chain and b locus with B-chain."
https://openalex.org/W2090475973,"Embryonic cells isolated from eggs ofDrosophila melanogasterhave been cultured continuously in a new medium. Generation time for cell division is 30 hours. Chromosome number remains constant for at least 10 days. Cells from embryos of the mutant maroon-like grow at the same rate as those from wild-type embryos, but cells from rosy-2 grow slower and at a lower optimum temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1996843278,"Daily exposure of pigeons to four cycles of a reinforcement schedule in which the density of reinforcements varied cyclically as a function of time induced a periodicity in their responding matching that of the schedule, but out of phase with it. The technique used of presenting the same sequence of interreinforcement intervals in every session may have useful application in determining animals' adjustment to more complex temporal patterns of reinforcement. Investigation of animals' response to cyclic schedules of different frequencies suggests links with engineering methods of frequency analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2008154480,"Cytoplasmic particles of the slime-mold, Physarum polycephalum, incorporate tritiated thymidine in a form which is insoluble in acid and in ribonuclease, and soluble in deoxyribonuclease. Evidence for the mitochondrial nature of these thymidine-incorporating particles is based on their distribution, size, and staining behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1979577212,"Constriction of the ascending aorta in the guinea pig resulted in ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. In animals with heart failure which were killed 5 to 40 days after constriction, the norepinephrine stores in both ventricles were strikingly reduced; the extent of reduction was related to the severity of the constriction."
https://openalex.org/W2002181737,"Sedimentation and immunodiffusion experiments indicate that the molecular weight for the minimum molecular unit of C-phycocyanin is 30,000. This result agrees with an analysis of available data on amino acid content for C-phycocyanins from several different algae."
https://openalex.org/W2041958690,"Feeding experiments with rats demonstrate that p,p' DDT [1,1,1- trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] is converted to p,p' DDD [1,1-dichloro- 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2048415052,The nucleolus is implicated as a site of synthesis of nuclear basic proteins. Some of these newly synthesized sized proteins derived from the nucleolus have been characterized chemically as histones.
https://openalex.org/W2013739025,"The rate of spontaneous discharge of second-order vestibular neurons is higher during wakefulness than during drowsiness and synchronized sleep. The activity of units recorded from the lateral (and superior) vestibular nucleus remains unmodified or is slightly increased during desynchronized sleep, in spite of the complete disappearance of the postural tonus. Units in medial and descending vestibular nuclei show bursts of rapid discharge associated with the eye movements characteristic of desynchronized sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2030361075,"The use of nearly monochromatic radiation (l(125)) for the direct determination of bone mineral absorption in cadaver materials indicates that underlying bone components can be measured accurately on the flesh-covered forearm. The correlation of the bone mass, determined by this scanning technique, with actual bone weight is 0.96. The method is the most accurate yet demonstrated for bone with overlying tissue, and may prove suitable for these studies in vivo where it has not been possible to use previous roentgenologic techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2030240445,The synthetic polynucleotides may be used as models for the effects of alkylating agents on nucleic acid. Alkylation of polyadenylic acid with methyl methanesulfonate yields a polymer methylated in the one-position of adenine. This alteration in structure produces marked changes in physical properties and decreases the capacity to code for polylysine synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2077754568,"Experiments were performed in which the typical procedure for obtaining discriminated avoidance behavior with rats in a lever-pressing apparatus was compared with a new procedure which allowed only avoidance but not escape from the shock. When either escape or avoidance is possible, the rats make a majority of escape responses, but where escape is impossible avoidance behavior is rapidly established."
https://openalex.org/W2006046786,A midbrain hemisection in a midpontine pretrigeminal preparation of the cat causes an asymmetry in the electroencephalogram with a marked increase in the acetylcholine content of the cortex from the synchronized hemisphere. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine is related to the decrease of nervous activity caused by the hemisection.
https://openalex.org/W2065342091,"It is known that the synthesis of DNA is not essential for constitutive or induced enzyme synthesis. Our studies indicate that DNA synthesis is required for the basal level synthesis (that is, for synthesis in absence of inducer) of two inducible enzymes, a finding which supports an earlier speculation that a messenger-RNA transcription event may normally accompany DNA replication. Studies with cultures of Escherichia coli TAU-bar in which DNA replication is synchronized suggest that the β-galactosidase gene is transcribed at a particular time in the sequential replication of the bacterial chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1975579061,"Adult females of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), showed a daily rhythm of sensitivity to DDVP (dimethyl 2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate). When the mites were maintained in alternating light-dark conditions, maximum susceptibility to the chemical occurred 2 hours after dawn and the mites were least sensitive 2 hours after nightfall."
https://openalex.org/W2081947289,"Some ethionine-resistant mutants of Neurospora crassa are temperature-sensitive, in that they fail to grow in the upper temperature range at which wild type Neurospora grow best. Two of these mutants have lost an indispensable function since at elevated temperatures they are unable to grow on a variety of complex media."
https://openalex.org/W2032599894,"Tritiated uridine is selectively incorporated into the nucleus and nucleolus of tobacco leaf discs infected with tobacco mosaic virus that has been treated with actinomycin D. Such incorporation did not occur in noninfected tobacco treated with actinomycin D. Nontreated, infected, and healthy tobacco incorporated substantially more tritiated uridine."

https://openalex.org/W1986130520,"Of five chimpanzees injected with blood of other chimpanzees in Freund's adjuvant, three produced antiserums for simian blood factors designated A(c), B(c), and C(c), respectively. Factors Ac and Bc determine four blood groups which were distributed among 60 chimpanzees in conformity with the triple-allele hypothesis. Factor C(c) appears to belong to an independent blood group system. All three simian blood factors are distributed independently of sex. An antithetical relation exists between the simian blood factor A(c) and blood factor N(v), the latter being a blood factor shared by all human N cells. Since the simian blood factors A(c) and B(c) are also related, the three blood factors A(c), B(c), and N(v) must belong to one and the same blood group system, which is named the V-A-B blood group system of chimpanzees. The V-A-B blood group system of chimpanzees appears to be the counterpart of the M-N-S blood group system of man."
https://openalex.org/W1993350171,"The hypothesis that discharges from afferent nerves from muscle stretch receptors do not participate in kinesthesis has been substantiated by test of discrimination thresholds. In awake, unrestrained cats, nerve stimulation activating group I and most group II sensory fibers (from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs) in pure muscular nerves failed to evoke sensory discrimination. Cutaneous nerve stimulation in the same animals produced sensory discrimination even below intensities required to elicit detectable nerve thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W2022569088,"Feeding a diet deficient in nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and tryptophan to pregnant rats causes death and resorption of all fetuses. This effect can be prevented by administration of either chlorpromazine or imipramine. Analysis of maternal liver at the time of fetal resorption indicates that the observed effects may be mediated through modification of the concentration of the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2080411670,"Release of inorganic sulfate from human erythrocytes is depressed in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol (5 × 10-4M) or dicumarol (5 × 10-4M). This effect cannot be readily attributed to uncoupling of phosphorylation from respiration, since the study was conducted with cells that metabolize principally by anaerobic means and since the effect was not influenced by iodoacetic acid. A more reasonable explanation may be that permeability of the erythrocyte membrane to anions may be reduced by these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1965748314,"Cytoplasmic fragments were produced by micromanipulation of cells from a human amnion cell line cultured on coverslips. The cultures were infected with type 1 (Mahoney) poliovirus, and incubated for 7 hours with tritiated uridine (H3U). Fluorescent antibody to the poliovirus indicated antigenic sites in a number of non-nucleate fragments. By autoradiography the incorporation of H3U was demonstrated at some of the same sites. The occurrence of poliovirus antigen at the same site as induced synthesis of RNA in non-nucleate cytoplasm of mammalian cells indicates that poliovirus infection and growth occurred independently of immediate contribution from the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2046518884,Ultraviolet inactivation of chloroplast formation was studied in synchronously dividing cultures of Euglena gracilis. Sensitivity to sublethal doses given at intervals throughout the cell cycle was greater just before cell division than during division. There was approximately a twofold difference in the doseresponse relationships for the periods of high and low sensitivity.
https://openalex.org/W2055759269,Radioautographs of tissue from the thyroid gland prepared 24 hours after the administration of iodine-125 showed that the concentration of radioactivity in intracellular colloid droplets was the same as that in the follicular colloid. This observation indicates that colloid droplets are due to phagocytosis of small portions of follicular colloid.
https://openalex.org/W2035092210,A versatile automatic culture-sampling system is described and data are presented from experiments in which this device was used to study growth and synchronized cell division in Euglena gracilis.
https://openalex.org/W1983769572,Attempts to elicit visual hallucinations in sensory deprivation indicate the desirability of adopting a set of criteria for identifying hallucinations as distinct from reported visual sensations in general.
https://openalex.org/W2050419514,"Adult thymectomized, irradiated mice restored with syngeneic bone marrow exhibit an accelerated response toward second-set skin homografts, although the response to the primary grafts is impaired. Such mice have a long-lasting impairment (up to 223 days) of the primary response to allogeneic grafts (but not to xenogeneic grafts) and show the greatest deficiency of response toward grafts sharing the same H2 locus as the host. Thymectomy in the adult mouse is ineffective in altering a state of homograft sensitivity induced prior to irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2087796071,"When cell cultures are initiated from aortic connective tissue of rats and maintained as monolayers on glass, the differentiated property of collagen production disappears. However, these same cells, when placed in diffusion chambers in the peritoneal cavities of other rats, produce collagen, as indicated both morphologically and by the accumulation of hydroxyproline within the chambers."
https://openalex.org/W2026236937,The uptake of calcium and strontium by a green unicellular alga cultured in media containing these elements in concentrations found in nature is directly proportional to the concentration in the media. Variation in the concentration of either element has a slight inverse influence on the uptake of the other. The increase of strontium uptake when the calcium concentration is very low indicates that strontium is substituted for calcium when calcium is limited and suggests that the alga requires either element.
https://openalex.org/W1994579726,"Eighty morphological mutants in the homothallic fungus Sordaria fimicola were tested on liquid minimal medium for nutritional requirements. Five had nutritional requirements, one for adenine, three for arginine, and one for lysine. All five were from among the eighty single gene mutants that were also partially or completely self-sterile. Nutritional requirements and centromere-locus intervals provide better criteria than morphological characters for selecting self-sterile mutants at complex loci governing heterothallism."
