https://openalex.org/W2955316307,"The potential for global forest cover The restoration of forested land at a global scale could help capture atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity.Such a change has the potential to store an equivalent of 25% of the current atmospheric carbon pool.

These mats, although abundant, have until recently been limited and discontinuous. However, Wang et al. report that, since 2011, the mats have increased in density and aerial extent to generate a 8850-kilometer-long belt that extends from West Africa to the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico (see the Perspective by Gower and King).

https://openalex.org/W2955961495,"Ceramides contribute to the lipotoxicity that underlies diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and heart disease. By genetically engineering mice, we deleted the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which normally inserts a conserved double bond into the backbone of ceramides and other predominant sphingolipids. Ablation of DES1 from whole animals or tissue-specific deletion in the liver and/or adipose tissue resolved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice caused by leptin deficiency or obesogenic diets. Mechanistic studies revealed ceramide actions that promoted lipid uptake and storage and impaired glucose utilization, none of which could be recapitulated by (dihydro)ceramides that lacked the critical double bond. These studies suggest that inhibition of DES1 may provide a means of treating hepatic steatosis and metabolic disorders."

The usual way to try to circumvent this poor ductility is by adding other elements, which can be costly. Liu et al. show that very small samples of pure magnesium are much more ductile than previously believed (see the Perspective by Proust). The small samples suppress the deformation twinning that causes fractures in larger samples. Avoiding this mechanism should allow development of high-ductility magnesium and other metal alloys.

https://openalex.org/W2954699006,"Stress granules (SGs) form during cellular stress and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). To yield insights into the role of SGs in pathophysiology, we performed a high-content screen to identify small molecules that alter SG properties in proliferative cells and human iPSC-derived motor neurons (iPS-MNs). One major class of active molecules contained extended planar aromatic moieties, suggesting a potential to intercalate in nucleic acids. Accordingly, we show that several hit compounds can prevent the RNA-dependent recruitment of the ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) TDP-43, FUS, and HNRNPA2B1 into SGs. We further demonstrate that transient SG formation contributes to persistent accumulation of TDP-43 into cytoplasmic puncta and that our hit compounds can reduce this accumulation in iPS-MNs from ALS patients. We propose that compounds with planar moieties represent a promising starting point to develop small-molecule therapeutics for treating ALS/FTD."
https://openalex.org/W2948036155,"Organisms must respond to hypoxia to preserve oxygen homeostasis. We identify a thiol oxidase, previously assigned as cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO), as a low oxygen affinity (high-KmO2) amino-terminal cysteine dioxygenase that transduces the oxygen-regulated stability of proteins by the N-degron pathway in human cells. ADO catalyzes the conversion of amino-terminal cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid and is related to the plant cysteine oxidases that mediate responses to hypoxia by an identical posttranslational modification. We show in human cells that ADO regulates RGS4/5 (regulator of G protein signaling) N-degron substrates, modulates G protein-coupled calcium ion signals and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and that its activity extends to other N-cysteine proteins including the angiogenic cytokine interleukin-32. Identification of a conserved enzymatic oxygen sensor in multicellular eukaryotes opens routes to better understanding and therapeutic targeting of adaptive responses to hypoxia."

Timms et al. used a global protein stability (GPS) technology to take a broader look at these pathways in human cells. Unexpectedly, glycine exposed at the N terminus could act as a potent degron; proteins bearing N-terminal glycine were targeted for proteasomal degradation by two Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases through the substrate adaptors ZYG11B and ZER1. This pathway may be important, for example, to degrade proteins that fail to localize properly to cellular membranes and to destroy protein fragments generated during cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2956091366,"Antibiotic resistance is prevalent among the bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections. However, antimicrobial treatment is often prescribed 'empirically', in the absence of antibiotic susceptibility testing, risking mismatched and therefore ineffective treatment. Here, linking a 10-year longitudinal data set of over 700,000 community-acquired urinary tract infections with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of antibiotic purchases, we identify strong associations of antibiotic resistance with the demographics, records of past urine cultures and history of drug purchases of the patients. When combined together, these associations allow for machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions of antibiotic resistance, thereby enabling drug-prescribing algorithms that match an antibiotic treatment recommendation to the expected resistance of each sample. Applying these algorithms retrospectively, over a 1-year test period, we find that they greatly reduce the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the current standard of care. The clinical application of such algorithms may help improve the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments."

Cui et al. studied a protein known as Lst1 in yeast and SEC24C in mammalian cells that is involved in loading secretory cargo into vesicles that are delivered to the Golgi complex. In response to stress caused by starvation or misfolded aggregate-prone secretory proteins, Lst1 acted to promote an additional function—ER-phagy.

https://openalex.org/W2954476098,"In cortical regions of brains from individuals with preclinical or clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition precedes the aggregation of pathological intracellular tau (the product of the gene microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)). To our knowledge, current mouse models of tauopathy reconstitute tau pathology by overexpressing mutant human tau protein. Here, through a homologous recombination approach that replaced the entire murine Mapt gene with the human ortholog, we developed knock-in mice with humanized Mapt to create an in vivo platform for studying human tauopathy. Of note, the humanized Mapt expressed all six tau isoforms present in humans. We next cross-bred the MAPT knock-in mice with single amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mice to investigate the Aβ–tau axis in AD etiology. The double-knock-in mice exhibited higher tau phosphorylation than did single MAPT knock-in mice but initially lacked apparent tauopathy and neurodegeneration, as observed in the single App knock-in mice. We further observed that tau humanization significantly accelerates cell-to-cell propagation of AD brain-derived pathological tau both in the absence and presence of Aβ-amyloidosis. In the presence of Aβ-amyloidosis, tau accumulation was intensified and closely associated with dystrophic neurites, consistently showing that Aβ-amyloidosis affects tau pathology. Our results also indicated that the pathological human tau interacts better with human tau than with murine tau, suggesting species-specific differences between these orthologous pathogenic proteins. We propose that the MAPT knock-in mice will make it feasible to investigate the behaviors and characteristics of human tau in an animal model."

We found that the eIF2α kinase heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) controls NOD1 signalosome folding and activation through a process requiring eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), the transcription factor ATF4, and the heat shock protein HSPB8. The HRI/eIF2α signaling axis was also essential for signaling downstream of the innate immune mediators NOD2, MAVS, and TRIF but dispensable for pathways dependent on MyD88 or STING. Moreover, filament-forming α-synuclein activated HRI-dependent responses, which suggests that the HRI pathway may restrict toxic oligomer formation.

Selective labeling and manipulation of endogenous proteins are essential to delineating the molecular mechanisms of cell and organismal biology. Recent advances in exploratory proteomics and gene expression analysis generate sizable datasets that urgently require high-throughput and reliable methods for protein visualization and functional manipulation purposes. However, current techniques to enable these strategies are often inefficient or resource intensive. For example, due to the limited availability and the cost of antibodies, it is often not a viable option for single labs to immunolabel tens to hundreds of proteomic candidates. Further, a large fraction of available antibodies may have limited utility due to unsuspected cross-reactivity to other proteins, lot-to-lot variability in quality, and insufficient application-specific validation (Berglund et al., 2008Berglund L.

Additionally, overexpression of recombinant constructs to map protein localization or conduct functional analyses is also resource intensive and can be highly sensitive to available cellular docking sites or unforeseen artifactual cellular effects associated with protein overexpression. CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9-based strategies have great promise to enable highly precise genome editing of mammalian cells to address many of the above limitations (Cong et al., 2013Cong L.

CRISPR-Cas9 introduces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at guide RNA (gRNA) specified genomic sites. These genomic DSBs are repaired via two main pathways in cells; non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the prevailing pathway, while homology-directed repair (HDR) is reportedly less frequent, especially in non-dividing cells outside of the S and G2 phase of cell cycle (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D.

Both HDR and NHEJ pathways are currently utilized to insert foreign DNA sequences into genes of interest (GOIs) for applications such as labeling of translated endogenous protein products. Examples of these methods include single-cell labeling of endogenous proteins (SLENDR and viral SLENDR [(v)SLENDR]) and homology-independent targeted integration (HITI), both of which have been shown to function in post-mitotic cells, including neurons. SLENDR is based on HDR, using oligonucleotides or adeno-associated virus (AAV) donors containing gene-specific homology sequences to facilitate insertion into GOIs (Mikuni et al., 2016Mikuni T. Nishiyama J. Sun Y. Kamasawa N. Yasuda R.

Virus-mediated genome editing via homology-directed repair in mitotic and postmitotic cells in mammalian brain.Neuron. 2017; 96: 755-768.e755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HITI leverages NHEJ to insert foreign sequences into a GOI. It utilizes donor vectors containing gene-specific gRNA recognition sequences, which simultaneously direct DSB cuts to the gene and donor vector, facilitating directional insertion during NHEJ (Suzuki et al., 2016Suzuki K. Tsunekawa Y. Hernandez-Benitez R. Wu J. Zhu J. Kim E.J. Hatanaka F. Yamamoto M. Araoka T. Li Z. et al.In vivo genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-independent targeted integration.Nature. 2016; 540: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Although SLENDR and HITI are flexible in their ability to modify proteins both in vitro and in vivo for neuronal applications, they both necessitate the cloning of gRNA vectors for the GOIs, as well as customized gene-specific donor vectors for each insertion. By requiring the generation of tailored donor vectors for each DSB cut site in each GOI, the scalability and throughput of testing multiple insertional sequences using either SLENDR or HITI are limited. Alternatively, CRISPaint pairs NHEJ with modular donor vectors that are linearized and integrated into GOIs and demonstrates improved throughput for insertional editing in cell lines (Schmid-Burgk et al., 2016Schmid-Burgk J.L. Höning K. Ebert T.S. Hornung V. CRISPaint allows modular base-specific gene tagging using a ligase-4-dependent mechanism.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it requires specially prepared mini-circular vectors that are not compatible with viral delivery methods important for many in vivo applications, or the bacterial vector backbones are necessarily co-inserted into genomes, which can interfere long-term transgene expression (Chen et al., 2001bChen Z.Y. Yant S.R. He C.Y. Meuse L. Shen S. Kay M.A. Linear DNAs concatemerize in vivo and result in sustained transgene expression in mouse liver.Mol.

Ther. 2003; 8: 495-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These issues may limit its widespread utility, especially for applications where viral transduction is preferred in vitro or in vivo. Here, we describe homology-independent universal genome engineering (HiUGE), a new generalized method that obviates many of the constraints to the current state of the art. HiUGE is an AAV-mediated method that uses a two-vector modular approach for higher-throughput genomic knockin (KI) applications. The donor vector contains an insertional DNA fragment (payload) that is flanked on both ends by an artificial DNA sequence non-homologous to the target genome. This sequence is recognized by a donor-specific gRNA (DS-gRNA) that directs the Cas9-mediated autonomous excision and release of the payload. The payload can then be integrated across diverse GOIs, both in vitro and in vivo, at genomic loci specified by a separate panel of high-throughput and low-cost gene-specific gRNA (GS-gRNA) vectors. This design frees the donor vectors of any gene-specific sequences, rendering them universally compatible for virtually any CRISPR-Cas9-accessible genomic loci. Importantly, these AAV donors can be premade for ubiquitous applications, greatly simplifying strategies for insertional genome editing. We have tested payloads for a variety of applications and demonstrate their interchangeability within and between GOIs in both cells and tissues. These applications include antibody epitope and fluorescent protein labeling for localization mapping and dynamic visualization of endogenous proteins, protein subcellular rerouting and sequestration, protein truncation for structure-function relationship analysis, and neural-circuit-specific genome engineering. Because this method is highly modular, scalable, and suitable for in vitro as well as in vivo applications, it opens new avenues to pair higher-throughput proteomic and genomic applications with experimental validation and phenotypic screening to address molecular mechanisms of cellular neurobiology. Recent advances in proteomics and gene expression studies generate sizable protein and gene network datasets, which urgently require novel methods to analyze them on larger scales with greater precision. Higher-throughput genome engineering techniques targeting candidate proteins/genes could satisfy these needs. We thus designed a method utilizing the delivery of universal DNA inserts (payloads) that can ubiquitously integrate across genes to achieve this. In the HiUGE system (Figure 1A), a two-vector approach was used to deliver GS-gRNAs and universal payloads, with AAV as the delivery vehicle for its flexible use in vitro and in vivo. HiUGE GS-gRNA vectors are prepared by ligations of 23- to 24-mer oligonucleotides to the backbone vector, which is scalable to generate panels of gRNA expressing vectors targeting diverse GOIs. HiUGE donor vectors are autonomous, expressing a synthetic donor-specific gRNA (DS-gRNA) that is non-homologous to the targeted genome but directs Cas9-mediated self-cleavage and release of the universal payloads for genomic insertion. This design allows the separation of the donor vector construction from any specific sequence of genomic targets, thus enabling universal applications of the donor “toolkits.” Such utilities include localization mapping and functional manipulation of the endogenous proteins, by introducing tags at their carboxy- or amino-terminus (C- or N-term) within diverse CRISPR-Cas9-accessible genomic loci unlocked by the GS-gRNA “keys.” To test this concept, a dual-orientation payload design was used to facilitate the expression of a hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tag following either forward or reverse integration into the C-term of proteins of interest (Figure 1B). We adopted a protocol to produce small-scale transduction-ready AAVs for higher-throughput use in vitro, complimenting traditional AAV purifications for use in vivo (Figure 1C; STAR Methods). As a proof of concept, small-scale AAVs of a GS-gRNA targeting the mouse Tubb3 gene and a dual-orientation HA-epitope HiUGE donor were used to co-transduce primary neurons prepared from neonatal pups of conditional Cas9 mice. The GS-gRNA AAV also expresses Cre-recombinase to induce Cas9-2A-GFP expression. Approximately 1 week following infection, immunofluorescent detection of HA-epitope showed successful labeling of endogenous βIII-tubulin, with localization characteristics specific to microtubules (Figures 1D and S1A). Western blot detection of the HA-epitope showed a single band (∼51 kDa) consistent with the predicted molecular mass of βIII-tubulin (Figure 1E). Genomic insertion of the payload was verified by sequencing the Tubb3 locus, confirming the successful HA-epitope integration (Figure 1F). In control experiments, the relative selectivity of frame-dependent labeling was tested by comparing the correct open reading frame (ORF) donor (ORF+1, in reference to the Cas9 cleavage locus specified by the Tubb3 gRNA) to out-of-frame donors (ORF+0 or ORF+2) (Figure S1B i–iii). HA-labeling in the correct ORF was substantially more efficient (Figure S1C), with occasional HA-positive cells observed from out-of-frame ORFs, indicating comparatively less frequent frameshifting insertion or deletion (indel) events during payload integration. Negative controls demonstrated the absolute requirement for both GS-gRNA and HiUGE donor vectors for HA-epitope KI (Figure S1B iv–vi). To demonstrate that donor vectors for all three ORFs are equally capable of facilitating HiUGE, three GS-gRNAs, one for each ORF, were designed to target the mouse Map2 gene. Pairing these GS-gRNA AAVs with HA-epitope donor AAVs in their corresponding ORFs resulted in comparable and efficient labeling (Figures S1D and S1E). An important consideration is that the HiUGE donor vectors should be suitable to target diverse coding sequences without introducing premature stop codons that prevent proper expression of the insert. This is achieved by using donor recognition sequences (DRSs) specifically designed such that premature stop codons cannot be introduced during genomic integration. We compared HA-epitope donor vectors with different DRSs and found similar cellular labeling efficiencies among them (Figures S2A–S2C), demonstrating flexibility in DRS usage. Also, we found that the cellular labeling efficiency for HiUGE was comparable to HITI (Figures S2D–S2I). We next tested whether a single HiUGE payload can be integrated across diverse genomic loci and label multiple target proteins for subcellular localization mapping. We used oligonucleotide ligation to rapidly construct an arrayed panel of GS-gRNA AAV vectors targeting the C terminus of 12 proteins, which exhibit previously described and highly patterned subcellular localizations in neurons and glia.

Primary neuron-glia cultures of Cas9 mice were co-transduced with one of these GS-gRNA AAVs in combination with the same HA-epitope donor AAV (Figure 2A). Approximately 7 days following infection, we observed the predicted localization of the 12 protein targets by HA immunostaining (Figures 2B–2M). Further, genomic PCRs were performed for five targets to amplify the region around the edited junctions. HA-epitope integrations were confirmed (Figures S3A and S3B), with deep sequencing of the amplicons revealing the positional indel occurrences, the proportions of forward and reverse payload insertion without indels, and the proportions of allelic mutations without donor integration (Figure S3C). We also tested for the integration of donor payloads in top-ranked predicted off-target sites and found no evidence for payload insertion (Figures S3D and S3E). In addition, experimental genome-wide analysis was performed to detect potential off-target payload integrations, including those at nonpredicted sites. We found that while genomic off-target integrations can occur, their estimated frequencies are low (Figures S3F–S3H). In each instance, the observed off-target integration was into non-coding regions that would not result in unintended labeling of non-target proteins. Further, the cellular labeling efficiencies across various conditions were quantified for several AIS-specific targets, as each neuron typically has only one AIS, and their distinct expression pattern is suitable for easy visual identification and quantification. The ratios of HiUGE-labeled AIS structures compared to all AIS (stained with an antibody against the AIS-marker Ankyrin-G) were quantified (Figures S4A–S4C). Estimated efficiencies were shown across multiple viral doses (Sptbn4: 34%; Scn2a: 29% at the high dose) and across various ratios between the GS-gRNA and the donor (ratios around 1:1 are optimal). Further, we tested HiUGE-mediated labeling to visualize several members of the recently uncovered inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD) proteome (Uezu et al., 2016Uezu A. Kanak D.J. Bradshaw T.W. Soderblom E.J. Catavero C.M. Burette A.C. Weinberg R.J. Soderling S.H. Identification of an elaborate complex mediating postsynaptic inhibition.Science. 2016; 353: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Spaghetti-monster HA (smFP-HA), a larger insert that exhibits enhanced antigenicity suitable for detecting low-expression proteins (Viswanathan et al., 2015Viswanathan S. Williams M.E. Bloss E.B. Stasevich T.J. Speer C.M. Nern A. Pfeiffer B.D. Hooks B.M. Li W.P. English B.P. et al.High-performance probes for light and electron microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was used as the payload (Figure 2A). These iPSD proteomic candidates included inhibitory synaptic protein 1 (Insyn1), inhibitory synaptic protein 2 (Insyn2), and Rho GTPase activating protein 32 (Arhgap32). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that they were localized juxtaposed to the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) (Figures 2N–2P), confirming their presence at inhibitory synapses. In addition, three different GS-gRNAs (Table S1) were tested for Insyn1, and all of them yield comparable inhibitory synaptic labeling (Figures S4D–S4G), demonstrating the flexibility of GS-gRNA selection and the robustness of the labeling method. Finally, we performed mixed labeling of diverse protein targets by applying a single C-term HA-epitope donor with a mixture of GS-gRNA AAVs (Figures S4H and S4I). Immunocytochemistry revealed simultaneous labeling of the targeted proteins (βIV-spectrin, GFAP, and MeCP2) in a single experiment and provided a proof of concept for other applications that require simultaneous modification of multiple proteins. Next, we tested N-term modifications using a single Myc-epitope payload with an upstream stop codon cassette to constrain its expression to the N-term (Figure 2A). GS-gRNAs targeting the N-term of three proteins were tested, including proteins of the actin cytoskeleton (β-actin, Actb), nuclear envelope (lamin B1, Lmnb1), and neurofilaments (neurofilament medium, Nefm). Myc-epitope immunolabeling, consistent with the expected localization pattern, was observed for each target (Figures 2Q–2S). Further, like previous studies (Mikuni et al., 2016Mikuni T. Nishiyama J. Sun Y. Kamasawa N. Yasuda R. High-throughput, high-resolution mapping of protein localization in mammalian brain by in vivo genome editing.Cell. 2016; 165: 1803-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we tested selective dual labeling of different proteins with different tags. This is achieved by combining the N-term selective Myc-epitope payload with the HA-epitope HiUGE payload described above, which contains a stop codon cassette following the epitope tag that enforces its expression at the C-term (Figure S4J). These donors were co-infected with GS-gRNA AAVs targeting the N-term of dendritic MAP2 (Map2) and the C-term of AIS-enriched βIV-spectrin (Sptbn4). Co-staining for HA and Myc-epitopes revealed selective labeling for each protein, with instances of co-staining in single neurons (Figure S4K). Thus, HiUGE N- and C-term selective payloads can be used to co-label proteins simultaneously to reveal the spatial relationships of two endogenous proteins, which may be more useful than the mixed labeling of multiple proteins with identical tags described above. Together, using rapidly constructed GS-gRNA libraries, HiUGE integrates universal payloads into diverse protein coding regions in a highly specific and higher-throughput manner for mapping endogenous protein localizations. HiUGE is thus suitable for rapid and robust labeling of proteins, including post hoc localization analysis following large-scale proteomic studies. We next tested in vivo labeling by intracranial injections of HiUGE AAVs (Figure 3A). Approximately 2 weeks following infection, immunohistochemistry was performed. Images of sections from each injection revealed the expected HA immunoreactivity localized to the AIS (Sptbn4 and Scn2a; Figures 3B and 3C), microtubules (Tubb3; Figure 3D), and nuclei (Mecp2; Figure 3E). Of note, the detection for each of four targets was consistent across independent cells with no visible mis-localization, suggesting off-target protein coding integration was undetectable or rare. In addition, local injections of HiUGE AAVs into the motor cortex of adult Cas9 mice were performed, and the cellular labeling efficiencies for the AIS-localized targets at the injection sites were quantified (Sptbn4: 30%; Scn2a: 23%. Figures 3F–3J). These data demonstrated that a single HiUGE donor can be paired with multiple GS-gRNAs to modify diverse endogenous proteins in vivo. While the above data demonstrated that a single HiUGE payload could integrate across diverse gene targets in vitro and in vivo, an additional feature of the HiUGE method is that the donor payloads should be interchangeable for multiplexing and flexible selection of protein modifications. The ability to mix and match premade HiUGE donors would simplify the experimental selection of optimal epitopes, diverse fusion proteins, or fusion proteins with variable linkers. To demonstrate the interchangeability of HiUGE payloads, we modified proteins either in vitro or in vivo with a combination of epitope tags (HA, Myc, and/or V5) to create a mosaic labeling of infected cells (Figure 4A). Immunostaining of cultured neurons infected with a mixture of these HiUGE epitope payload AAVs paired with GS-gRNA AAV targeting the Tubb3 locus revealed a visual montage of multicolored βIII-tubulin labeling, with occasional double-labeled cells indicating the two alleles of Tubb3 were modified by different epitopes (Figure 4B, magenta neurons). Thus, after genomic cleavage directed by the GS-gRNA, different HiUGE payloads can be inserted interchangeably. Further, multiplexed labeling was also tested in vivo, where a mixture of HiUGE epitope payload AAVs were co-injected with the Tubb3 GS-gRNA AAV into neonatal pups intracranially. Two weeks following infections, immunohistochemistry revealed extensive multiplexed labeling of neurons throughout multiple brain regions of the cerebrum (Figure 4C). Higher magnification images (Figure 4D) demonstrated heterogeneous epitope labeling of ßIII-tubulin in neighboring neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, as well as projections representing thalamocortical connectivity, globus pallidus bundles, and corpus callosum fibers. Together, these data demonstrated the interchangeability of HiUGE donor payloads within a single gene locus, thus enabling flexible selection of diverse protein modifications. We further reasoned that it should be possible to limit the genome editing activity to specific neural circuits by utilizing a recently reported retrograde-transported AAV2-retro serotype (Tervo et al., 2016Tervo D.G. Hwang B.Y. Viswanathan S. Gaj T. Lavzin M. Ritola K.D. Lindo S. Michael S. Kuleshova E. Ojala D. et al.A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons.Neuron. 2016; 92: 372-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Injection of AAV2-retro GS-gRNA into a brain area containing axon terminals of a circuit could be paired with injection of AAV2/9 HiUGE donor into a specific projection region, allowing retrograde access of projection neurons from a target brain region for neural circuit-selective protein manipulations. We tested this possibility in the well-defined cortico-striatal circuit and the thalamocortical circuit. For the corticostriatal circuit, Tubb3 GS-gRNA AAV2-retro was injected to the striatum, whereas individual AAV2/9 HiUGE donor AAVs were injected laterally into either the primary motor cortex (MOp, HA-epitope) or secondary motor cortex (MOs, Myc-epitope) of adult conditional Cas9 mice (Figure 5A). Retrograde access to the projection neurons in the motor cortex was confirmed by positive GFP labeling, indicating Cre-dependent activation of Cas9-2A-GFP (Figure 5B). HiUGE"

This study is aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among children less than five years of age in Guguftu, South Wollo, Northeast Ethiopia.A cross-sectional health facility based study was conducted among 404 children aged 6 to 59 months. Systematic random sampling technique was used to include the participants. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the family and child. Data on nutritional status, capillary blood and stool samples were collected from each child. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.The overall prevalence of anemia was 41.1% (95% CI;36.6% - 45.8%). Of the anemic under five children, 112 (67.5%) had mild anemia, 52(31.3%) had moderate anemia, and 2(1.2%) had severe anemia. Children who were in the age group of 6-11(AOR = 4.52; 95% CI: 1.67-12.34) and 12-23 (AOR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.04-7.51) months, living in an urban (AOR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05-3.18), with no formal education mothers (AOR = 7.05; 95% CI: 2.93-17.01) and primary education mothers (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.29-8.24), with a family monthly income of <750 ETB(AOR = 5.19; 95% CI: 1.24-21.75) and 750-1500 ETB(AOR = 5.89; 95% CI: 1.45-23.98), with early (<6 months) introduction of complementary foods (AOR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.23-10.18), Underweight (AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.21-3.69) were more likely to become anemic.This study has revealed that the prevalence of anemia in children less than five years is high and a severe public health problem in the study area. Therefore, the policymakers should make a strategy that can reduce poverty and increase the awareness of women on breastfeeding, nutrition, and other associated factors to reduce anemia."

This study evaluated red propolis extracts obtained by conventional (ethanolic) extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction of six samples from different regions of northeastern Brazil. The total phenolic compounds and flavonoids, in vitro antioxidant activity, concentration of formononetin and kaempferol and the cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell lines were determined for all twelve obtained extracts. Significant variations in the levels of the investigated compounds were identified in the red propolis extracts, confirming that the chemical composition varied according to the sampling region. The extraction method used also influenced the resulting propolis compounds. The highest concentration of the compounds of interest and the highest in vitro antioxidant activity were exhibited by the extracts obtained from samples from state of Alagoas. Formononetin and kaempferol were identified in all samples. The highest formononetin concentrations were identified in extracts obtained by ultrasound, thus indicating a greater selectivity for the extraction of this compound by this method. Regarding cytotoxic activity, for the HCT-116 line, all of the extracts showed an inhibition of greater than 90%, whereas for the HL-60 and PC3 lines, the minimum identified was 80%. In general, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the antiproliferative potential when comparing the extraction methods. The results showed that the composition of Brazilian red propolis varies significantly depending on the geographical origin and that the method used influences the resulting compounds that are present in propolis. However, regardless of the geographical origin and the extraction method used, all the red propolis samples studied presented great biological potential and high antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the ultrasound-assisted method can be efficiently applied to obtain extracts of red propolis more quickly and with high concentration of biomarkers of interest."

We hypothesized that machine-learning algorithms using administrative claims data may represent a novel approach to predicting ADRD. Using a national de-identified dataset of more than 125 million patients including over 10,000 clinical, pharmaceutical, and demographic variables, we developed a cohort to train a machine learning model to predict ADRD 4–5 years in advance. The Lasso algorithm selected a 50-variable model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693. Top diagnosis codes in the model were memory loss (780.93), Parkinson’s disease (332.0), mild cognitive impairment (331.83) and bipolar disorder (296.80), and top pharmacy codes were psychoactive drugs. Machine learning algorithms can rapidly develop predictive models for ADRD with massive datasets, without requiring hypothesis-driven feature engineering."

A genus-specific conventional cytochrome b (cytb) PCR has shown high sensitivity in field studies, detecting 70% submicroscopic malaria. The main objective of this study was to assess the conversion from conventional to real-time PCR testing both SYBR and probe protocols, and including quantitative (q) PCR. The protocols were assessed applying well-defined clinical patient material consisting of 33 positive and 80 negative samples. Sequencing of positive PCR products was performed. In addition, a sensitivity comparison of real-time PCR methods was done by including five relevant assays investigating the effect of amplification target and platform. Sensitivity was further examined using field material consisting of 111 P.falciparum positive samples from Tanzanian children (< 5 years), as well as using related patient data to assess the application of q-PCR with focus on low-level parasitaemia. Both the cytb SYBR and probe PCR protocols showed as high sensitivity and specificity as their conventional counterpart, except missing one P. malariae sample. The SYBR protocol was more sensitive and specific than using probe. Overall, choice of amplification target applied is relevant for achieving ultra-sensitivity, and using intercalating fluorescence dye rather than labelled hydrolysis probes is favourable. Application of q-PCR analysis in field projects is important for the awareness and understanding of low-level parasitaemia. For use in clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies the highly sensitive and user-friendly cytb SYBR q-PCR method is a relevant tool. The genus-specific method has the advantage that species identification by sequencing can be performed as an alternative to species-specific PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2953654319,"The interaction of emotions with creative cognition is one of the most intriguing topics in the creativity research. In this study, we investigated the extent to which various emotional states influence the evaluation of ideas, which is a crucial component of the creative thinking process. To this end, we used emotional (both positive and negative) and neutral pictures to induce emotional states and then asked participants to evaluate the creativity of exogenous ideas (i.e., those generated by other people) as part of an alternative use evaluation task. As the results of previous studies suggest the existence of a negative bias when judging highly creative ideas, we presented the participants with non-creative, moderately creative, and highly creative uses for everyday objects. Overall, the participants gave higher creativity ratings when under positive emotional engagement than when in negative or neutral conditions. Moreover, neutral and emotional context differently moderated the creativity evaluation of the three object use categories. Specifically, participants gave higher ratings for non-creative uses, and (to a lesser extent) for highly creative uses when in a positive emotional state, than they did when in the neutral condition. On the other hand, when in a negative emotional state, the participants gave lower ratings for moderately creative uses than they did in either the positive or neutral conditions. These data provide initial evidence that emotional states can influence the creativity evaluation of exogenous alternative ideas that are generated through divergent thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2954879004,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latency and reactivation rely on a complex interplay between cellular differentiation, cell signaling pathways, and viral gene functions. HCMV reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is triggered by IL-6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)–mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. However, activation of the same pathway fails to reactivate HCMV in other myeloid cell types, despite this signaling axis being active in those cells. We hypothesized that IL-6–induced ERK activation initiates the changes in chromatin structure required for viral reactivation but that a concomitant signal is necessary to complete the changes in chromatin structure required for gene expression to occur. Using a differential phosphoproteomics approach in cells that do or do not support IL-6–induced viral reactivation, we identified the concomitant activation of an Src family kinase (SFK), hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), specifically in DCs in response to IL-6. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of HCK activity indicated that HCK is required for HCMV reactivation. Furthermore, the HCK/SFK activity was linked to recruitment of the monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) histone acetyltransferase to the viral promoter, which promoted histone acetylation after ERK-mediated histone phosphorylation. Importantly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of MOZ activity prevented reactivation. These results provide an explanation for the selective activation of viral gene expression in DCs by IL-6, dependent on concomitant SFK and ERK signaling. They also reveal a previously unreported role for SFK activity in the regulation of chromatin structure at promoters in eukaryotic cells via MOZ histone acetyltransferase activity.

They also reveal a previously unreported role for SFK activity in the regulation of chromatin structure at promoters in eukaryotic cells via MOZ histone acetyltransferase activity. The regulation of eukaryotic gene expression requires the coordinated action of a number of molecular mechanisms active within the cell. One key mechanism is selective activation of cellular signaling pathways to either activate or repress gene expression in response to cell stimulation (1Barolo S. Posakony J.W. Three habits of highly effective signaling pathways: principles of transcriptional control by developmental cell signaling.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (12023297): 1167-118110.1101/gad.976502Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a major contribution to the regulation of more than 20,000 human genes depends on a relatively small number of canonical signaling pathways (2Gerhart J. 1998 Warkany lecture: signaling pathways in development.Teratology. 1999; 60 (10508976): 226-23910.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199910)60:4%3C226::AID-TERA7%3E3.0.CO;2-WCrossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, how such complex patterns of gene regulation are performed by a limited number of pathways is an area of great interest. The key players in these pivotal signaling pathways have mostly been identified and characterized (2Gerhart J. 1998 Warkany lecture: signaling pathways in development.Teratology. 1999; 60 (10508976): 226-23910.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199910)60:4%3C226::AID-TERA7%3E3.0.CO;2-WCrossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, even more prescient is the question of how a particular pathway can evoke different effects depending on the stimulus and cell type in which it is being activated (1Barolo S. Posakony J.W. Three habits of highly effective signaling pathways: principles of transcriptional control by developmental cell signaling.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (12023297): 1167-118110.1101/gad.976502Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).

What is consistent is that reactivation is largely dependent on cellular mechanisms of gene regulation through the complimentary mechanisms of mimicry (the MIEP bears the hallmarks of an inflammatory promoter (20Meier J.L. Stinski M.F.

Ultimately, the HCMV genome is regulated by higher-order chromatin structure and, essentially, can be considered another eukaryotic genetic unit for the purpose of regulatory studies. human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter immediate-early extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase Src family kinase monocyte-derived dendritic cell monocyte-derived Langerhans cell hematopoietic cell kinase monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein cAMP response element–binding protein histone acetyltransferase acute myeloid leukemia multiplicity of infection histone H3 serine 10 histone H3 lysine 9 histone H3 lysine 14 MOZ, Ybf2, Sas2, Tip60 family quantitative RT-PCR. Here we show that ERK–MAPK–driven reactivation of HCMV viral gene expression depends on the concomitant activation of Src family kinase (SFK) signaling in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). We link this to the activation of SFK member hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), which is highly expressed in cells that support reactivation; consequently, its deletion from cells is sufficient to abrogate reactivation. Through molecular studies, we show for the first time that SFK signaling can drive histone acetylation and does this, in part, via recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase MOZ to the MIEP. Thus, SFK activity works after ERK-MAPK signaling to potentiate an open chromatin structure, ensuring that reactivation proceeds after exit from latency. We have observed previously that IL-6–ERK–MAPK signaling promotes HCMV reactivation in MoDCs but not undifferentiated progenitors (8Reeves M.B. Compton T. Inhibition of inflammatory interleukin-6 activity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling antagonizes human cytomegalovirus reactivation from dendritic cells.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21937636): 12750-1275810.1128/JVI.05878-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and, consistent with this, delivery of a dominant negative version of the ERK1/2 kinase MEK1 (an inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation) inhibits reactivation (16Kew V.G. Yuan J. Meier J. Reeves M.B. Mitogen and stress activated kinases act co-operatively with CREB during the induction of human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene expression from latency.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24945302): e100419510.1371/journal.ppat.1004195Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, our first experiments tested the reciprocal experiment: delivery of a constitutively active version of MEK1. The data showed that activation of ERK by delivery of a constitutively active version of MEK kinase does not trigger the full induction of viral IE gene expression (Fig. 1a), despite evidence of increased ERK phosphorylation in the cells (Fig. 1b). This, in the context of our previous results, suggested that activation of ERK alone was not sufficient for induction of viral gene expression. To investigate this further, we took advantage of a previous study we had performed, in which we demonstrated that, when we altered the culture conditions and promoted monocytes to differentiate into immature monocyte-derived Langerhans-like cells (MoLCs), they did not support IL-6–induced reactivation, unlike what was observed in MoDCs (21Huang M.M. Kew V.G. Jestice K. Wills M.R. Reeves M.B. Efficient human cytomegalovirus reactivation is maturation dependent in the Langerhans dendritic cell lineage and can be studied using a CD14+ experimental latency model.J. Virol. 2012; 86 (22647696): 8507-851510.1128/JVI.00598-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggested that the pathway of differentiation was playing an important role in the reactivation phenotype. However, an analysis of MoLCs demonstrated that they were clearly IL-6–responsive so that IL-6 promoted ERK phosphorylation in MoLCs (Fig. 1c), which was consistent with the observation that both MoDCs and MoLCs express similar levels of the IL-6 receptor on their cell surface (Fig. 1d). All of these observations suggested that the intracellular context in which IL-6 was activating ERK could be important. Thus, we decided to investigate whether IL-6 was concomitantly activating additional pathways in MoDCs that could explain the differential reactivation phenotype between the two cell types. To do this, comparative phosphoproteomics of IL-6–stimulated MoLCs and MoDCs were performed (Fig. 1e and Fig. S1). This confirmed that MoLCs were responsive to IL-6, with evidence of both ERK and Stat activation detected (Fig. S1). Although the pattern of phosphorylation was broadly similar, a number of differences in protein phosphorylation profiles were observed between the two cell types in response to IL-6 (Fig. 1f and Fig. S1). We noted that the biggest changes in protein phosphorylation were observed with two SFKs, HCK and Src itself; thus, we investigated this family of kinases further. To find out whether SFK activity was important for HCMV reactivation, we tested the effect of SFK inhibitors on HCMV reactivation from latency. Pretreatment of latently infected MoDCs with SFK inhibitors prior to IL-6 was sufficient to reduce IL-6–induced IE gene expression from both experimental and natural latency when analyzed 16 h after stimulation (Fig. 2, a and c). No comparable effect on IE gene expression was evident in primary infection of MoDCs or fibroblasts (Fig. S2), nor was IL-6–induced expression of c-fos mRNA affected in reactivating MoDCs (Fig. 2b), suggesting that pan-inhibition of IL-6–responsive genes was not occurring and, furthermore, that the requirement for SFK activity to drive viral IE gene expression was restricted to latency and reactivation. Unlike Src, which is expressed in most cells, HCK expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells (22Poh A.R. O'Donoghue R.J. Ernst M. Hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as a therapeutic target in immune and cancer cells.Oncotarget. 2015; 6 (26087188): 15752-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Coupled with the observation that HCK expression was higher in myeloid cells that support HCMV reactivation (Fig. 2d), we chose to investigate HCK further. Using siRNAs, we transiently depleted HCK from MoDCs (Fig. 2e). Loss of HCK resulted in a clear decrease in IE gene expression in response to IL-6 (Fig. 2f). Again, the effect on IE RNA did not reflect global shutdown of IL-6–induced gene expression, as a number of other IL-6–responsive genes were relatively unaffected in HCK knockdown cells (Fig. 2g). Thus, HCK activity was an important component of SFK-induced reactivation of HCMV and was having a particularly strong effect on HCMV gene expression in MoDCs. The observed inhibition of IE gene expression in our studies suggested that SFK/HCK activity was particularly important during the initial stages of reactivation, when a key viral promoter (the MIEP) must be activated. An important mechanism of regulation at the MIEP involves the activity of higher-order chromatin structure (6Reeves M.B. MacAry P.A. Lehner P.J. Sissons J.G. Sinclair J.H.

Most recently, we linked changes in chromatin structure required for reactivation with ERK-driven activation of cellular kinases, mitogen, and stress-activated kinases, which promote histone phosphorylation at the MIEP in a CREB transcription factor–dependent manner in MoDCs (16Kew V.G. Yuan J. Meier J. Reeves M.B. Mitogen and stress activated kinases act co-operatively with CREB during the induction of human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene expression from latency.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24945302): e100419510.1371/journal.ppat.1004195Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, this concept of histone phosphorylation for reactivation of viral gene expression is an emerging theme in herpes virology (25Cliffe A.R. Arbuckle J.H. Vogel J.L. Geden M.J. Rothbart S.B.

Neuronal stress pathway mediating a histone methyl/phospho switch is required for herpes simplex virus reactivation.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 (26651941): 649-65810.1016/j.chom.2015.11.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Cheng F.

Given the importance of chromatin in viral reactivation, we asked what, if any, effect SFK inhibitors had on the chromatin phenotype at the MIEP (Fig. 3). As expected, in reactivating MoDCs stimulated with IL-6 histone, H3S10 phosphorylation and H3K14 acetylation predominated at the reactivating MIEP and was concomitant with a reduction in H3K9 methylation (Fig. 3a). In contrast, 2 h after IL-6, in the presence of the SFK inhibitor PP2, the chromatin phenotype copied the latent MIEP phenotype prior to IL-6 addition (Fig. 3a). This suggested that SFK activity could be co-involved in H3S10 phosphorylation with ERK. However, analysis of the MIEP at earlier time points revealed that, 30 min after IL-6 H3S10, phosphorylation at the MIEP was evident even in PP2-treated cells despite being reversed by 2 h (Fig. 3b). This transient H3S10 phosphorylation was concomitant with the loss of HP1 from the MIEP (Fig. 3c); H3S10 phosphorylation has been hypothesized to promote HP1 dissociation from methylated histones (27Fischle W. Tseng B.S. Dormann H.L. Ueberheide B.M. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Funabiki H. Allis C.D. Regulation of HP1-chromatin binding by histone H3 methylation and phosphorylation.Nature. 2005; 438 (16222246): 1116-112210.1038/nature04219Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Indeed, few differences in chromatin phenotype at the MIEP were observed between control and PP2-treated MoDCs at 30 min, except histone H3K14 acetylation was reduced (Fig. 3, d and e). This suggested a model whereby ERK was initiating chromatin modifications at the MIEP, but additional cellular signaling (i.e. SFK signaling) was required to potentiate the effects after ERK. To test the hypothesis that ERK is important for initiating reversal of the chromatin phenotype but that the effect is potentiated by SFK activity, we sought to identify the histone acetyltransferase responsible for HCMV reactivation because this would likely be involved at the MIEP after ERK-mediated histone phosphorylation. Although the focus of our study is on HCMV reactivation in MoDCs, we chose to include an analysis of reactivation in macrophage-like cells to test whether the same HAT was responsible in multiple cell types that support HCMV reactivation. To do this, we used pharmacological inhibitors of cellular HAT activity in two models of HCMV reactivation: our MoDC model and also the THP1 macrophage model. In the THP1 model cell line, we observed that MG149 (an inhibitor of MOZ and Tip60 HATs) reduced IE gene expression (Fig. S3a). A titration of the MYST family inhibitor MG149 (which has different activities depending on concentration) and the relative inability of a Tip60-specific inhibitor (NU9056) to inhibit IE gene expression suggested that MOZ was the HAT most important for reactivation in THP1 cells (Fig. S3b). Interestingly, in the MoDC model, the phenotype was different. In these cells, inhibitors of p300 (C646) and MYST family HATs (MG149) had the biggest effect on IE gene expression (Fig. 4a). Again, titration of MG149 alongside a lack of activity of NU9056 suggested that it was MOZ, and not Tip60, that was important for reactivation in MoDCs (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the failure of CPTH2 and NU9056 to prevent reactivation was not due to these inhibitors reducing histone acetylation in cells (Fig. 4c). However, the data obtained using C646 also suggested that p300 activity appeared to be more important for reactivation in the MoDC model, in contrast with the THP1 macrophage cell line, where very little effect was observed with C646 (Fig. S3). This MoDC-specific effect on reactivation with C646 could be recapitulated with an inhibitor of the transcription factor CREB (66615), a known interaction partner of p300 (Fig. S4). Specifically, 66615 inhibited reactivation in MoDCs but not THP1 cells (Fig. S4a), despite 66615 being active in the THP1 cell line (Fig. S4b). For the purpose of this study, we chose to focus on the suggestion that MOZ activity is centrally important in both models of HCMV latency and reactivation tested. However, although the pharmacological data argued for a role of MOZ, we sought to confirm this genetically prior to further investigation of the effect of MOZ on HCMV reactivation. To do this, MoDCs were transfected with MOZ-targeted siRNAs or a nontargeting control, and 48 h later, reactivation was stimulated with IL-6. The data demonstrate that depletion of MOZ from DCs (Fig. 4d) was sufficient to reduce viral IE gene expression in response to IL-6 (Fig. 4e); thus, pharmacological and genetic depletion of MOZ activity in MoDCs was sufficient to prevent HCMV reactivation. The demonstration that MOZ was important for reactivation did not determine whether the effects were direct or indirect. To begin to address this, we utilized ChIP analyses to demonstrate that MOZ was bound to the MIEP during the early stages of viral reactivation, arguing that it played a direct role in the regulation of IE gene expression (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, pretreatment with the SFK inhibitor PP2 prevented recruitment of MOZ to the MIEP, suggesting that activation of SFK signaling was driving the recruitment of MOZ (Fig. 5a). Consistent with MOZ binding being important for histone modifications occurring at the MIEP during reactivation, it was demonstrated that acetylation of histone H4 at the MIEP was markedly reduced in MG149-treated cells 2 h after IL-6 (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, it was clear from the analyses that histone demethylation or prolonged histone phosphorylation were only partially impaired, suggesting that these events preceded or were independent of MOZ activity (Fig. 5b). These data reinforce the view that HCMV reactivation is highly dependent on cellular mechanisms of gene regulation. Furthermore, they demonstrate a novel role for SFK signaling in the control of gene expression via chromatin modifications. Specifically, we show that ERK–MAPK–driven HCMV reactivation depends on the concomitant activation of SFK signaling in response to IL-6. A key event for reactivation is the availability and activation of HCK,"
https://openalex.org/W2953886254,"Background In the state of Bihar, India a multi-faceted quality improvement nurse-mentoring program was implemented to improve provider skills in normal and complicated deliveries. The objective of this analysis was to examine changes in diagnosis and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) of the mother and intrapartum asphyxia of the infant in primary care facilities in Bihar, during the program. Methods During the program, mentor pairs visited each facility for one week, covering four facilities over a four-week period and returned for subsequent week-long visits once every month for seven to nine consecutive months. Between- and within-facility comparisons were made using a quasi-experimental and a longitudinal design over time, respectively, to measure change due to the intervention. The proportions of PPH and intrapartum asphyxia among all births as well as the proportions of PPH and intrapartum asphyxia cases that were effectively managed were examined. Zero-inflated negative binomial models and marginal structural methodology were used to assess change in diagnosis and management of complications after accounting for clustering of deliveries within facilities as well as time varying confounding. Results This analysis included 55,938 deliveries from 320 facilities. About 2% of all deliveries, were complicated with PPH and 3% with intrapartum asphyxia. Between-facility comparisons across phases demonstrated diagnosis was always higher in the final week of intervention (PPH: 2.5–5.4%, intrapartum asphyxia: 4.2–5.6%) relative to the first week (PPH: 1.2–2.1%, intrapartum asphyxia: 0.7–3.3%). Within-facility comparisons showed PPH diagnosis increased from week 1 through 5 (from 1.6% to 4.4%), after which it decreased through week 7 (3.1%). A similar trend was observed for intrapartum asphyxia. For both outcomes, the proportion of diagnosed cases where selected evidence-based practices were used for management either remained stable or increased over time. Conclusions The nurse-mentoring program appears to have built providers’ capacity to identify PPH and intrapartum asphyxia cases but diagnosis levels are still not on par with levels observed in Southeast Asia and globally."

The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce C. jejuni chicken colonization. Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81–176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81–176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal colonization below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of C. jejuni colonization at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against C. jejuni colonization in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites."

In addition to the effect of chronic pain on well-being, chronic pain has also been associated with poor health conditions and increased mortality. Due to its multifactorial origin, the classification of pain types remains challenging. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small molecules that regulate gene expression. They are released into the bloodstream in a stable manner under normal and pathological conditions and have been described as potential biomarkers. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether pain may induce an aberrant, specific dysregulation of miRNA expression, depending on the origin of the pain.To do so, we measured the expression changes of 184 circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) in the plasma samples of patients with different origins of chronic musculoskeletal pain. After statistical analyses, we identified seven c-miRNA candidates that were differentially expressed depending on the nociceptive or neuropathic origin of the pain. We then developed a two c-miRNA signature (hsa-miR-320a and hsa-miR-98-5p) that was able to correctly classify the pain type of 70% of the patients from the validation set.In conclusion, circulating miRNAs are promising biomarkers to identify and characterize the chronic pain type and to further improve its clinical management."

The influence of diving experience on perceptions was determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Experienced divers provided positive self-assessments, were less satisfied with dive sites’ health and management, and viewed the impacts of scuba diving activities less critically than novice divers. Scuba diving experience exerted similar influences on divers, regardless of the study area. However, remarkable differences also emerged between the study areas. Therefore, the use of generalisations on scuba diving experience remains a delicate issue. Recommendations were formulated for the management of experienced scuba diving markets and for the use of generalisations on diving experience to manage diving destinations."

https://openalex.org/W2953861580,"Ebolaviruses continue to inflict horrific disease and instill fear. The 2013–2016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from ~130 to ~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GPcl) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GPcl is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GPcl. Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GPcl-mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GPcl binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factors—cations (Ca++ and K+), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and L—did not induce detectable fusion. Our findings are in line with the earlier proposal that an additional factor is required to trigger the full fusion activity of GPcl after binding to NPC1. We discuss caveats to our study and what the missing factor(s) might be."

The aim of this project was to estimate the double burden of DM hypertension and TB and to pilot the integration of the screening for DM and hypertension in the TB national programs in six TB centers in Luanda, Angola.All newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) patients accessing six directly observed treatment (DOT) centers in Luanda were screened for diabetes and hypertension. TB diagnosis was made clinically and/or with sputum microscopy DM diagnosis was made through estimation of either fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (considered positive if ≥ 7∙0mmol/l) or random plasma glucose (considered positive if ≥ 11∙1mmol/l). Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 140 mm of Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90 mm of Hg, irrespective of use of antihypertensive drug.Between January 2015 and December 2016, a total of 7,205 newly diagnosed patients with PTB were included in the analysis; 3,598 (49∙9%) were males and 3,607 females. Among 7,205 PTB patients enrolled, blood pressure was measured in 6,954 and 1,352 (19∙4%) were found to have uncontrolled hypertension, more frequently in females (23%) compared to males (16%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis uncontrolled hypertension was associated with increasing age and BMI and ethnic group. The crude prevalence of DM among TB patients was close to 6%, slightly higher in males (6∙3%) compared to females (5∙7%). Age adjusted prevalence was 8%. Impaired fasting glucose (>6∙1 to <7∙0 mmol/L) was detected in 414 patients (7%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis DM prevalence was higher in males and increased with increasing age and BMI.TB patients have a considerable hypertension and diabetes co-morbidity.

Participants self-reported insufficient sleep (number of days without sufficient rest/sleep in the last month; categorized as 0, 1-13, 14-29, or ≥30 days), sleep duration (over average 24 hours; categorized as ≤6 [short sleeper], 7-9 [optimal sleeper], or ≥10 hours [long sleeper]), and unintentional daytime sleep (number of days with unintentional sleep in the last month; categorized as 0 vs ≥30 days). Physical activity was assessed subjectively using the BRFSS Physical Activity Questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between physical activity and sleep problems, controlling for age, sex, race, education, body mass, months homeless, at-risk drinking, self-rated health, serious mental illness, smoking status, and recruitment city.Failure to meet/exceed physical activity guidelines was associated with higher likelihood of being a long sleeper (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.46, 4.78) but a lower likelihood of having ≥30 days of insufficient rest/sleep (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.93).Findings suggest that physical activity promotion may hold promise for addressing the problem of too much sleep, but not other manifestations of sleep problems among this vulnerable group."
https://openalex.org/W2955537785,"Background Sleep disorders and vitamin D deficiency are among the most common health problems. Few studies investigated the effect of vitamin D on objectively recorded sleep with sound methodological quality and reasonable temporal proximity. Objective To investigate the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and objective sleep parameters assessed within close temporal proximity in a population-based sample. It is expected that higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with 1) better objective sleep outcomes (longer sleep duration, higher sleep efficiency, earlier mid-sleep time) and 2) more positive subjective sleep evaluations. Methods A subset of participants (n = 1045) from the LIFE-Adult-Study was analysed. Measurement of serum 25(OH)D vitamin was performed using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Actigraphic assessments were performed using SenseWear Pro 3 devices. The following objective sleep parameters were calculated: total sleep duration, night sleep duration, night sleep efficiency, midsleep time and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Subjective sleep evaluations were assessed via questionnaire (sleep quality (PSQI), daytime sleepiness (ESS)). Data were analysed applying a multiple linear regression model with a stepwise approach. Results The regression models revealed significant associations of serum 25(OH)D concentration with night sleep duration and midsleep time. No association was found for total sleep duration and night sleep efficiency. Higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was further associated with shorter WASO in males but longer WASO in females. Moreover, serum 25(OH)D concentration did not show any significant association with subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion The results indicate that a higher concentration of serum 25(OH)D is associated with longer and earlier night sleep. Although the present study was able to demonstrate an association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and objective sleep parameters, no conclusion about underlying mechanisms or causal inferences can be drawn."
https://openalex.org/W2956160046,"Background The population of stallion spermatozoa that survive thawing experience compromised mitochondrial functionality and accelerated senescence, among other changes. It is known that stallion spermatozoa show very active oxidative phosphorylation that may accelerate sperm senescence through increased production of reactive oxygen species. Rosiglitazone has been proven to enhance the glycolytic capability of stallion spermatozoa maintained at ambient temperature. Objectives Thus, we hypothesized that thawed sperm may also benefit from rosiglitazone supplementation. Materials and methods Thawed sperm were washed and resuspended in Tyrodes media, and the samples were divided and supplemented with 0 or 75 μM rosiglitazone. After one and two hours of incubation, mitochondrial functionality, Akt phosphorylation and caspase 3 activity were evaluated. Additional samples were incubated in the presence of an Akt1/2 inhibitor, compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) or GW9662 (an antagonist of the PPARγ receptor). Results Rosiglitazone maintained Akt phosphorylation and reduced caspase 3 activation (p<0.01), both of which were prevented by incubation in the presence of the three inhibitors. Rosiglitazone also enhanced mitochondrial functionality (P<0.01). Conclusion We provide the first evidence that the functionality of frozen stallion spermatozoa can be potentially improved after thawing through the activation of pro survival pathways, providing new clues for improving current sperm biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2953478819,"Objective The current paradigm in the treatment of patients with non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) is a diagnostic lobectomy rather than complete thyroidectomy and postoperative radioiodine treatment. Consequently, preoperative diagnosis of NIFTP is considered to be important. Methods We performed the comprehensive analysis for diagnosis of preoperative 20 NIFTPs in comparison with 41 invasive encapsulated follicular papillary thyroid carcinomas (I-EFVPTCs) using the Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS), Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC), and molecular analysis for BRAF and RAS mutations. Results K-TIRADS 3 was identified as the most common sonographic diagnosis in both NIFTP and I-EFVPTC. Unlike I-EFVPTC, K-TIRADS 5 was not identified in NIFTP. AUS/FLUS was the most common cytopathological diagnosis and none of the cases were classified as malignant category in both groups, although the difference in distribution was not significant between the groups. BRAF mutation was not found in NIFTP but was present in 9.8% of cases in I-EFVPTC. The frequency of RAS mutation in I-EFVPTCs was twice as high as that of NIFTP. Wild-type BRAF and RAS in NIFTP was significantly higher than I-EFVPTC. Conclusion The existence of overlapping features between the groups was evident, hence conclusive distinction between radiology, cytology and molecular analysis could not be achieved. Apparently, the diagnosis of NIFTP based on comprehensive analysis was not confirmable but could perceive or at least favor the diagnosis of NIFTP."
https://openalex.org/W2953928386,"Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM) MRI can accurately measure regional myocardial velocities and strain. The lengthy data acquisition, however, renders TPM prone to errors due to variations in physiological parameters, and reduces data yield and experimental throughput. The purpose of the present study is to examine the quality of functional measures (velocity and strain) obtained by highly undersampled TPM data using compressed sensing reconstruction in infarcted and non-infarcted rat hearts.Three fully sampled left-ventricular short-axis TPM slices were acquired from 5 non-infarcted rat hearts and 12 infarcted rat hearts in vivo. The datasets were used to generate retrospectively (simulated) undersampled TPM datasets, with undersampling factors of 2, 4, 8 and 16. Myocardial velocities and circumferential strain were calculated from all datasets. The error introduced from undersampling was then measured and compared to the fully sampled data in order to validate the method. Finally, prospectively undersampled data were acquired and compared to the fully sampled datasets.Bland Altman analysis of the retrospectively undersampled and fully sampled data revealed narrow limits of agreement and little bias (global radial velocity: median bias = -0.01 cm/s, 95% limits of agreement = [-0.16, 0.20] cm/s, global circumferential strain: median bias = -0.01%strain, 95% limits of agreement = [-0.43, 0.51] %strain, all for 4x undersampled data at the mid-ventricular level). The prospectively undersampled TPM datasets successfully demonstrated the feasibility of method implementation.Through compressed sensing reconstruction, highly undersampled TPM data can be used to accurately measure the velocity and strain of the infarcted and non-infarcted rat myocardium in vivo, thereby increasing experimental throughput and simultaneously reducing error introduced by physiological variations over time."

https://openalex.org/W2955767478,"Background Childhood obesity is a world-wide concern due to its growing prevalence and association with cardiometabolic risk factors in childhood and subsequent adult cardiovascular disease. In young pre-school children, there is uncertainty regarding which of the commonly used anthropometric measures of childhood obesity is best associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. This study compared the utility of common measures used in identifying obesity in these young children. Methods The four commonly used metrics for identifying obesity in children: body fat percentage ≥ 90th percentile, waist circumference ≥ 90th percentile, BMI z score > 2 SD and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) ≥ 0.5, were measured in a cohort of children born singleton, at full term and followed from birth (n = 761) to 5 years of age (n = 513). The utility of each in identifying cardiometabolic risk factors (fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure) was examined. Results At age 5 years, children with percent body fat ≥ 90th percentile or waist circumference ≥ 90th percentile, were associated with higher levels of triglycerides, glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures than those < 90th percentile, respectively. Such differences were not obvious at age 3 years or at birth. A BMI z-score > 2 SD was associated with higher levels of triglycerides and systolic and diastolic blood pressure but not glucose at age 5 years. Differences in HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose and systolic blood pressure were observed in children with BMI z score > 2 SD at age 3 years but not with the other indices of obesity. As almost all children had WHtR ≥ 0.5 at birth, ages 1 and 3 years, this measure could not differentiate increased cardiometabolic risk. At age 5 years, the differences were much more obvious, with significant differences in triglycerides and systolic and diastolic blood pressures between those with WHtR ≥ 0.5 and those with < 0.5. Conclusion Each of the four commonly used measures of childhood obesity shows moderate associations with cardiometabolic risk factors at 5 years, with no advantage of one measure over the other. These associations were less consistent at 3 years of age or younger. These observations have not been reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W2955999329,"In this paper we describe two assemblages of flint retouchers or “bulb retouchers” retrieved from Nesher Ramla and Quneitra, two Middle Palaeolithic, open-air sites in the Levant. The site of Nesher Ramla yielded the largest assemblage of bulb retouchers (n = 159) currently known, allowing a detailed investigation of this poorly known phenomenon. An extensive experimental program and use-wear analysis enabled us to characterize the different sets of traces related to the retouching activity and to identify different motions applied by the knappers in the course of this action. In both sites, blanks used as bulb retouchers were almost exclusively retouched items, with a special emphasis on convergent morphotypes in Nesher Ramla. The use of retouched items as bulb retouchers is a common trait over different time spans and geographical areas. Our data suggests that bulb retouchers were versatile, multi-purpose tools with a long use-life, transported over long distances as components of the hunter-gatherer mobile tool kit. The high frequencies of bulb retouchers within some archaeological units of Nesher Ramla appear to be connected to the highly curated nature of the lithic assemblages, in turn reflecting a high mobility of the human groups that produced them."
https://openalex.org/W2955643247,"RebiQoL was a phase IV multicenter randomized study to assess the impact of a telemedicine patient support program (MSP) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) being administered with Rebif with the RebiSmart device. The primary endpoint was to assess the impact of MSP compared to patients only receiving technical support for RebiSmart on HRQoL at 12 months, using the psychological part of Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), in patients administered with Rebif. A total of 97 patients diagnosed with RRMS were screened for participation in the study of which 3 patients did not fulfill the eligibility criteria and 1 patient withdrew consent. Of the 93 randomized patients, 46 were randomized to MSP and 47 to Technical support only. The demographic characteristics of the patients were well-balanced in the two arms. There were no statistical differences (linear mixed model) in any of the primary (difference of 0.48, 95% CI: -8.30–9.25, p = 0.91) or secondary outcomes (p>0.05). Although the study was slightly underpowered, there was a trend towards better adherence in the MSP group (OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.85–14.40, p = 0.08) although not statistically significant. No unexpected adverse events occurred. This study did not show a statistically significant effect of the particular form of teleintervention used in this study on HRQoL as compared to pure technical support, for MS patients already receiving Rebif with the RebiSmart device.

https://openalex.org/W2953654852,"State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) arise from a resonance phenomenon in the visual cortex that is produced by a repetitive visual stimulus. SSVEPs have long been considered a steady-state response resulting from purely oscillatory components phase locked with the stimulation source, matching the stimulation frequency and its harmonics. Here we explore the dynamical character of the SSVEP response by proposing a novel non-stationary methodology for SSVEP detection based on an ensemble of Echo State Networks (ESN). The performance of this dynamical approach is compared to stationary canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for the detection of 6 visual stimulation frequencies ranging from 12 to 22 Hz. ESN-based methodology outperformed CCA, achieving an average information transfer rate of 47 bits/minute when simulating a BCI system of 6 degrees of freedom. However, for some subjects and stimulation frequencies the detection accuracy of CCA exceeds that of ESN. The comparison suggests that each methodology captures different features of the SSVEP response: while CCA captures purely stationary patterns, the ESN-based approach presented here is capable of detecting the non-stationary nature of the SSVEP."

Experience is also associated with personality characteristics such as extraversion and Autism, yet the effects of these variables on the own-gender bias has not been explored. We ran a face recognition study exploring the relationships between own-gender experience, holistic processing (measured using the face-inversion effect, composite face effect, and the parts-and-wholes test), personality characteristics (extraversion and Autism Quotient) and the OGB. Findings did not support a mediational account where experience increases holistic processing and this increases the OGB. Rather, there was a direct relationship between extraversion and Autism Quotient and the OGB. We interpret this as personality characteristics having an effect on the motivation to process own-gender faces more deeply than opposite-gender faces."
https://openalex.org/W2955524390,"Recent research in machine learning pointed to the core problem of state-of-the-art models which impedes their widespread adoption in different domains. The models' inability to differentiate between noise and subtle, yet significant variation in data leads to their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations that cause wrong predictions with high confidence. The study is aimed at identifying whether the algorithms inspired by biological evolution may achieve better results in cases where brittle robustness properties are highly sensitive to the slight noise. To answer this question, we introduce the new robust gradient descent inspired by the stability and adaptability of biological systems to unknown and changing environments. The proposed optimization technique involves an open-ended adaptation process with regard to two hyperparameters inherited from the generalized Verhulst population growth equation. The hyperparameters increase robustness to adversarial noise by penalizing the degree to which hardly visible changes in gradients impact prediction. The empirical evidence on synthetic and experimental datasets confirmed the viability of the bio-inspired gradient descent and suggested promising directions for future research. The code used for computational experiments is provided in a repository at https://github.com/yukinoi/bio_gradient_descent."

https://openalex.org/W2954621556,"I never thought I would spend so much of my time and money setting up still-life–worthy displays of flaky croissants and shiny fruit for people who are judging my science, and that of my colleagues. Yet that's the expectation: At my university, and many others, students bring food to our thesis committee meetings and defenses, adding to the already sky-high pressure. My first taste of it came 5 years ago, for my first committee meeting. I prepared furiously. I meticulously proofread my written proposal and aligned all the figures. My slides all used the same font. I had even prepared some extra slides to address possible questions my judges might ask. Even so, I was sure the meeting was doomed—because I didn't know how to make coffee.

> “Committees shouldn't expect students to provide lavish spreads.” 

In my mind, one drop of burnt coffee would cause my judges to kick me aside like a stray dog. One bite of stale pastry would put them in a mood so foul I would be carted back to the humble Pennsylvania town where I grew up, then forced into my high school job as a Wendy's drive-thru operator. Of course, I knew logically that these things were unlikely to happen, but the pressure of a committee meeting often sends logic out the window.

So in the hours before the meeting, when I should have been looking over my slides, skimming key papers, or even relaxing a bit, I was standing numbly in front of the lab coffee maker—a Rubik's Cube I couldn't solve. Discouraged, I tackled a problem more within my reach: plating the fresh almond croissants I had trekked 20 blocks uptown to fetch earlier that morning. (I had made the mistake of wearing my meeting outfit—a button-down that made me feel like a capable adult—and the humidity had left me with pit stains like a character in a deodorant commercial; good thing I had a backup outfit.)

But once the croissants were settled on the wooden cutting board and the perfectly ripe grapes were in their cute owl-decorated bowl, I turned back to the dreaded coffee maker and felt my perfectly prepared world crumbling around me. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Joan. One year ahead of me in grad school, Joan had already been through the gauntlet I was about to face. Even more important, she was a fervent coffee drinker.

“Hey Joan!” I yelped, trying to keep my cool. “How would you like to help me make coffee for my meeting?” She gave me a knowing look, the kind of look that says she's been there and come out the other side. Of course, she agreed to help.

In the end, the meeting went fine. But my lack of coffee-making knowledge shook my confidence in my abilities as a scientist more than it should have.

Since then, the grad students in my lab have made a pact to help each other with snacks for these meetings. This year, we banded together to create a delectable offering for Joan's thesis defense. She had been through all our committee meetings with us, and if we could help her with some sandwiches and a fruit salad, we were going to do it. She didn't need the stress of remembering when to hit the button on the coffee maker while also remembering the molecular weights of all the proteins in the nuclear pore complex.

Our camaraderie doesn't make the expectation less of a burden, though. Graduate students want to do everything in our power to please our committee members as we describe our research plans and show we are capable scientists. But that should mean spending time preparing and thinking, not stressing ourselves out to buy and serve croissants. I'm lucky to have some of the best fellow grad students-slash-event planners anyone could ask for, but many students don't have this sort of network or tradition.

The solution is easy: Committees shouldn't expect students to provide lavish spreads, or anything at all. We shouldn't have to spend our money buying overpriced fruit salad or know how to make coffee to be considered successful graduate students. Our research should be enough.
