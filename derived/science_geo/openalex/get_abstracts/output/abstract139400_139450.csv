https://openalex.org/W2144882745,"Clinical evidence suggests that cellular immunity is involved in controlling human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1) replication. An animal model of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected rhesus monkey, was used to show that virus replication is not controlled in monkeys depleted of CD8 + lymphocytes during primary SIV infection. Eliminating CD8 + lymphocytes from monkeys during chronic SIV infection resulted in a rapid and marked increase in viremia that was again suppressed coincident with the reappearance of SIV-specific CD8 + T cells. These results confirm the importance of cell-mediated immunity in controlling HIV-1 infection and support the exploration of vaccination approaches for preventing infection that will elicit these immune responses."

The chemokine stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 were found to be critical for murine bone marrow engraftment by human severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) repopulating stem cells. Treatment of human cells with antibodies to CXCR4 prevented engraftment. In vitro CXCR4-dependent migration to SDF-1 of CD34 + CD38 −/low cells correlated with in vivo engraftment and stem cell function. Stem cell factor and interleukin-6 induced CXCR4 expression on CD34 + cells, which potentiated migration to SDF-1 and engraftment in primary and secondary transplanted mice. Thus, up-regulation of CXCR4 expression may be useful for improving engraftment of repopulating stem cells in clinical transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W1999665858,"The gate bias dependence of the field-effect mobility in pentacene-based insulated gate field-effect transistors (IGFETs) was interpreted on the basis of the interaction of charge carriers with localized trap levels in the band gap. This understanding was used to design and fabricate IGFETs with mobility of more than 0.3 square centimeter per volt per second and current modulation of 10 5 , with the use of amorphous metal oxide gate insulators. These values were obtained at operating voltage ranges as low as 5 volts, which are much smaller than previously reported results. An all-room-temperature fabrication process sequence was used, which enabled the demonstration of high-performance organic IGFETs on transparent plastic substrates, at low operating voltages for organic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2077408214,"Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a severe human skin disease that occurs primarily in Africa and Australia. Infection with M. ulcerans results in persistent severe necrosis without an acute inflammatory response. The presence of histopathological changes distant from the site of infection suggested that pathogenesis might be toxin mediated. A polyketide-derived macrolide designated mycolactone was isolated that causes cytopathicity and cell cycle arrest in cultured L929 murine fibroblasts. Intradermal inoculation of purified toxin into guinea pigs produced a lesion similar to that of Buruli ulcer in humans. This toxin may represent one of a family of virulence factors associated with pathology in mycobacterial diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2057961805,"Virus-specific antibodies protect individuals against a wide variety of viral infections. To assess whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope-specific antibodies confer resistance against primate lentivirus infections, we purified immunoglobulin (IgG) from chimpanzees infected with several different HIV-1 isolates, and used this for passive immunization of pig-tailed macaques. These monkeys were subsequently challenged intravenously with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) bearing an envelope glycoprotein derived form HIV-1DH12, a dual-tropic primary virus isolate. Here we show that anti-SHIV neutralizing activity, determined in vitro using an assay measuring loss of infectivity, is the absolute requirement for antibody-mediated protection in vivo. Using an assay that measures 100% neutralization, the titer in plasma for complete protection of the SHIV-challenged macaques was in the range of 1:5-1:8. The HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies studied are able to bind to native gp120 present on infectious virus particles. Administration of non-neutralizing anti-HIV IgG neither inhibited nor enhanced a subsequent SHIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2089685532,"The abnormally high number of centrosomes found in many human tumor cells can lead directly to aneuploidy and genomic instability through the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. To facilitate investigation of the mechanisms that control centrosome reproduction, a frog egg extract arrested in S phase of the cell cycle that supported repeated assembly of daughter centrosomes was developed. Multiple rounds of centrosome reproduction were blocked by selective inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2–cyclin E (Cdk2-E) and were restored by addition of purified Cdk2-E. Confocal immunomicroscopy revealed that cyclin E was localized at the centrosome. These results demonstrate that Cdk2-E activity is required for centrosome duplication during S phase and suggest a mechanism that could coordinate centrosome reproduction with cycles of DNA synthesis and mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2093335630,"Oligomerization of a peptide was attempted in a flow reactor that simulated a submarine hydrothermal system. When fluid containing glycine repeatedly circulated through the hot and cold regions in the reactor, oligopeptides were made from glycine. When divalent ions (such as copper ions) were added under acidic conditions, oligoglycine was elongated up to hexaglycine. This observation suggests that prebiotic monomers could have oligomerized in the vicinity of submarine hydrothermal vents on primitive Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2094320554,"Discs of finite size are a very rare form of stable surfactant self-assembly. It is shown that mixing of two oppositely charged single-chain surfactants can produce rigid nanodiscs as well as swollen lamellar liquid crystals with frozen bilayers. The crucial requirement for obtaining nanodisc self-assembly is the use of H + and OH − as counterions. These counterions then form water and lower the conductivity to 10 microsiemens per centimeter. In the case of cationic component excess, a dilute solution of nanodiscs is in thermodynamic equilibrium with a lamellar phase. The diameter of the cationic nanodiscs is continuously adjustable from a few micrometers to 30 nanometers, with the positive charge located mainly around the edges."
https://openalex.org/W2065563101,"Diel fluorescence patterns were discovered in phytoplankton sampled over 7000 kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean that appear indicative of iron-limiting growth conditions. These patterns were rapidly lost after in situ iron enrichment and were not observed during a 15,000-kilometer transect in the Atlantic Ocean where iron concentrations are relatively high. Laboratory studies of marine Synechococcus sp. indicated that the patterns in the South Pacific are a unique manifestation of iron limitation on the fluorescence signature of state transitions. Results suggest that primary productivity is iron limited not only throughout the equatorial Pacific but also over much of the vast South Pacific gyre."

https://openalex.org/W1997774657,Electron transmission experiments demonstrate a large asymmetry in the scattering probability of polarized electrons by thin organized films of chiral molecules. This large asymmetry results from the interaction of the electron's wavefunction with many scatterers (molecules) in the organized monolayer structure and represents a manifestation of quantum interference on the scale of supramolecular lengths.

https://openalex.org/W2071871820,"Fatty acid transport protein (FATP), a plasma membrane protein implicated in controlling adipocyte transmembrane fatty acid flux, is up-regulated as a consequence of adipocyte differentiation and down-regulated by insulin. Based upon the sequence of the FATP gene upstream region (Hui, T. Y., Frohnert, B. I., Smith, A. J., Schaffer, J. A., and Bernlohr, D. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27420–27429) a putative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) is present from −458 to −474. To determine whether the FATP PPRE was functional, and responded to lipid activators, transient transfection of FATP-luciferase reporter constructs into CV-1 and 3T3-L1 cells was carried out. In CV-1 cells, FATP-luciferase activity was up-regulated 4- and 5.5-fold, respectively, by PPARα and PPARγ in the presence of their respective activators in a PPRE-dependent mechanism. PPARδ, however, was unable to mediate transcriptional activation under any condition. In 3T3-L1 cells, the PPRE conferred a small but significant increase in expression in preadipocytes, as well as a more robust up-regulation of FATP expression in adipocytes. Furthermore, the PPRE conferred the ability for luciferase expression to be up-regulated by activators of both PPARγ and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) in a synergistic manner. PPARα and PPARδ activators did not up-regulate FATP expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, however, suggesting that these two subtypes do not play a significant role in differentiation-dependent activation in fat cells. Electromobility shift assays showed that all three PPAR subtypes were able to bind specifically to the PPRE as heterodimers with RXRα. Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 adipocytes also showed a specific gel-shift complex with the FATP PPRE. To correlate the expression of FATP to its physiological function, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PPARγ and RXRα activators resulted in an increased uptake of oleate. Moreover, linoleic acid, a physiological ligand, up-regulated FATP expression 2-fold in a PPRE-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the FATP gene possesses a functional PPRE and is up-regulated by activators of PPARα and PPARγ, thereby linking the activity of the protein to the expression of its gene. Moreover, these results have implications for the mechanism by which certain PPARγ activators such as the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione drugs affect adipose lipid metabolism.

Obesity, defined as an excessive accumulation of body fat, has become an increasingly common health concern in industrialized societies. Excessive adiposity has been linked to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. The increased awareness of the detrimental effects of obesity contributes to the search for a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the accumulation of adipose tissue and its metabolism. A central issue in the function of fat tissue is the method by which adipocytes take up and release fatty acids. This process has been the source of considerable debate (1Berk P.D. Proc. Soc. Exp.

Because free fatty acids are hydrophobic, they freely crossed membranes by passive diffusion. However, studies in adipocytes, hepatocytes, jejunal enterocytes, skeletal muscle, and heart myocytes support a saturable, protein-mediated mechanism for fatty acid transport (4Abumrad N.A.

Thus far, five putative mammalian fatty acid transporters have been identified: fatty acid-binding protein (plasma membrane) (9Stremmel W. Strohmeyer G. Borchard F. Kochwa S. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl.

(13Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). FATP is an integral plasma membrane protein with four to six predicted membrane-spanning regions with the highest levels found in skeletal muscle, heart, and fat with lower levels in brain, kidney, lung, and liver. Although FATP mRNA is present at low levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, it is up-regulated 5–7-fold as a consequence of adipose conversion (13Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 14Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This increase is consistent with the increase in oleic acid uptake shown during preadipocyte differentiation (15Abumrad N.A. Forest C.C. Regen D.M. Sanders S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6008-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The differentiation of adipose precursor cells into adipocytes has been shown to be mediated by three groups of transcription factors: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ 1 and 2) the CCAATT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP), and the sterol-response element binding proteins (SREBP or ADD1) (16Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The importance of PPARs for the development and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype can be more directly shown by the existence of peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoters of several genes whose protein products are critical for lipid metabolism and the development of the adipocyte phenotype such as lipoprotein lipase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, acyl-CoA synthetase, malic enzyme, and adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP or aP2) (16Lemberger T.

PPARα is predominantly expressed in liver, heart, kidney, and adipose tissue, whereas PPARδ (also known as NUC1 or FAAR) shows a similar expression, with the exception of low levels in liver (22Chen F.

PPARγ1 is expressed in liver, heart, and kidney, similar to PPARα, whereas PPARγ2 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue (29Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The two PPARγ isoforms do not appear to differ significantly in ligand binding affinities, ability to bind DNA response elements, or ability to activate transcription. The critical difference identified, thus far, is the distribution of expression. FATP expression has been shown to be up-regulated in mouse liver by PPARα activators and in white adipose tissues by activators of PPARγ (30Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Staels B. Auwerx J.

This evidence, together with the differentiation-dependent regulation of FATP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, led us to investigate the upstream region of the recently cloned FATP gene (32Hui T.Y.

In this report we detail the regulation of the FATP gene, the identification of a functional PPRE, and its up-regulation by PPARα and PPARγ agonists. Troglitazone and Delta Selective C were gifts from Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis) and David E. Moller (Merck). WY14643 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Linoleic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid were purchased from Biomol. Expression plasmids prPPARα, pSG5-FAAR (PPARδ), pBS-PPARγ2, and pRS-hRXRα were provided by Drs. Donald Jump, Paul A. Grimaldi, Bruce M. Spiegelman, David J. Mangelsdorf, and Ronald M. Evans, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce NheI sites into the upstream sequence of FATP. Reporter constructs pNH11 (−971/+84), pNH13 (−556/+84), and pNH15 (−160/+84) were constructed by ligating varying lengths of FATP upstream sequence into the NheI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic luciferase expression vector (Promega). Construct pNH13ΔP was generated by single-stranded mutagenesis of construct pNH13 using the Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the oligonucleotide: 5′-CTGGAACATCTCCTGAGTACTTCCTCCTCTCCC-3′. Sequence fidelity and the introduced mutation were verified by sequencing. The PPARγ2 expression construct, pAH215, was made by cutting pBS-PPARγ2 withKpnI and XbaI and ligating into pCDNA3.1 (Promega). The expression construct for RXRα, pAH232, was subcloned from pRS-hRXRα into the EcoRI site of pCDNA3.1. CV-1 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until the day prior to transfection experiments, when the cells were plated in phenol red-free DMEM and 10% charcoal-treated FBS. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium-phosphate method as described previously (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar, 34Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, each well of a 12-well culture plate was transfected with 1 μg of firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter construct with or without 0.5 μg of expression plasmid for mouse PPARγ2, rat PPARα, or mouse PPARδ. 20 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega), a vector containing a sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase gene driven by an SV40 promoter, was cotransfected into each well as a transfection control. After approximately 20 h, the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then refed and treated for 48 h with either the appropriate PPAR activator or its vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate to adipocytes as described previously(35). Briefly, preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM and 10% calf serum. Two days after reaching confluence, cells were differentiated by treatment with 174 nm insulin, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 0.25 μm dexamethasone in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were treated for an additional 2 days with insulin and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS until they are fully mature adipocytes at day 8. Transient transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described above. Each well was transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct and 10 ng of pRL-SV40 control vector. In the first set of transfections, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum until transfection mixture was washed off of cells. Cells were then treated with either linoleic acid or ethanol for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. For the second set of preadipocyte transfections, cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum for the duration of the experiments. After washing transfection mixture from cells, they were treated with either a PPAR activator or its vehicle (Me2SO) for 48 h. 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in 12-well culture plates were transiently transfected as described previously (35Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 500 ng of firefly luciferase construct and 20 ng of pRL-SV40 control vector per well. Briefly, DNA in DMEM was complexed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at the ratio of 1:8 (w/v) for 45 min before addition to the cells. After 4 h, an equal volume of 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM was added. The transfection mixture was removed after 20 h. The cells were then refed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and treated with either PPAR activator or vehicle for 48 h. All transiently transfected cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to sea pansy luciferase activities to adjust for transfection efficiency. Activities were also normalized to the promoterless reporter construct, pGL3-Basic. cDNAs for rPPARα, mPPARγ2, mPPARδ, and hRXRα were transcribed and translatedin vitro from the plasmids prPPARα, pAH215, pSG5-FAAR, and pAH232, respectively. The TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following expression plasmids were used prPPARα, pSG5-FAAR (PPARδ), pAH215, and pAH232. Translation products were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from day 9 3T3-L1 adipocytes essentially as described previously (36Dignam J.D.

To study the binding of nuclear hormone receptors to the putative PPRE, a double-stranded oligonucleotide, PPREwt, spanning nucleotides −482 to −453 of the FATP upstream sequence was32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega). A 15-μl reaction containing and 0.5 ng of PPRE probe and 9 μg of nuclear extract or 0.5–1 μl of in vitro translation reaction was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE = 9 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 20 mm EDTA) (pH 8). Double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were used for competition analysis: PPREwt, 5′-GATCTAGAGGAGGAAGTGGGGCAAAGGGCACAGGA-3′; PPREmut, 5′-GATCTAGAGGAGGAAGTGGGGCtAtcGGCACAGGA-3. PPRE sequence is underlined. Mutated bases are shown in lowercase letters. 3T3-L1 adipocytes between days 7 and 9 were treated for 4 days with either 20 μmtroglitazone and 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid or their carrier, Me2SO. The adipocytes were then assayed for uptake of oleate essentially as described previously (37Waggoner D.W. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11417-11420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first preincubated for 2–4 h in serum-free DMEM and then for 10–30 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution with 2 mm glucose. Oleate uptake was measured at 25 °C by incubating cells in a 100 μm, 1:1 oleate:BSA mixture, which contained trace [3H]oleate (approximately 12,000 dpm/nmol). At various time points, uptake was terminated by aspirating the oleate:BSA mixture from the cells and washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% albumin and 200 μm phloretin. Cell lysate was then quantitated for radioactivity using a Beckman 3801 liquid scintillation counter. Previous studies of FATP regulation in mice indicated that transcription was activated in both liver and white adipose tissue by treatment of mice with activators of PPARα or PPARγ, respectively (30Martin G.

Furthermore, FATP expression was observed to be up-regulated during adipose differentiation, a process known to be mediated in part by PPARγ (14Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

In order to determine whether the putative PPRE identified in the FATP upstream sequence was able to mediate transcriptional activation, portions of the FATP 5′-flanking sequence were tested for their ability to mediate PPAR-activated transcription of a reporter gene. Four luciferase reporter constructs were made, each containing portions of the FATP 5′-flanking region linked to a promoterless firefly luciferase gene. Two of these plasmids, pNH11 and pNH13, contained the putative PPRE sequence, while the other two, pNH13ΔP and pNH15 did not (Fig.2). In the first set of experiments, two of these constructs, pNH13 and pNH13ΔP, as well as the promoterless pGL3-Basic control construct, were transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Following transfection, the cells were maintained for 24 h in serum-free media and treated with 100 μm linoleic acid or its carrier, ethanol. This experiment was performed in the absence of serum, since serum albumin binds fatty acids, leaving low levels of available fatty acid activator. Linoleic acid treatment activated transcription of the PPRE-containing construct approximately 2-fold over control-treated cells (Fig. 3), but did not affect transcription of the PPRE-deletion construct. Similar results were seen in transfection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). These experiments indicated that the putative PPRE identified in the FATP upstream sequence was indeed functional. To further characterize the responsiveness of this PPRE to the various PPAR subtypes, all four reporter constructs were transfected into CV-1 cells and assayed for luciferase activity in the presence and absence of various PPARs and their activators. The activators used were troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (PPARγ activator); WY14643, a fibrate drug (PPARα activator); and the PPARδ activator, Delta Selective C. As shown in Fig.4 A, cells transfected with PPARγ and treated with troglitazone demonstrated a 5.5-fold increase in transcription of the PPRE-containing reporter constructs. PPARγ alone was able to activate transcription approximately 3-fold. PPARα was also able to activate transcription in the PPRE-containing constructs, albeit to a lesser extent; transcription was increased 4- and 2-fold in the presence and absence of activator, respectively (Fig.4 B). Finally, the PPARδ subtype was unable to positively regulate transcription of any of the reporter constructs, regardless of activator treatment (Fig. 4 C). Deletion of the PPRE rendered the promoter unresponsive to any PPAR or agonist combination. In order to determine the role of the FATP PPRE in the process of its gene regulat"
https://openalex.org/W2008704486,"Costimulation of both the CD3 and CD28 receptors is essential for T cell activation. Induction of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)–specific phosphodiesterase-7 (PDE7) was found to be a consequence of such costimulation. Increased PDE7 in T cells correlated with decreased cAMP, increased interleukin-2 expression, and increased proliferation. Selectively reducing PDE7 expression with a PDE7 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited T cell proliferation; inhibition was reversed by blocking the cAMP signaling pathways that operate through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Thus, PDE7 induction and consequent suppression of PKA activity is required for T cell activation, and inhibition of PDE7 could be an approach to treating T cell–dependent disorders."

Velocity maps of Ne 7+ from its bright resonance line at 770 angstroms, formed at the base of the corona, show a relationship between outflow velocity and chromospheric magnetic network structure, suggesting that the solar wind is rooted at its base to this structure, emanating from localized regions along boundaries and boundary intersections of magnetic network cells. This apparent relation to the chromospheric magnetic network and the relatively large outflow velocity signatures will improve understanding of the complex structure and dynamics at the base of the corona and the source region of the solar wind."

Traditionally, these horses were interpreted to have fed on abrasive grasses because of their high-crowned teeth. However, carbon isotopic and tooth microwear data indicate that these horses were not all C 4 grazers but also included mixed feeders and C 3 browsers. The late Hemphillian Florida sister species of the modern genus Equus was principally a browser, unlike the grazing diet of modern equids. Late Hemphillian horse extinctions in Florida involved two grazing and one browsing species."

SAM domains are known to form homo- and hetero-oligomers. The crystal structure of the SAM domain from an Eph receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2, reveals two large interfaces. In one interface, adjacent monomers exchange amino-terminal peptides that insert into a hydrophobic groove on each neighbor. A second interface is composed of the carboxyl-terminal helix and a nearby loop. A possible oligomer, constructed from a combination of these binding modes, may provide a platform for the formation of larger protein complexes."

Results from a 6-year field study are presented, providing evidence of density regulation but also of large variability in the zooxanthellae population with regular episodes of very low densities. These bleaching events are likely to be part of a constant variability in zooxanthellae density caused by environmental fluctuations superimposed on a strong seasonal cycle in abundance."
https://openalex.org/W1993954144,"Munc18a, a mammalian neuronal homologue ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Sec1p protein, is essential for secretion, likely as a result of its high affinity interaction with the target SNARE protein syntaxin 1a (where SNARE is derived from SNAP receptor (the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)). However, this interaction inhibits vesicle SNARE interactions with syntaxin that are required for secretory vesicles to achieve competency for membrane fusion. As such, regulation of the interaction between Munc18a and syntaxin 1a may provide an important mechanism controlling secretory responsiveness. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a member of the Cdc2 family of cell division kinases, co-purifies with Munc18a from rat brain, interacts directly with Munc18a in vitro, and utilizes Munc18a as a substrate for phosphorylation. We have now demonstrated that Cdk5 is capable of phosphorylating Munc18ain vitro within a preformed Munc18a·syntaxin 1a heterodimer complex and that this results in the disassembly of the complex. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the Cdk5 phosphorylation site on Munc18a was identified as Thr574. Stimulation of secretion from neuroendocrine cells produced a corresponding rapid translocation of cytosolic Cdk5 to a particulate fraction and an increase of Cdk5 kinase activity. Inhibition of Cdk5 with olomoucine decreased evoked norepinephrine secretion from chromaffin cells, an effect not observed with the inactive analogue iso-olomoucine. The effects of olomoucine were independent of calcium influx as evidenced by secretory inhibition in permeabilized chromaffin cells and in cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. Furthermore, transfection and expression in chromaffin cells of a neural specific Cdk5 activator, p25, led to a strong increase in nicotinic agonist-induced secretory responses. Our data suggest a model whereby Cdk5 acts to regulate Munc18a interaction with syntaxin 1a and thereby modulates the level of vesicle SNARE interaction with syntaxin 1a and secretory responsiveness.

In the case of regulated exocytosis, the formation and dissociation of SNARE protein complexes is essential and under spatial and temporal control (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+, there are a number of other factors that have been postulated to regulate the secretory machinery either positively or negatively. One such factor is the protein Munc18a (also termed nSec1 and rbSec1), a mammalian homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec1p protein (5Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 6Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Munc18a is at once essential and inhibitory to secretion (8Pevsner J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) because while Sec1p and its homologues are necessary for membrane trafficking and the final stages of protein secretion (9Aalto M.K.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) for formation of a protein core complex that mediates vesicle fusion. Genetic evidence has also established that the Drosophila Sec1 homologue ROP functionsin vivo to regulate neurotransmitter release via binding to syntaxin (13Wu M.N. Littleton J.T. Bhat A.A. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As such, any factor that regulates the interaction of Munc18a with syntaxin 1a, either by increasing their affinity or by prompting their dissociation, might be crucial to the ultimate control of the secretory process. One candidate for this type of regulation is Cdk5, a member of the Cdc2 family of cell cycle kinases that has recently been found to co-precipitate with Munc18a from rat brain (14Shetty K.T. Kaech S. Link W.T. Jaffe H. Flores C.M. Wray S. Pant H.C. Beushausen S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unlike the other members of this family, Cdk5 appears to be neither directly involved in the cell cycle nor activated by a cyclin (15Lew J. Huang Q.-C. Qi Z. Winkfein R. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 16Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, Cdk5 was first isolated from brain tissue as part of the Nclk (neuronal Cdc2-like kinase) complex, where it was found to be associated with a 35-kDa neural specific activator protein now termed p35 (17Hellmich M. Pant H. Wada E. Battey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In this capacity, Cdk5 has been demonstrated to act as a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylating neurofilament and tau protein at (S/T)PX(K/R) sites (20Lew J. Winkfein R. Paudel H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6844-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice that lack p35 or Cdk5 have been shown to suffer from severe cortical lamination defects, suggesting that the Nclk complex is also essential for proper neuronal migration and, therefore, for brain development in general (22Chae T. Kwon Y. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 23Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.-G. Longenecker G.

Although Cdk5 can associate with cyclin D, it does not appear that, despite its demonstrated structural similarities to p35, cyclin D is able to fully activate Cdk5 (24Tang D. Chun A. Zhang M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that cyclin D exerts an indirect effect on Cdk5 by competing with p35 for binding (25Guidato S. McLoughlin D. Grierson A. Miller C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cdk5 is further thought to differ from the other cell cycle kinases in that it does not appear to be directly regulated by phosphorylation. Thus, it is neither activated by CDK-activating kinase nor inhibited by Wee1 kinase, although it possesses consensus sites for both (26Poon R. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, recent work has also determined that there may be a number of regionally specific isoforms of p35 and that levels of p35 are under strict control (27Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of Cdk5 may be as intricate and highly specialized as that of the other members of the Cdc2 family (28Qi Z. Tang D. Zhu X. Fujita D. Wang J. J. Biol.

Munc18a is a potential substrate for Cdk5 phosphorylation as it contains two of the Cdk5 consensus sequences identified from neurofilament and tau protein (9Aalto M.K. Ruohonen L. Hosono K. Keranen S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphorylation state of Munc18a has previously been shown to be a crucial determinant of its interaction with syntaxin 1a. When phosphorylated by protein kinase C, Munc18a has been shown to have a greatly reduced affinity for syntaxin 1a, although protein kinase C has proven ineffective at phosphorylating Munc18a already bound to syntaxin 1a (29Fujita Y.

Recently it has been demonstrated that Cdk5 bound to its 35-kDa activator protein not only binds Munc18a but utilizes it as a substrate for phosphorylation, and that Munc18a phosphorylated in this manner has a significantly reduced affinity for syntaxin 1a (30Shuang R. Zhang L. Fletcher A. Groblewski G. Pevsner J. Stuenkel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4957-4966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The focus of the present investigation was to attempt to more completely characterize the interaction between Cdk5 and Munc18a and to establish the likelihood of a regulatory role for Cdk5 in the secretory mechanism. Recombinant pGEX plasmid constructs containing GST-nSec1 (rat), GST-syntaxin 1a (rat), GST-Cdk5 (human), and GST-p25 (bovine) were gifts of R. Scheller and J. Wang.Escherichia coli strain TG-1 was used as the host for the bacterial expression recombinant plasmids. Mouse monoclonal anti-Munc18 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdk5 (C8) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Protein kinase C purified from rat brain was purchased from Calbiochem. Olomoucine and iso-olomoucine were from LC Laboratories. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Sprague-Dawley rats were asphyxiated with carbon monoxide and decapitated prior to preparation of neural lobe tissue samples. pGEX plasmid double-stranded DNA with the GST-nSec1 insert was purified from transformed bacteria strain (TG-1) with QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). For the Munc18a site-directed mutants (S158A, T574A), cDNA constructs were made by the polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide sense (amino acids 152–162, S158A; 566–586, T574A) and corresponding antisense primers. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of Michigan DNA Core Facility. The construction of the Munc18a mutant cDNAs was confirmed by chain termination sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The BamHI and EcoRI fragment cut from GST-p25 was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI site of the vector pcDNA in which a Kozak sequence had been inserted to allow mammalian expression of the p25 cDNA under the control of the cDNA promoter. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified by means of their affinity for glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.I. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 16.7.1-16.7.6Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by treatment with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were lysed by treatment with a French cell press (1000 pounds/square inch pressure differential) and subsequently with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. When necessary, cleavage of the GST moiety from the fusion protein was accomplished by treatment with human thrombin (Sigma) at 0.2 NIH units/μl for 16 h at 20 °C. Alternatively, the entire GST fusion protein was eluted from the Sepharose 4B beads by treatment with 10 mm glutathione for 15 min at 20 °C. Protein production and purification was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. The cytosolicversus particulate distribution of Cdk5 was examined in cell or tissue samples under control conditions or following exposure to membrane-depolarizing stimuli. Control physiological saline contained 40 mm NaCl, 100 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 5 mmKHCO3, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Elevated potassium saline solutions were prepared by appropriate addition of KCl (50 or 100 mm), concomitant with an equivalent reduction in concentration ofN-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl. Calcium-free solutions omitted CaCl2 and included 1 mm EGTA. Following treatment, cells were lysed in buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 2.25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μm olomoucine. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant constituted the cytosolic fraction. The resulting pellet was suspended in lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, sonicated 3 × 5 s with 1-min intervals between each sonication and then re-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was the particulate fraction. Cdk5 content in each fraction was measured by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and probing for Cdk5 immunoreactivity by ECL detection. Visualization and quantitation of the signal was performed off both x-ray film and a GS-250 Molecular Imager. Cdk5 kinase activity was determined as described previously using a Cdc2 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) by following incorporation of 32P radiotracer into a histone H1 peptide from bovine calf thymus containing a predicted Cdc2 phosphorylation site. Specificity of the reaction to Cdk5 kinase activity was tested by inclusion of supplied peptide inhibitors of protein kinase C and protein kinase A within the reaction mixtures, together with an inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (R24571; 5 μm). In addition, kinase activity was tested for sensitivity to the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine or the much less active analogue iso-olomoucine. Munc18a and mutant Munc18a phosphorylation reactions were performed by using Cdk5 immunoprecipitated from rat brain. Cdk5 immunoprecipitate was prepared by homogenizing rat brain in lysis buffer and spinning the resulting lysate at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and precleared with protein A-linked agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Aliquots (1 ml) of the precleared supernatant were then treated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of anti-Cdk5 and subsequently with 100 μl of protein A-linked agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were gathered by centrifugation and washed 3 times with phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 30 μl of the beads (approximately 20 ng of Cdk5 immunoprecipitate) were then added to 300 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing ATP at 0.5 mm and substrate (i.e. wild type and mutant Munc18s) at 1 μm. The reaction mixtures were prepared and kept at 4 °C to prevent the start of the phosphorylation reactions. Olomoucine and iso-olomoucine were also added in 50 and 200 μm concentrations, respectively, to certain reactions. The reactions mixtures were kept at 4 °C and then spiked with 3 μl (30 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. For kinase assay quantification, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was blotted onto phosphocellulose paper, washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid, and the incorporated radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specificity of 32P incorporation into wild type or mutant Munc18a was determined by subjecting aliquots of each reaction mixture to SDS-PAGE followed by visualization and quantitation with a GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Binding relations between Munc18a or mutant Munc18s and syntaxin 1a were performed by incubation of GST-Munc18a proteins at 300 nm (600 nm for Munc18a T574A) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with given concentrations of syntaxin 1a in binding buffer. Binding buffer contained 4 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3.5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm MgCl2. After overnight incubation with rotation at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged, washed extensively, and pellets resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Analysis of syntaxin 1a binding was determined by SDS-PAGE of each sample, followed by Western blotting and probing for syntaxin 1a immunoreactivity by ECL. Quantitation of the signal was performed by phosphorimaging. For kinase-induced protein dissociation studies, the Munc18a· syntaxin 1a heterodimer complex was formed by incubating 12 μg of Munc18a (either wild type or mutant) with 50 μg of GST-syntaxin bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 300 μl of protein binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were then pelleted and washed extensively with protein binding buffer to remove all the unbound Munc18a. Next, the complex was eluted off the purified Sepharose 4B beads by treatment with 100 μl of 10 mmglutathione for 15 min at 20 °C. The supernatant containing the eluted complex was then injected into a 10K Dialysis Cassette (Pierce) and incubated in 750 ml of phosphorylation buffer with constant stirring for 2 h at 4 °C in order to remove the glutathione. The Munc18a·GST·syntaxin 1a complex was then recovered from the cassette, and aliquots of approximately 15 μg of total protein were added to 300 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP and either Cdk5 immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysate or 0.42 μg/ml protein kinase C (the protein kinase C reaction was conducted in the presence of 100 μmCaCl2, 83.3 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 8.3 μg/ml diglyceride). Immunoprecipitated Cdk5 rather than bacterially expressed recombinant p25/Cdk5 protein was utilized for these experiments as it demonstrated higher specific catalytic activity, represented mammalian expressed Cdk5 protein, and could be more rapidly prepared. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with constant agitation, following which the Cdk5 immunoprecipitate on agarose beads was centrifuged. The supernatant was then mixed with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C to bind and subsequently pellet all the syntaxin 1a by centrifugation. The obtained pellet was washed 3 times with phosphorylation buffer. Aliquots of the pellet and supernatant from each sample were subject to SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, and probed for Munc18a immunoreactivity by ECL. Visualization of the signal was by both x-ray film and a GS-250 Molecular Imager. Chromaffin cell preparation, transient transfection, and secretion experiments were performed as described previously (32Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16219-16225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For intact chromaffin cells, secretion experiments were performed in a physiological salt solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mm ascorbate. Secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells was conducted in potassium glutamate solution containing 139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.6), 2 mm MgATP, and 5 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+(Ca2+-free) or 5 mm EGTA buffered with calcium to set a free calcium concentration of 30 μm. In non-transfected chromaffin cells, secretion was investigated by preincubating the cells for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, [3H]norepinephrine, and 0.5 mm ascorbate. Cultures were rinsed for at least 30 min in medium without added [3H]norepinephrine before inducing release with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). Analysis of release from transfected cells was carried out by measurement of human growth hormone that was co-transfected with the test vector (i.e.pcDNA-p25). Human growth hormone appearing in the medium was measured with a luminometric assay kit from Nichols Institute (San Juan Capistrano, CA). Whole-cell patch clamp methods were used to evoke and record Ca2+ currents and measure the changes in membrane capacitance (ΔCm) from single bovine chromaffin cells using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes were constructed out of 1.5-mm outer diameter capillary glass (AM Systems), coated with Sylgard elastomer (Dow Corning, Midland MI), and fire-polished. The patch pipettes had tip resistances of 2–5 megohms and were filled with a pipette solution that contained 140 mm CsMeSO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mmLi-GTP, and 10 mm HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.1 with NaOH. For recording, the cells were placed in a solution containing 130 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose with pH adjusted to 7.15 with Tris. The whole-cell capacitance and 60–70% of the series resistance were compensated electronically. High resolution measurements of changes in membrane capacitance reflecting net of exocytotic and endocytotic activity were performed using a modified phase-tracking method with a software-based (Pulse Control) phase-sensitive detector (33Herrington J. Bookman R.J. Pulse Control, Version4.3, Igor XOPS for Patch Clamp Data Acquisition. University of Miami Press, Miami1994Google Scholar). A 19.1-kHz sampling rate was used to compute 1 Cm point for each 13 ms. Calibration pulses of 100 femtofarads and 500 kΩ were generated and placed at the beginning of each Cm data record. To demonstrate that Cdk5 was capable of phosphorylating Munc18a, Cdk5 was immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysate and incubated in a [32P]ATP solution with recombinant Munc18a fusion protein. The obtained autoradiograph shows that immunoprecipitated Cdk5 causes 32P incorporation into Munc18a (Fig. 1 A). A 23-kDa upward shift of the radiolabeled signal in the GST-Munc18a sample corresponds to the additional mass of the GST moiety and verifies that Munc18a is the substrate for this reaction. That Cdk5 is the phosphorylating kinase is demonstrated by inhibition of phosphate incorporation by the specific Cdk inhibitor olomoucine (50 μm). Olomoucine, a purine analogue, has been demonstrated to exhibit little or no inhibition of many other protein kinases including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and protein tyrosine kinases (34Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D. Kato J. Detivand L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). As a control, protein A-linked agarose beads which had been incubated with the rat brain lysate for a commensurate period, but without pretreatment of the lysate with Cdk5 antibody, failed to demonstrate radiotracer incorporation. To determine whether Cdk5 could phosphorylate Munc18a when bound to syntaxin 1a, we utilized a pre-assembled Munc18a·GST·syntaxin 1a heterodimer complex that was subsequently incubated with Cdk5 immunoprecipitate in a [32P]ATP-containing solution. Following incubation, the GST-syntaxin 1a was pelleted by centrifugation following addition of Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads and then washed extensively. The GST-syntaxin 1a pellet and the supernatant from the reaction were then probed for Munc18a radiolabeling. The autoradiograph showed labeling of a 67-kDa protein in the supernatant fraction alone, demonstrating that Munc18a bound to syntaxin is a substrate for Cdk5 phosphorylation and that phosphorylation induces disassembly of the complex (Fig. 1 B). To determine the extent of Munc18a dissociation from GST-syntaxin 1a, the experiments were repeated and the fractions analyzed for Munc18a by immunoblotting. The resulting immunoblot reveals that conditions supporting Cdk5 kinase activity induce considerable dissociation (approximately 30–50%) of Munc18a from syntaxin 1a (Fig. 1 C). This dissociation was found to be ATP-dependent and olomoucine-sensitive. In addition, comparable dissociation could not be achieved by protein kinase C, another putative regulator of the Munc18a·syntaxin 1a complex. The Munc18a amino acid sequence possess two consensus phosphorylation sequences for Cdk5 at residues 158–161 (SPHK) and residues 574–577 (TPQK). Analysis of Munc18a homologues revealed a high degree of preservation of the Cdk5 phosphorylation sequence, which includes the Thr574 residue but not that of the Ser158residue (Table I). To determine the importance of the Ser158 and the Thr574sites to the Cdk5-induced phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of Munc18a binding from syntaxin 1a, single site directed mutations (alanine substitution) of each site were generated (S158A and T574A). Initially, the S158A and T574A Munc18a mutants along with the wild type Munc18a were tested in a kinase assay as substrates for32P incorporation by Cdk5 immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysate (Fig. 2 A). The Thr574 mutant failed to act as substrate for Cdk5, whereas the S158A mutant served in a manner statistically indistinguishable from the wild type Munc18a (6.3 ± 0.4% for T574Aversus 90 ± 9% for S158A versus 100 ± 10% for wild type Munc18a; n = 6). To verify that the radiotracer incorporated was within the Munc18a protein, addition"

This second cleavage after a Gly residue demonstrated that the substrate specificity of this protease is less restricted than anticipated. The unusual processing of MDC by CD26/DPP IV was confirmed on the synthetic peptides GPYGANMED (MDC(1–9)) and YGANMED (MDC(3–9)). Compared with intact MDC(1–69), CD26/DPP IV-processed MDC(5–69) had reduced chemotactic activity on lymphocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, showed impaired mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ through CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), and was unable to desensitize for MDC-induced Ca2+-responses in CCR4 transfectants. However, MDC(5–69) remained equally chemotactic as intact MDC(1–69) on monocytes. In contrast to the reduced binding to lymphocytes and CCR4 transfectants, MDC(5–69) retained its binding properties to monocytes and its anti-HIV-1 activity. Thus, NH2-terminal truncation of MDC by CD26/DPP IV has profound biological consequences and may be an important regulatory mechanism during the migration of Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells to germinal centers and to sites of inflammation.

Moreover, its expression is up-regulated on activated T cells (1von Bonin A. Hühn J. Fleisher B. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Morimoto C.

The proteolytic activity of CD26/DPP IV is located in the extracellular domain of the protein, which also occurs in a soluble active form in plasma. CD26/DPP IV has a unique specificity compared with other exopeptidases. It is known to cleave dipeptides from the NH2 terminus of peptides with a penultimate Pro, Hyp, or Ala residue. The penultimate NH2-terminal Pro is present in a number of cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10), growth factors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and growth hormone), neuro- and vasoactive peptides (e.g. neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, and substance P) and chemokines (e.g. stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and RANTES). This Pro residue protects these molecules from degradation by most aminopeptidases (4Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpé S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Some short peptides, including substance P and gastrin-releasing peptide have been known for some time as effective substrates for CD26/DPP IV (3Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the intact cytokines with a penultimate Pro has been identified as a CD26/DPP IV substrate although smaller peptides containing their NH2-terminal sequences were cleaved (5Hoffmann T. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of observations indicate that CD26/DPP IV plays an important role in immunology, in particular during T cell activation and proliferation (1von Bonin A. Hühn J. Fleisher B. Immunol.

The involvement of the enzymatic activity in the immunoregulatory function of CD26/DPP IV is demonstrated under several circumstances. These include the in vitro normalization of impaired responses to recall antigens by the addition of soluble CD26/DPP IV (6Tanaka T. Duke-Cohan J. Kameoka J. Yaron A. Lee I. Schlossman S.F.

Indeed, truncation of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV into RANTES(3–68) generated a chemotaxis antagonist with enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity against macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains. Incubation of SDF-1 with CD26/DPP IV drastically reduced the chemotactic activity of this chemokine but also reduced its anti-HIV-1 activity against T cell-tropic (T-tropic) HIV-1 strains. The recently identified CC chemokine macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), also designated stimulated T cell chemotactic protein-1 (STCP-1), binds to CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). The MDC cDNA was one of the most abundant sequences identified in a macrophage library. MDC is synthesized by macrophages and dendritic cells and is highly expressed in the thymus (13Godiska R.

NH2-terminally truncated forms of natural MDC were isolated from a CD8+ T cell clone and have been reported to inhibit HIV-1 infection (17Pal R. Garzino-Demo A. Markham P.D. Burns J. Brown M.

Surprisingly, the enzyme removes an additional dipeptide from the MDC NH2 terminus proving that the substrate specificity of this dipeptidyl-peptidase is less restricted than anticipated. In addition, this double truncation affects the receptor interaction and chemotactic activity of MDC. Recombinant synthetic MDC and125I-MDC were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ), Gryphon Sciences (South San Francisco, CA), and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, UK), respectively. Synthetic NH2-terminal chemokine fragments (GPYGANMED or MDC(1–9), YGANMED or MDC(3–9), ANMED or MDC(5–9), and SPYSSDTTP or RANTES(1–9)) were synthesized using an automated PS3 solid phase peptide synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company Inc., Woburn, MA) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed on an electrospray VG Quattro-II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Fisons, Manchester, UK). Human CD26/DPP IV was obtained from prostasomes and purified to homogeneity using anion exchange followed by affinity chromatography onto immobilized adenosine deaminase (18De Meester I. Vanhoof G. Lambeir A.-M. Scharpé S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 189: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Soluble CD26/DPP IV, without membrane anchor and starting at amino acid Gly31, was obtained from total seminal plasma and purified and characterized as described (19Lambeir A.-M. Diaz-Peirera J.F.

Fresh peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy donors and isolated by hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation and Ficoll-sodium metrizoate centrifugation (20Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Put W. Van Damme J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1996; 10: 82-92Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Monocytes were separated from the mononuclear cell fraction with anti-CD14 antibodies coupled to magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were purified as described previously (13Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp.

Lymphocytic SUP-T1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (BioWhitakker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and HOS cells transfected with CD4 and CCR4 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhitakker), 10% fetal calf serum, and 1 μg/ml puromycin (21Deng H.

NH2-terminal truncation was verified after electroblotting or HPLC on 0.5–2 μg of MDC by Edman degradation on a 477A/120A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Degradation of the small synthetic MDC peptides was analyzed by fluorescamine derivatization. The synthetic peptides (1 mm) were incubated at 37 °C with CD26/DPP IV in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. At indicated time points, 5-μl samples were diluted in 0.5 ml of 100 mmsodium-borate buffer, pH 8.5. Immediately thereafter, 25 μl of fluorescamine (3.4 mg/ml in dry acetone) was added under vortex mixing. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a model RF5000 fluorimeter (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 475 nm, respectively. Linearity of the fluorescence toward the concentration was verified with Phe as a standard and with intact substrates and peptides. Alternatively, peptide degradation was analyzed by HPLC. The peptides (5 mm) were incubated at 37 °C with CD26/DPP IV in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. At indicated time points, 40-μl samples were taken and diluted in 120 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Samples were applied to an Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Beckman, Fullerton, CA) and the peptides were eluted in a linear acetonitrile gradient and monitored at 214 nm. Disappearance curves of MDC analogues were constructed from the integrated peak areas versus time. To compare the relative affinities of CD26/DPP IV for the various peptides and the synthetic substrate Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide, IC50 values were determined. CD26/DPP IV enzymatic activity was measured at 37 °C using Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide as a chromogenic substrate. The reaction was monitored at 405 nm, and the initial rate was determined between 0 and 0.25 absorbancy units. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm substrate, approximately 1 milliunit of CD26/DPP IV activity, 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, and test compounds at final concentrations between 0 and 1.5 mm. Measurements were performed in duplicate. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of test peptide required to reduce CD26/DPP IV activity to 50% of the control. To verify the specificity of the observed reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by the specific irreversible CD26 inhibitor Pro-Pro-diphenylphosphonate (22De Meester I. Belyaev A. Lambeir A.-M. De Meyer G.R.Y. Van Osselaer N. Haemers A. Scharpé S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) before the start of the experiment. The chemotactic activity of chemokines for lymphocytic SUP-T1 cells, monocytes, or monocyte-derived dendritic cells was determined in Boyden chemotaxis chambers as described previously (11Proost P.

Briefly, SUP-T1 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were allowed to migrate at 37 °C for 4 h through 5-μm pore-size fibronectin-coated polycarbonate filters (11Proost P. Struyf S. Schols S. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.-P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). With monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (106 cells/ml), chemotaxis through polyvinylpyrrolidone-treated polycarbonate filters was stopped after 2 h (13Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Filters were removed, cells were fixed and stained and counted microscopically. Results are expressed as chemotactic index corresponding to the number of cells migrated to the sample over the number of cells that migrated to control medium. The intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were determined spectrofluorometrically using the fluorescent dye fura-2 (11Proost P. Struyf S. Schols S. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.-P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and were calculated from the Grynkiewicz equation (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For desensitization experiments, cells were stimulated first with intact or CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC and 100 s later with intact MDC at a concentration (3 nm) that induced a significant increase in [Ca2+]i after prestimulation with buffer. Competition for MDC binding was measured on purified PBMC, monocytes (>95% pure) or lymphocytes (>95% lymphocytes) or CCR4-transfected cells as described (24Schols D. Proost P. Struyf S. Wuyts A. De Meester I. Scharpé S. Van Damme J. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1998; 39: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, two (purified monocytes) or five (other cell types) million cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.06 nm125I-MDC and varying concentrations of unlabeled chemokine. Cells were centrifuged and washed three times with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and the radioactivity present on the cells was measured in a gamma counter. Purified PBMC from healthy donors were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin at 1 μg/ml for 3 days before infection with the T-tropic HIV-1 strain NL4.3 (obtained through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, AIDS reagent program, Bethesda, MD). The activated cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonadsorbed virus and varying concentrations of intact or CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC were added (11Proost P. Struyf S. Schols S. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.-P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2 (25 units/ml), and after 8 days, cell supernatants were collected. HIV-1 core antigen was analyzed by a p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (NEN Life Science Products). Recombinant and synthetic MDC(1–69) were treated with purified CD26/DPP IV. Incubation of synthetic MDC(1–69) with natural intact membrane-bound CD26/DPP IV for 48 h resulted in the removal of four NH2-terminal residues (Gly-Pro-Tyr-Gly) yielding MDC(5–69) (TableI). This finding was confirmed with recombinant MDC(1–69) incubated with the soluble form of the protease. However, a small amount of MDC(3–69) was also recovered. Prolonged treatment of MDC(3–69) with either membrane-bound or soluble CD26/DPP IV also resulted in complete conversion into MDC(5–69). Specific inactivation of CD26 with Pro-Pro-diphenylphosphonate prevented the formation of MDC(5–69) leaving ±85% of the MDC(3–69) intact (TableI).Table INH2-terminal truncation of MDC by CD26/DPP IVMDC SourceaSynthetic (synt) MDC or recombinant (rec) MDC.IncubationSequenceAmount of ProteinbAmount of protein in percentage of the by sequence analysis-detected proteins.h%syntMDC(1—69)48 (m)ANMED...100recMDC(1—69)48 (s)YGANMED...6ANMED...941 (s)YGANMED...67ANMED...33recMDC(3—69)48 (s)ANMED...1001 (s)YGANMED...50ANMED...5024 (m)cIncubation with membrane-bound CD26/DPP IV of which the biological activity was inhibited with the selective inhibitor Pro-Pro-diphenylphosphonate.

Detected NH2-terminal sequences after purification by HPLC or after electroblotting on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and Coomassie Blue staining are shown. To investigate whether the nature of the amino acids in the immediate proximity of the scissile bond exerts an important influence on the cleavage, the NH2-terminal peptides MDC(1–9), MDC(3–9), and RANTES(1–9) were synthesized. The interference of these peptides with the hydrolysis of a commonly used chromogenic CD26/DPP IV substrate, i.e. Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide, was determined, and the IC50 values for competition between this and the peptide-substrates were calculated. RANTES(1–9) competed more efficiently (IC50: 0.15 ± 0.02 mm) for cleavage of Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide compared with MDC(1–9) (IC50: 0.94 ± 0.09 mm). In addition, MDC(3–9) (IC50: > 1.5 mm) was a less efficient competitor for CD26/DPP IV-cleavage compared with MDC(1–9). Peptide hydrolysis by purified CD26/DPP IV was also monitored by fluorescamine derivatization of free NH2 termini of the peptides resulting from incubation with CD26/DPP IV. The NH2-terminal nonapeptides of RANTES and MDC were efficiently cleaved by CD26/DPP IV into RANTES(3–9) and MDC(5–9), respectively. To prove that CD26/DPP IV is responsible for the observed truncations of the nonapeptides, EDTA was included in all incubation buffers to inhibit metallopeptidases. In a control experiment in the presence of the CD26 specific inhibitor Pro-Pro-diphenylphosphonate, the hydrolysis of MDC(1–9) was prevented. CD26/DPP IV was found to metabolize RANTES(1–9) and MDC(1–9) more quickly, generating more free NH2 termini during the same time interval, compared with MDC(3–9) (results not shown). To obtain more information on the difference in kinetics between both cleavage steps at the NH2 terminus, MDC(1–9) and MDC(3–9) were incubated with CD26/DPP IV and the resulting peptides, collected at different time points, were separated by HPLC. Under the experimental conditions used, almost all MDC(1–9) was cleaved within 30 min. Most of the generated MDC(3–9) is further converted into MDC(5–9) within the following hours (Fig. 1 A). Using the same incubation conditions and starting with MDC(3–9), 50% of this peptide is processed after about 100 min (Fig. 1 B). In addition, 2 μg of MDC(1–69) and MDC(3–69) were incubated with CD26/DPP IV at 37 °C for 1 h, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the relative amounts of the different forms of MDC were determined by Edman degradation (Table I). The result of this short term incubation indicates that both dipeptides are efficiently and sequentially removed from the MDC NH2terminus and that the first truncation, resulting in MDC(3–69), is more rapid compared with the second cleavage. CD26-cleaved MDC was compared with intact MDC to stimulate the migration of lymphocytic SUP-T1 cells, peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. On lymphocytic SUP-T1 cells MDC(1–69) was chemotactic from 10 nm on (Fig.2 A), whereas 10 times higher amounts of MDC(5–69) were necessary to obtain an equivalent chemotactic effect. In contrast, both intact MDC and CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC(5–69) were equally potent to stimulate monocyte chemotaxis (Fig. 2 B), 1 nm of chemokine yielding significant cell migration. CD26/DPP IV treatment of MDC also resulted in reduced chemotactic potency on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Fig. 2 C). Intact MDC significantly induced in vitro chemotaxis of dendritic cells at 0.1 nm, whereas MDC(5–69) remained inactive at concentrations up to 10 nm. To explain the altered chemotactic responses, it was verified whether MDC signaling through and binding to CCR4, the only known MDC receptor, was affected by treatment of MDC with CD26/DPP IV. Indeed, intact MDC(1–69) dose-dependently induced a [Ca2+]i rise in CCR4-transfected HOS cells (minimal effective concentration of 0.3 nm), whereas MDC(5–69) was still unable to signal at 30 nm (Fig.3). Furthermore, in contrast to intact MDC, 30 nm of MDC(5–69) did not desensitize for a subsequent [Ca2+]i increase induced by 3 nm of intact MDC(1–69). Compared with MDC(1–69), the potential of MDC(5–69) to compete for 125I-MDC binding to CCR4 was 100–300-fold reduced. Impaired competition of MDC(5–69) for binding of labeled MDC(1–69) was obtained on CCR4-transfected HOS cells (Fig. 4 A), on total PBMC (Fig. 4 B), and on CD14-depleted lymphocytes (Fig.4 C). However, on monocytes purified by positive selection with anti-CD14, MDC(5–69) competed for125I-MDC(1–69)-binding as efficiently as intact MDC (Fig.4 D).Figure 4Competition for 125I-MDC(1–69) binding. HOS cells transfected with CD4 and CCR4 (panel A), total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (panel B), purified lymphocytes (panel C) or monocytes separated by magnetic cell sorting using anti-CD14 beads (panel D) were incubated with 125I-MDC(1–69) in 200 μl and varying concentrations of unlabeled MDC(1–69) (♦) or MDC(5–69) (▪). Results are expressed as the % of specific binding (mean ± S.E. of two to four independent experiments on cells of different donors) with 0.06 nm125I-MDC without competition with unlabeled chemokine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Intact MDC has been reported to have antiviral activity against T- and M-tropic HIV-1 strains (17Pal R.

CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC and intact MDC had comparable anti-HIV-1 activity against infection of PBMC with the T-tropic strain NL4.3 (Fig.5). Although 50% inhibition of HIV-1 infection was not obtained, the inhibition was significant in all four experiments (11 to 28% at 50 nm of intact or CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC). CD26/DPP IV is involved in the in vivo metabolization of a number of relatively small natural peptides containing a penultimate Pro (e.g. pancreatic polypeptide family) or Ala (e.g. secretins) (4Vanhoof G.

Based on the MDC sequence, containing a penultimate Pro, and on the observation that different natural NH2-terminally truncated MDC forms have been isolated (17Pal R. Garzino-Demo A. Markham P.D.

Science. 1997; 278 (and Comments in (1998) Science281, 487): 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the CC chemokine MDC was investigated as a candidate substrate for CD26/DPP IV. Recombinant and synthetic MDC(1–69) were treated with the purified CD26/DPP IV to verify whether MDC was cleaved after the penultimate Pro as previously shown for the chemokines RANTES, GCP-2 and SDF-1α (9Proost P.

It was observed that incubation of MDC(1–69) with CD26/DPP IV resulted in the unexpected removal of four NH2-terminal residues (Gly-Pro-Tyr-Gly) yielding MDC(5–69) instead of the predicted MDC(3–69). A small amount of MDC(3–69) was also recovered indicating that this form is generated as an intermediate. The conversion of MDC(3–69) into MDC(5–69) was prevented by the specific CD26/DPP IV inhibitor Pro-Pro-diphenylphosphonate. This confirmed that the generation of MDC(5–69) was specific for CD26/DPP IV and that the cleavage involved the sequential removal of the two NH2-terminal dipeptides Gly1-Pro2and Tyr3-Gly4. The efficient cleavage after Gly4 is unexpected based on previous reports on the specificity of this protease (1von Bonin A. Hühn J. Fleisher B. Immunol.

Interference by other aminopeptidases in the purified natural membrane-bound or soluble CD26/DPP IV preparations was found to be unlikely, because no further truncation of RANTES, GCP-2, or SDF-1α was obtained with the same CD26/DPP IV preparations using identical incubation conditions (9Proost P.

Investigation of the kinetics of the cleavage of intact MDC and of NH2-terminal MDC-fragments by CD26/DPP IV confirmed that both dipeptides were subsequently removed and that the first hydrolysis proceeds more rapidly compared with the second one. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the CD26/DPP IV-mediated release of an NH2-terminal Xaa-Gly dipeptide from a natural peptide. A study by Bongers et al. (27Bongers J. Lambros T. Ahmad M. Heimer E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) on growth hormone-releasing hormone and synthetic analogs revealed that the introduction of a Gly or Ser as the penultimate residue still allowed degradation by CD26/DPP IV although at a slower rate compared with the natural hormone containing a penultimate Ala. In contrast, the synthetic glucagon-like peptide 2 analog with an Ala to Gly substitution at position 2 was resistant to cleavage by CD26/DPP IV (28Drucker D. Shi Q. Crivici A. Sumner-Smith M. Tavares W. Hill M. De Forest L. Cooper S. Brubaker P.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Along the same line, we did not observe the generation of RANTES(5–68) by CD26/DPP IV, which means that Tyr3-Ser4 is not released from RANTES(3–68), although the same dipeptide was released from the synthetic growth hormone-releasing hormone analog with a penultimate Ser (27Bongers J. Lambros T. Ahmad M. Heimer E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was observed for other peptidases that the less the residue subject to cleavage is preferred, the more the extended substrate recognition influences the hydrolysis. The nature of the surrounding amino acids clearly influences the efficiency with which CD26/DPP IV removes dipeptides from substrates with an unusual penultimate residue (29Keil B.

In contrast, cleavage of MDC into MDC(5–69) resulted in reduced chemotactic activity on lymphocytic and dendritic cells. A similar reduction of the chemotactic activity has been observed for the chemokines RANTES and SDF-1α, whereas CD26/DPP IV processing had no effect on the chemotactic activity of GCP-2. Removal of the Xaa-Pro dipeptide from the NH2 terminus of SDF-1α and RANTES caused the loss of chemotactic activity on lymphocytes (11Proost P. Struyf S. Schols S. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.-P.

J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), respectively. The reduced binding of MDC(5–69) to CCR4 and the reduced signaling of CD26/DPP IV-truncated MDC through this receptor explained the lower chemotactic activity on lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Moreover, MDC(5–69) did not desensitize for a subsequent [Ca2+]i increase induced by the intact chemokine. In concert with the chemotaxis data on monocytes, CD26/DPP IV processing had no influence on the binding properties of MDC to monocytes. The weak antiviral activity of MDC against HIV-1 infection of PBMC with a T-tropic strain also remained essentially unaltered. In this respect, it is interesting to notice that MDC(5–69) and MDC(3–69) (the intermediate reaction product of MDC cleavage by CD26/DPP IV) are the two most abundant MDC forms that were purified from CD8+ T cells based on their antiviral activity against the T-tropic HIV-1 strain IIIB (17Pal R.

However, our results with the CD26/DDP IV-truncated MDC indicate that NH2-terminal truncation of MDC cannot explain the conflicting results between several laboratories concerning the absence or presence of anti-HIV-1 activity for this chemokine. For SDF-1α(3–68), binding to and signaling through its receptor were also strongly reduced. However, this SDF-1α(3–68), in contrast to MDC, lost most of its antiviral activity against T-tropic HIV-1 strains (11Proost P. Struyf S. Schols S. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.-P. De Clercq E.

In conclusion, MDC is a CD26/DPP IV substrate with an unexpected second cleavage site resulting in the generation of MDC(3–69) and MDC(5–69). Processing of MDC by this dipeptidyl-peptidase results in reduced biological activity on lymphocytes and dendritic cells, but not on monocytes. Thus, in addition to the regulation of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression by endogenous and exogenous immunomodulation, the NH2-terminal processing of MDC by CD26/DPP IV may have an important down-regulatory function in Th2 lymphocyte and dendritic cell trafficking without affecting its monocyte chemotactic and antiviral activity.

This study shows that PKA directly phosphorylates NHE-3 and inhibits its activity via complex mechanisms. Phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 were increased by cAMP addition and appeared to be critical for functional inhibition of NHE-3, although other regions of the transporter are likely to be involved in PKA regulation.DISCUSSIONWe confirmed the previous finding of inhibition ofV max by cAMP in native NHE-3 in renal epithelial cells (24Pollock A.S.

The lack of detectable NHE-3 whole protein phosphorylation is comparable with the report by Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) although we observed discernible but variable changes in NHE-3 whole protein phosphorylation with 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. As some cation channels are directly gated by cyclic nucleotides (19Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we queried if such can be a model for NHE-3 regulation by cAMP. When we inactivated the catalytic subunit of PKA, 8-Br-cAMP no longer regulated NHE-3 activity indicating that the cAMP effect is kinase-dependent. Also congruent with A kinase-mediated action is the fact that unlike the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (27Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the primary sequence of NHE-3 does not conform to the β-roll/α-helix motif derived from the catabolite gene activator protein model (28McKay D.B. Stietz T.A. Nature. 1981; 290: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, a recombinant fusion protein of maltose-binding protein/NHE-3 cytoplasmic domain failed to bind3H-cAMP (data not shown).The cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 contains numerous PKA consensus target sites and NHE-3 is rapidly phosphorylated by PKA in vitro(10Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although NHE-3 is a phosphoprotein in vivo (10Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), there is no a priori reason to assume that PKA directly phosphorylates NHE-3 in vivo. The basis of the back phosphorylation assay rests on the presumption that certain common sites are preserved for in vivo and in vitrokinase reactions and multiple kinases do not converge on the exact same serine residues. Our results suggest that PKA likely phosphorylates NHE-3 in the cell. It is possible that the regulation of NHE-3 by cAMP involves phosphorylation of proteins other than NHE-3 by PKA and that PKA may activate other kinases that phosphorylate NHE-3. Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that the lack of change in total NHE-3 protein phosphorylation in vivo is because of multiple constitutively phosphorylated sites masking the change in the regulated sites. We also found that phosphopeptides B, C, and D are largely unregulated in vivo. In contrast, phosphopeptide E (Ser-605) and J (Ser-552) were increased at 1 and 10 μm 8-Br-cAMP, respectively. The dose-response profiles of phosphopeptides E and J actually correlate well with that of changes in NHE-3 activity in response to cAMP.If phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 are important, then elimination of phosphorylation should abolish functional regulation. All the single and double point mutants showed comparable antigen expression and baseline transport activity but the quadruple mutants showed decreased and the six-point mutant showed markedly attenuated expression of both NHE-3 protein and activity. Because NHE-3 transcript levels are not affected by the mutations, one has to postulate that the multiple serine mutations significantly affected translation and/or protein half-life. This study does not address the mechanism of these changes. Ser-552 and Ser-605 were both phosphorylated in vivo and when mutated singly to nonphosphorylatable residues, functional regulation by PKA was abrogated in both mutants. Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have reported the importance of Ser-605 and Ser-634 in the functional regulation of NHE-3 by PKA although Ser-634 appeared not to be a phosphoserine. Our phosphopeptide map and functional response of the NHE-3mut/S605A is very similar to the previous report. A major disparate finding is that we found Ser-552 to be critical for PKA regulation, whereas Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found normal functional regulation of NHE-3mut/S552A by cAMP. In addition, Cabado and co-workers (11Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from the same group found that truncation of the cytoplasmic domain at amino acid 579 rendered NHE-3 nonresponsive to cAMP. The difference may reside in the fact that Ser-552, which is phosphorylated in our cells, was not phosphorylated in the previous report as is evident by the absence of phosphopeptide J (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that multiple PKA target phosphoserines may participate in mediating the functional inhibition of NHE-3 and different host cells may use different sets of serines. The basis for the differential NHE-3 phosphorylation is unclear, because both laboratories used AP-1 cells from the same source. Because AP-1 cells are mutants derived and selected from the parental Chinese hamster ovary cell, repeated passages and clonal expansion might have created different phenotypes.One possible interpretation for the lack of regulation of NHE-3mut/S552A is that some cellular cofactor(s) are missing in that particular AP-1 recipient that harbors the mutant NHE-3 and that the cAMP-insensitive phenotype stems from the cell rather than NHE-3mut/S552A. Such an explanation is unlikely for several reasons. All pooled transfectants of single or multiple mutant NHE-3s were generated about the same time from the same parental AP-1 cells. In addition, when we tried to examined NHE-3mut/S552A in as heterogenous an AP-1 cellular background as we can create, we found that the cAMP-nonresponsive phenotype prevailed.The lack of regulation of NHE-3mut/S575/S661/S690/S804 is harder to explain because none of the serines were functionally important when examined as single mutants. One can speculate on several explanations. One is that there are multiple regulatory phosphoserines with P-Ser-552 and P-Ser-605 having the most dominant effects with lesser contribution from the other phosphoserines. Although singular mutations of serines other than Ser-552 and Ser-605 do not affect the overall response, mutation of four minor phosphorylation sites may be sufficient. A second possibility is that these serines participate in specific protein-protein interactions with regulatory factors such as NHE-RF (20Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that modulate NHE-3 function, and this interaction is disrupted by the mutations. A third possibility is that the mutations distort the protein structure to such an extent that it nonspecifically alters NHE-3 function and its regulation. Crystallographic evidence indicates that one can significantly alter the protein structure of a domain of a protein by a single amino acid mutation from tyrosine to phenylalanine, which essentially only removes a single hydroxyl group (33Zhang J. Zhang F. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The present paper does not distinguish the three stated possibilities. We did however observe intact regulation of all mutants including the four- to six-point mutants by acute hyperosmolality (25–40% inhibition) (data not shown). This is compatible with the ability of hyperosmolality to inhibit NHE-3 activity despite radical truncations of the cytoplasmic domain (34Nath S.K. Hang C.Y. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G431-G441PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we hypothesize that the functional regulation of NHE-3 by PKA does not converge on single covalent modifications such as phosphorylation of a specific serine. We submit a model where PKA phosphorylates NHE-3 on Ser-552 and Ser-605 in addition to other serines. Phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 each play a major although not exclusive role in the functional regulation of NHE-3, which involves specific interaction of various regions of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 with other regulatory cofactors.

In the kidney, NHE-3 is expressed exclusively on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb where it mediates absorption of a significant fraction of the filtered NaCl and NaHCO3 (4Biemesderfer D.

The Structure, Function and Molecular Biology of Na/H Exchangers. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1998Google Scholar). Acute hormonal regulation of NHE-3 involves multiple intracellular cascades including activation of adenylyl cyclase (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The NHE-3 isoform when expressed in fibroblasts is inhibited by cAMP analogues or forskolin (8Kandasamy R.A. Yu F.H. Harris R.

Although the NHE-1 isoform is cAMP insensitive, chimeric insertion of the NHE-3 cytoplasmic domain confers cAMP sensitivity to the NHE-1 transporting domain (11Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Partial deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 reduce although more drastic truncations abolish the effect of cAMP on NHE-3 activity (10Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin.

This study shows that PKA directly phosphorylates NHE-3 and inhibits its activity via complex mechanisms. Phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 were increased by cAMP addition and appeared to be critical for functional inhibition of NHE-3, although other regions of the transporter are likely to be involved in PKA regulation. DISCUSSIONWe confirmed the previous finding of inhibition ofV max by cAMP in native NHE-3 in renal epithelial cells (24Pollock A.S. Warnock D.G. Strewler G.J. Am. J.

The lack of detectable NHE-3 whole protein phosphorylation is comparable with the report by Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) although we observed discernible but variable changes in NHE-3 whole protein phosphorylation with 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. As some cation channels are directly gated by cyclic nucleotides (19Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we queried if such can be a model for NHE-3 regulation by cAMP. When we inactivated the catalytic subunit of PKA, 8-Br-cAMP no longer regulated NHE-3 activity indicating that the cAMP effect is kinase-dependent. Also congruent with A kinase-mediated action is the fact that unlike the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (27Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the primary sequence of NHE-3 does not conform to the β-roll/α-helix motif derived from the catabolite gene activator protein model (28McKay D.B. Stietz T.A. Nature. 1981; 290: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, a recombinant fusion protein of maltose-binding protein/NHE-3 cytoplasmic domain failed to bind3H-cAMP (data not shown).The cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 contains numerous PKA consensus target sites and NHE-3 is rapidly phosphorylated by PKA in vitro(10Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although NHE-3 is a phosphoprotein in vivo (10Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), there is no a priori reason to assume that PKA directly phosphorylates NHE-3 in vivo. The basis of the back phosphorylation assay rests on the presumption that certain common sites are preserved for in vivo and in vitrokinase reactions and multiple kinases do not converge on the exact same serine residues. Our results suggest that PKA likely phosphorylates NHE-3 in the cell. It is possible that the regulation of NHE-3 by cAMP involves phosphorylation of proteins other than NHE-3 by PKA and that PKA may activate other kinases that phosphorylate NHE-3. Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that the lack of change in total NHE-3 protein phosphorylation in vivo is because of multiple constitutively phosphorylated sites masking the change in the regulated sites. We also found that phosphopeptides B, C, and D are largely unregulated in vivo. In contrast, phosphopeptide E (Ser-605) and J (Ser-552) were increased at 1 and 10 μm 8-Br-cAMP, respectively. The dose-response profiles of phosphopeptides E and J actually correlate well with that of changes in NHE-3 activity in response to cAMP.If phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 are important, then elimination of phosphorylation should abolish functional regulation. All the single and double point mutants showed comparable antigen expression and baseline transport activity but the quadruple mutants showed decreased and the six-point mutant showed markedly attenuated expression of both NHE-3 protein and activity. Because NHE-3 transcript levels are not affected by the mutations, one has to postulate that the multiple serine mutations significantly affected translation and/or protein half-life. This study does not address the mechanism of these changes. Ser-552 and Ser-605 were both phosphorylated in vivo and when mutated singly to nonphosphorylatable residues, functional regulation by PKA was abrogated in both mutants. Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have reported the importance of Ser-605 and Ser-634 in the functional regulation of NHE-3 by PKA although Ser-634 appeared not to be a phosphoserine. Our phosphopeptide map and functional response of the NHE-3mut/S605A is very similar to the previous report. A major disparate finding is that we found Ser-552 to be critical for PKA regulation, whereas Kurashima and co-workers (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found normal functional regulation of NHE-3mut/S552A by cAMP. In addition, Cabado and co-workers (11Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from the same group found that truncation of the cytoplasmic domain at amino acid 579 rendered NHE-3 nonresponsive to cAMP. The difference may reside in the fact that Ser-552, which is phosphorylated in our cells, was not phosphorylated in the previous report as is evident by the absence of phosphopeptide J (12Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that multiple PKA target phosphoserines may participate in mediating the functional inhibition of NHE-3 and different host cells may use different sets of serines. The basis for the differential NHE-3 phosphorylation is unclear, because both laboratories used AP-1 cells from the same source. Because AP-1 cells are mutants derived and selected from the parental Chinese hamster ovary cell, repeated passages and clonal expansion might have created different phenotypes.One possible interpretation for the lack of regulation of NHE-3mut/S552A is that some cellular cofactor(s) are missing in that particular AP-1 recipient that harbors the mutant NHE-3 and that the cAMP-insensitive phenotype stems from the cell rather than NHE-3mut/S552A. Such an explanation is unlikely for several reasons. All pooled transfectants of single or multiple mutant NHE-3s were generated about the same time from the same parental AP-1 cells. In addition, when we tried to examined NHE-3mut/S552A in as heterogenous an AP-1 cellular background as we can create, we found that the cAMP-nonresponsive phenotype prevailed.The lack of regulation of NHE-3mut/S575/S661/S690/S804 is harder to explain because none of the serines were functionally important when examined as single mutants. One can speculate on several explanations. One is that there are multiple regulatory phosphoserines with P-Ser-552 and P-Ser-605 having the most dominant effects with lesser contribution from the other phosphoserines. Although singular mutations of serines other than Ser-552 and Ser-605 do not affect the overall response, mutation of four minor phosphorylation sites may be sufficient. A second possibility is that these serines participate in specific protein-protein interactions with regulatory factors such as NHE-RF (20Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that modulate NHE-3 function, and this interaction is disrupted by the mutations. A third possibility is that the mutations distort the protein structure to such an extent that it nonspecifically alters NHE-3 function and its regulation. Crystallographic evidence indicates that one can significantly alter the protein structure of a domain of a protein by a single amino acid mutation from tyrosine to phenylalanine, which essentially only removes a single hydroxyl group (33Zhang J. Zhang F. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The present paper does not distinguish the three stated possibilities. We did however observe intact regulation of all mutants including the four- to six-point mutants by acute hyperosmolality (25–40% inhibition) (data not shown). This is compatible with the ability of hyperosmolality to inhibit NHE-3 activity despite radical truncations of the cytoplasmic domain (34Nath S.K. Hang C.Y. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G431-G441PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we hypothesize that the functional regulation of NHE-3 by PKA does not converge on single covalent modifications such as phosphorylation of a specific serine. We submit a model where PKA phosphorylates NHE-3 on Ser-552 and Ser-605 in addition to other serines. Phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 each play a major although not exclusive role in the functional regulation of NHE-3, which involves specific interaction of various regions of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 with other regulatory cofactors.

A third possibility is that the mutations distort the protein structure to such an extent that it nonspecifically alters NHE-3 function and its regulation. Crystallographic evidence indicates that one can significantly alter the protein structure of a domain of a protein by a single amino acid mutation from tyrosine to phenylalanine, which essentially only removes a single hydroxyl group (33Zhang J. Zhang F. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The present paper does not distinguish the three stated possibilities. We did however observe intact regulation of all mutants including the four- to six-point mutants by acute hyperosmolality (25–40% inhibition) (data not shown). This is compatible with the ability of hyperosmolality to inhibit NHE-3 activity despite radical truncations of the cytoplasmic domain (34Nath S.K. Hang C.Y. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G431-G441PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we hypothesize that the functional regulation of NHE-3 by PKA does not converge on single covalent modifications such as phosphorylation of a specific serine. We submit a model where PKA phosphorylates NHE-3 on Ser-552 and Ser-605 in addition to other serines. Phosphorylation of Ser-552 and Ser-605 each play a major although not exclusive role in the functional regulation of NHE-3, which involves specific interaction of various regions of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE-3 with other regulatory cofactors.

Almost 100 inteins have been identified (5Perler F.B.

Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Of the mini-inteins, the smallest is the 134-amino acid intein found in the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase gene of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Mth RIR1 intein; Ref. 7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y.

This intein may be close to the minimum amino acid sequence needed to promote splicing, and interestingly, it has a proline residue N-terminal to the first amino acid of the intein, Pro−1(see Fig. 1), which was shown to inhibit splicing in an intein found in the 69-kDa vacuolar ATPase subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce VMA intein; Ref. 8Chong S.

Studies into the mechanism of splicing led to the development of a protein purification system that utilized thiol-induced cleavage of the peptide bond at the N terminus of the Sce VMA intein (9Chong S.

Structure. 1998; 6: 945-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the generality of IPL was limited by the use of a synthetic peptide as a ligation partner. We describe the next major advance in intein-mediated protein ligation, which is the modulation of the Mth RIR1 intein for the facile isolation of a protein with an N-terminal cysteine for use in the in vitro fusion of two bacterially expressed proteins. Furthermore, the Mth RIR1 mini-intein, the smallest known protein splicing element, was found to be capable of splicing. These results significantly expand the utility of IPL to include the labeling of extensive portions of a protein for NMR analysis and the isolation of a greater variety of cytotoxic proteins. In addition, this advance opens the possibility of labeling the central portion of a protein by ligating three fragments in succession. The gene encoding theMth RIR1 intein along with 5 native N- and C-extein residues (Fig. 1; Ref. 7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D.

To ensure maximal Escherichia coli expression, the coding region of the synthetic Mth RIR1 intein incorporates 61 silent base mutations in 48 of the 134 codons. The oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing at equimolar ratios (400 nm) in a ligation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg of bovine serum albumin) followed by heating to 95 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the annealed and ligated oligonucleotides were inserted into the XhoI andAgeI sites of pMYB5 (New England Biolabs), replacing theSce VMA intein and creating the plasmid pMRB8P. The uniqueXhoI and SpeI sites flanking the N-terminal splice junction and the unique BsrGI and AgeI sites flanking the C-terminal splice junction allowed substitution of amino acid residues by linker replacement. Pro−1, the proline residue preceding the intein in pMRB8P, was substituted with alanine or glycine to yield pMRB8A and pMRB8G1, respectively. Substitution of Pro−1-Cys1 with Gly-Ser or Gly-Ala yielded pMRB9GS and pMRB9GA, respectively. Replacing Asn134 with Ala in pMRB8G1 resulted in pMRB10G. The following linkers were used for substitution of the native amino acids at the splice junctions. Each linker was formed by annealing two synthetic oligonucleotides as described above.

Protein synthesis was induced by addition of 0.5 mm IPTG and proceeded at 15 °C overnight or at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell extracts were visualized on 12% Tris-glycine gels (Novex Experimental Technology, San Diego, CA) stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purification was as described previously for theSce VMA and Mxe GyrA inteins (9Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Briefly, ER2566 cells (11Evans J.T.C. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) containing the appropriate plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to anA 600 of 0.5–0.6 followed by induction with IPTG (0.5 mm). Induction was either overnight at 15 °C or for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min followed by resuspension in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl). The cell contents were released by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 23,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a column packed with chitin resin (bed volume, 10 ml) equilibrated in buffer A. Unbound protein was washed from the column with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Thiol reagent-induced cleavage was initiated by rapidly equilibrating the chitin resin in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 500 mm NaCl and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA)). The cleavage reaction proceeded overnight at 4 °C, after which the protein was eluted from the column. Protein purification was performed as described above with buffer A replaced by buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 500 mm NaCl) and buffer B replaced by buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 500 mmNaCl). Also, following equilibration of the column in buffer D the cleavage reaction proceeded overnight at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Freshly isolated thioester-tagged protein was mixed with freshly isolated protein containing an N-terminal cysteine residue (starting concentration, 1–200 μm). The solution was concentrated with a Centriprep 3 or Centriprep 30 apparatus (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) then with a Centricon 3 or Centricon 10 apparatus to a final concentration of 0.15–1.2 mm for each protein. Ligation reactions proceeded overnight at 4 °C and were visualized using SDS-PAGE with 12% Tris-glycine gels (Novex Experimental Technology, San Diego, CA) stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 2 mg of ligation reaction involving MBP and T4 DNA ligase was bound to 3 ml of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) equilibrated in buffer A (see above). Unreacted T4 DNA ligase was rinsed from the column with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Unligated MBP and the MBP-T4 DNA ligase fusion protein were eluted from the amylose resin using buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm maltose). Overnight incubation of the eluted protein with a 200:1 protein:bovine factor Xa (New England Biolabs) ratio (w/w) at 4 °C resulted in the proteolysis of the fusion protein and regeneration of a band on SDS-PAGE gels that ran at a molecular weight similar to T4 DNA ligase. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the proteolyzed fusion protein was performed on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The splicing activity of the Mth RIR1 intein with its 5 native N- and C-extein residues was investigated by expressing it as an in-frame fusion between E. coli maltose-binding protein (15Duplay P. Bedouelle H. Fowler A. Zabin I. Saurin W. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10606-10613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the chitin-binding domain (16Watanabe T. Ito Y. Yamada T. Hashimoto M. Sekine S. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) from Bacillus circulans. In this protein context splicing products were detected (Fig.2, lane 1), although the majority of the protein remained in the precursor form (M-R-B). Splicing proficiency was increased by mutating the Pro−1to an Ala (Fig. 2, lane 3). Furthermore, the Pro−1 → Ala or Pro−1 → Gly mutants also displayed cleavage at the N- and C-terminal junctions of the intein (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). The identity of splicing and cleavage products were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-MBP and anti-CBD polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). The cleavage and/or splicing activity of the M-R-B precursor was more proficient when protein synthesis was induced at 15 °C than when the induction temperature was raised to 37 °C (Fig. 2). Replacement of Pro−1 with a Gly and Cys1 with a Ser resulted in a double mutant, M-R-B (Pro−1 → Gly/Cys1→ Ser), which showed only in vivo C-terminal cleavage activity when protein synthesis was induced at 15 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). Another double mutant, M-R-B (Pro−1 → Gly/Cys1 → Ala) displayed slow cleavage, even at 15 °C, which allowed the accumulation of substantial amounts of the precursor protein (data not shown) and showed potential for use as a C-terminal cleavage construct for protein purification. The C- and N-terminal cleavage constructs of the Mth RIR1 intein were used to purify T4 DNA ligase or thioredoxin with an N-terminal cysteine or MBP with a C-terminal thioester. Two C-terminal cleavage constructs, pBRL-A and pBRT (Fig. 3, data not shown for pBRT), resulted in the isolation of 4–6 mg/liter cell culture and 5–10 mg/liter cell culture of T4 DNA ligase and thioredoxin, respectively. These proteins possessed N-terminal cysteine residues based on amino acid sequencing following the ligation reaction (see below under “Intein-mediated Protein Ligation”). Conversely, an intein with only N-terminal cleavage activity was generated by changing Pro−1 to Gly and the C-terminal Asn134 to an Ala creating M-R-B (Pro−1 → Gly, Cys1 → Ser). N-terminal cleavage products were detected when protein synthesis was induced at both 15 and 37 °C (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10). However, more precursor accumulated at the higher induction temperature. The remaining precursor protein could undergo thiol-mediated cleavage with reagents such as dithiothreitol or MESNA and could be used to purify thioester-tagged proteins as described previously (Fig. 3 and Refs. 11Evans J.T.C. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholarand 12Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6705-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). IPL reactions consisted of mixing freshly purified MBP with T4 DNA ligase or thioredoxin (Fig.4 and “Experimental Procedures”). Ligation was monitored by the appearance of an extra band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 and data not shown for thioredoxin) corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the ligation product. Typical ligation efficiencies ranged from 20–60%. A factor Xa site in MBP that exists 5 amino acids N-terminal from the site of fusion (17Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea III, A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) allowed amino acid sequencing through the ligation junction (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence obtained was NH2-TLEGCGEQPTGXLK-COOH, which matched the last 4 residues of MBP (TLEG) followed by a linker sequence (CGEQPTG) and the start of T4 DNA ligase (ILK). During amino acid sequencing, the cycle expected to yield an isoleucine did not have a strong enough signal to assign it to a specific residue, so it was represented as anX. The cysteine was identified as the acrylamide alkylation product. The C-terminal cleavage activity of the mutated MthRIR1 intein advanced IPL technology by providing a means to isolate proteins possessing an N-terminal cysteine to act as substrates in thein vitro fusion of large, bacterially expressed proteins. Initially, an intein that cleaves in vivo was tested for the ability to generate a protein with an N-terminal cysteine. However, the side chain of the N-terminal cysteine residue appeared to be modifiedin vivo by an unidentified pathway (data not shown). Although this problem could be circumvented using a protease to cut on the N-terminal side of a cysteine residue, concern over nonspecific proteolysis and the need to remove the protease after cleavage limited its usefulness. Interestingly, C-terminal cleavage using theMth RIR1 intein appeared to protect the cysteine residue until it could be released in vitro. A recently developedSce VMA intein with thiol-inducible C-terminal cleavage activity could not be used because it would undergo splicing instead of cleavage with an N-terminal cysteine on the target protein (18Chong S. Montello G.E. Zhang A. Cantor E.J. Liao W. Xu M.Q. Benner J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5109-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of the ligation reaction was probably due to the need to increase the ligation reaction rate to effectively compete with thioester hydrolysis, which would prevent ligation. Protein fusion occurred at 20–40% efficiency at 6.5–8.5 mg/ml of each reactant (data not shown), although greater extents of reaction (50–60%, Fig. 3) were observed at higher protein concentrations. Many proteins can exist in solution at the lower concentrations, indicating that IPL will be useful for a wide range of applications. However, these conditions are problematic for some proteins, and future work may determine procedures that will lower this concentration requirement. N-terminal amino acid sequencing through the ligation junction demonstrated that the two proteins were fused tail-to-head in a continuous polypeptide chain and had not fused to form an unusual branched structure. Furthermore, these data reinforce past studies reporting that a native peptide bond is formed using native chemical ligation chemistry (10Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar) because the polypeptide sequencing reaction requires a peptide bond between amino acid residues. Previously, studies with the Sce VMA intein reported that splicing was inhibited when a proline replaced the naturally occurring glycine at the −1 position (8Chong S. Williams K.S. Wotkowicz C. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10567-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the Mth RIR1 intein has a naturally occurring proline at this position and was thought to be able to splice with this unique amino acid. The low splicing activity of the Mth RIR1 intein shows that it is capable of splicing but that it may not be folding properly when expressed in E. coli. Alternatively, this intein may require more native extein sequence than provided or require a cofactor such as a prolyl isomerase to promote proficient splicing activity. The Mth RIR1 intein primary sequence was compared with the amino acid sequence and crystal structure of another mini-intein, theMxe GyrA intein (19Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs J. William R. Perler F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the amino acids that form two α-helices and a disordered region in the Mxe GyrA intein appeared to be missing in the Mth RIR1 intein. The α-helical and disordered regions were previously found not to be required for splicing of the Ssp DnaB intein (21Wu H. Xu M.-Q. Liu X.-Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and this portion of the protein may only serve as a linker. The small size of this region in the Mth RIR1 intein may decrease its stability and may account for some of its induction temperature-dependent activity. The mechanism of the induction temperature-dependent splicing and cleavage activity has yet to be determined, but it may be due to reactions occurring at the C terminus of the intein. C-terminal cleavage was more severely affected by induction temperature than N-terminal cleavage activity (Fig. 2). It is also possible that theMth RIR1 intein could be misfolding in E. coliwhen induced at the higher temperature, an interesting possibility considering that M. thermoautotrophicum is a thermophilic bacteria. In conclusion, this report demonstrated that the smallest known intein, the Mth RIR1 intein, along with its 5 native extein residues was capable of splicing. Furthermore, this intein was capable of generating both thioester-tagged proteins and proteins with an N-terminal cysteine. The latter was of particular importance because it facilitated the next major advance in intein-mediated protein ligation, which is the fusion of two large, bacterially expressed proteins. This paves the way for greater freedom in the labeling of proteins for NMR analysis, the isolation of cytotoxic proteins, and in the future the controlled fusion of three bacterially expressed proteins.

The use of sodium ions as a current carrier enabled single-channel recordings of CRAC channels during activation, inactivation, and blockade of current in the presence of divalent cations. A large conductance of 36 to 40 picosiemens indicates that 100 to 400 CRAC channels are present in T lymphocytes."

They are also suggested to be involved in other events such as rearrangement of cytoskeleton and vesicle transport because these phenomena are sensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase (10Fukui Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides can activate guanine nucleotide exchanging factors of Rac and Arf, small G proteins involved in actin rearrangement and vesicle transport, respectively (11Han J.

Therefore, G proteins as well as kinases are downstream of PI 3-kinase. We have identified PIP3BP as a PIP3-binding protein, using a PIP3 analogue column (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Swada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y. Shirai T. Terada Y. Kimura K. Nagata S. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is abundant in brain, implying that it may be involved in the function of nerve systems. PIP3BP binds to PIP3 but not to PI 3,4-P2 or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2). It has a zinc finger motif homologous to that of Arf-GTPase activating protein (GAP) and two PH domains. Both PH domains are shown to be involved in binding to PIP3. Another PIP3-binding protein, centaurin α, is highly homologous to PIP3BP (14Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R.A. Profit A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Teibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). No GAP activity to Arf has been detected in either protein. Although the binding of centaurin α and PIP3BP to PIP3 was specific, the role of the protein is unclear. To address this question, we determined the intracellular localization by immunological techniques, using monoclonal antibody to PIP3BP as well as localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. Surprisingly, PIP3BP was found to localize in the nucleus, where the generation of PIP3 was detected after stimulation, suggesting a new pathway of signal transduction through PI 3-kinase to PIP3BP in nucleus. PIP3BP was exported out of the nucleus by expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase. This suggests that PIP3BP can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm depending on the activity of PI 3-kinase. COS-7 cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Transfection was done by the calcium phosphate method as described by Shirai et al. (15Shirai T. Tanaka K. Terada Y. Sawada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Nagata S. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Li S. Hattori S. Mano H. Fukui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that pH of the buffer was 7.00 instead of 7.15. Pregnant mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the 18th-day of gestation. After isolation of the embryos from the uterus, by cutting the outer layer of the pelvis, the fetal meninges were removed and the cerebral cortices were placed in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following the mechanical dissociation, cells were passed through a #100 mesh, and were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for glial cell culture. For neuronal cell culture, the cells were suspended in neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement (both from Life Technologies, Inc.), 74 μg/ml l-glutamine and 25 μml-glutamate. They were plated in culture dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) and cultured in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 36 °C. A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length PIP3BP or mutant PIP3BPs was subcloned into pEGFP c-1, an expression vector for GFP fusion protein (CLONTECH), to produce pEGFP-PIP3BP, pEGFP-PIP3BP(−NLS), pEGFP(+NLS), and pEGFP-PIP3BP(−PH). PIP3BP-NLS was constructed by deletion of amino acid 1–9 residues using the restriction site,XhoI, in the cDNA. Point mutants in the PH domains in PIP3BP (PIP3BP-PH) were introduced as described previously (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Swada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y. Shirai T.

A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). To obtain Myc-tagged PIP3BP, an Myc-tag sequence with an initiation codon, ATGGAACAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAAGAAGATCT, was attached at the 5′ end of the cDNA of the PIP3BP. The resulting gene was expressed under the control of SRα promoter by an expression vector pMIKNeo (17Hayashi H. Nishioka Y. Kamohara S. Kanai F. Ishii K. Fukui Y. Shibasaki F. Takenawa T. Kido H. Katsunuma N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7107-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors for constitutively active PI 3-kinase (BD110) and a kinase negative mutant of PI 3-kinase (BDKN) were described previously (18Kita Y. Kimura K. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BD110 protein has a structure similar to that of p110* reported by Hu et al. (19Hu Q.J. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The protein has an inter-SH2 domain of p85, which binds to the p110 amino terminus. BDKN protein is a kinase negative counterpart of the BD110 protein with a point mutation in the kinase domain. In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (20Hirota S. Ito A. Morii E. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length PIP3BP was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), and the transcripts of T7 or T3 RNA polymerase labeled with digoxigenin were used as antisense or sense probes. A monoclonal antibody, mAb 13–14, was produced. GST fusion protein of PIP3BP (GST-PIP3BP) was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified with a glutathione-Sepharose column. Eight-week-old male mice were injected subcutaneously with the purified protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections were given subcutaneously with the antigen mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant two times with an interval of two weeks. After the final booster injection, which was given intravenously, spleen cells of the mouse were taken and fused with the SP2/O cells by a polyethylene glycol method (21Nagata S. Yamamoto K. Ueno Y. Kurata T. Chiba J. Hybridoma. 1991; 10: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Ten days after fusion, culture supernatant of the hybridomas were examined for the reactivity to purified GST-PIP3BP protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After several cycles of cloning, a hybridoma clone producing mAb 13–14 was established. The epitope for mAb 13–14 was determined to be the region between amino acid position 42–109, which is within the zinc finger motif. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (22Yoshida Y. Tsutsumi T. Makita T. Nagata S. Tashiro F. Yoshida F. Sekijima M. Shin-ichi T. Harada T. Keizo M. Ueno Y. Toxicol. Pathol. 1998; 26: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2. After homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer, they were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After removal of the supernatant, two cycles of the same procedure were done to remove any non-nuclear membranes from the nucleus. The resulting pellet was used as a nuclear fraction. The supernatant was further ultracentrifugated at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and the pellet were used as cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) for 4 h in a phosphate-free MEM supplemented with 25 mmHepes-NaOH and treated with various stimuli. After fractionation of the cells, the lipids were extracted as described previously (23Fukui Y. Saltiel A.R. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 407-411PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC as described previously (24Kabuyama Y. Nakatsu N. Homma Y. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). High performance liquid chromatography analysis using SAX5 column (Whatman) was done to confirm the result of TLC (25Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Kita Y. Nakatsu N. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saitoh I. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16089-16092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunostaining was carried out to determine the expression of PIP3BP in rat brain with mAb 13–14, anti-PIP3BP monoclonal antibody. In the rat brain section, roughly two types of the cells are clearly seen: large and round-shaped neuronal cells, and small and sharp-shaped glial cells (Fig.1 A). In situhybridization revealed that only the neuronal cells were stained by the antisense probe in cerebral cortex, whereas the sense probe did not give clear signals (Fig. 1 A, a and b). Consistent with this, immunostaining analysis suggested the same expression pattern (Fig. 1 A, c and d). Interestingly, the staining of mAb 13–14 appeared to be restricted within the hematoxylin-stained areas, suggesting that PIP3BP might be located in the nucleus. Similar results were obtained in the hippocampus and the cerebellum (data not shown). Primary neuronal and glial cultures were prepared separately from embryonic day 18 rat brains. Cell fractionation was correctly done because neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was specifically found in neuronal fraction, and the glial fiber acidic protein (GFAP) was found in the glial fraction (Fig. 1 B, bottom part). Expression of PIP3BP was examined by immunoblotting using mAb 13–14. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PIP3BP was detected exclusively in neuronal cells. No detectable amounts of PIP3BP were observed in glial cells. These results suggest that PIP3BP is localized in nucleus of the neuronal cells in rat brain. Immunostaining using mAb 13–14 showed that native PIP3BP was also detected in nucleus of neuroblastoma, Neuro2A cells (Fig. 1 C). To confirm the nuclear localization of PIP3BP, COS-7 cells were transfected with a construct coding for PIP3BP fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP-PIP3BP), and the localization of the protein in the intact cells was analyzed. The GFP-PIP3BP fusion protein was almost exclusively detected in the nucleus, supporting the immunostaining data (Fig. 1 D,a). Similar results were obtained using PC12 cells and neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar, 27Olmsted J.B. Carlson K. Klebe R. Ruddle F. Rosenbaum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Nuclear localization signal-like motif, KERRK, was found in the amino terminus part of PIP3BP. We tested whether or not this sequence directs the protein to the nucleus. GFP fused to amino-terminal 14 amino acids of PIP3BP, MAKERRKAVLELLQ, localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D, c). A deletion mutant lacking amino acid 1–9 (GFP-PIP3BP(−NLS)) was diffusely distributed all over the cells (Fig. 1 D,b), suggesting that the targeting mechanism of the protein to the nucleus was absent. GFP alone was detected in all parts of the cells (Fig. 1 D, d). These results suggest that the amino acid 1–14 of PIP3BP targets the proteins to the nucleus. Fractionation of COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector for Myc-PIP3BP by homogenizing and centrifugation revealed that PIP3BP free from GFP was also located in the nucleus (see below). The above results suggest that PIP3BP may play a role in the nucleus. We therefore determined whether or not PIP3 was generated in the nucleus. Various cells were stimulated by agonists and fractionated, and the lipids were analyzed by TLC. PI 3-kinase is strongly activated to give a strong signal of PIP3 in 293T cells treated with 10 mmH2O2. 2H. Konishi et al., submitted for publication. We first used this system. As shown in Fig.2 A, generation of PIP3 in the nucleus was detected in those cells as well as in the membrane. The fractionation was confirmed by Western blotting of Src and Myc, which are membrane and nuclear proteins, respectively (Fig. 2 C). When the nuclear fraction of the H2O2-treated 293T cells was prepared and incubated with [32P]ATP-MgCl2, generation of PIP3 was clearly detected; it was not seen in that of the untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). The presence of PIP3in the samples was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the lipids, using a SAX5 column (data not shown). In the H2O2-treated 293T cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins was extremely elevated, suggesting the activation of many signaling pathways (28Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fractionation of the cells revealed that the level of p85 in the nuclear fraction was markedly elevated after H2O2 treatment and considerable tyrosine phosphorylation on nuclear p85 was detected (Fig.2 C), suggesting that the activation of PI 3-kinase activity in the nucleus may be because of relocalization of the enzyme. PIP3 was also detected in the nucleus in 293T cells transiently expressed, constitutively active PI 3-kinase, NGF-treated PC12 cells, and PDGF-treated NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A). Recently, several groups have used PIP3-binding proteins, such as ARNO and GRP1, fused to GFP, as a means to visualize changes in cellular PIP3 levels (29Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, they failed to detect the nuclear PIP3. This may be because of failure of nuclear localization of these proteins. To test the effect of PI 3-kinase on the localization of PIP3BP, COS-7 cells were transfected with the constructs for expression of PIP3BP and constitutively active PI 3-kinase (BD110), and the cells were fractionated and distribution of PIP3BP was determined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both PIP3BPs fused to GFP and a Myc tag were fractionated in nucleus in the absence of the activated PI 3-kinase. In contrast, they were localized in the membrane or cytosolic fractions when the constitutively active PI 3-kinase was co-expressed. The cells were observed under the microscope to detect the relocalization of GFP-PIP3BP. Co-expression of BD110 resulted in exportation out of the protein from the nucleus in more than 75% of the transfected cells (Fig. 3 B), whereas fluorescence was detected almost exclusively in the nucleus without expression of BD110 (data not shown). The kinase negative version of PI 3-kinase did not cause this effect (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of the cells with wortmannin resulted in relocation of PIP3BP to the nucleus within 30 min, suggesting that cells were not damaged by the expression of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3 B). Point mutations of PH domains in PIP3BP were suggested to abolish the binding to PIP3, previously (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Swada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y. Shirai T. Terada Y. Kimura K. Nagata S. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This mutant PIP3BP was not exported out of the nucleus (Fig.3 B). These results suggest that interaction of the PH domains and PIP3 is responsible for the relocation of PIP3BP. These results suggest that PIP3BP can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm depending on the activity of PI 3-kinase. It is well known that PI 4,5-P2 is present in the nucleus, probably in the nuclear membrane. It is possible that PI 3-kinase which is present in the cytosol can approach the nuclear membrane at least from the cytosolic side to produce PIP3. We found that PI 3-kinase can be targeted after H2O2 treatment of 293T cells. The condition used here was artificial; however, PI 3-kinase may be a specific protein that is targeted to the nucleus because Coomassie Blue staining patterns of the proteins in the nuclear fractions from H2O2-treated and -untreated cells were almost identical. Although a drastic condition may be required for nuclear localization of a considerable amount of PI 3-kinase, this finding implicates that a small amount of PI 3-kinase, which is undetectable by the present methods, can be targeted to the nucleus after appropriate stimulation of the cells. The results in this paper clearly indicate that PIP3BP can function as a PIP3-binding protein. Therefore, the fact that PIP3BP is targeted to the nucleus suggests that there may be an unknown function of PIP3BP in the nucleus. The exportation of PIP3BP out of the nucleus was resistant to leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear exportation signal (NES)-dependent exportation. We are currently examining how PIP3BP is exported out of the nucleus to understand the role of the protein. We thank Dr. Kathy Barker for critical reading of the paper."
https://openalex.org/W1989911355,"K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as taxol, that induce cell death by apoptosis. This resistance is mediated by the chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogene Bcr-Abl. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl protects K562 cells from apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that expression of PKCι is necessary for the resistance of K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis (Murray, N. R., and Fields, A. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 27521–27524). We now demonstrate that treatment of K562 cells with taxol leads to sustained activation of PKCι. In contrast, Bcr-Abl-negative HL60 myeloid leukemia cells, which are sensitive to taxol-induced apoptosis, do not exhibit sustained PKCι activation in response to taxol. Treatment of K562 cells with tyrphostin AG957, a selective Bcr-Abl inhibitor, blocks taxol-induced PKCι activation and sensitizes these cells to taxol-induced apoptosis, indicating that PKCι is a relevant downstream target of Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active PKCι by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer rescues AG957-treated K562 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both Bcr-Abl and PKCι activity are necessary for apoptotic resistance in K562 cells. Furthermore, they identify PKCι as a critical downstream target of Bcr-Abl that is sufficient to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcr-Abl. K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as taxol, that induce cell death by apoptosis. This resistance is mediated by the chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogene Bcr-Abl. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl protects K562 cells from apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that expression of PKCι is necessary for the resistance of K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis (Murray, N. R., and Fields, A. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 27521–27524). We now demonstrate that treatment of K562 cells with taxol leads to sustained activation of PKCι. In contrast, Bcr-Abl-negative HL60 myeloid leukemia cells, which are sensitive to taxol-induced apoptosis, do not exhibit sustained PKCι activation in response to taxol. Treatment of K562 cells with tyrphostin AG957, a selective Bcr-Abl inhibitor, blocks taxol-induced PKCι activation and sensitizes these cells to taxol-induced apoptosis, indicating that PKCι is a relevant downstream target of Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active PKCι by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer rescues AG957-treated K562 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both Bcr-Abl and PKCι activity are necessary for apoptotic resistance in K562 cells. Furthermore, they identify PKCι as a critical downstream target of Bcr-Abl that is sufficient to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcr-Abl. Leukemia is a malignant disease of the bone marrow that is the leading cause of cancer death in children and adults under the age of 35 (1Landis S.H. Murray T. Parker S.L. Tong T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. Cancer J. Clin. 1998; 48: 6-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Leukemias arise in hematopoietic progenitor cells and are characterized by impaired or blocked differentiation, uncontrolled proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis (2Hiddemann W. Griesinger F. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 3-25PubMed Google Scholar). Many leukemias can be effectively treated using one or combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxol, that induce apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 3Kerr J.F. Winterford C.M. Harmon B.V. Cancer. 1994; 73: 2013-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). A notable exception is chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; GFP, green fluorescent protein. which is highly resistant to most commonly utilized chemotherapeutic drugs, including taxol (4Green D.R.

Blood. 1995; 86: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CML cells, such as K562 cells, are characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation involving chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (6Nowell P.C. Hungerford D.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1960; 25: 85-89PubMed Google Scholar,7Rowley J.D. Nature. 1973; 243: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). In K562 cells, the Abl tyrosine kinase gene on chromosome 9 is translocated into the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) region on chromosome 22 producing a chimeric gene whose product, Bcr-Abl, expresses disregulated Abl tyrosine kinase activity (8Kurzrock R. Gutterman J.U. Talpaz M. New Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The Bcr-Abl gene is the transforming activity responsible for CML (9Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 247: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), and the resistance of K562 cells to drug-induced apoptosis is conferred by Bcr-Abl (5Bedi A. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. el-Deiry W.S. Sidransky D. Vala M.S. Akhtar A.J. Hilton J. Jones R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell.

Res. 1996; 20: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) leads to increased sensitivity of K562 cells to apoptosis induced by many drugs including taxol. Despite the importance of Bcr-Abl in resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which Bcr-Abl exerts its anti-apoptotic effects (18Amarante-Mendes G.P. McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Afar D.E.H. Witte O.N. Green D.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that expression of the atypical PKC isozyme, PKCι, is important for resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have now further defined the role of PKCι in this process. We find that treatment of K562 cells with taxol leads to potent and sustained activation of PKCι. In contrast, treatment of HL60 cells, which are sensitive to taxol-induced apoptosis, does not lead to appreciable activation of PKCι. Furthermore, inhibition of Bcr-Abl using the highly selective inhibitor tyrphostin AG957 blocks PKCι activation and sensitizes K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis. Tyrphostin AG957-treated cells can be rescued from taxol-induced apoptosis by expression of constitutively active PKCι. These data, along with our previous results (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), demonstrate that PKCι activation is both necessary and sufficient to mediated the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcr-Abl. Human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were maintained in suspension culture as described previously (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml were treated with paclitaxel (taxol) at the concentrations and for the time periods indicated in the figure legends. In some cases, the Bcr-Abl-selective inhibitor tyrphostin AG957 or the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY 294002 were added to K562 cell cultures at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends prior to treatment with taxol. Tyrphostin AG957 is a highly selective Bcr-Abl inhibitor that blocks Bcr-Abl-mediated cell growth and resistance to apoptosis in K562 cells (12Anafi M. Gazit A. Zehavi A. Ben-Neriah Y. Levitzki A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3524-3529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was assessed by the presence of apoptotic bodies or chromosomal condensation and by trypan blue exclusion as described previously (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These morphological manifestations of apoptosis correlate directly with the apoptotic DNA fragmentation induced by taxol and provide a convenient method to quantitate the apoptotic response (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For assessment of nuclear DNA morphology, 1 × 105 cells were fixed and permeablized with 1% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 37 °C, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min, and observed under phase-fluorescence optics. A minimum of 500 cells for each treatment were scored for the presence of apoptotic bodies. K562 and HL60 cell extracts were lysed directly into SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis for PKCι as described previously (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that K562 cells express PKCι but no detectable PKCζ (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Protein quantitation was carried out using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Antigen/antibody complexes were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation kinase assay of PKCι, K562 and HL60 cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. PKCι antibody was first bound to 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h prior to addition to clarified lysates and further incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with RIPA buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmCaCl2) to remove unbound proteins. Washed beads were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μg of histone substrate, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by addition of SDS buffer and boiling prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Constitutively active PKCι was generated by PCR amplification of a fragment containing an A120E substitution within the pseudosubstrate domain of human PKCι. Such a mutation has previously been shown to induce constitutive activity in PKCι (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). TheEcoRV/NdeI-digested fragment was subcloned into similarly digested full-length PKCι cDNA and sequenced to confirm the presence of this single mutation. PKCιA120E (designated caPKCι) was then subcloned into pXCX.CMV, a transfer vector based on pXCX2 (22Spessot R. Inchley K. Hupel T.M. Bacchetti S. Virology. 1989; 168: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing the expression cassette from pRcCMV (Stratagene). Recombinant adenoviruses containing either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (a kind gift from Phil Poronik, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia) or constitutively active PKCι were produced by homologous recombination with pJM17 (a circular form of the adenovirus genome) in HEK 293 cells as described (23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: Manipulation of Adenovirus Vectors Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-128Google Scholar). Once recombinant viruses were plaque purified and characterized by Western blot analysis, concentrated viral lysates were generated by infection of HEK 293 cells as described (23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: Manipulation of Adenovirus Vectors Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-128Google Scholar). Viral lysates (titers of ∼1012plaque-forming unit/ml) were used to infect K562 cells. Briefly, viral lysate was transfected into K562 cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, cells were treated with taxol and/or AG957 for 24 h, at which time cells were assayed for apoptosis as described above. Infection efficiency was routinely >95% as judged by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression. caPKCι expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation kinase assay of total cell lysates from cells 24 h after infection as described above. Recently, we demonstrated that PKCι expression is important for resistance of K562 cells to apoptotic agents including taxol (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Specifically, overexpression of PKCι leads to enhanced resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis, whereas antisense inhibition of PKCι expression leads to sensitization to taxol-induced apoptosis (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These results suggested that changes in PKCι expression and/or activity may play a critical role in the survival of K562 cells to apoptotic stress. To determine whether the level of PKCι expression is a key determinant of resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, we studied two human leukemic cell lines that differ in their sensitivity to taxol-induced apoptosis. HL60 cells are sensitive to taxol, undergoing dose-dependent apoptosis such that in the presence of 100 nm taxol, >90% of HL60 cells are apoptotic after 24 h (Fig.1 A). In contrast, K562 cells are highly resistant to taxol-induced apoptosis showing little or no apoptosis after 24 h in up to 325 nm taxol (Fig.1 B). To assess whether this difference in resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis correlates with PKCι expression, both cell lines were treated with 100 nm taxol for up to 50 h, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis for PKCι as described previously (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, these cell lines express similar basal levels of PKCι (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, PKCι levels do not vary in response to taxol-induced apoptotic stress, suggesting that differences in resistance to apoptosis are not due to differences in PKCι expression. Therefore, we measured PKCι activity in K562 and HL60 cells during taxol-induced apoptotic stress (Fig. 2 C). Cells were treated with 100 nm taxol and PKCι immunoprecipitated from cell lysates at the indicated times and assayed for PKCι activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that >90% of total cellular PKCι is captured by this antibody (data not shown). Basal PKCι activity is similar in K562 and HL60 cells prior to exposure to taxol, consistent with the similar levels of PKCι expression in these cells. When HL60 cells are treated with 100 nm taxol, very little change in PKCι activity is observed over the first 25 h, by which time >90% of HL60 cells are apoptotic. After 25 h, PKCι activity drops to undetectable levels by 36 h. This loss of PKCι activity is not due to proteolytic degradation because the levels of PKCι do not change over this time course (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, PKCι activity in K562 cells is dramatically induced in response to taxol (Fig. 2 C). Increased PKCι activity is seen at 6 h, peaks at 12 h, and is sustained over the subsequent 36 h. Quantitation of the data indicates a 6.5-fold increase in PKCι activity by 12 h. These data demonstrate that endogenous PKCι is activated in response to apoptotic stress in K562 cells but not HL60 cells, suggesting that sustained PKCι activation may be important in the resistance of K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis. The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is the oncogene responsible for CML and is highly expressed in K562 cells but is absent from HL60 cells. Bcr-Abl is required for both transformation and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis of K562 cells (5Bedi A. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. el-Deiry W.S. Sidransky D. Vala M.S. Akhtar A.J. Hilton J. Jones R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 1994; 83: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the proximal downstream targets of Bcr-Abl critical for the resistance phenotype are not known. Given the involvement of PKCι activation in taxol resistance, we determined whether taxol-induced PKCι activation in K562 cells was dependent upon Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Furthermore, because Bcr-Abl can directly bind, phosphorylate, and activate PI 3-kinase (24Gotoh A. Miyazawa K. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 115-120PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar) to generate PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which can in turn activate PKCι (26Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we also determined whether PI 3-kinase activity was required for taxol-induced PKCι activation. K562 cells were treated with 100 nmtaxol in the presence or absence of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor tyrphostin AG957 (12Anafi M. Gazit A. Zehavi A. Ben-Neriah Y. Levitzki A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3524-3529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (27Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or LY294002 (28Vlahos C. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 12 h. PKCι activity was subsequently determined by immunoprecipitation kinase assay. Taxol treatment leads to potent activation of PKCι above the basal activity seen in the absence of taxol (Fig. 3 A). However, tyrphostin AG957 completely abolishes taxol-induced PKCι activation, whereas neither wortmannin (100 nm) nor LY294002 (100 μm) affected PKCι activation despite the fact that they were used at concentrations well above their IC50 values (5 nm for wortmannin (27Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1.4 μm for LY294002 (28Vlahos C. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Tyrphostin AG957-mediated inhibition of taxol-induced PKCι activation is dose-dependent and is nearly complete at 30 μm consistent with the effective doses of the compound that inhibit Bcr-Abl activity (12Anafi M. Gazit A. Zehavi A. Ben-Neriah Y. Levitzki A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3524-3529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrphostin AG957 leads to dose-dependent sensitization of K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis consistent with its ability to inhibit PKCι activation (Fig. 3 C). Neither wortmannin nor LY294002 had any effect on taxol-induced apoptosis, consistent with the lack of inhibition of PKCι observed with these PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Taken together, these data indicate that Bcr-Abl is an upstream regulator of taxol-induced PKCι activation, that PKCι activation is important for resistance of K562 cells to taxol, and that Bcr-Abl-mediated PKCι activation does not require PI 3-kinase activity. To determine whether PKCι activity is sufficient to protect K562 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis, we used recombinant adenovirus gene transfer to express constitutively active PKCι in K562 cells. Constitutively active PKCι adenovirus (caPKCι-Ad) was produced by mutation of alanine 120 to glutamic acid in the pseudosubstrate region of PKCι as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This mutation has been demonstrated to lead to constitutive activation of PKCι (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). K562 cells were infected with either GFP or caPKCι adenovirus for 24 h. GFP immunofluorescence demonstrated that >95% of cells are infected under these conditions. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays demonstrate that GFP-Ad-infected cells contain PKCι activity comparable with uninfected cells (Fig.4 A). In contrast, cells infected with caPKCι-Ad contain 3–5-fold higher levels of PKCι activity. Adenovirus-infected cells were next treated with taxol and tyrphostin AG957 for 24 h, and the level of apoptosis was assessed (Fig. 4 B). Neither taxol nor tyrphostin AG957 alone induced apoptosis in GFP- or caPKCι-expressing K562 cells. However, in the presence of tyrphostin AG957, taxol induced apoptosis in GFP-expressing cells. In contrast, expression of caPKCι blocked taxol-induced apoptosis in tyrphostin AG 957-treated cells. These results demonstrate that PKCι is a downstream target of Bcr-Abl and that PKCι activity is sufficient to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcr-Abl. PKC is a family of serine/threonine, lipid-dependent kinases implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Overexpression of PKCα leads to gene dose-dependent cytostasis and increased sensitivity to PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, whereas inhibition of PKCα expression blocks PMA-induced differentiation, demonstrating that PKCα plays a direct role in this process (31Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PKCβII leads to a small increase in proliferation and resistance to PMA-induced differentiation (31Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKCβII expression blocks proliferation, demonstrating that PKCβII is required for this process (31Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proliferative effects of PKCβII are mediated, at least in part, through the cell cycle-regulated translocation and activation of the enzyme at the nucleus (32Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rather, overexpression of PKCι leads to enhanced resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, and antisense inhibition of PKCι expression leads to increased sensitivity to apoptosis, indicating an important role in resistance to drug-induced apoptosis (19Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Atypical PKC isozymes can also protect NIH 3T3 cells against UV-induced apoptosis (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), indicating that atypical PKCs may play a general role in cell survival and protection from apoptotic stress. However, the mechanism by which PKCι protects cells from apoptosis is not known. In NIH 3T3 cells, atypical PKC activity is inhibited by UV exposure prior to the onset of apoptosis, suggesting that atypical PKC activity is required for cell survival (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In this and our previous studies, we provide direct evidence that PKCι activity is both necessary and sufficient for resistance of K562 cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Our results with PKCι are reminiscent of those described previously for Bcr-Abl, whose expression and tyrosine kinase activity is required for resistance of K562 cells to drug-induced apoptosis (5Bedi A. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. el-Deiry W.S. Sidransky D. Vala M.S. Akhtar A.J. Hilton J. Jones R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, although both HL60 and K562 cells express similar levels of PKCι, the pattern of PKCι activity in these cells during apoptotic stress is distinct. During apoptotic stress, sustained activation of PKCι is observed in K562 cells but not HL60 cells, suggesting that K562 cells possess an upstream regulator of PKCι activity that is either not present or is defective in HL60 cells. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of Bcr-Abl blocks taxol-induced PKCι activation and induces apoptosis in K562 cells, demonstrating that Bcr-Abl is required for taxol-induced PKCι activation. An interesting aspect of our results is the fact that PI 3-kinase activity is not required for Bcr-Abl-mediated PKCι activation or protection from taxol-induced apoptosis. PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate can stimulate atypical PKC activityin vivo (24Gotoh A. Miyazawa K. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 115-120PubMed Google Scholar). Our results do not preclude involvement of the PI 3-kinase pathway in the activation of PKCι in response to other cellular stimuli. Bcr-Abl is a well characterized oncoprotein whose transforming phenotype is linked to its anti-apoptotic properties. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors quercetin or genistein (15Beran M. Cao X. Estrov Z. Jeha S. Jin G. O'Brien S. Talpaz M. Arlinghaus R.B. Lydon N.B. Kantarjian H.

Our results using the highly selective Bcr-Abl inhibitor tyrphostin AG957 are consistent with these studies and demonstrate that PKCι activation is a requisite downstream target of Bcr-Abl necessary for its anti-apoptotic function. Future studies will focus on determining the molecular mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates PKCι and on identification of the downstream targets of PKCι that mediate its anti-apoptotic effects."

The potentiating effect of MgADP is conferred by the sulfonylurea receptor subunit of the channel, SUR, whereas the inhibitory effect of ATP appears to be mediated via the pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2.

The pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, is a member of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel family (10Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J.

Unlike most other Kir channels, expression of Kir6.2 alone does not produce functional channel activity; instead, it requires coexpression with SUR1. However, an isoform of Kir6.2 in which the last 26 amino acids have been removed (Kir6.2ΔC26) is capable of expressing functional K+ channel activity in the absence of SUR1. Kir6.2ΔC26 retains sensitivity to inhibition by ATP, and mutations in this subunit can significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This has been taken as evidence that the primary site at which ATP acts to cause KATP channel closure resides on Kir6.2. However, controversy still remains as to whether ATP binds directly to Kir6.2, whether truncation of Kir6.2 exposes a cryptic blocking site for nucleotides, or whether ATP inhibition is mediated indirectly by binding of the nucleotide to an endogenous subunit that modulates the activity of Kir6.2 (9Babenko A. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Kir6.2 directly binds the photoaffinity analog of ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and that this labeling can be reduced by 50% with 100 μm ATP. We also demonstrate that the related inwardly rectifying K+channel subunit Kir4.1, which is not inhibited by ATP, exhibits no significant photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP. Furthermore, we show that mutations in Kir6.2 that reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP on channel activity also reduce photoaffinity labeling. This provides strong evidence that ATP binds directly to Kir6.2. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding full-length wild-type or mutant mouse Kir6.2, tagged with the Flag epitope at the NH2 terminus and with a hexahistidine tag at the COOH terminus (Flag-Kir6.2), or tagged with the Flag epitope at the COOH terminus (Kir6.2-Flag), using LipofectAMINEplus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Rat Kir4.1 was tagged with the Flag epitope at the COOH terminus (Kir4.1-Flag). Addition of these epitopes did not significantly affect the functional properties of the channel (data not shown). Two days after transfection, cellular membranes were prepared as described previously (16Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out with an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak). 8-Azido-[γ-32P]ATP (500–600 GBq/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Membranes were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, 4 mmMgSO4, and 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 6 μl for 10 min on ice. After UV irradiation (at 254 nm, 4.4–8.2 milliwatts/cm2) for 15 s to 3 min, 500 μl of TE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmEGTA) was added to the mixture, and free 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The pellet was solubilized with 100 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15m NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)-methane-sulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Flag-Kir6.2 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with the anti-Flag M2 antibody. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Bound 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP to Kir6.2 was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film Co.). Experiments were carried out in duplicate. Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant inside-out patches excised from Xenopusoocytes expressing Kir6.2ΔC26, as described previously (17Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmää C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV in response to repetitive voltage ramps from −110mV to +100 mV, at 20–24 °C. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH), and the internal (bath) solution contained 110 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm KOH, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH) and 8-azido-ATP as indicated. ATP dose-response relationships were measured by alternating the control solution with a test ATP solution, and the extent of inhibition by ATP was expressed as a fraction of the mean of the value obtained in the control solution before and after ATP application (17Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmää C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ATP dose-response curves were fit to the Hill equation G/G c = 1/(1 + ([ATP]/K i)h), where [ATP] is the ATP concentration, K i is the ATP concentration at which inhibition is half-maximal, and h is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). We first examined the ability of 8-azido-ATP to inhibit Kir6.2ΔC26 currents. Fig. 1 shows that this nucleotide blocks Kir6.2ΔC26 currents rather less potently than ATP, half-maximal inhibition (K i) occurring at 2.8 ± 0.4 mm (n = 6) compared with 172 ± 7 μm for ATP (n = 6). The Hill coefficients were 0.9 ± 0.2 for 8-azido-ATP and 1.3 ± 0.1 for ATP. We next investigated the direct interaction of Kir6.2 with ATP using the photoaffinity ATP analog, 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP. Flag-Kir6.2 and Kir4.1-Flag were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and expression levels were monitored by immunoblot analysis of membrane fraction preparations (Fig. 2 A). Membranes were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP for 10 min on ice and irradiated with UV light. Flag-Kir6.2 and Kir4.1-Flag were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag M2 antibody and subjected to electrophoresis. The autoradiogram in Fig. 2 Bshows an approximately 43-kDa photoaffinity-labeled protein to be immunoprecipitated from Flag-Kir6.2 transfected cells (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and4) but not from untransfected cells (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4). The molecular mass of this photoaffinity-labeled membrane protein is identical to that of Flag-Kir6.2 identified by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). Neither of the two bands observed in the Western blot of Kir4.1-Flag transfected cells (Fig. 2 A) exhibited any significant photoaffinity labeling (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). Attachment of the Flag epitope at the COOH terminus of Kir4.1 is unlikely to hinder immunoprecipitation because photoaffinity-labeled Kir6.2-Flag (COOH-terminal tag) was precipitated as efficiently as the NH2-terminal fusion, Flag-Kir6.2 (data not shown). Flag-Kir6.2 could also be photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (data not shown).Figure 3Concentration dependence of photoaffinity labeling of Flag-Kir6.2 with 8-azido-[γ-32P] ATP.Membranes (100 μg) from untransfected COS-7 cells (A) or COS-7 cells expressing Flag-Kir6.2 (B) were incubated with 8-azido-[γ-32P] ATP at 10 μm (lane 1), 50 μm (lane 2), 100 μm(lane 3), and 200 μm (lane 4). Proteins were photoaffinity-labeled with UV irradiation (at 254 nm, 4.4 milliwatts/cm2) for 3 min. Flag-Kir6.2 was immunoprecipitated with antibody M2 after solubilization as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Membranes from Flag-Kir6.2 transfected cells were incubated with different concentrations of 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP and photoaffinity-labeled (Fig.3 B). Photoaffinity labeling increased with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, and no saturation was observed at the highest concentration tested (200 μm). No protein smaller than 50-kDa showed specific photoaffinity labeling in membranes from untransfected COS-7 cells, even with 200 μm 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig.3 A). To determine whether photoaffinity labeling of Flag-Kir6.2 was specific, competition by ATP was examined (Fig. 4). Membranes were preincubated with 100 μm, 1 mm, and 2 mm ATP on ice for 10 min, and then 50 μm8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was added. Photoaffinity labeling of Flag-Kir6.2 was reduced as the concentration of ATP was increased. Quantitation by radioimaging analysis revealed that photoaffinity labeling was reduced by approximately 50% in the presence of 100 μm ATP. We have previously identified two mutations that reduce the apparent ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2ΔC26 from a K i of ∼100 μm to ∼4 mm. These are R50G in the NH2 terminus and K185Q in the COOH terminus (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Neither mutation affects the level of channel expression as examined by electrophysiological methods and immunoblotting. The effect of these mutations on 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP binding was examined. Membranes prepared from cells expressing equivalent amounts of the wild-type and mutant forms of Flag-Kir6.2 (Fig.5 A) were labeled using 100 μm 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig.5 B). Quantitation of the labeling by radioimaging analysis revealed that photoaffinity labeling of the mutants R50G and K185Q was reduced by 50 and 65%, respectively, as compared with wild-type Flag-Kir6.2. The results we present here provide the first biochemical evidence that ATP binds directly to Kir6.2. We demonstrate that Kir6.2 can be specifically labeled by the ATP photoaffinity analog 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the absence of SUR and that this labeling can be significantly reduced by competition with ATP. Furthermore, the related subunit Kir4.1, which is not inhibited by ATP, exhibits no photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP. Further evidence of the direct and specific interaction of ATP with Kir6.2 is provided by the observation that mutations in Kir6.2 that reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP on channel activity also reduce the photoaffinity labeling. We have previously reported that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP with high affinity (16Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). SUR1 was efficiently photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[32P]ATP by UV irradiation even after the removal of unbound 8-azido-ATP. In contrast, Kir6.2 was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[32P]ATP by UV irradiation after the removal of unbound 8-azido-ATP (data not shown). Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP did not appear to saturate even at a concentration 200 μm (Fig.3). These results indicate that Kir6.2 has much lower affinity for 8-azido-ATP than SUR1. This is consistent with the result of the lower affinity of Kir6.2 for 8-azido-ATP (K i = 2.8 mm) as compared with ATP itself (K i = ∼100 μm). Introduction of the reactive azido group at the 8′ position may account for this reduced affinity because Kir6.2 demonstrates high specificity toward the adenine moiety of ATP (15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Labeling with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP required 0.1 mm ATP for approximately 50% displacement, a value that is consistent with that found for half-maximal inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC26 currents (∼0.1 mm). Mutations in both the NH2- and COOH-terminal intracellular domains have been identified that significantly reduce ATP inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC26 currents (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mutations R50G in the NH2 terminus and K185Q in the COOH terminus both reduce theK i for inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC26 from ∼100 μm to ∼4 mm (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In support of the fact that channel inhibition is mediated by a direct interaction of ATP with Kir6.2, we found that both of these mutations also exhibit significantly reduced photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5). Neither mutation affected the channel gating kinetics (15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and so are predicted to influence ATP sensitivity by effects on ATP binding and/or the link between binding and gating. However, although we show that mutations in both the NH2- and COOH-terminal intracellular domains influence labeling, it remains unclear whether the effect of these mutations reflects a direct interaction of these residues with ATP or whether their effects on ATP binding are mediated indirectly."

https://openalex.org/W2109332814,"Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA. We have investigated the role of polyadenylation in the degradation of RNA by the purifiedEscherichia coli degradosome in vitro. RNA molecules with 3′-ends incorporated into a stable stem-loop structure could not readily be degraded by purified polynucleotide phosphorylase or by the degradosome, even though the degradosome contains active RhlB helicase which normally facilitates degradation of structured RNA. The exoribonucleolytic activity of the degradosome was due to polynucleotide phosphorylase, rather than the recently reported exonucleolytic activity exhibited by a purified fragment of RNase E (Huang, H., Liao, J., and Cohen, S. N. (1998) Nature391, 99–102). Addition of a 3′-poly(A) tail stimulated degradation by the degradosome. As few as 5 adenosine residues were sufficient to achieve this stimulation, and generic sequences were equally effective. The data show that the degradosome requires a single-stranded “toehold” 3′ to a secondary structure to recognize and degrade the RNA molecule efficiently; polyadenylation can provide this single-stranded 3′-end. Significantly, oligo(G) and oligo(U) tails were unable to stimulate degradation; for oligo(G), at least, this is probably due to the formation of a G quartet structure which makes the 3′-end inaccessible. The inaccessibility of 3′-oligo(U) sequences is likely to have a role in stabilization of RNA molecules generated by Rho-independent terminators. Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA. We have investigated the role of polyadenylation in the degradation of RNA by the purifiedEscherichia coli degradosome in vitro. RNA molecules with 3′-ends incorporated into a stable stem-loop structure could not readily be degraded by purified polynucleotide phosphorylase or by the degradosome, even though the degradosome contains active RhlB helicase which normally facilitates degradation of structured RNA. The exoribonucleolytic activity of the degradosome was due to polynucleotide phosphorylase, rather than the recently reported exonucleolytic activity exhibited by a purified fragment of RNase E (Huang, H., Liao, J., and Cohen, S. N. (1998) Nature391, 99–102). Addition of a 3′-poly(A) tail stimulated degradation by the degradosome. As few as 5 adenosine residues were sufficient to achieve this stimulation, and generic sequences were equally effective. The data show that the degradosome requires a single-stranded “toehold” 3′ to a secondary structure to recognize and degrade the RNA molecule efficiently; polyadenylation can provide this single-stranded 3′-end. Significantly, oligo(G) and oligo(U) tails were unable to stimulate degradation; for oligo(G), at least, this is probably due to the formation of a G quartet structure which makes the 3′-end inaccessible. The inaccessibility of 3′-oligo(U) sequences is likely to have a role in stabilization of RNA molecules generated by Rho-independent terminators. Polyadenylation of mRNA contributes to its stability and maturation and to the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells (2Jackson R.J. Standart N.

Furthermore, disruption of the pcnB gene, encoding poly(A) polymerase I, results in increased stability of RNA I (12Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In E. coli, degradation of mRNA is mediated by the concerted action of endo- and exoribonucleases. A large multienzyme complex (the degradosome) includes two of the most important ribonucleases, the endoribonuclease RNase E and the 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease PNPase 1The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).(16Carpousis A.J.

Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), together with the DEAD box helicase RhlB, enolase, and a non-stoichiometric amount of polyphosphate kinase (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20Blum E. Py B. Carpousis A.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The roles of enolase and polyphosphate kinase in mRNA degradation are not yet clear. However, RhlB has a central role in the degradation of mRNAs with stable stem-loop structures (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Purified PNPase is impeded by stem-loop structures in RNA, whereas PNPase in the degradosome can degrade structured RNA: in the degradosome, the RhlB helicase unwinds such structures in an ATP-dependent fashion to permit the passage of PNPase. Thus, the degradosome is generally efficient at degrading structured RNA. However, in this study, we show that the degradosome is inefficient in degrading RNA molecules with their 3′-ends incorporated into a stem-loop structure. Addition of a single-stranded 3′-poly(A) tail facilitated degradation, providing a “toehold” permitting the degradosome to initiate its attack on the 3′-end of the RNA. The genotypes of the E. coli strains used in this study were as follows: BL21 (F − ompT r −B m −B) and HB101 (F − Δ(gpt-proA)62 leuB6 supE44 ara-14 galK2 lacY1 Δ(mcrC-mrr) rpsL20(Strr) xyl-5 mtl-1 recA13). Cells were grown in LB medium with antibiotics as appropriate (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids pCH77 (22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar), pET-20b (Novagen), and pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) have been described. DNA manipulations were performed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and enzymes were used as recommended by the manufacturers. PurifiedE. coli poly(A) polymerase was purchased from Cambio (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The degradosome was purified following the protocol described by Carpousis et al. (16Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) as modified by Py et al. (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). For in vitro RNA degradation assays, RNA was transcribed from DNA templates generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA fragments from the intergenic region of themalE-malF operon of E. coli were amplified using pCH77 as template (22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar) with the same 5′-primer A (5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and each of the three alternative 3′-primers: 3′-primer i, 5′-TGCCGGATGCGACGCTGACG-3′; 3′-primer ii, 5′-(T15)TGCCGGATGCGACGCTGACG-3′; and 3′-primer iii, 5′-TTATCCGACAACAACTGCCGGATGCGACGCTGACG-3′. The PCR fragments generated (320, 335, and 335 bp, respectively) contained a T7 promoter at the 5′-end and could therefore be used directly for in vitro transcription (see below) to synthesize RNA molecules of 297, 312, and 312 nucleotides, respectively. All these RNAs also contained the A → C change indicated in Fig. 1. The 3′ termini of these RNAs ended precisely at the 3′-base of the malE-malF stem-loop structure (“stem”) (3′-primer i), with a 3′-A15 tail (“stemA15”) (3′-primer ii), or with 15 nucleotides of the original malE-malF sequence downstream of the stem-loop (“stemN15”) (3′-primer iii). To transcribe RNA molecules with 5 or 10 adenosine residues or 15 guanosine or 15 uridine residues downstream of the stem-loop, derivatives of 3′-primer ii were used in which the T15 sequence (boldface) was exchanged for the appropriate C or A nucleotides. Two DNA fragments in which the malE-malF intergenic region was shortened at the 5′-end by 86 nucleotides, compared with the fragments described above, were amplified using 5′-primer B (5′-AAATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCGCAGATGTCCGCTTTC-3′) together with each of 3′-primers ii and 3′-iii to generate 3′-A15 or 3′-N15 tails downstream of the stem-loop, respectively. These PCR products (250 bp) also contained a T7 promoter at the 5′-end such that in vitro transcription generated RNA molecules of 228 bp (named “sstemA15” and “sstemN15”). A DNA fragment in which the stem-loop structure of themalE-malF region was replaced by the terminator stem-loop of the lpp gene (for the mRNA sequence, see Ref. 22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified using 5′-primer A (see above) and the 3′-primer 5′-AAAAAAATGGCGCACAATGTGCGCCATTTTTCATTTCACAGCATTACTTGGTGAT-3′. The PCR product (266 bp) used as a template for in vitrotranscription gave a 243-nucleotide RNA molecule (named “lpp-stem”). Radiolabeled RNA was synthesizedin vitro from linearized, gel-purified DNA templates using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Pharmacia) and [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham) as described previously (22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription reactions were diluted to 70 μl in water, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and eluted through a Push column (Stratagene) to separate unincorporated nucleotides. The RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water (MilliQ). The RNA products stemA15, stemU15, and sstemA15 migrated as broad bands (especially sstemA15 in Fig. 8, band e), probably because runoff transcription does not stop precisely at the end of the DNA template due to the weak deoxyribo(T)n-ribo(A)n or deoxyribo(A)n-ribo(U)n interactions. In vitrotranscribed, radiolabeled RNA was incubated with E. colipoly(A) polymerase and 5 mm ATP in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer (Cambio) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform and further treated as described above (see “In Vitro Transcription”). In vitro RNA degradation assays were performed as described (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The reaction (100 μl) contained exonuclease assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmK2HPO4), 1 mm ATP, and 80 units of RNasin (Promega) and was incubated with enzyme at 37 °C. Unless otherwise stated, 0.18 μg of His-tagged PNPase or 0.66 μg of the degradosome was added to each reaction. Aliquots were taken at appropriate time points, loaded onto a 4 or 6% sequencing gel, and electrophoresed at 60 watts. The gel was dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper, and radioactivity in each band was quantitated with a PhosphorImager. The gene encoding PNPase was amplified by PCR fromE. coli HB101 genomic DNA using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATATTAATCATATGCTTAATCCGATCGTT-3′ and 5′-CCCCAAGCTTCTCGCCCTGTTCAGC-3′ were based on thepnp sequence (GenBankTM accession number U18996) and amplified the pnp gene flanked by NdeI andHindIII restriction sites (boldface) to facilitate subsequent cloning. After amplification, gel purification, and cleavage with HindIII, the 2254-bp PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) digested with SmaI andHindIII. The pnp gene was excised from the resulting plasmid with NdeI and HindIII and recloned into pET-20b (NdeI/HindIII). The resulting plasmid, pPNPHIS, contained the pnp gene under the control of the T7 promoter, allowing inducible overexpression of a PNPase derivative with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in E. coli strain BL21. His-tagged PNPase was purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography (24Hochuli E. Döbeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) as described previously for His-tagged polyphosphate kinase (20Blum E. Py B. Carpousis A.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Buffer A for resuspending the cell pellet and for washing steps consisted of 0.1 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 1% Tween, 1 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted in steps using 5 ml of buffer B (0.1 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, and 1% Tween) containing 30, 50, 80, 120, and 500 mm imidazole, respectively. His-tagged PNPase was purified to near homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (see Fig.4 A). The fractions containing the protein peak were pooled and stored in 50% glycerol (final concentration) at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined as described (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. To examine the influence of polyadenylation on RNA degradation in vitro, various polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNAs were incubated with the degradosome in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. As the primary substrate a segment of malE-malF mRNA (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20Blum E. Py B. Carpousis A.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was used (named stem). The 3′-end of this RNA corresponded to the last nucleotide of the stable stem-loop structure of the malE-malF intergenic region (Fig. 1 A), such that the 3′-end was fully incorporated into the secondary structure. Derivatives of this mRNA were generated with an additional 15 adenosine residues (stemA15) or a poly(A) tail (“stem-poly(A)” containing 200–300 adenosine residues), providing a single-stranded 3′-tail. These substrates were incubated with the degradosome, samples were taken at defined time points, and the products were separated on a denaturing gel. Fig.2 A shows an example of such a gel. The rate of disappearance of the mRNA species was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2 B). In all reactions, the oligo(A) tail (when present) was rapidly removed to generate a stable intermediate with its 3′-end close to the base of the stem-loop structure (Fig. 2) (22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). The curves are biphasic (Fig.2 B) because, for a small proportion of the RNA starting material, it appears the degradosome falls off the RNA at the base of the stem-loop (having removed the poly(A) tail), and this species is then unable to be degraded further (see below). In the absence of ATP this intermediate RNA species was only poorly degraded by the degradosome, irrespective of the starting RNA from which it was generated, because ATP is required for the RhlB helicase to unwind the secondary structure (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, however, this intermediate was rapidly degraded, but only for the RNA molecules that initially had a single-stranded A15 or poly(A) tail at their 3′-ends (stemA15 and stem-poly(A)); the RNA lacking any nucleotides added to the 3′-base of the stem-loop (stem) was still resistant to degradation (Fig. 2). The degradation of RNAs containing 5 or 10 adenosine residues did not differ significantly from those containing 15 adenosine residues or a poly(A) tail, demonstrating that the length of the oligo(A) tail is relatively unimportant (Fig.3). As a control, we purified His-tagged PNPase (Fig.4 A). This C-terminally His-tagged PNPase was active as a 3′-exoribonuclease (Fig.4 B), in contrast to N-terminally His-tagged PNPase which is inactive (17Py B. Causton H. Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The stem and stemA15 RNA molecules were incubated with the purified His-tagged PNPase. The purified exoribonuclease did not degrade either stem RNA or stemA15RNA, apart from removing the oligo(A) tail (Fig. 4 C), confirming that, under these conditions, the RhlB helicase of the degradosome is required for the stem-loop structure to be degraded (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). Since addition of a 3′-poly(A) tail stimulated degradation of the stem-loop structure by the degradosome, we assessed whether there was any specificity for the composition of the 3′-tail. The rate of degradation of RNAs with a 3′-tail of 15 guanosines (“stemG15”) or 15 uridines (stemU15) was compared with that of the stem, stemA15, and stemN15 substrates. The stemN15 substrate incorporated a 3′-tail consisting of the 15 nucleotides normally 3′ of the stem-loop in the malE-malF mRNA. Assays were in the presence of 1 mm ATP. The stemN15 RNA was degraded as rapidly as the stemA15 RNA (Fig.5). In contrast, the stemG15and stemU15 RNAs were degraded slowly, at a rate similar to that of the stem RNA. Furthermore, and in contrast to the stemA15, stemN15, and stemU15 RNA substrates, the oligo(G) tail of the stemG15 RNA was removed poorly by the degradosome (Fig.6). Incubation of RNA substrates with purified His-tagged PNPase showed that the purified enzyme was also unable to degrade the oligo(G) tail (Fig. 6), demonstrating that the oligo(G) tail is not accessible to either enzyme.Figure 6Accessibility of RNAs with different homopolymeric tails. Shown is autoradiograph of a denaturing gel. The indicated malE-malF RNA derivatives were incubated with the degradosome (D), with His-tagged PNPase (P), or with no added enzyme (−) for 10 min (stemA15) or for 30 min (stemG15 and stemU15) in the presence of ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vivo, transcription of themalE-malF mRNA terminates several hundred base pairs downstream of the large intergenic stem-loop. A stable RNA molecule with the stem-loop near its 3′-end is then generated by processive exoribonucleolytic degradation from the 3′-end (22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar, 26Newbury S.F. Smith N.H. Robinson E.C. Hiles I.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1987; 48: 297-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To mimic thein vivo situation in vitro, stemN15RNA was incubated with His-tagged PNPase for 15 min; the reaction was stopped; and the resulting RNA was purified. Fig.7 B shows that all the initial substrate was converted to the stable intermediate, designated “stem(N15)*.” Aliquots of stem(N15)* RNA were then polyadenylated and used as substrate for the degradosome in the presence of ATP. Although the residual 3′-tail on stem(N15)*, compared with stem RNA, permitted slightly faster degradation of the stem-loop structure, the degradosome degraded the polyadenylated RNA significantly faster than the non-polyadenylated precursor (Fig. 7, A and C). Similar results were obtained when the stem(N15)* RNA was generated using the degradosome (in the absence of ATP) rather than His-tagged PNPase (data not shown). Thus, polyadenylation enhances the rate of degradation of intermediates equivalent to those generated in vivo. To determine whether PNPase has higher affinity for poly(A) tails than for generic single-stranded 3′-ends, the rate of degradation of the N15tail of stemN15 RNA was compared in the presence of different competing RNA substrates. 5′-Truncated malE-malFcompetitor RNAs were constructed to distinguish them from the substrate RNA following gel electrophoresis. These shorter RNAs (sstemA15 and sstemN15) ended with an A15 or N15 tail 3′ to the stem-loop structures, respectively. In this assay, the concentration of enzyme was reduced to amounts equimolar to the substrate RNA. The competitor RNAs were also added in equimolar amounts. The rate of degradation of the N15 tail of stemN15 in the presence of either competitor (band a going to band b) calculated from the data shown in Fig. 8 give the time, in which 50% of the full-length stemN15 substrate is shortened to the base of the stem-loop structure (td50), as 0.5 min for the sstemN15 substrate alone. Addition of either of the competing substrates (sstemN15 or sstemA15) resulted in a similar increase in td50 to ∼2 min. The removal of the 3′-tails from sstemN15 and sstemA15 can also be seen to occur at a similar rate (generated band d and f, respectively). These data demonstrate that, as long as the 3′-tail is single-stranded and accessible to the enzyme (unlike the G15 tail; see above), it does not matter whether the 3′-tail is poly(A) or is a generic sequence. To demonstrate the general relevance of polyadenylation, the degradation of a primary transcript ending in a native terminator stem-loop was characterized. The lpp terminator (Fig. 1 B) was selected because the lpp mRNA is relatively stable and polyadenylation has been reported in vivo (6Cao G.-J. Sarkar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7546-7550Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Newbury S.F. Smith N.H. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1987; 51: 1131-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The native lpp terminator was used to replace the large stem-loop of the malE-malF RNA, and the resulting mRNA (lpp-stem) and its polyadenylated derivative were used as substrates for the degradosome and for His-tagged PNPase. Equimolar amounts of PNPase were used, whether His-tagged or in the degradosome (0.18 μg of purified His-tagged PNPase is equivalent to 0.66 μg of degradosome containing 28% PNPase (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the malE-malFstem-loop, ATP was not required for degradation of the lppstem-loop by the degradosome, presumably because the lower thermodynamic stability of the stem-loop is such that the RhlB helicase is not essential for unwinding (Fig. 9). Therefore, addition of ATP promoted the degradation only slightly. Nevertheless, the presence of a 3′-poly(A) tail still markedly stimulated degradation of the RNA (whether or not ATP was present) both by the degradosome and by purified PNPase (Fig. 9). Polyadenylation of bacterial mRNA is increasingly recognized as a potentially important destabilizing signal for the RNA degradation machinery. RNA molecules or fragments generated by endoribonuclease cleavage are degraded by one of the 3′ → 5′ exoribonucleases: PNPase or RNase II. These processive exoribonucleases are stalled by stem-loop structures; temporarily at smaller stem-loop structures, but more stable stem-loops (e.g. the malE-malF intergenic stem-loop structure) (19Py B.

In the cell, however, a proportion of PNPase is part of a multiprotein complex, the degradosome (16Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M.

The ATP-dependent helicase activity of RhlB in the degradosome strongly promotes the degradation of structured RNA by unwinding sequences and offering them as single-stranded substrates to PNPase (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus, the degradosome appears to be fully equipped to degrade highly structured RNA molecules (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Since polyadenylation is important for destabilizing structured RNA molecules (9Hajnsdorf E. Braun F. Haugel-Nielsen J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we set out to address the apparent paradox of how polyadenylation might stimulate the activity of the degradosome. In particular, it has previously been suggested that polyadenylation may provide a point of access for ribonucleases (11O'Hara E.B. Chekanova J.A. Ingle C.A. Kushner Z.R. Peters E. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1807-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); this idea was tested experimentally for the degradosome. The malE-malF intergenic region forms a very stable stem-loop structure, and its degradation does not require RNase E cleavage (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). 2G. S. C. Dance and C. F. Higgins, unpublished data. The degradosome and purified PNPase are stalled by the stem-loop structure to give a very stable intermediate in vivo and in vitro (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22McLaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol.

A derivative of the malE-malFmessage with its 3′ terminus incorporated into the stem-loop structure was degraded very poorly by the degradosome in vitro, even when RhlB was active. In contrast, 3′-adenylated derivatives of the RNA were degraded rapidly. This demonstrates that the ability of the degradosome can be limited by the absence of a single-stranded 3′-RNA end. Addition of an oligo(A) tail efficiently destabilized the messagein vitro, even when as few as 5 nucleotides were added. Fewer than 5 adenosine residues did not seem to be recognized (data not shown). Although it has been suggested that as few as 2 adenosine residues might target RNA for degradation (12Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), these studies were carried out in vivo, and nucleases other than the degradosome might be involved. Similarly, Coburn and Mackie (14Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15776-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have indicated that RNA with <6–10 unpaired 3′-residues is stable; these were not adenosines, and the experiments were carried out with purified nucleases, not the degradosome. Although the model malE-malFtranscript studied initially is not normally generated in vivo, we also showed that polyadenylation stimulated degradation of a malE-malF intermediate equivalent to that generatedin vivo and of the lpp 3′-stem-loop generatedin vivo by transcription termination. Thus, polyadenylation appears to stimulate degradation by the degradosome of any structured RNA generated as a termination product or degradation intermediate where the 3′-end has a limited single-stranded tail. Since an N15 generic single-stranded sequence of the stem-loop was as effective as the A15 sequence and since A15and N15 sequences competed equally well for degradation, the destabilizing effect appears be due to the single-stranded nature of the 3′-end rather than to a high affinity for poly(A) per se. Interestingly, a 3′-oligo(G) tail did not stimulate degradation of RNAin vitro (Fig. 5). Furthermore, neither the degradosome nor purified PNPase could even shorten the G15 tail, suggesting that the sequence is inaccessible to these enzymes. G-rich sequences are able to form intramolecular or intermolecular G quartets (30Sugimoto N. Ohmichi T. Sasaki M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1996; 15: 559-567Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Sundquist W.I. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 893-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which are very resistant to nucleases (32Bishop J.S. Guy-Caffey J.K. Ojwang J.O. Smith S.R. Hogan M.E. Cossum P.A. Rando R.F. Chaudhary N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5698-5703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and which presumably render the 3′-end inaccessible to enzymatic attack. A 3′-U15 tail also failed to destabilize the RNA. There is no known structure an oligo(U) tail might adopt, although in contrast to the G15 tail, the U15 tail was shortened by the degradosome and by PNPase in vitro (Fig. 6), showing that it remains accessible. More important, every RNA generated from a gene with a Rho-independent terminator ends in a 3′-oligo(U) tail. Thus, apart from the terminator stem-loop itself, this oligo(U) sequence of the terminator may contribute significantly to the stability of such mRNAs, protecting against 3′ → 5′ exoribonucleolytic attack. Recently, a purified N-terminal fragment of RNase E was reported to remove 3′-poly(A) and 3′-poly(U) tails (1Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence argue against the possibility that RNase E, rather than PNPase, is responsible for the exoribonucleolytic activities of the degradosome observed here. First, the exoribonucleolytic activity of the degradosome containing a temperature-sensitive RNase E is still efficient at the nonpermissive temperature (19Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Since both the endoribonucleolytic and poly(A) tail-shortening activities of RNase E are in the same N-terminal region of the polypeptide (1Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the poly(A) shortening should also be inactive at the nonpermissive temperature. Second, purified PNPase gave the same pattern of 3′-poly(A) tail shortening as the degradosome. Third, characterization of the released nucleotides by thin-layer chromatography allowed us to distinguish which enzyme is involved. 3C. Burns and C. F. Higgins, unpublished data. Thus, the reported exoribonucleolytic activity reported for a fragment of RNase E is unlikely be significant in RNA degradation by the degradosome. In conclusion, we have shown that polyadenylation can play an important role in the degradation of mRNA molecules that have 3′-terminal secondary structures, providing a single-stranded toehold recognized by the degradosome. 3′-Structured RNAs are normally generated by Rho-independent termination, by endonuclease cleavage, or by stalling of 3′ → 5′ exonucleases at an internal secondary structure. Poly(A) polymerase can potentially pin a label “to be degraded” to structured RNA generated by any of these processes that is otherwise inaccessible to ribonucleases. Thus, “initiation of degradation” of structured RNA by polyadenylation may play an important role not only in the degradation of functional RNA molecules with inaccessible (structured) 3′-ends, but also in recycling the small structured RNA degradation intermediates generated during cellular RNA turnover.

In the present study, we investigated whether the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway is involved in cellular signaling of the Gi protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor in myeloid differentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells. Receptor activation resulted in rapid and transient production of SPP by sphingosine kinase, which was abolished after pertussis toxin treatment. Direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by AlF4− also rapidly increased SPP formation in intact HL-60 cells. In cytosolic preparations of HL-60 cells, sphingosine kinase activity was stimulated by the stable GTP analog, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Inhibition of sphingosine kinase bydl-threo-dihydrosphingosine andN,N-dimethylsphingosine did not affect phospholipase C stimulation and superoxide production but markedly inhibited receptor-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization and enzyme release. We conclude that the formyl peptide receptor stimulates through Gi-type G proteins SPP production by sphingosine kinase, that the enzyme is also stimulated by direct G protein activation, and that the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway apparently plays an important role in chemoattractant signaling in myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells.

During the last few years, it has become clear that sphingolipids, in addition to being structural constituents of cell membranes, are sources of important signaling molecules. Particularly, the sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; DHS, dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine; DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; fMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PTX, pertussis toxin. have emerged as a new class of potent bioactive molecules, implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation (1Hannun Y.A.

Interest in SPP focused recently on two distinct cellular actions of this lipid, namely its function as extracellular ligand activating specific G protein-coupled membrane receptors and its role as intracellular second messenger (5Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Important clues to a specific intracellular action of SPP were the following findings. First, activation of various plasma membrane receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (6Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 7Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G. Hakomori S. Ross R. J.

Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and the FcγRI antigen receptors (9Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9393-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), was found to rapidly increase intracellular SPP production through stimulation of sphingosine kinase. Second, inhibition of sphingosine kinase stimulation strongly reduced or even prevented cellular events triggered by these tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, such as receptor-stimulated DNA synthesis, Ca2+ mobilization, and vesicular trafficking (6Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 8Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Melendez A.

Finally, intracellular SPP was found to mimic the receptor responses,i.e. it stimulated DNA synthesis and mobilized Ca2+ from internal stores (10Qiao L. Kozikowski A.P. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Ghosh T.K.

We recently reported that the G protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes m2 and m3 expressed in HEK-293 cells also induce a rapid and transient SPP production by sphingosine kinase. Furthermore, intracellular injection of SPP rapidly mobilized Ca2+ in intact HEK-293 cells and inhibition of sphingosine kinase markedly inhibited Ca2+ signaling by these and other G protein-coupled receptors (14Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To characterize the mechanisms leading to sphingosine kinase activation by G protein-coupled receptors and the cellular role of this pathway, we investigated whether the formyl peptide receptor stimulates sphingosine kinase in myeloid differentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells, whether G proteins participate in this process, and, finally, whether sphingosine kinase activation is involved in specific cellular responses to receptor stimulation in HL-60 cells. It is well established that most, if not all, cellular responses to formyl peptide receptors in HL-60 cells and neutrophils, including phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation, Ca2+ mobilization, superoxide production, and enzyme release, are mediated by pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi-type G proteins (15Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we report that formyl peptide receptor activation rapidly stimulates sphingosine kinase in differentiated HL-60 cells and that G proteins are involved in this process. Moreover, it is shown that inhibition of sphingosine kinase by dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS) orN,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) does not affect PLC stimulation and superoxide production but largely inhibits receptor-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization and enzyme release. N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), lucigenin, dibutyryl cAMP, cytochalasin B, staurosporine,p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide, andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucosaminide were obtained from Sigma.

All other materials were from previously described sources (14Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J.

Immediately before use, stock solutions of the lipids made in methanol or isopropanol were dried down and dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (118 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), containing in addition 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 150 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. Differentiation into neutrophil-like cells was induced by culturing HL-60 cells for 48 h in the presence of 0.5 mmdibutyryl cAMP. For PTX treatment, cells were incubated for 20 h with 50 ng/ml PTX (16Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wieland T. Liedel K. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sphingosine kinase-catalyzed formation of SPP was measured as described before (14Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In brief, differentiated HL-60 cells (1.8 × 106 cells) equilibrated in Hanks' balanced salt solution/bovine serum albumin for 5 min at 37 °C were incubated with [3H]sphingosine (∼105 cpm; final concentration, 30 nm) for 30 s to 10 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold methanol, followed by 1 ml of chloroform. After vigorous vortexing and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, particulate matter was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac centrifuge. After redissolving in 20 μl of methanol, the samples were spotted onto Silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck), together with authentic unlabeled sphingosine and SPP. Separation of the products was achieved by TLC in 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:1:1) as a solvent system. Sphingosine and SPP spots were visualized by staining with ninhydrin spray. After scraping, radioactivity in the spots was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Formation of [3H]SPP is expressed as cpm/1.8 × 106 cells and corrected for time 0 count rates, amounting to 80–100 cpm. Differentiated HL-60 cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (1.2 × 106 cells/ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol and disrupted on ice by 50–100 strokes in a pre-cooled Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 20 min at 50,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected and used directly in sphingosine kinase assays. Enzyme activity was determined for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl, containing 10 μm[3H]sphingosine (∼105 cpm), 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and HL-60 cytosol (120–200 μg of protein). Reactions were terminated by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold methanol. Extraction, TLC separation, and quantification of [3H]SPP were carried out as described above. Sphingosine kinase activity is expressed as pmol SPP formed per mg protein and 20 min. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 in a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter as described before (18van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Zhang C. Laser K.T. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 956-961PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, Ca2+ was omitted from the medium, and in addition 5 mm EGTA was added 2 min before stimulus exposure. Measurement of PLC-catalyzed inositol phosphate formation was performed as described in detail previously (19Schmidt M. Bienek C. van Koppen C.J. Michel M.C. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 352: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, after labeling for 48 h withmyo-[3H]inositol (2.5 μCi/ml) in inositol-free medium, differentiated HL-60 cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution/bovine serum albumin with or without the indicated agents. Cells were then incubated with 10 μm fMLP at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm LiCl for 20 s and 10 min to measure formation of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and total [3H]inositol phosphates, respectively, as reported before (19Schmidt M. Bienek C. van Koppen C.J. Michel M.C. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 352: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Generation of superoxide anions in differentiated HL-60 cells was measured with the lucigenin assay (20Bhakdi S. Martin E. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (18van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Zhang C. Laser K.T. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 956-961PubMed Google Scholar). Release of β-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase enzymes from HL-60 cells was assessed as described (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Immunobiology. 1990; 181: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated HL-60 cells (3.5–5 × 106 cells) were suspended in 500 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml). Reactions initiated by the addition of fMLP were conducted for 5 min at 37 °C and terminated by placement of the tubes on ice. After cell pelleting, activities of β-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase enzymes in supernatant fluids and cell lysates were determined as described (22Absolom D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 95-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Release of the enzymes is given as a percentage of the total cellular content. Unless otherwise stated, results are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each done in duplicates or triplicates. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's two-tailed t test for unpaired data. First, we investigated whether the formyl peptide receptor activates the sphingosine kinase in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells. For this, formation of [3H]SPP from [3H]sphingosine was determined for various periods of time at 37 °C in the absence and presence of the receptor agonist fMLP, which was applied simultaneously with the radiolabel. Cellular uptake of [3H]sphingosine was fast, reaching 76% of total added after 30 s and 84% after 5 min of incubation, and was not influenced by fMLP (data not shown). Basal conversion of [3H]sphingosine by sphingosine kinase to [3H]SPP was also rapid, and within 2–5 min a plateau of [3H]SPP was reached (Fig.1 A). Activation of the formyl peptide receptor by 10 μm fMLP induced a rapid and transient increase in [3H]SPP production (Fig.1 B). After 2 min, the increase in [3H]SPP reached a maximum of 63 ± 11% (n = 6) above basal [3H]SPP formation in unstimulated cells. Comparable increases in [3H]SPP production were observed in cells stimulated for 2 min with 0.1 μm and 1 μmfMLP. When the measurements were performed in the presence of the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, DHS (30 μm) or DMS (15 μm) (6Olivera A. Spiegel S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), basal and fMLP-stimulated formation of [3H]SPP were inhibited by 80–90% (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the formyl peptide receptor is capable of stimulating SPP production by sphingosine kinase in differentiated HL-60 cells. To investigate the signaling pathway leading to sphingosine kinase activation, we studied first whether Gi-type G proteins are involved in the formyl peptide receptor action. Thus, formation of [3H]SPP was measured in control and PTX-treated HL-60 cells. Stimulation of control cells for 2 min with 10 μmfMLP increased [3H]SPP levels by 67 ± 17% over unstimulated cells (Fig. 2 A). PTX treatment (50 ng/ml, 20 h) had no effect on basal [3H]SPP production but completely blocked fMLP-induced stimulation of sphingosine kinase, indicating that activation of sphingosine kinase by the formyl peptide receptor is mediated by Gi-type G proteins. To directly assess the role of G proteins in sphingosine kinase stimulation, we studied the effects of direct G protein activation on [3H]SPP formation in intact cells and in a cell-free system. Direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by AlF4− in intact HL-60 cells led to a rapid and transient production of [3H]SPP, in a manner similar to the receptor agonist fMLP (Fig. 2 B). [3H]SPP levels in cells stimulated for 1, 2, and 5 min with AlF4− amounted to 117, 142, and 46%, respectively, above unstimulated control cells. Sphingosine kinase activity has been found to be present in the cytosol of various cell types (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and purification of a cytosolic sphingosine kinase from rat kidney has recently been reported (26Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study G protein regulation of sphingosine kinase in a cell-free system, the effects of various guanine nucleotides on sphingosine kinase activity were investigated in cytosol prepared from differentiated HL-60 cells. Addition of the stable GTP analog GTPγS stimulated SPP production by sphingosine kinase in HL-60 cell cytosol by about 50% in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50value of less than 1 μm and a maximal effect at 10–100 μm (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, addition of GTP (100 μm) and the stable GDP analog GDPβS (500 μm) did not alter basal sphingosine kinase activity (Fig. 3 B). However, GDPβS (500 μm) almost fully blocked sphingosine kinase stimulation by GTPγS (100 μm). Together, these results indicate that G proteins are signal transduction components in the pathway leading to sphingosine kinase activation in myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells. Previous studies in other cell types suggested that sphingosine kinase activation represents a Ca2+ signaling pathway for some plasma membrane receptors (8Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol.

Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because fMLP stimulated sphingosine kinase, we investigated the role of this pathway in Ca2+ mobilization in HL-60 cells. Stimulation of HL-60 cells with fMLP (0.1 nm to 0.1 μm) in the presence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ markedly increased [Ca2+]i (Fig.4 A). Maximal increase by about 500 nm was observed at 0.1 μm fMLP. In cells pretreated for 1 min with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor DHS (30 μm), [Ca2+]i increases were reduced by 80–90% at all fMLP concentrations examined, even at a supramaximally effective fMLP concentration of 10 μm(data not shown). Half-maximal inhibition of fMLP (0.1 μm)-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase by DHS was observed at 5.9 ± 0.4 μm (Fig.4 B). A similar inhibition was observed with DMS, another sphingosine kinase inhibitor (IC50 = 5.2 ± 0.9 μm). As exemplified in Fig. 4 C, treatment of HL-60 cells with DHS (30 μm) also markedly inhibited the fMLP (1 μm)-stimulated [Ca2+]iincrease measured in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. DHS and DMS by themselves did not cause an increase in [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells. To dismiss the possibility that the sphingosine kinase inhibitors might deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores, we studied the effect of DHS (30 μm) on [Ca2+]ielevations induced by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, in the absence of external Ca2+. In contrast to fMLP stimulation, maximal [Ca2+]iincreases induced by thapsigargin (1 μm) were not affected by DHS (control cells, 73 ± 4 nm; DHS-treated cells, 87 ± 4 nm). The time to peak [Ca2+]i after thapsigargin addition, however, was significantly (p < 0.05) increased from 60 ± 8 s in control cells to 103 ± 9 s in DHS-treated cells (data not shown). The inhibitory action of DHS and DMS on fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was not caused by inhibition of PLC stimulation. Preincubation of HL-60 cells for 10 min with 30 μm DHS or 15 μm DMS, strongly reducing Ca2+ mobilization, neither altered basal nor inhibited fMLP (10 μm)-stimulated production of either IP3or total inositol phosphates (Table I). Furthermore, release of 45Ca2+ induced by IP3 (0.3–20 μm) from45Ca2+-preloaded saponin-permeabilized cells, measured as described before (27Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Niederdräing N. Neumann E. Fröde R. Lass H. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 354: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was not affected by pretreatment of HL-60 cells for 10 min with 30 μm DHS. Finally, because DHS and DMS can act as protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (28Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Toyo Kuni T. Dean B. Fujita S. Sugimoto M. Ogawa T. El-Ghendy K. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6796-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we examined whether the inhibition of Ca2+ signaling might be due to PKC inhibition. However, in contrast to DHS and DMS, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the PKC inhibitors staurosporine (100 nm, 3 min), or bisindolylmaleimide I (100 nm, 15 min) had no effect on the fMLP (0.1 μm)-induced [Ca2+]i elevation, amounting to 605 ± 36 nm in control cells and 637 ± 26 and 591 ± 99 nm in staurosporine- and bisindolylmaleimide I-treated cells, respectively (data not shown).Table ILack of effect of DHS and DMS on basal and fMLP-stimulated PLC activities in HL-60 cellsTreatment[3H]IP3[3H]Inositol phosphatesBasalfMLPBasalfMLPcpm/106 cellscpm × 10−3/106 cellsNone99 ± 12222 ± 273.66 ± 0.8514.3 ± 4.04DHS115 ± 9242 ± 294.02 ± 0.8114.7 ± 4.07DMS105 ± 17206 ± 235.03 ± 1.4514.9 ± 3.97Formation of [3H]IP3 and total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined in differentiated HL-60 cells pretreated for 10 min without (None) and with 30 μm DHS or 15 μm DMS in the absence (Basal) and presence of 10 μm fMLP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Formation of [3H]IP3 and total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined in differentiated HL-60 cells pretreated for 10 min without (None) and with 30 μm DHS or 15 μm DMS in the absence (Basal) and presence of 10 μm fMLP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Finally, the role of sphingosine kinase in two well characterized functional responses of myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells to formyl peptide receptor activation was examined, namely production of superoxide anions by NADPH oxidase and enzyme exocytosis. Pretreatment of differentiated HL-60 cells for 1 min with 30 μm DHS did not affect the superoxide production induced either by a maximally effective concentration of fMLP (1 μm) or by a half-maximally effective one (10 nm) (Fig.5). On the other hand, staurosporine (100 nm) strongly inhibited (by 70 ± 0.5%) the fMLP (1 μm)-stimulated production of superoxide anions (data not shown). In contrast to superoxide production, formyl peptide receptor-stimulated enzyme release was strongly affected by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors. As illustrated in Fig.6 A, pretreatment of HL-60 cells for 5 min with 30 μm DHS or 15 μm DMS inhibited, by 45–50%, the fMLP (1 μm)-stimulated release of β-glucuronidase. A similar inhibition was observed when the effect of DMS on fMLP (1 μm)-stimulated release ofN-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase was examined (Fig.6 B). Pretreatment with DMS inhibited receptor-stimulated release of this enzyme half-maximally and maximally (about 85% inhibition) at 12 and 20 μm DMS, respectively. Basal enzyme release was not affected by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors. In contrast to DHS and DMS, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with staurosporine (100 nm, 3 min) did not affect fMLP-stimulated β-glucuronidase release (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrate that sphingosine kinase catalyzing formation of SPP from sphingosine is rapidly activated by formyl peptide receptors in myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells, a process apparently mediated by Gi-type G proteins, and that sphingosine kinase activity is also stimulated by direct G protein activation, both in intact cells and in a cell-free system. Furthermore, by using the two sphingosine kinase inhibitors DHS and DMS, evidence is provided suggesting that the sphingosine kinase pathway plays an important role in functional responses of HL-60 cells triggered by activation of the formyl peptide receptor. The time course and the magnitude of fMLP-stimulated SPP production in HL-60 cells were comparable with those reported for the G protein-coupled muscarinic receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells and for various tyrosine kinase-linked receptors in other cellular systems (6Olivera A.

Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sphingosine kinase inhibitors DHS and DMS effectively suppressed basal and fMLP-stimulated SPP formation, indicating that sphingosine kinase is in fact responsible for SPP production in HL-60 cells. The present study demonstrates for the first time that G proteins are involved in sphingosine kinase activation. First, similar to most other cellular responses of formyl peptide receptors in HL-60 cells and neutrophils (15Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the fMLP-induced sphingosine kinase stimulation was completely abolished in PTX-treated cells, indicating participation of Gi-type G proteins. Second, direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by AlF4− also markedly increased SPP production in intact HL-60 cells, with a time course similar to that observed for the formyl peptide receptor agonist. Third, the stable GTP analog GTPγS stimulated sphingosine kinase activity in HL-60 cytosolic fractions with a concentration-response curve in the μm range, and this stimulation was prevented by the stable GDP analog, GDPβS. The identity of the GTP-binding protein mediating the stimulatory effect of GTPγS, which can activate both heterotrimeric and low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, on HL-60 cytosolic sphingosine kinase activity is presently under investigation. In agreement with our previous findings on muscarinic receptors in HEK-293 cells (14Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we provide evidence that the sphingosine kinase pathway is involved in the formyl peptide receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in HL-60 cells. Short-term pretreatment of the cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitors DHS and DMS potently reduced the fMLP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, with IC50 values (5–6 μm) in the ranges of those described for inhibition of sphingosine kinase activity (6Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 8Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Control experiments excluded that suppression of Ca2+ signaling by DHS and DMS was caused by PKC inhibition, depletion of internal Ca2+stores, and perturbation of the PLC/IP3 pathway. It is highly unlikely that the intracellularly formed SPP is released from the cells and stimulates the cells in an autocrine manner,i.e. by activation of plasma membrane sphingolipid receptors. First, there was no evidence of fMLP-stimulated release of [3H]SPP into the medium. Second, similar to results reported before in promyelocytic HL-60 cells (18van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Zhang C. Laser K.T. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 956-961PubMed Google Scholar), extracellularly added SPP only marginally increased [Ca2+]i in differentiated HL-60 cells (by ≤30 nm at 1 μm SPP). Finally, desensitization of this small SPP-induced [Ca2+]i increase by 70% following overnight treatment of the cells with 1 μm SPP did not affect the formyl peptide receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increase (data not shown). The lag time between peak [3H]SPP formation and [Ca2+]i increase most likely results from the time span required for extracellularly applied [3H]sphingosine to cross the plasma membrane and reach intracellular sphingosine kinase to be converted to [3H]SPP. Because SPP and IP3 are generated in a similar time-frame, there may be a concerted action of SPP and IP3 in releasing Ca2+ from internal stores. In this sense, we found that DHS caused a delay in Ca2+release induced by thapsigargin, without reducing the maximal [Ca2+]i increase by this agent. In lacrimal acinar cells, the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]irise due to leakage of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores has been shown to be dependent on basal levels of IP3 (29Smith P.M. Gallacher D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of SPP after DHS treatment may explain the delay in Ca2+ release induced by thapsigargin. Our data thus suggest that although the formyl peptide receptor strongly stimulates PLC-catalyzed IP3 formation, an intact sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway is required for the receptor-elicited Ca2+ mobilization, similar to the results reported before for other receptors in other cell types (8Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol.

Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, Ca2+ mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells by the G protein-coupled receptors for endothelin-1 and thrombin, both strongly stimulating the PLC/IP3 pathway, has been reported to be independent of the IP3 receptor (30Mathias R.S. Mikoshiba K. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1456-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative or additional mechanism, which may be the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway, appears to be involved in Ca2+ signaling by these receptors, similar to the results shown here for the formyl peptide receptor in HL-60 cells. At present, the connection between the two pathways in Ca2+ signaling is not clear. To investigate the physiological role of the sphingosine kinase in chemoattractant signaling, we studied the effects of the sphingosine kinase inhibitors on superoxide production and enzyme release. Production of superoxide anions by the NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells involves several membrane and cytosolic proteins and can be turned on by various distinct mechanisms, including increase in [Ca2+]i and PKC activation but also by Ca2+- and PKC-independent pathways (31Morel F. Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 32Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, DHS (30 μm), causing marked inhibition of fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i increase, had no effect on superoxide production induced by fMLP, both at maximally and half-maximally effective concentrations of this stimulus, whereas the PKC inhibitor staurosporine strongly inhibited the fMLP response. These results indicate that sphingosine kinase is apparently not involved in the signaling pathway to NADPH oxidase. In contrast to superoxide production, there is a tight correlation between rises in [Ca2+]i and enzyme exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes (34Nübe O. Serrander L. Foyouzi-Yousefi R. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28360-28367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of differentiated HL-60 cells with DHS and DMS strongly inhibited the fMLP-stimulated release of β-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. Moreover, the inhibition of fMLP-inducedN-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase release and [Ca2+]i increase by DMS exhibited a similar concentration dependence, strongly suggesting that inhibition of enzyme release is, at least to a major extent, due to blockade of Ca2+ mobilization. Because the fMLP-stimulated enzyme release was not completely inhibited by DHS or DMS at concentrations effectively blocking fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i rises, it appears that the activated receptor generates additional signals required for exocytosis, e.g. stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (34Nübe O.

Finally, the differential sensitivity of the cellular events triggered by the formyl peptide receptor to DHS and DMS (i.e. no effect on PLC stimulation and superoxide production, but marked inhibition of Ca2+mobilization and enzyme release) underlines the specificity of the sphingosine kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that formyl peptide receptors stimulate through PTX-sensitive Gi-type G proteins SPP production by sphingosine kinase in myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells and that this enzyme is also stimulated by direct G protein activation. Furthermore, evidence is provided that the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway is involved in Ca2+ and exocytosis signaling pathways but apparently not in superoxide production in phagocytic cells."

The A-subunit contains two distinct structural domains linked by a disulfide bridge: an A1-fragment (residues 1–192) that displays ADP-ribosyl transferase activity and an A2-fragment (residues 193–240) that mediates interaction with the B-subunit pentamer (4Sixma T.K.

The B-subunits of Ctx and Etx (CtxB and EtxB, respectively) bind to cell surface receptors, principally GM1-ganglioside, found ubiquitously on the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells (7Holmgren J. Lönnroth I. Svennerholm L. Infect. Immun. 1973; 8: 208-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ctx and Etx exhibit a remarkable degree of structural homology, with 81.6% sequence identity between CtxA and EtxA and 82.5% sequence identity between CtxB and EtxB (8Dallas W.S. Falkow S. Nature. 1980; 288: 499-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Mekalanos J.J. Swartz D.J. Pearson G.D.N. Harford N. Groyne F. de Wilde M.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), there are a number of subtle physicochemical and functional differences between the two toxins. For example, although the B-subunit pentamers of both toxins are resistant to environmental conditions that normally lead to protein denaturation, the pH stability of EtxB is almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of CtxB (11Ruddock L.W. Ruston S.P. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29953-29958Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that the receptor binding specificities CtxB and EtxB are slightly different; whereas both bind with high affinity to ganglioside GM1, and to a lesser extent to GD1b, EtxB also binds significantly to glycoprotein receptors and polyglycosylceramides, and with lower affinity to GM2, asialo-GM1, and paragloboside (12Holmgren J.

Sequence differences between CtxA and EtxA are spread throughout the polypeptides with the lowest identity surrounding the A1/A2 cleavage site and near the C terminus of the A2-fragment (10Domenighini M. Pizza M. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The influence on toxin function of most of the primary amino acid sequence divergence has not yet been fully explored. The action of cholera toxin and related enterotoxins on eukaryotic cells depends on a complex sequence of events that eventually leads to alterations in ion fluxes and a concomitant loss of water, characteristic of cholera and related diarrheal diseases. The use of polarized human colonic epithelial T84 cells has greatly facilitated studies of Ctx and Etx, since toxicity can be readily monitored as the induction of electrogenic Cl− secretion (18Lencer W.I. Delp C. Neutra M.R. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Toxin action is initiated by binding of the B-subunit moiety to cell surface receptors. Recently, it was demonstrated that, following binding of Ctx to T84 cells, Ctx-GM1 complexes cluster in caveolae-like detergent insoluble subdomains of the plasma membrane (19Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Invagination and internalization of these membrane domains results in the formation of smooth endocytic vesicles that enter vesicular trafficking pathways leading to transport of the toxin to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (18Lencer W.I.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17038-17044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of a KDEL sequence at that the C terminus of CtxA (RDEL in EtxA) have suggested that the toxin is transported from the TGN to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Indeed, mutations in the K(R)DEL sequence of CtxA and EtxA reduce the efficiency of toxin-induced Cl− secretion in T84 cells (22Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Jobling M.G. Webb H.M. Ruston S. Madara J.L. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the A-subunit may detach from the B-subunits in the TGN, since only the A-subunit (A1/A2-fragments) has been detected in the ER (23Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.-D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Majoul I.V. Bastiaens P.I.H. Soling H.-D. J.

A. 1996; 93: 12339-12343Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although transport of the holotoxin from the Golgi to the ER, followed by rapid dissociation and anterograde transport of the B-subunit back to the Golgi, has not been excluded. Reduction of the disulfide bond between the A1- and A2-fragments is thought to be catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase resident in the ER (27Majoul I. Ferrari D. Soling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Orlandi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4591-4599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by translocation of the A1-fragment across the ER membrane to the cytosolic compartment. Because of its hydrophobicity, the A1-fragment may remain associated with the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, rather than being released free into the cytosol. The subsequent trafficking and presumed delivery of the A1-fragment to the basolateral membrane are less well understood, although the finding that the A-subunit interacts with “so-called” ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) (29Moss J. Vaughan M. Witholt B. Alouf J.E. Boulnois G. Cossart P. Dijkstra B.W. Falmagne P. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J. Niemann H. Rappuoli R. Wadström T. Bacterial Protein Toxins. 23. Gustav Fischer, Stuttgart1992: 220-228Google Scholar), involved in vesicular transport, may facilitate its anterograde targeting to the basolateral membrane. ARFs have also been demonstrated directly to increase toxin activity in vitro(30Moss J. Tsai S.C. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a finding that may be important in determining the magnitude of toxin action in vivo. The A1-fragments of Ctx and Etx accomplish their toxic effects by ADP-ribosylating GSα, a component of the trimeric GTP-binding protein that activates adenylate cyclase. In T84 cells, toxin-induced elevations in cAMP levels lead to electrogenic Cl− secretion: the primary ion transport event responsible for secretory diarrhea in humans. For Ctx and Etx to exhibit full toxicity, the A-subunits must undergo proteolytic cleavage or “nicking” at Arg-192 to give separate A1- and A2-fragments (31Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Wolf A. Jobling M.G. Ruston S.P. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15562-15568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of cholera toxin, extracellular proteases, such as HA protease produced by V. cholerae, can efficiently nick and activate the A-subunit (32Booth B.A. Boesman-Finkelstein M. Finkelstein R.A. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 558-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Etx from enterotoxinogenic E. coli, as well as recombinant Ctx produced in E. coli, are normally isolated with their A-subunits intact; trypsin or other gut-associated proteases have been postulated to accomplish toxin activation in such cases (33Hunt P.D. Hardy S.J.S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 168-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies on T84 cells have shown that a serine protease, which efficiently nicks and activates both CtxA and EtxA, is present on either the apical surface or in apically-derived transport vesicles (31Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Wolf A. Jobling M.G. Ruston S.P. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15562-15568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this respect, no difference was found in toxicity of commercial (nicked) preparations of Ctx and recombinant Ctx that was either unnicked or nicked with trypsin. The time course and magnitude of electrogenic Cl−secretion in T84 cells demonstrated that Ctx (hereafter referred to as CtxAB) was significantly more active than Etx (hereafter referred to as EtxAB); CtxAB exhibited a shorter apparent lag period and generated a higher short circuit current (22Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Jobling M.G. Webb H.M. Ruston S. Madara J.L. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the structural basis for this difference in toxicity. The data reveal that it is not due to structural or functional differences in the ADP-ribosylating A1-fragment or in the receptor-binding B-subunits, but to the A2-adapter fragment, which mediates A/B-subunit interactions. These findings highlight the importance of a region in the toxin that has hitherto been generally overlooked, and provides a possible contributory explanation for the difference in severity of cholera and traveler's diarrheal disease. All reagents were purchased from Sigma or BDH unless otherwise stated. Monoclonal antibodies CT-17, which recognizes CtxA was the gift of Professor J. Holmgren (University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden), and 118-8, which recognizes the CtxB and EtxB, was provided by Dr. H. Person (University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden). Recombinant human ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (rhARF 6) was provided by Dr. W. Patton (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) The ctxAB operon encoding the A- and B-subunits of cholera toxin was amplified by PCR from the template plasmid, pJBK33 (34Kaper J.B. Lockman H. Baldini M.M. Levine M.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the following primers; 5′-TTGGGCCCGATATCTTTCTGTTAAACAAAG-3′ (CROL1) and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGTTTGCCATACTAATTGCGGC-3′ (CROL2) and ExpandTM high fidelity polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting fragment was cleaved with ApaI andSpeI and then ligated into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) that had been cut with the same restriction enzymes to yield pRC1 (Fig.1). 2The ApaI site is immediately adjacent to the EcoRV site shown in Fig. 1. To facilitate controlled, high level expression of CtxAB, theEcoRV-SpeI fragment of pRC1 was subcloned into pTTQ18 (35Stark M.J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) at the SmaI and XbaI sites to yield pRC9. Plasmid pTRH29 was described previously and is a pBluescript derivative containing the etxAB operon of E. colienterotoxin flanked by EcoRV and SpeI restriction sites (36Yu J. Webb H. Hirst T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1949-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A pTTQ18 derivative, harboring theEcoRV-SpeI fragment from pTRH29 and designated pAM29, has been described (37.Marcello, A., Escherichia coli Heat-labile Enterotoxin: A Multipurpose Delivery System for Peptides and Epitopes. Ph.D. thesisi, 1994, Department of Biology, University of York, York, United Kingdom.Google Scholar). Mutant and hybrid operons were constructed by ligating two separate fragments derived by PCR amplification of upstream and downstream segments of the ctxAB or etxABoperons. pJBK33 was used as the template for amplification of a 5′-fragment encoding CtxA using primers CROL1 and 5′-TCATCCCGAATTCTATTATGTG-3′, and a 3′-fragment encoding CtxB using primers 5′-ATAGAATTCGGGATGAA-3′and CROL2. The 3′-fragment was cloned into pBluescript at the EcoRI-SpeI sites, yielding pATA8. This plasmid was subsequently cut with ApaI and EcoRI, and the 5′ PCR fragment inserted to reconstruct the ctxAB operon, yielding plasmid pATA14 (Fig.1). 2The ApaI site is immediately adjacent to the EcoRV site shown in Fig. 1. The EcoRI site in pATA14 at the junction between the genes encoding the A- and B-subunit resulted in replacement of Lys-237 by Arg in CtxA. TheEcoRV-SpeI fragment of pATA14 was subcloned into pTTQ18, yielding pCDR3. pTRH29 was used as the template for amplification of a 5′-fragment from theetxA gene using the universal reverse primer (Stratagene) 5′-AACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ and oligonucleotide 5′-CCTCTGACTGGTACCCTGAA-3′. The DNA fragment was cleaved with EcoRV and KpnI and inserted into these sites in pBluescript to yield pRC7. pRC1 was used as the template for amplification of a 3′-fragment of thectxAB operon from codon 226 of ctxA using the oligonucleotide 5′-TTTCAGGGTACCAATCTG-3′ and the −40 primer (Stratagene) 5-TTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′. The fragment was then cleaved withKpnI and SpeI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pBluescript, yielding pRC2. The hybrid operon was constructed using an intermediate vector pRCK18, a derivative of pK18 (38Pridmore R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) in which the polylinker sequence had been replaced by one with sites forBamHI-XbaI-SpeI-ClaI-KpnI-NdeI-EcoRV-ApaI-PstI. 3Difficulties were encountered in the construction of the hybrid operons, possibly due to the toxicity of gene products encoded by fragments of the toxin genes; and necessitated the design and use of an intermediate vector. The EcoRV-KpnI fragment from pRC7 was inserted into pRCK18, followed by insertion of theKpnI-SpeI fragment from pRC2. The resultant plasmid was cleaved with EcoRV and SpeI and the hybrid operon cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript to yield pRC18 (Fig. 1). TheEcoRV-SpeI fragment of pRC18 was subcloned into pTTQ18, yielding pRC20. The hybrid operon was constructed in a similar manner to that in pRC18. The 5′-fragment from the ctxA gene was amplified from pRC1 using the universal reverse primer and oligonucleotide 5′-CAGATTGGTACCCTGAAA-3′, and the 3′-fragment of the etxABoperon from codon 226 of etxA was amplified from pTRH29 using the oligonucleotide 5′-TTTTCAGGGTACCAGTCAGA-3′ and the −40 primer. These were cloned separately into pBluescript to yield pRC3 and pRC6, respectively. The subsequent subcloning of these fragments to generate a hybrid operon was carried out in a manner identical to that described above for the construction of pRC18. The resultant plasmid encoding CtxA(1–225)EtxA(226–240)EtxB was designated pRC19 (Fig. 1). The EcoRV-SpeI fragment of pRC19 was subcloned into pTTQ18, yielding pRC21. The EcoRV-EcoRI fragment from pTRH29 was substituted for the same fragment derived from pATA14, yielding plasmid pCDR1 (Fig. 1). The EcoRV-SpeI fragment of pCDR1 was subcloned into pTTQ18, yielding pCDR2. The DNA sequences of all of the cloned operons and constructs were verified by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. V. cholerae 0395NT (9Mekalanos J.J. Swartz D.J. Pearson G.D.N. Harford N. Groyne F. de Wilde M. Nature. 1983; 306: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) with a chromosomalctxAB deletion and harboring pTTQ-plasmid derivatives encoding wild-type, mutant, or hybrid toxins were cultured overnight at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani agar plates supplemented with 30 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were inoculated into NZCYM medium (1% (w/v) NZ amine (ICN Biochemicals), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) casamino acids (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Betalab), 0.2% (w/v) MgSO4·7H2O) plus 200 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C in a rotary shaker. When cultures reached an absorbance of 0.6 (λ = 600 nm), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and cells were cultured for an additional 12 h. A total of 3 liters of culture was centrifuged at 8,000 × g in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge at 4 °C. Sodium hexametaphosphate (39Mekalanos J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was added to the culture supernatant to a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v), the pH adjusted to 4.5 with concentrated HCl, and the mixture stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Precipitated material was recovered by centrifugation at 8,000 × g in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge at 4 °C and then dissolved in 150 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The sample was dialyzed against two changes of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and then centrifuged in a Sigma 4K10 centrifuge at 15,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to 1.0 m (NH4)2SO4, stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore) and toxin purified by FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a modification of the method described by Amin and Hirst (42Amin T. Hirst T.R. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sample was applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (2 × 11 cm, 35-ml bed volume, Source 15PHE, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient (1.0 to 0 m) of (NH4)2SO4 containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing the toxin were pooled, desalted by overnight dialysis against 20 mm Tris base, 20 mm NaCl, pH 8.75, at 4 °C and then applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (20 mm to 1.0m) in 20 mm Tris base, pH 8.75. Fractions containing the toxin were added to a NAP-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to replace the buffer with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and stored at –80 °C. Toxin concentration was determined by UV absorbance at λ = 280 nm using the theoretical molar extinction coefficients for each holotoxin calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (40Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). T84 cells (from passages 75–100) obtained from ATCC were grown and passaged as described (18Lencer W.I. Delp C. Neutra M.R. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 192: 354-389Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Toxins were diluted in prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing (per liter): 0.185 g of CaCl2, 0.098 g of MgSO4, 0.4 g of KCl, 0.06 g of KH2PO4, 8 g of NaCl, 0.048 g of Na2HPO4, 1.0 g of glucose, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, and applied to the apical surface of confluent T84 cell monolayers in Transwell inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA), followed by incubation at 37 °C. Alternatively, T84 cells were placed at 4 °C; the toxins diluted in ice-cold HBSS were then applied apically for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed to remove unbound toxin, fresh HBSS was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. Measurements of short circuit current (I sc) and resistance (R) were performed as reported elsewhere (18Lencer W.I. Delp C. Neutra M.R. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 192: 354-389Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To assay NAD:agmatine ADP-ribosylation (30Moss J. Tsai S.C. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μg of toxin to a mixture (total volume 0.3 ml) containing 10 mm agmatine, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 μm[adenine-U-14C]NAD (90,000 cpm), 20 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GTP, ovalbumin (0.1 mg/ml), 3 mmdimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and 0.2% cholate, with or without 1 μg of rhARF 6. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, duplicate 0.1-ml samples were transferred to columns (0.4 × 5 cm) of AG1-X2 (Bio-Rad) followed by five washes with 1.0 ml of water, which were collected for radioassay in a liquid scintillation counter (30Moss J. Tsai S.C. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The stability of A- and B-subunit interaction in hybrid toxins was determined using an adaptation of a GM1-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (42Amin T. Hirst T.R. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates were coated with GM1-ganglioside (1.5 μg/ml) for 24 h at 4 °C and then washed with PBS. The plates were incubated with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed with PBS. 0.1 ml of toxin (1.5 μg/ml) in PBS with 0.1% (w/v) BSA was then added to each well. After 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and once with PBS, and then the effect of various treatments on the stability of GM1-bound toxin was assessed. PBS alone, PBS containing 0.5% SDS, or McIlvaine buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.5% SDS (0.15 ml) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by the addition of either an anti-CtxA monoclonal antibody (CT-17) or an anti-EtxB monoclonal antibody (118-8) (43Sandkvist M.

In this study, we demonstrate that the nuclear export of importin-β is mediated by the nuclear pore complex-binding domain of this molecule. Insensitivity to leptomycin B indicates that its export is not mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal-specific receptor, CRM1. Furthermore, the nuclear export of importin-β was not inhibited by co-injection with a GTPase-deficient Ran mutant (G19V). The cell line tsBN2 contains a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the RCC1 gene, which encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Ran. At the nonpermissive temperature, importin-β was exported from the nucleus of these cells, even when RanGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Ran, was co-injected. These results not only provide support for the view that Ran-dependent GTP hydrolysis is not required for the nuclear export of importin-β but also indicate that nuclear RanGTP is not essential for its export. As a result, we propose that importin-β can be recycled from the nucleus alone in a Ran-independent manner.

It is well known that the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules occurs through NPCs 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HVJ, hemagglutinating virus of Japan; NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PTAC, nuclear pore-targeting complex; TR, Texas Red; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; WT, wild type; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; aa, amino acid(s); T-APC, SV40 large T-antigen NLS conjugated to allophycocyanin. and that the selective nuclear import and export of proteins occur via a signal- and temperature-dependent pathway (1Davis L.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 865-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Conventional nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins target the nuclear pores via the formation of a stable complex, termed the nuclear pore-targeting complex (PTAC), in the cytoplasm (3Görlich D.

A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This complex is composed of a karyophilic protein and two cytosolic components. One of these (PTAC58/importin-α/karyopherin-α/human SRP1/Srp1/Kap60p) functions as an NLS receptor (2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The other component (PTAC97/importin-β/karyopherin-β/p97/Kap95p) mediates the targeting of the NLS substrate bound to the NLS receptor to the nuclear pores by binding both the NLS receptor and components of the NPC (2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The NPC-binding domain of importin-β is able to migrate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through the NPC, suggesting that importin-β is translocated through the NPC by binding directly to nucleoporins (6Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar,7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After targeting of the trimeric complex to the NPC, the translocation step through the NPC occurs in an energy-dependent manner and requires additional soluble factors, namely a small GTPase Ran and its interacting protein, p10/NTF2 (2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The direct binding of RanGTP to importin-β causes the dissociation of the importin-α/β heterodimer (6Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 8Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 9Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This event is generally thought to occur on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, resulting in the release of NLS substrate into the nucleus (6Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). After the translocation of the NLS substrate into the nucleus, its carrier molecules, importin-α and -β must return to the cytoplasm in order to transport the next NLS substrate into the nucleus. CAS has recently been identified as a nuclear export mediator of importin-α (10Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). CAS is also related to importin-β and binds simultaneously to both importin-α and RanGTP. In addition, it has been reported that Kap95p, which is an Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of importin-β, requires a leucine-rich NES in the molecule for its nuclear export in mammalian and yeast cells (11Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, an export receptor (CRM1/exportin 1/XPO1) for a leucine-rich NES has been identified (12Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 13Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E.

Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). CRM1 is related to importin-β and binds directly to the leucine-rich NES and RanGTP, and this trimeric complex is then translocated to the cytoplasm through the NPC (12Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether or not the nuclear export of mammalian importin-β requires a leucine-rich NES in mammalian cells. Ran is a key component in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins (2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 16Görlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Ran is an abundant, small GTPase of the Ras superfamily, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus (17Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 18Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, Ran is thought to function as a molecular switch by cycling between a GDP- and a GTP-bound state. This cycle is catalyzed mainly by two molecules, RCC1 and RanGAP1 (19Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RCC1 was first identified as a causative gene for the temperature sensitivity of tsBN2 cells derived from hamster BHK21 cells (20Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RCC1 is located on the chromatin (21Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor of Ran, which enhances the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran by about 100,000-fold (17Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 22Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, RanGAP1 is located in the cytoplasm and on the cytoplasmic fibers extending from the NPC (23Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 1457-1470Crossref Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 24Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Ran, which enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis on Ran by about 100,000-fold (22Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The asymmetric distribution of these two factors across the nuclear envelope suggests that nuclear Ran may be predominantly the GTP-bound form and that cytoplasmic Ran is the GDP-bound form. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the asymmetric distribution of RanGTP across the nuclear envelope assures the directional movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (6Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 26Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that mouse importin-β is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the NPC in living mammalian cells and that this nuclear export of importin-β is temperature-dependent. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nuclear export of mammalian importin-β depends on the NPC-binding domain of this molecule and is not mediated by CRM1. Experiments using a GTPase-deficient Ran mutant show that the nuclear export of importin-β does not require Ran-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Further, microinjection experiments using tsBN2 cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature show that importin-β can be transported from the nucleus in a nuclear RanGTP-independent manner. The requirement of Ran on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of importin-β is discussed. MDBK, BHK21, and tsBN2 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C (MDBK, BHK21) or 33.5 °C (tsBN2). Cultured cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h at 37 °C (BHK21) or 39.5 °C (tsBN2) prior to use in microinjection experiments. BHK21 or tsBN2 cells were fused by HVJ as described previously (27Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H. Nishimoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24542-24545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homokaryons were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C (BHK21) or 39.5 °C (tsBN2) prior to microinjection. In experiments using leptomycin B, BHK21 cells were fused by HVJ after preincubation with leptomycin B (2 ng/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum) for 3 h at 37 °C. Expression and purification of recombinant mouse importin-β, the amino acid (aa) 448–876 mutant, and importin-α were performed as described previously (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To construct the expression vector of the aa 145–449 mutant, the region of aa 145–449 of mouse importin-β was amplified by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-TTGGGGAGCTCGAGCATATGAAAGAGTCCACATTGG-3′ and 5′-GAAAAGGTACCAGGTAGACATCGTTGATGGCGGCTTC-3′), and this PCR product was inserted into BamHI and KpnI sites of the pRSETA vector (Invitrogen Corp.). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fragment amplified by PCR was then inserted into aBamHI site. Recombinant GFP-(145–449) protein was expressed by 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18 h at 20 °C in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) and a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The human RanGAP1 gene (30Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was amplified from a HeLa cell cDNA library by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTTCCGGGATCCATGGCCTCGGAAGACATTGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGCAGAATTCCTAGACCTTGTACAGCGTCTGCAG-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-RanGAP1 protein was expressed by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 20 °C in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT) containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by means of a French press. The extract was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 15,000 × g) and incubated with 1.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose. The recombinant protein, which was trapped in glutathione-Sepharose, was eluted with TE buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm glutathione. The GST portion of the GST-RanGAP1 fusion protein was cleaved off by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with 1 National Institutes of Health unit of thrombin/100 μg of protein. GST and thrombin were separated from the recombinant protein on a MonoQ column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0.05–1.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3) and 2 mm DTT. RanGAP1 eluted with 600 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing RanGAP1 were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate and 2 mm DTT. The mouse RanBP1 gene was amplified by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCTACGGATCCATGGCGGCCGCCAAGGACA-3′ and 5′-CCACTGAATTCTCATTGTTTCTCCTCAGACTTCTC-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector. Expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the recombinant fusion protein was performed in the same manner as for RanGAP1. GST and thrombin were separated from the recombinant protein on a MonoQ column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3) and 2 mm DTT. An expression vector of GST-GFP (containing the S65A/Y145F mutation) fusion protein, pGEX-6P-2-hGFP, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kuroda (Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Japan). Expression in E. coli and purification of the recombinant fusion protein was performed in the same manner as for RanGAP1. GST-GFP binding to glutathione-Sepharose was cleaved by PreScission Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Free GFP protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 110 mmpotassium acetate, and 2 mm DTT. These resultant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the region amplified by PCR and in frame ligation of the fused region. Aliquots of each recombinant protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Ran(G19V) (31Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and GST-NES-GFP proteins (32Tachibana T. Hieda M. Sekimoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was dissolved at 5 mg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 mg of Texas Red (TR) was added per 5 mg of BSA, and the solution was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Free fluorophore was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mmHepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate. Peak fractions containing TR-BSA were collected and dialyzed against 10 mmHepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate. Microinjection experiments were performed essentially as described previously (33Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After microinjection and incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 30 min at room temperature. The injected fluorescence-labeled proteins were detected by Axiophot 2 microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). RanGTP overlay assay was performed as described previously (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recombinant importin-β, its aa 145–449 mutant, and RanBP1 were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose and then incubated, first in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 100 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.25% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA, and 5 mm DTT and then preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA, and 5 mm DTT) in the presence of 100 μm GTP. Blots were rinsed with binding buffer and then overlaid with 0.126 pmol/μl [γ-32P]GTP-Ran (specific activity 15400 cpm/pmol) in binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Allophycocyanin (Calbiochem) was chemically conjugated to synthetic peptide containing the amino acid sequence of SV40 large T-antigen NLS (CYGGPKKKRKVEDP), as described previously (28Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized MDBK cells were prepared as described previously (28Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated with transport buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmglycoletherdiaminetetraacetic acid, 2 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) containing test proteins, in 10 μl, under the conditions indicated in the figure legends. After incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in transport buffer. Rabbit anti-mouse importin-β and anti-mouse importin-α antibodies were prepared as described previously (28Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,29Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of affinity-purified antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature. Rabbit antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (TAGO). The samples were examined using an Axiophot 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). It is proposed that importin-β is recycled back to the cytoplasm after termination of translocation of NLS protein-carrier complexes via the binding of RanGTP to importin-β at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. However, the precise mechanism involved in the recycling of importin-β remains obscure. Therefore, we attempted to better understand the mechanism of how importin-β is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after dissociating from the cargo in the nucleus. To accomplish this, we constructed homokaryons by using the HVJ, injected recombinant GFP-fused mouse importin-β proteins into a nucleus of multinucleated cells, and then examined the intracellular localization of GFP-importin-β. As shown in Fig.1 C, GFP-importin-β was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then reimported into all of the nuclei in the homokaryons within 30 min at 37 °C. We next examined whether the export of importin-β is temperature-dependent. After the BHK21 cells were fused by HVJ, the homokaryons were preincubated for 10 min on ice and the recombinant GFP-importin-β proteins were then injected into a nucleus. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the injected GFP-importin-β proteins were largely detected only in the injected nucleus (Fig. 2 A). This finding indicates that importin-β is exported from the nucleus in a temperature-dependent manner. We further examined whether wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) inhibits the nuclear export of importin-β. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the nuclear export of importin-β was inhibited by the co-injection of WGA (2 mg/ml in a needle), whereas the passive diffusion of GFP (about 27 kDa) from the nucleus was not (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the nuclear export of importin-β observed herein does not result from the passive diffusion of the degradation products of GFP-importin-β fusion proteins. Recently, an export receptor (CRM1) for leucine-rich NES was identified (12Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 13Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E.

Meanwhile, it was reported that Kap95p, a yeast homologue of importin-β, contains a region (amino acid residues 55–65) that is similar to the leucine-rich NES motifs and that this region of Kap95p is sufficient to mediate the active nuclear export of Kap95p (11Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More recently, an antibiotic, leptomycin B was demonstrated to specifically inhibit the leucine-rich NES-mediated nuclear export by binding directly to CRM1 (35Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D.

Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 37Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether nuclear export of mouse importin-β is inhibited by leptomycin B. BHK21 cells were preincubated with leptomycin B at 2 ng/ml in a culture medium for 3 h at 37 °C and then fused by HVJ. As reported previously, nuclear export of GST-NES-GFP was inhibited in these homokaryons, which had been preincubated with leptomycin B (Fig. 3 A). However, the nuclear export of the importin-β was completely unaffected by leptomycin B. These results strongly suggest that mouse importin-β is not carried by CRM1 and does not possess a leucine-rich NES such as those in Rev and PKI (protein kinase A inhibitor) (discussed below). We next attempted to determine the region required for the nuclear export of importin-β. Since it was previously found that importin-β contains the NPC-binding domain (amino-terminal region) as well as the importin-α binding domain (carboxyl-terminal region) (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we constructed two deletion mutants containing the NPC-binding region (aa 145–449) and the importin-α binding region (aa 448–876). As expected, the aa 145–449 mutant failed to bind the importin-α (data not shown) and Ran (Fig. 1 B, left), but migrated into the nucleus in vivo and in vitro (summarized in Fig. 1 A), consistent with our previous results (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Further, in the digitonin-permeabilized cells, NPC-targeting of NLS-containing proteins was competitively inhibited by the addition of the aa 145–449 mutant, indicating that the aa 145–449 mutant contains a domain that interacts with the NPC (Fig. 1 B,right). It was found that, similar to the case of wild type (WT) importin-β, the aa 145–449 mutant was exported from the nucleus and reimported into the nuclei (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, it was also shown that the nuclear export of the aa 145–449 mutant is temperature-dependent, WGA-sensitive, and unaffected by leptomycin B treatment, similar to WT importin-β (Figs.1 C, 2 A, 2 C, and 3 B). In contrast, the NPC binding-deficient mutant, aa 448–876, was not exported from the nucleus at all (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the NPC-binding domain of importin-β is involved in not only nuclear import but also the nuclear export of importin-β. Richards et al. (38Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that a leucine-rich NES-mediated nuclear export requires RanGTP but not the GTP hydrolysis of Ran. In order to determine if the hydrolysis of RanGTP is required for the nuclear export of importin-β, we investigated the effect of a Ran mutant, Ran(G19V), which is known to be a GTPase-deficient mutant (39Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous results on the leucine-rich NES-mediated nuclear export (38Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the nuclear export of WT importin-β was not inhibited by co-injection with Ran(G19V)GTP (Fig. 4), indicating that the GTP hydrolysis of Ran is not required for the export of importin-β. Moreover, the nuclear export of the aa 145–449 mutant, which does not bind Ran, was not inhibited by co-injection with Ran(G19V)GTP (Fig. 4). In order to determine whether the nuclear export of importin-β actually requires the GTP-bound form of Ran, we used tsBN2 cells (40Nishimoto T. Eilen E. Basilico C. Cell. 1978; 15: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,41Uchida S. Sekiguchi T. Nishitani H. Miyauchi K. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When tsBN2 cells were incubated for 3 h at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 °C), RCC1 could not be detected immunocytochemically, and the degree of cytoplasmic staining of Ran substantially increased (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (18Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H. Nishimoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24542-24545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Iida H. Pines J. Yasudo H. Shibata Y. Hunter T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We first examined the localization of endogenous importin-β in tsBN2 cells cultured for 24 h at 39.5 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, staining of importin-β in tsBN2 cells cultured for 24 h at 39.5 °C was not substantially different from that in tsBN2 cells cultured at the permissive temperature (33.5 °C), and significant accumulation of importin-β in the nuclei of tsBN2 cells cultured at 39.5 °C was not observed. However, importin-α, which is known to be exported by CAS in a nuclear RanGTP-dependent manner, accumulated at considerably higher levels in the nuclei of the tsBN2 cells cultured for 24 h at 39.5 °C compared with those cultured at 33.5 °C. These results suggest that importin-β, but not importin-α, can be exported in the absence of nuclear RanGTP. To support this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of co-injection of RanGAP1 with importin-β in the nuclei of tsBN2 cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature. As shown in Fig.6, the nuclear export of importin-β was not inhibited by co-injection of RanGAP1, while the export of the leucine-rich NES-containing substrates was strongly inhibited. In addition, the nuclear export of importin-β occurred in tsBN2 cells incubated for 24 h at 39.5 °C followed by treatment of 35.5 μm cycloheximide for 3 h at 39.5 °C to prevent the resynthesis of RCC1 (data not shown). Moreover, it was also found that the nuclear export of the Ran binding-deficient mutant, aa 145–449, was not inhibited under the same assay conditions (Fig. 6). These results indicate that mouse importin-β can be exported from the nucleus through the NPC without the support of RanGTP as well as its GTP hydrolysis in living mammalian cells, while the possibility that importin-β bound to RanGTP is also exported without its GTP hydrolysis cannot be excluded. The actual role of Ran in the export of importin-β is discussed below. The NLS substrate targets to the NPC through nuclear pore-targeting complex formation with the importin-α/β heterodimer and is then translocated through the NPC into the nucleus in an energy-dependent manner. After translocation of the NLS substrate-carrier complex into the nucleus, carrier molecules are required to return to the cytoplasm. As expected, microinjection experiments showed that importin-β was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in living mammalian cells (Fig. 1 C). Nuclear export of importin-β did not occur in chilled cells (Fig. 2 A), which is consistent with a previous report (11Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The nuclear export of importin-β was inhibited by WGA (Fig. 2 C), while the passive diffusion of small molecules was not affected (Fig. 2 B). These results exclude the possibility that the degradation products of GFP fusion proteins passively diffuse out of the injected nucleus. Moreover, although the precise mechanism of the inhibitory effects of WGA remains unclear, it is generally assumed that some glycoproteins of the NPC can function, not only in selective nuclear import but also in the nuclear export of importin-β. Importin-β mediates the targeting of the NLS substrate bound to importin-α by directly binding to both importin-α and components of the NPC. Previously, we showed that importin-β alone is translocated through nuclear pores from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, when it does not carry the NLS substrate-importin-α complex (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This nuclear migration of importin-β depends on the domain of importin-β for binding to components of the NPC and does not require the binding domains for importin-α and GTPase Ran. In this study, it was found that the aa 145–449 mutant containing the region for NPC binding involved in the nuclear import of importin-β also possesses nuclear export activity (Fig. 1 C). In addition, numerous other studies have shown that several importin-β-related proteins are likely to associate with components of the NPC, suggesting that the binding of importin-β family members to components of the NPC is critical in order for the member to function as a nuclear transport factor. These data strongly suggest that the nuclear export of importin-β is promoted by direct association with components of the NPC. Recently, it was reported that the nuclear export of proteins containing a leucine-rich NES is mediated by CRM1 (12Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 13Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E.

Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem.

Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear export of importin-β was insensitive to leptomycin B treatment (Fig.3 B), suggesting that importin-β is not carried back to the cytoplasm by CRM1. Iovine and Wente (11Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) previously showed that Kap95p, which is a S. cerevisiae homologue of importin-β, contains a region similar to a leucine-rich NES in the amino terminus (amino acid residues 55LEGRILAALTL65) and that the NES-like motif-mutated Kap95p abolished the binding activity to glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine. (GLFG) repeat regions of nucleoporins Nup116p and Nup100p. Moreover, they found that the NES-like motif-containing substrate moved to the cytoplasm in a temperature-dependent manner after injection into the nuclei of cultured mammalian cells. From these findings, they proposed a model in which the recycling of Kap95p is mediated by the interaction of an NES-like motif with GLFG repeat regions. In contrast, in this study, we found that the aa 145–449 mutant of mouse importin-β, which lacks the region (52VARVAAGLQI61) corresponding to the NES-like motif of yeast Kap95p, is fully capable of migrating from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the NPC (Fig.1 C). Although we cannot clearly explain this contradiction, the differences may result from the source of importin-β family molecules used in these experiments. A putative vertebrate homologue of yeast Nup116p is human/rat/Xenopus Nup98, which localizes at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (43Powers M.A. Macaulay C. Masiarz F.R. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 44Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). At present, Nup98 is the only identified vertebrate GLFG repeat-containing nucleoporin. It has been reported that importin-β is able to bind to Nup98 in overlay assays (45Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Powers et al. showed that nuclear injection of anti-Xenopus Nup98 antibodies did not inhibit nuclear protein import but did inhibit the nuclear export of RNAs, including small nuclear RNAs, 5 S RNA, large ribosomal RNAs, and mRNA (46Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although it has not been determined whether the nuclear export of importin-β is inhibited by the nuclear injection of anti-Xenopus Nup98 antibodies. Further studies are required to elucidate the function of GLFG repeat-containing nucleoporins in the nuclear export of importin-β. In this study, we found that the nuclear export of importin-β is not inhibited by nuclear injection of Ran(G19V)GTP (Fig. 4), which is consistent with a previous report concerning NES-mediated nuclear export (38Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, it appeared that the recycling of importin-β, but not importin-α, occurred in tsBN2 cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5), in which endogenous mutated RCC1 is inactive and the level of nuclear RanGTP would be expected to be quite low (18Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The export of importin-β was not inhibited by nuclear co-injection of RanGAP1, which lowers the level of free RanGTP and, in turn, elevates that of RanGDP, into the tsBN2 cells at nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 6). In addition, we showed that the aa 145–449 mutant, which lacks the Ran-binding domain, is capable of migrating from nucleus to cytoplasm through the NPC (Figs. 1 C,3 B, and 6). These results suggest that nuclear RanGTP is not essential for the nuclear export of importin-β. In contrast, Izaurralde et al. (26Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the nuclear export of human importin-β was significantly, but not completely, inhibited by the injection of Rna1p, a Saccharomyces pombe homologue of RanGAP1, into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. However, their data showed that a considerable amount of importin-β was exported into the cytoplasm, even when Rna1p was injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei at higher concentration than that which nearly completely inhibited the nuclear export of importin-α. These findings suggest that at least part of importin-β can be exported via a pathway that is unaffected by Rna1p. Alternatively, since we did not examine the export kinetics of importin-β, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease of nuclear RanGTP may affect export efficiency and that the export rate of importin-β may be decreased by nuclear injection of RanGAP1 in mammalian cells as in Xenopus oocytes. It should be noted that the nuclear reimport of WT importin-β was considerably inhibited when Ran(G19V)GTP was co-injected in a nucleus of multinucleated cells, whereas the aa 145–449 mutant lacking the Ran-binding domain was not inhibited (Fig. 4). From these findings, we speculate that the WT importin-β-Ran(G19V)GTP complex formed in the nucleus is exported to the cytoplasm, and the disassembly of the importin-β-RanGTP complex through GTP hydrolysis of Ran is involved in the reimport of WT importin-β. Moreover, these results suggest that WT importin-β, which is complexed with RanGTP in the nucleus, can be exported from the nucleus without GTP hydrolysis of Ran. From these and other findings, we propose that importin-β is recycled from the nucleus in two distinct ways: 1) in the form of a complex with RanGTP and 2) alone in a Ran-independent manner. In either case, the export does not require the GTP hydrolysis of Ran. Since importin-β binds RanGTP with high affinity and nuclear Ran would be expected to be the predominant GTP-bound form, it is plausible that nuclear RanGTP binds importin-β to dissociate the nuclear pore-targeting complex after its translocation through the NPC and that the importin-β-RanGTP complex recycles back to the cytoplasm without hydrolysis of its GTP. However, in our previous study, it was demonstrated that importin-β is translocated alone into the nucleus through the NPC in a Ran-independent manner when it does not carry the importin-α-NLS substrate complex (7Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the NPC-binding domain of importin-β, which had been shown to be involved in nuclear import of importin-β, was also required for the nuclear export. Therefore, we speculate that importin-β traverses the NPC into and out of the nucleus in two ways; “Ran-dependent” and “Ran-independent.” As a result, we assume that importin-β, which is imported independently from the NLS substrates, may be exported without the binding of RanGTP, although the biological significance for this type of shuttling of importin-β is not known at present. Further studies of this Ran-dependent and Ran-independent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of importin-β will provide new insights in our understanding of the directionality for movement and the requirement of Ran and energy in nucleocytoplasmic protein transport.

This reaction is the first committed step of the cytoplasmic biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of uridine 5′-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The final product of this pathway is an activated precursor of numerous macromolecules containing amino sugars, including chitin and mannoproteins in fungi, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides in bacteria, and glycoproteins in mammals. GlcN-6-P synthase belongs to the class II amidotransferase family but is unique among other amidotransferases due to its apparent inability to use exogenous ammonia as a nitrogen donor (1Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is widely distributed in nature, and its activity has been detected in almost every organism and tissue; several genes coding for GlcN-6-P synthase have been cloned and sequenced (for review see Ref. 1Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar). However, only prokaryotic GlcN-6-P synthases have been purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli and from the thermophilic bacteria Thermus thermophilus (3Badet-Denisot M.-A.

On the other hand, there is very little known of the molecular structure of eukaryotic GlcN-6-P synthases, and all the studies performed so far have been done on partially purified preparations. Several lines of evidence indicate that the eukaryotic enzyme could be different from its prokaryotic counterpart. Comparison of the available gene sequences has revealed a relatively large region (about 200 base pairs) that is lacking in the prokaryotic proteins (9Smith R.J. Milewski S. Brown A.J.P. Gooday G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2320-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic but not prokaryotic GlcN-6-P synthases are the subject of feedback inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc (10Kornfeld R. J. Biol.

Fungal GlcN-6-P synthase is a subject of interest as a potential target in antifungal chemotherapy (13.Borowski, E., Abstracts of the 8th International Symposium on Future Trends in Chemotherapy, Tirrenia, Italy, March 28–30, 1988, 158, Litografia Tacchi, Pisa, Italy.Google Scholar). Rationally designed oligopeptides containing an inhibitor of this enzyme showed promising chemotherapeutic effect in the murine model of disseminated candidiasis (14Milewski S. Chmara H.

Moreover, the fungal enzyme is a probable point of regulation of chitin biosynthesis. In the opportunistically pathogenic fungusCandida albicans, activity of this enzyme increases 4–5-fold during yeast-to-mycelia (Y → M) morphological transformation (15Chiew Y.Y. Shepherd M.G.

Barlow A.J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1968; 51: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This transformation is considered to be a virulence factor during pathogenesis of human tissues (17Lo H.-J. Kohler J.R. DiDomenico B. Loebenger D. Cacciapuoti A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The GFA1 gene encoding C. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase has been recently cloned and sequenced (9Smith R.J. Milewski S. Brown A.J.P. Gooday G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2320-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present communication we describe the results of our further studies concerning overexpression of the GFA1 gene in yeast, purification and characterization of properties of the gene product, aimed especially at regulation of its activity during morphological transformation ofC. albicans cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ1991 (MATα pep4-3 prb1 ura3 leu2 trp1) was provided by I. Purvis (Glaxo Group Research, Greenwood, UK). C. albicans ATCC 10261 was a gift from M. Payton (GIMB, Geneva, Switzerland). C. albicans and yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (2% glucose, 2% bacterial peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. C. albicans cells grown overnight in YPD were harvested, washed with saline, and starved overnight in saline at 4 °C. Starved cells were used to inoculate either the YCB/BSA medium containing 1.17% yeast carbon base, 1% glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin or the Lee's medium (18Lee K.L. Buckley H.R. Campbell C.C. Sabouraudia. 1975; 13: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Yeast form cells grew efficiently in both media at pH 4.5, 28 °C, and Y → M transformation was performed at pH 6.5, 37 °C. Efficiency of the morphological transformation was assessed by cell counting in a Burker chamber. E. coli DH5αF′ (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for plasmid selection and amplification. Plasmid YEpGW42 (8.7 kb) carrying the S. cerevisiae GFA1 gene on a 3.5-kbEcoRI fragment inserted into YEp352 (19Watzele G. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8753-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from W. Tanner (Regensburg, Germany). YEpMA91 was a yeast shuttle vector carrying the LEU2 marker and the promoter and terminator fromPKG1 separated by a BglII site (20Kingsman S.M. Cousens D. Stanway C.A. Chambers A. Wilson M. Kingsman A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for the isolation and subcloning of plasmid DNA fragments (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Methods for Southern and Northern analyses were the same as cited previously (9Smith R.J. Milewski S. Brown A.J.P. Gooday G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2320-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was for 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C) followed by 8 min at 72 °C then cooling to 40 °C. The reaction mix used standard concentrations recommended by Perkin-Elmer. The primers were designed to incorporate BamHI sites at either end of the structural gene, while maintaining an optimum environment around the start codon (22Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar): 5′-oligo, 5′-GAG AAA AAT ggA Tcc TAT TAA Aaa ATG TGT GG-3′; 3′-oligo, 5′-CAG ACA ggA TcCATT TTC ATT ACT CAA CAG-3′. The start codon and stop anti-codon are underlined. Mismatches are in lowercase. S. cerevisiae deletion strains YRSu3-21 and YRSu3-31 were propagated in YPD containing d-glucosamine, 5 mg ml−1. The cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (23Lauermann K. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Selection for transformants was for LEU+ on YNB minimal agar plates. YRS-C65 and YRS-C53 transformants were propagated in defined YNB media containing 1% glucose, 0.65% YNB, and appropriate supplements at 50 μg/ml and then transferred to YPD medium. YRSC-65 cells (10 g wet weight) from the overnight culture on YPD were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and washed with cold buffer A (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA). Cell paste was mixed with 20 g of alumina and frozen. The mixture was carefully thawed and cells were disrupted by grinding in a mortar. Buffer B (25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) was added in small portions until the cell paste became sticky, and grinding was continued. Cell debris and alumina were spun down (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). Supernatant was saved, and the solid residue was extracted again with buffer B, followed by centrifugation. Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged (35,000 × g, 4 °C, 45 min). Precipitate was discarded, and supernatant was saved as a crude extract. Solution containing 1% protamine sulfate in buffer B was added dropwise to the crude extract (1 ml per 70 mg of protein present in the crude extract), stirred moderately at 4 °C. The precipitated solid was harvested. Supernatant was discarded, and precipitate was washed with buffer B and then combined with 6 ml of buffer C (0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmFru-6-P). This suspension was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). Precipitate was discarded, and supernatant was saved as a pyrophosphate extract. Pyrophosphate extract containing GlcN-6-P synthase activity was filtered through the 0.22-μm Millipore membrane filter, diluted 1:2 with buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and loaded on Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer D, and elution was performed with a linear 0–0.5m NaCl gradient in buffer D at 1.0 ml min−1. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon 10 device. The concentrated active fraction from Mono Q was loaded on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at the flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Active fractions were pooled. A standard incubation mixture consisted of 10 mm Fru-6-P, 10 mml-glutamine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and appropriately diluted enzyme preparation and inhibitors when necessary. Final concentration of the pure GlcN-6-P synthase was 0.5–1.0 μg ml−1. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and terminated by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. The concentration of GlcN-6-P formed by the enzyme, determined by the modified Elson-Morgan procedure (24Kenig M. Vandamme E. Abraham E.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 94: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), increased linearly for at least 60 min. One unit of specific activity was defined as an amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of GlcN-6-P min−1 mg protein−1. l-Glutamate formed by GlcN-6-P synthase was determined by coupling with glutamate dehydrogenase, essentially as described by Badet et al. (2Badet B. Vermoote P. Haumont P.Y. Lederer F. LeGoffic F. Biochemistry. 1987; 86: 1940-1948Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This method was used to confirm the results obtained from kinetic experiments performed at low concentrations of the substrates. C. albicans cells grown in Lee's medium were harvested and suspended in 8.5-ml portions of 0.1 mimidazole/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m KCl and 0.1m MgCl2, at cell density 1.2–1.6 × 109 cells ml−1. Aliquots (1.5 ml) composed of toluene/ethanol/Triton X-100, 5:20:2, were added to the cell suspensions, and the mixtures were vortexed for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DDT and suspended in the same buffer at 108 cells ml−1. l-Glutamine, 10 mm, and Fru-6-P, 10 mm, and inhibitors when necessary were added, and the suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and GlcN-6-P concentration was assayed in the supernatant, as described above. Incubation mixtures containing 5 μg of GlcN-6-P synthase, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mmEDTA, 15 mm Fru-6-P, and inactivators at various concentrations in a total volume of 1 ml were incubated at 25 °C. To follow an inactivation of the enzyme, 200-μl aliquots were withdrawn from the mixtures, applied at the tops of 1-ml columns packed with Sephadex G-25 (equilibrated previously with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8), and centrifuged (500 × g, 1 min, 4 °C). Under these conditions the unbound inhibitor was separated from the enzyme, and protein was recovered in clean test tubes. Appropriate effluent aliquots were used for the determination of the residual enzyme activity. GlcN-6-P synthase, 5 μg, was incubated with group-specific reagents under following conditions: (a) with NTCB, IAA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and NAI in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA; (b) with DEP in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA; (c) with BD in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5; (d) with CMC in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0; (e) with PLP in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.5, in the dark, followed by 1-h reduction with 20 mm NaBH3CN. All the incubations were run in a total volume of 1 ml, at 25 °C, except that with DEP was run at 4 °C. Aliquots (200 μl) withdrawn from the incubation mixtures at appropriate time intervals were further processed as described above. Chromatofocusing was performed on a Mono P HR 5/5 column. The purified GlcN-6-P synthase (200 μg) was dissolved in 25 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, as a starting buffer, and a pH 6 to 4 gradient was generated during the elution with 20 ml of Polybuffer 74 (diluted 1:10 in water) solution, pH 4. Samples (0.5 ml) were collected, and pH values and the GlcN-6-P synthase activity were measured. GlcN-6-P synthase, 100 μg ml−1, was preincubated for 0–120 min at 25 °C with 10 μm cAMP, 1 mm ATP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase from beef heart (30 units ml−1), and/or protein kinase inhibitor from rabbit muscle (10 μg ml−1), as indicated. Each sample contained 10 mm EDTA and 40 mm NaF. Samples were assayed for GlcN-6-P synthase activity and sensitivity to 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc. GlcN-6-P synthase (10 μg ml−1, 30 pmol) was phosphorylated by incubating with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (5 μg ml−1, 62 pmol), [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 mm, 4 μCi nmol−1), 10 μmcAMP, 10 mm EDTA in a total volume of 800 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C for various times. At time intervals, 2× 50 μl samples of the incubation mixture were collected. One of them was treated with protein kinase inhibitor, 1 μg ml−1, and after appropriate dilution assayed for GlcN-6-P synthase activity. In the second sample, the phosphorylation was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and the mixture was boiled for 3 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and bands corresponding to GlcN-6-P synthase were cut from the gel and counted for radioactivity in Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. Blanks obtained from control mixtures containing all components except protein kinase, processed as described above, were subtracted from the particular values. Gel filtration was performed on Superdex 200 HR 10/30, eluted at 0.5 ml min−1 with 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein elution was followed at 280 nm, and GlcN-6-P synthase activity was measured colorimetrically in 0.5-ml samples. Native PAGE was run at 4–9% acrylamide concentration, and the data were treated as described (25Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Native GlcN-6-P synthase, 0.5 mg ml−1 in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.15m KCl, was treated at 25 °C with 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 8 h. SDS was added to 0.6%, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then submitted to SDS-PAGE analysis run in 3% gel with cross-linked rabbit phosphorylase b oligomers as molecular mass markers. Small quantities of yeast or C. albicans cells were broken by the small scale glass beads procedure (26Schatz G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 56: 40-50Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Phosphoglucose isomerase activity was assayed according to the procedure of Stein (27Stein M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 1: 299-310Google Scholar) and glutaminase activity by the method of Holcenberg (28Holcenberg J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate concentration was assayed as described by Lowry and Passoneau (29Lowry O.H. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, NY1972: 72-73Google Scholar). Discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 5% stacking gel and 7.5% separating gel. Native PAGE was performed as described previously (31Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, NY1992: 143-160Google Scholar). Protein was assayed by the Bradford procedure (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glutamine analogs were synthesized by Dr. R. Andruszkiewicz, Technical University of Gdańsk. [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi nmol−1) was from Amersham, UK. Other reagents were from Sigma. EcoRI fragment of the YEpGW42 plasmid containing the S. cerevisiae GFA1 gene was ligated into theEcoRI site of vector pBR325 (6 kb, Life Technologies, Inc.). The backbone of the deletion casette was obtained by band purification of an 8.5-kb fragment after digestion with XhoI andBglII. A 1.1-kb HindIII fragment encoding a functional URA3 gene was obtained by digestion of pSPUR1, band-purified, and ligated into the polylinker of pGEM-7Zf(+) (3,000 base pairs, Promega). Transformants that gave white colonies on isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside plates were isolated. The 1.1-kb fragment was then excised by digestion with XhoI andBamHI, thus generating URA3 fragment containing ends compatible with the deletion cassette backbone. Ligation yielded plasmid pRS where residues −31 to 971 of GFA1 had been replaced with the URA3 gene. Yeast strain BJ1991 was transformed with the mixture of the restriction fragments excised withSspI, and URA3 colonies were selected. Four were picked and shown to require glucosamine for growth on YPD plates. YRSu3-21 and YRSu-31 were isogenic deletion strains except for the orientation of insertion of the URA3 gene. Northern analysis confirmed that these strains did not produce any mRNA hybridizing to theGFA1 gene (Fig. 1), and no GlcN-6-P synthase activity could be detected. The C. albicans GFA1 gene (9Smith R.J. Milewski S. Brown A.J.P. Gooday G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2320-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers that incorporated BamHI sites 5′ and 3′ to the coding sequence. The PCR 2.1-kb product was digested withBamHI, band-purified, and ligated into the BglII site of pMA91. Restriction mapping was used to determine that obtained plasmids YEpRSC-65 and YEpRSC-53 contained the GFA1 gene in the correct orientation relative to the PGK1 promoter. These plasmids were transformed into strains YRSu3-21 and YRSu3-31. They complemented the glucosamine auxotrophy, restored GlcN-6-P synthase activity, and a GFA1 transcript of the correct size was detected by Northern analysis (Fig. 1). Several isolated YRSC-65 and YRSC-53 transformants when grown in YPD medium reproducibly produced C. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase constituting 5–7% of total cytoplasmic proteins, as revealed by densitometric SDS-PAGE analysis. The C. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase, overproduced by YRSC-65 cells, was purified to at least 97% homogeneity with 52% yield using a four-step procedure involving protamine sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration, as summarized in TableI. Two enzymes that could affect the kinetic measurements, namely phosphoglucose isomerase and glutaminase, were not precipitated with protamine sulfate and therefore absent from the pyrophosphate extract and more purified preparations. Such a purification could be completed in 2 days. Isolation from 10 g of wet weight cells afforded 4.4 mg of the electrophoretically homogenous protein. The enzyme was relatively stable in crude extract, when stored at −20 °C; repeated thawing and freezing did not affect its activity for at least 1 month. More purified preparations were stable at −20 °C for weeks when stored in 50% glycerol. The presence of 1 mm DTT and 10 mm Fru-6-P was essential for the enzyme stability. The pure enzyme exhibited pH optimum 6.8 ± 0.05 in Tris, Bis-Tris, HEPES, Mops, and phosphate buffers.K m for l-Gln was 1.56 mm,K m for Fru-6-P was 1.41 mm, andk cat was 1150 min−1. TheK m values were also determined for the enzyme present in crude extracts prepared from C. albicans ATCC 10261 Y and M cells. The former exhibited K m forl-Gln was 1.52 mm and K m for Fru-6-P was 1.45 mm, whereas the latter had the sameK m for Fru-6-P, but the K m forl-Gln was 0.82 mm, and an inhibition of the enzyme activity by an excess of this substrate was observed (details not shown). Substrate inhibition was not detected for the pure enzyme and for the enzyme present in the crude extract from C. albicans Y cells.Table IPurification of C. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase from YRSC-65 cellsVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurication factormlmgunitsunits mg−1%−foldCrude extract1017540.80.3271001Pyrophosphate extract82934.01.18833.6Mono Q47.421.72.93538.95Superdex 20044.421.24.835214.8 Open table in a new tab Pure GlcN-6-P synthase was chromatofocused using a 6 to 4 pH gradient on MonoP HR 5/5 FPLC column. The enzyme was partially denatured during column development, but an activity profile (not shown) enabled an estimation of an isoelectric point of 4.6 ± 0.05. Molecular weight of theC. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase subunit was determined by SDS-PAGE. From the plot of lg(M r)versus migration distance, M r = 79,500 was obtained, which is in a good agreement with the value 79,482, deduced from the gene sequence. The molecular weight of the native protein was determined by gel filtration and native PAGE run under variety of acrylamide concentrations. The first method gave reproducibly M r = 340,000 and the latterM r = 330,000 (Fig.2). In both methods only single bands were detected. The native enzyme was treated with glutaraldehyde for 8 h. SDS treatment of such a preparation and subsequent separation of its components by SDS-PAGE led to the appearance of bands corresponding toM r = 80,000, 178,000, and 325,000 (not shown). It may be assumed that the bands corresponded to the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms of the enzyme, respectively. No band corresponding to the possible trimeric form was found. Pure native C. albicans GlcN-6-P synthase was incubated with several chemical reagents under conditions ensuring selective modification of particular amino acid residues. Samples drawn from the reaction mixtures at time intervals were subjected to enforced gel filtration, and activity of GlcN-6-P synthase was determined in effluent aliquots. Incubation with Cys-directed NTCB and IAA, Arg-directed BD, His-directed DEP, Lys-directed PLP, Asp/Glu-directed CMC, and Tyr-directed NAI led to a time- and concentration-dependent irreversible modification of the enzyme, whereas Ser-directed phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride had no effect. In each case the inactivation was complete at the appropriate reagent concentration. The pattern of the plots of apparent inactivation velocity constants (k app)versus inactivator concentration derived from these experiments were the straight lines originating at zero point (not shown), thus indicating single-step reactions. Kinetic analysis of the results afforded the apparent second-order rate constantsk 1, summarized in TableII. These values were rather low, except that found for DEP. Reaction orders determined from the plots of lg(k app) = n lg([I]) were found to be in the 0.87–1.18 range. The residues modified by the group-specific reagents were not unequivocally identified, but the protective effect of enzyme"

In this study, we examine the subcellular distribution of granzymes in the presence of perforin and the induction of apoptosis in mouse FDC-P1 myeloid and YAC-1 lymphoma cells that express the proto-oncogenebcl2. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy to visualize and quantitate subcellular transport of fluoresceinated granzyme, we find that granzyme entry into the cytoplasm in the absence of perforin is not impaired in the bcl2-expressing lines. However, perforin-dependent enhancement of granzyme cellular uptake and, importantly, granzyme redistribution to the nucleus were strongly inhibited in the bcl2-expressing lines, concomitant with greatly increased resistance to granzyme/perforin-induced cell death. DNA fragmentation induced by granzyme/perforin was severely reduced in the bcl2-expressing lines, implying that prevention of granzyme nuclear translocation blocks the nuclear events of apoptosis. The kinetics of GrB nuclear uptake and induction of apoptosis were faster than for GrA, whereas YAC-1 cells showed greater resistance to granzyme nuclear uptake and apoptosis than FDC-P1 cells. In all cases, granzyme nuclear accumulation in the presence of perforin correlated precisely with ensuing apoptosis. All results supported the idea that GrA and GrB share a common, specific nuclear targeting pathway that contributes significantly to the nuclear changes of apoptosis.

The induction of target cell apoptosis and accompanying DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation additionally requires the action of other granule components and in particular, serine proteases termed granzymes (2Russell J.H. Immunol. Rev. 1983; 72: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The most abundant granzyme in the mouse is granzyme A (GrA, fragmentin-1), a ∼60-kDa homodimer that, in contrast to the monomeric granzyme B (GrB, fragmentin-2), is able to activate interleukin-1β directly (3Irmler M.

GrA and GrB differ in their substrate specificities; although GrA cleaves at basic amino acid residues, GrB is an aspase, cleaving at aspartic acid residues (6Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M.

Evidence for synergy between perforin and granzymes comes from a variety of biochemical and cellular studies. Noncytotoxic rat basophilic leukemia cells transfected to express perforin with GrA and/or GrB become potent inducers of membrane damage and DNA fragmentation in conjugated target cells (7Shiver J.W.

Purified GrA or GrB in combination with perforin are able to effect both the nuclear and the nonnuclear changes of apoptosis, although GrA/perforin-mediated cell killing exhibits slower kinetics (9Hayes M.P.

GrA/GrB double knock-out mice are completely defective in the induction of the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis, whereas perforin-dependent target cell lysis is unaffected (13Simon M.M. Hausmann M. Tran T. Ebnet K. Tschopp J. ThaHla R. Muellbacher A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because the trypsin-like substrate specificity of GrAs is quite distinct from that of GrB, it must induce apoptosis by cleaving either substrates different from those of GrB or at tryptic sites within the natural substrates of GrB, this presumably being the basis of the documented role of GrA in chromosome degradation during apoptosis (9Hayes M.P.

We have recently shown that GrB can both enter the cell cytoplasm in the absence of perforin and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in target cells in the presence of perforin (15Shi L.

Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), implying that nuclear translocation of granzymes may constitute a means by which the apoptotic signal is communicated to the nucleus; nuclear transport of GrB may bring it into contact with potential substrates such as the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, both of which have been shown to be cleaved not only by caspases such as caspase-3, early in many forms of apoptosis, but also in vitro (18Froelich C.J.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) by GrB. On this basis, it has recently been proposed that GrB may bypass the requirement for active caspases in the presence of viral caspase inhibitors (20Andrade F. Roy S. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our recent work (21Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Jans P. Sutton V.R. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Froelich C.J. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that GrA resembles GrB in terms of nuclear targeting in intact cells in the presence of perforin as well as in in vitro andin vivo nuclear transport assays, this apparently conserved mechanism probably playing a role in contributing to the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis. Many forms of apoptotic cell death can be blocked by the proto-oncogenebcl2 (B cell leukemia gene-2), a member of a family of regulatory proteins involved in either promoting or inhibiting apoptosis. bcl2 expression is required for long term survival of lymphoid cells (22Nakayama K. Nokayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Shinkai Y. Louie M.C. Fields L.E. Lucas P.J. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Loh D.Y.

Although bcl2 inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli including cytotoxic drugs, tumor necrosis factor, and ionizing radiation, it does not confer general resistance to CTL-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells (24Vaux D.L.

We have recently shown that although BCL-2 does not confer resistance to apoptosis induced by allogeneic CTL, natural killer cells, or whole cytolytic granules, it can protect against apoptosis induced by purified perforin and GrB (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we use confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to assess the cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of granzymes in bcl2-expressing mouse myeloid FDC-P1 and YAC-1 lymphoma cells. We show that perforin-dependent redistribution and nuclear uptake of granzymes is strongly inhibited by BCL-2, concomitant with greatly increased resistance to granzyme-perforin-induced apoptosis and induction of DNA fragmentation in particular. The clear implication is that nuclear targeting of granzymes may participate directly in effecting the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis.

We have previously shown that purified GrA and GrB can localize in the nucleus of intact rat hepatoma and FDC-P1 mouse myeloid cells in the presence of sublytic concentrations of purified perforin (16Jans D.A.

Because bcl2expression affords protection against apoptosis in the case of purified GrB and perforin (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to investigate granzyme subcellular transport in bcl2-expressing FDC-P1 and YAC-1 cell lines using FITC-labeled granzymes and CLSM. Untransfected FDC-P1 and YAC-1 cells both showed perforin-dependent nuclear uptake of either GrA or GrB whereby two populations of cells became rapidly evident as observed previously (17Trapani J.A.

Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and those that did not accumulate granzymes and did not undergo apoptosis (“non-apoptotic” cells). Quantitative analysis of the cellular and nuclear uptake of FITC-labeled granzymes in the absence or presence of perforin indicated significant uptake of GrA and GrB into the cytoplasm, but not nuclear accumulation, in both wild type FDC-P1 and YAC-1 cells in the absence of perforin (Figs.2, left panel and not shown). In the presence of perforin, both granzymes were taken up by the cells to a greater extent and accumulated strongly in the nucleus, with maximum levels of accumulation in the nucleus around 2-fold those in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, left panel). Granzyme uptake in the absence of perforin when bcl2 was expressed in the cells appeared not to be significantly different to that in the parental lines (Fig. 2, right panel, and see also Figs.3 and 4,middle panels). However, when thebcl2-transfected cells were additionally exposed to perforin, the rapid redistribution of perforin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the pronounced increase in granzyme uptake into the cell were clearly not evident, maximum levels of nuclear accumulation not exceeding 1.0 (Fig. 2 and see below). A control molecule (a 20-kDa FITC-labeled dextran) did not enter cells in the presence of perforin, indicating that the effect of perforin with respect to granzymes was specific. Measurements of granzyme uptake (with or without perforin) in YAC-1/Ybcl2 cells at 15 and ∼60 min showed a pattern of granzyme subcellular distribution identical to that seen with FDC-P1/FDbcl2 (Figs. 3 and 4; data not shown).Figure 3Kinetics of uptake and nuclear accumulation of granzyme A (A) or B (B) or a 20-kDa dextran by FDC-P1 cells expressing (FDbcl2, right panels) or not expressing (FDC-P1, left panels) bcl2 in the absence or presence of perforin.

As demonstrated previously for GrB (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), BCL-2 almost totally blocked killing in response to both GrB and GrA applied with perforin (Figs. 3 and 4, top panels). Whereas 60–90% of wild type cells underwent apoptosis over the period of study (up to 150 min), bcl2-transfected cells exhibited less than 10% apoptosis (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of nuclear uptake and apoptosis induction by GrA (Figs. 3 A and 4 A,left panels) were slower than for GrB (Figs. 3 Band 4 B, left panels (21Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Jans P. Sutton V.R. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Froelich C.J. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and YAC-1 cells exhibited slower cellular and nuclear uptake of granzymes compared with FDC-P1 cells (compare Figs. 3 A and 4 A and3 B and 4 B). Thus, the onset of apoptosis correlated with the kinetics of granzyme redistribution; the slower nuclear targeting of GrA was reflected in slower apoptosis compared with the same concentrations of GrB, whereas YAC-1 cells showed slower rates of apoptotic death and subcellular redistribution of both granzymes, compared with FDC-P1 cells. To determine whether the nuclear events of granzyme/perforin-induced apoptosis were specifically prevented in bcl2-expressing cells coincident with the inhibition of granzyme nuclear translocation,bcl2-expressing and nonexpressing FDC-P1 and YAC-1 (data not shown) cells were exposed to perforin and GrB, and DNA breakdown during apoptosis was examined by TUNEL (Fig. 5). Neither perforin nor GrB alone induced DNA fragmentation in the cell population above background levels (∼3%) in any of the lines. The combination of both reagents induced a strong response in terms of DNA fragmentation in the FDC-P1 cells (maximally up to 70%) but had no significant effect on bcl2-expressing cells (<10% TUNEL positive cells) (Fig. 5). Comparable results were obtained for the YAC-1 lines (not shown). It was concluded that bcl2expression prevented the nuclear events of apoptosis induced by perforin and GrB, presumably as a consequence of the inhibition of GrB nuclear translocation. We have previously shown that GrB nuclear uptake precedes the onset of apoptotic DNA fragmentation (17Trapani J.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), implying a role of nuclear granzymes in the latter. In this study we establish for the first time that bcl2 expression prevents perforin-dependent nuclear translocation of granzymes in two different cell lines, concomitant with protection against the nuclear changes associated with granzyme/perforin-mediated apoptosis and ultimately cell death. This strongly supports the idea that nuclear translocation of granzymes plays a role in the nuclear events of apoptosis, consistent with the recent demonstration that catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase and NuMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) are both cleaved by GrB in vivo(20Andrade F. Roy S. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) as well as the fact that GrA/GrB knockout mice are completely deficient in the CTL-mediated nuclear but not cytolytic apoptotic response. Because our results here for cellular uptake (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) show that GrA and GrB enter bcl2-expressing cells to an extent comparable with wild type in the absence of perforin and the sensitivity of the bcl2-expressing cells to perforin-mediated membrane damage appears to be normal (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), it can be concluded that BCL-2 action is exerted at or downstream of the point of synergy between perforin and granzymes. BCL-2 presumably targets an essential component/step in the signaling pathway, a likely candidate being caspase activation that we have recently shown to be required for both granzyme nuclear translocation and induction of the nuclear events of apoptosis (39Trapani J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); inhibition of caspase activation would block the downstream events of granzyme nuclear translocation and subsequent nuclear changes of apoptosis (17Trapani J.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), including the cleavage of catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase and NuMA (38Xiao C.-Y. Hübner S. Elliot R.M. Caon A. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TheCaenorhabditis elegans BCL-2 homolog CED-9 has been shown to exert its effect at least in part by blocking activation by CED-4 of CED-3, the homolog of the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) (40Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 41Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nonnuclear events in granzyme/perforin-induced cytolysis, although able to be blocked by BCL-2 (29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), appear to be caspase-independent (39Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Browne K.A. Sutton V.R. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), suggesting that BCL-2 also acts on an as yet uncharacterized caspase-independent pathway that governs nonnuclear apoptotic phenomena; that the nucleus is dispensable for apoptosis has been shown using enucleated cytoplasts (43Nakajima H. Golstein P. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Of significance in the context of this study may be the fact that, apart from being localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, BCL-2 has been shown to be present in the nuclear envelope (44Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 45de Jong D. Prins D.Y. Reed J.C. van Ommen G.B. Kluin P.M.

Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The complete lack of BCL-2 within the plasma membrane is consistent with our observations that both granzyme uptake (this study) and pore formation by perforin (this study and Ref. 29Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar) are unaffected by BCL-2, and its absence from endocytic vesicles argues against the possibility that BCL-2 blocks perforin-induced release of granzymes from encapsulated vesicles to the cytosol (33Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 158: 910-920Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Structural homology between the BCL-2 family member BCL-XL and the membrane translocation domain of some bacterial toxins presumed to form a membrane pore (47Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) implies that BCL-2 may affect the transport of proteins or ions across membranes. That perturbation of ionic concentrations within the nuclear envelope can impair nuclear pore complex function, and hence, nuclear protein import (48Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 49Perez-Terzic C. Pyle J. Jaconi M. Stehno-Bittel L. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) has been reported, meaning that BCL-2 within the nuclear envelope could conceivably perturb nuclear pore complex function, thereby blocking granzyme passage into the nucleus directly. Significantly, BCL-2 antagonizes the transport of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinases into the nucleus as well as that of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria (50Ryan J.J. Prochownik E. Gotllieb C.A. Apel I.J.

This study demonstrates that bcl2 expression blocks perforin-dependent nuclear targeting of GrA and GrB in intact cells and concomitantly confers protection against apoptosis and its nuclear events in particular. The results here, consistent with other studies (9Hayes M.P. Berrebi G.A. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C.

Thus, in all cases, the rate of granzyme nuclear uptake correlated well with the kinetics of the induction of apoptosis, supporting the role of nuclear targeting of granzymes in apoptosis (Refs. 16Jans D.A.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). That perforin-dependent induction of apoptosis by both GrA and GrB is inhibited by bcl2 expression is further evidence that granzymes utilize a common and possibly unique nuclear transport pathway (16Jans D.A.

Comparison of the 19F NMR resonance intensities from the labeled enzyme in the intact cell and in cell-free lysates indicated that the enzyme is motionally restricted in vivo, consistent with its participation in a multienzyme complex. The protein concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is thought to be very high, between 270 and 560 mg/ml depending on the functional state of the organelle (1Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 120-121Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This very high protein concentration has been proposed to restrict the diffusion of enzymes and metabolites and to promote the association of matrix enzymes. This has led to the suggestion that the reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle may occur via channeling of metabolites between enzyme active sites in a multienzyme complex (3Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 4Srere P.A. Biol. Chem. 1993; 374: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Westerhoff H.V. Welch G.R. Curr. Top.

There is a large body of data that supports the idea of a tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolon. Specific associations have been demonstratedin vitro between tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and also between these enzymes and components of the respiratory chain and other proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane (3Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Complexes able to catalyze several consecutive steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle have been isolated following gentle disruption of both liver mitochondria (8Robinson J.B. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Robinson J.B. Inman L. Sumegi B. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1786-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a number of different microorganisms (10Barnes S.J. Weitzman P.D.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Mitchell C.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Coupled reactions within complexes of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes have been shown to have a kinetic advantage when compared with the completely solubilized systems (3Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 9Robinson J.B. Inman L. Sumegi B. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1786-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular modeling studies on a citrate synthase-malate dehydrogenase fusion protein, for which there was experimental evidence of substrate channeling (12Lindbladh C. Rault M. Haggland C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), showed that there could be a very efficient, electrostatically based, channeling mechanism for substrate transfer between the enzymes active sites (13Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12652-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been obtained in vivo for a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme complex. Disruptions of the genes for citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase in yeast resulted in cells that were unable to grow on acetate (14Srere P.A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Sumegi B. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 125-145Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This was despite the fact that there are isozymes in the cytosol which could, in principle, bypass the resulting blocks in the cycle. In the case of citrate synthase, introduction of a structurally similar but catalytically inactive mutant resulted in restoration of tricarboxylic acid cycle function and growth on acetate (15Kispal G. Evans C.T. Malloy C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11204-11210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have been interpreted as indicating the presence of a complex of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in which the enzymes have structural as well as catalytic roles. There is also evidence for substrate channeling in vivo. Analysis of 13C labeling patterns in metabolites derived from tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates indicated channeling of succinate and fumarate in the cycle (16Sumegi B. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9106-9110Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Sumegi B. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12725-12729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Demonstration of these weak enzyme complexes in situ has been difficult, however, because many of them are dissociated during isolation due to dilution effects. There is also no direct evidence for their presence in an intact cell. We show here, using NMR measurements on a minimally derivatized enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, that it exists in a motionally restricted form in the yeast mitochondrial matrix in vivo, consistent with its participation in a multienzyme complex. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ2168 (a, gal2, ura3–52, leu2–3, leu2–112, trp1=, pep4-3, prb1–1122, prc1–407) was used in these studies (18Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth media were obtained from Difco. Oligonucleotide linkers were supplied by New England Biolabs. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein concentrations were determined with a dye binding assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) kit from Bio-Rad, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The coding sequence for yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase 1 (CIT1) (20Suissa M. Sudra K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1781-1984Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was cloned into the Ecl136II site of the plasmid pYES2.0 (Invitrogen Corp.) to generate the plasmid pYESYCS1. This plasmid was linearized by digestion with KpnI, the resultant cohesive termini removed with T4 DNA polymerase and the blunt-ended molecule religated withBamHI linkers. This plasmid was digested withBamHI and the 1.5-kilobase pair fragment containing theCIT1 coding sequence was ligated into the uniqueBglII expression site of the LEU2-expressing plasmid pKV49 (21Cousens D.J. Wilson M.J. Hinchcliffe E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These manipulations generated the plasmid pBF208, which expressed yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase 1 (CIT1, EC 4.1.3.7) under the control of a galactose-inducible version of the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Cells were transformed with the plasmid pBF208 by the method of Hinnen et al. (22Hinnen A. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1929-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). CIT1 was fluorine-labeled by inducing enzyme expression in stationary phase cells in the presence of 5-fluoro-dl-tryptophan (5-FTrp). 1The abbreviations used are: 5-FTrp, 5-fluoro-dl-tryptophan; CIT1, yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase 1; CIT2, yeast peroxisomal citrate synthase 2; CIT3, yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase 3; GFP, green fluorescent protein. The labeling protocol employed was similar to that used previously to label phosphoglycerate kinase (23Brindle K.M. Williams S.-P. Boulton M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 121-124Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 109cells were used to inoculate a 500-ml culture containing 2% glucose, 2% bactopeptone, and 1% yeast extract. This culture was grown for 24 h, by which time the cells were in stationary phase at a density of approximately 2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were washed and resuspended in 500 ml of medium containing 2% galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and a mixture of amino acids lacking tryptophan and leucine. After 2 h, 50 ml of a 0.2% solution of 5-FTryp was added and the culture incubated for a further 24 h prior to cell harvesting. Cells were disrupted by vigorous agitation in extraction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.0). Citrate synthase activity was assayed as described in (24Srere P.A. Brazil H. Gonen L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S129-S134Crossref Google Scholar). Enzyme activities are expressed per milliliter of cell water, assuming that 1.67 g of cells contain 1 ml of cell water (25Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All means are quoted with their S.E. Cells were immobilized and perifused as described previously (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cells (6 g wet weight with 6 ml of 1.8% agarose) were perifused with an oxygenated buffer that had the same composition as that used for protein labeling, except that it was supplemented with 0.002% tryptophan instead of 5-FTrp. Mitochondria were isolated as described in Ref. 27Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4509-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Isolated mitochondria were disrupted by sonication, after the addition of Triton X-100 to 0.01% (v/v), and the debris and unlysed mitochondria removed by centrifugation (10 min, 15,000 ×g). The extract was brought to 85% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 and stirred for 30 min before centrifugation for 30 min at 27,000 × g. The resulting pellet was dissolved in a buffer containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and applied to a column of octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Citrate synthase was eluted from the column with a linear (NH4)2SO4 gradient ranging from 1.7 to 0 m. Fraction purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions that contained essentially pure CIT1 were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell (YM30 membrane) until the enzyme reached a concentration of greater than 1 mg/ml. CIT1 was stored at 4 °C as an (NH4)2SO4 precipitate. For NMR measurements the purified enzyme was desalted by gel filtration, using NAP-5 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), into NMR buffer (50 mm HEPES, 130 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) and then concentrated using Amicon centricon 10 microconcentrators. Samples contained 10% v/v 2H2O for a field frequency lock. pH measurements were not corrected for any deuterium isotope effect. Sucrose was added to give solutions of higher viscosity where required, and the final protein concentration was typically 15–25 mg/ml. NMR experiments were performed at a19F resonance frequency of 376.29 MHz, as described previously (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fluorine-19 chemical shifts are quoted relative top-fluorophenylalanine standards, either a 100 μm internal standard in solutions of the purified enzyme or an external standard contained in a coaxial capillary with cell and lysate preparations. Longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) measurements on the purified protein were performed using an inversion recovery sequence. Peak integrals in these experiments were fit iteratively to a three parameter single exponential function. Viscosity measurements on solutions of the purified enzyme were made on the same samples as used for the 19F NMR experiments. The diffusion coefficient of water in the samples was measured from proton spectra by pulsed-gradient spin echo techniques (28Stejskal E.O. Tanner J.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 288-292Crossref Scopus (6871) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient was taken to be inversely and linearly proportional to the viscosity of the solution (29Cantor C.R. Shimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar, 30Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1982Google Scholar). The NMR visibility of the labeled protein in the cell was assessed by comparing its signal intensity in the cell with that in diluted cell extracts. Extracts were prepared by disrupting 6 g of cells by vigorous agitation with glass beads in chilled extraction buffer. The lysates were then dialyzed against extraction buffer without Triton X-100 and their volumes adjusted to 27 ml, which was the sample volume used in cellular perifusions. Enzyme activity was assayed at this point in order to determine the degree of enzyme extraction. Typically the amount of enzyme in a dialyzed lysate was between 60 and 80% of the amount of enzyme in the original cell preparation. Where we have quoted concentrations of fluorine label in lysates, these have been corrected for loss of enzyme during the extraction procedure. Therefore the enzyme was diluted by a factor of 7.5 or more, depending on the degree of cell extraction, compared with its concentration in the cell. The equations used to calculate the theoreticalT 1 values and line widths for CIT1 have been described previously (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The relaxation times were calculated assuming that the protein tumbles as a sphere and that the label is held rigidly within the molecule. The structure of pig citrate synthase has been used previously to model the structure of CIT1 (13Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12652-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Vélot C. Mixon M.B. Teige M. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14271-14276Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using this approach we calculated the hydrated radius of CIT1 to be 33.3 Å and the rotational correlation time to be 29.5 ns in a solution of aqueous viscosity. A mitochondrial isoform of citrate synthase (CIT1) was selectively fluorine-labeled in vivo by inducing its synthesis, in stationary phase cells, in the presence of 5-FTrp. The addition of labeled or unlabeled tryptophan, following galactose induction of enzyme expression, resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme. The increase was from 163 ± 7 units/ml cell water (n = 9) to 1630 ± 60 units/ml cell water (n = 10) in the presence of 5-FTryp and from 170 ± 10 units/ml cell water (n = 6) to 2000 ± 100 units/ml cell water (n = 3) in the presence of unlabeled tryptophan. In the absence of additional tryptophan there was only an approximately 1.5-fold increase in enzyme activity to 266 ± 15 units/ml cell water (n = 9). In the presence of 5-FTryp the enzyme concentration after induction was 166 ± 6 μm, assuming a specific activity for CIT1 of 100 units/mg and a molecular mass for the dimer of 98 kDa (32McAlister-Henn L. Small W.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 317-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The comparable increase in enzyme activity that occurred following induction of expression in the presence of 5-FTrp or unlabeled tryptophan indicated that the specific activity of the labeled enzyme was not significantly different from that of the unlabeled form. A similar observation has been made previously for the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase labeled with 5-FTrp (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1781-1984Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and CIT3 (33Jia Y.-K. Bécam A.M. Herbert C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) are mitochondrial, whereas CIT2 is peroxisomal (34Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Labeled CIT1 was localized predominantly in the mitochondria as mitochondria prepared from the induced cells contained 91.1 ± 0.6% (n = 6) of the total citrate synthase activity in the cell. The protein labeling procedure had little effect on cell viability. The number of cells that grew on agar plates at the end of the procedure was 81 ± 2% of those that grew prior to the start of the procedure (n = 4). The labeling procedure increases the enzyme concentration by a factor of 10. This level of overexpression of CIT1, however, has been shown to have no significant effect on mitochondrial function (35Lindbladh C. Brodeur R.D. Lilius G. Bülow L. Mosbach K. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11684-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Yeast CIT1 is a homodimer of molecular mass 98 kDa and has six tryptophans per subunit (20Suissa M. Sudra K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1781-1984Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32McAlister-Henn L. Small W.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 317-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four of the six 5-FTrp resonances were resolved in the spectrum of the purified protein (Fig.1). The longitudinal relaxation time constant (T 1) of the well resolved downfield resonance (resonance 1, Fig. 1), at near aqueous viscosity, was 1.1 ± 0.2 s, in agreement with the value expected from theory of 1.0 s. The T 1 of the envelope of resonances (Fig. 1, resonances 2–6) was also near to 1 s, at 1.1 ± 0.1 s. These data indicate that the tryptophans are relatively immobile and have a correlation time similar to that of the whole protein. The location of the tryptophans within the protein structure is consistent with this apparent lack of mobility. Mapping of the CIT1 sequence onto the structure of the bovine heart and chicken heart enzymes and investigation of the solvent accessibility of the tryptophan residues, with the programs MODELLER and NACCESS (36Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS, Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar, 37Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar), indicate that all are buried or constrained within the protein structure. The T 1 of the envelope of resonances increased with solvent viscosity (Fig.2), and this increase showed reasonable agreement with theoretically calculated values (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The line widths also showed good agreement with theory. The line width of resonance 1 (Fig. 1) was measured at 60 Hz in a solution of near-aqueous viscosity, and the calculated value was 52 Hz.Figure 2Dependence of theT 1 values of the 5-fluorotryptophan resonances from CIT1 on the viscosity of the medium. The symbols show experimentally measured T 1 values for the envelope of 5-fluorotryptophan resonances from the labeled enzyme in media of specified viscosity. The T 1 values of the resonances are expected to be linearly dependent upon the viscosity of the medium, and therefore the solid line through these points was obtained by linear regression. The dashed lineshows the expected variation of T 1 with viscosity based upon theory (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Spectra were obtained from cells that had been immobilized in agarose gel threads and maintained in a metabolic steady state, during NMR data acquisition, by perifusion with oxygenated medium (Fig.3). The metabolic status of the cells was confirmed by 31P NMR spectra (38Williams S.-P. Fulton A.M. Brindle K.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) acquired before and after the 19F NMR experiments. There was no significant loss of citrate synthase activity in the cells during this period. The19F NMR data were acquired under fully relaxed conditions, assuming that the T 1 values of the CIT1 resonances were similar to those of the purified enzyme in a solution of near-aqueous viscosity i.e. approximately 1 s. Unresolved 19F resonances were observed in cells that had been induced to express CIT1 in the presence of 5-FTrp (Fig.3 C). However similar resonances were also observed in control cells, which had been transformed with the empty vector, pKV49, and taken through the same protein labeling protocol (Fig.3 A). The intensities of these unresolved resonances in the two sets of cells were similar. The concentration of detectable fluorine in the cells overexpressing citrate synthase was 300 ± 30 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) as compared with 180 ± 20 μm (mean ± S.E.,n = 2) in the control cells. The concentration of detectable fluorine in dialyzed lysates prepared from the control cells, when expressed on a cell water basis, was 285 ± 45 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig.3 B), showing that these resonances were due predominantly to nonspecific incorporation of 5-FTrp into cell proteins and that these proteins were fully visible in the 19F spectra of the cells. However spectra of dialyzed lysates prepared from cells overexpressing CIT1 (Fig. 3 D) were very similar to those obtained from the purified enzyme (Fig. 1), in particular the resolved downfield resonance (resonance 1, Fig. 1), which was never observed in spectra of cells, was clearly visible. Furthermore the concentration of detectable fluorine in these lysates, expressed on a cell water basis, was much higher at 850 ± 110 μm(mean ± S.E., n = 3). Thus the labeled enzyme, which was undetectable in 19F spectra of the cells, was visible in the diluted extracts prepared from these same cells. There is a considerable body of evidence for the organization of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in a multienzyme complex, in which there is channeling of cycle intermediates (reviewed in (3Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar,4Srere P.A. Biol. Chem. 1993; 374: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). The concept of a tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolon, however, has remained controversial as it has been difficult to isolate an intact complex from the cell. The relatively weak interactions between the enzymes, which are favored in the cell by the very high protein concentrations in the mitochondrial matrix (39Aragón J.J. Sols A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Minton A.P. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1090-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), are disrupted by the dilution that occurs during cell extraction. In this study we have investigated the rotational mobility of a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, CIT1, in the matrix of yeast mitochondria in vivo using 19F NMR measurements on a fluorine-labeled enzyme. We have used this technique previously to measure the rotational correlation times of three glycolytic enzymes in yeast. Phosphoglycerate kinase and hexokinase were found to be tumbling in a cytoplasm with a viscosity approximately twice that of water (26Williams S.-P. Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 490-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), in good agreement with fluorescence measurements of cytoplasmic viscosity in mammalian cells (see for example (41Fushimi K. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 42Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar)). Pyruvate kinase, however, yielded no detectable NMR signals in vivo, indicating that there was some degree of motional restriction of this enzyme in the cell. This was thought to be due to binding of the enzyme to other cellular macromolecules. CIT1, like pyruvate kinase, showed no detectable fluorine resonances in the intact cell, although it was readily detectable in diluted cell extracts. The 19F signals that were observed in the cell could be assigned to nonspecific labeling of cell proteins (see Fig.3). There are several possible explanations for this lack of NMR visibility of CIT1 in the cell. NMR and fluorescence measurements have indicated a mitochondrial matrix viscosity of between 25 and 37 times that of water (43Scalettar B.A. Abney J.R. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 44López-Beltrán E.A. Maté M.J. Cerdán S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10648-10653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such a high viscosity would lead to substantial broadening of the19F resonances of labeled CIT1 and an increase in theirT 1 relaxation times, resulting in signal saturation under the NMR acquisition conditions employed. For example at a viscosity of 25 centipoise (centipoise = 10−2poise), the calculated line width of the 19F resonances would be 1200 Hz and the T 1 22 s. With thisT 1 the signals detected in the cell would be substantially saturated, and their intensities would be only 26% of the fully relaxed value. However recent time resolved fluorescence measurements on mitochondrially targeted GFP (45Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R. Li Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) showed the matrix viscosity to be close to that of an aqueous solution. The high apparent viscosity estimated from the earlier fluorescence anisotropy measurements (43Scalettar B.A. Abney J.R. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was shown to be explicable by probe binding. The lack of NMR visibility of labeled CIT1 in vivo could be due to broadening of its resonances by paramagnetic ions present in the mitochondrial matrix. This, however, seems unlikely as the tryptophan residues are at least partially buried within the protein and should thus be inaccessible to paramagnetic ions. Furthermore there is no evidence for paramagnetic ions significantly affecting the relaxation rates of resonances from intramitochondrial metabolites, including the31P resonances of ATP (46Hutson S.M. Berkich D. Williams G.D. LaNoue K.F. Briggs R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47Jeffrey F.M. Storey C.J. Nunnally R.L. Malloy C.R.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the 1H resonance of water (44López-Beltrán E.A. Maté M.J. Cerdán S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10648-10653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation, therefore, for the NMR invisibility of CIT1 is that its 19F resonances are broadened by an increase in its correlation time, due to binding to other matrix proteins. A complex containing five tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes has been isolated (8Robinson J.B. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Robinson J.B. Inman L. Sumegi B. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1786-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Barnes S.J. Weitzman P.D.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Mitchell C.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assuming that there is one molecule of each enzyme in the complex then this would have a molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa. If the complex behaves as a hard sphere and CIT1 has the same correlation time as the whole complex, then the line width of the fluorine resonances of CIT1 would be increased to 210 Hz. Even with this degree of line broadening the protein could still be detectable in the cell. However since we have overexpressed the enzyme by a factor of 10, it is unlikely that much of the labeled enzyme could participate in such a stoichiometric complex. The enzyme has also been shown to bind, with other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, to the mitochondrial membrane (3Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 4Srere P.A. Biol. Chem. 1993; 374: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Srere P.A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Sumegi B. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 125-145Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This would lead to a much larger increase in the enzyme's correlation time and thus the 19F resonance line widths. Under these circumstances the NMR signals would be broadened beyond detection and therefore membrane binding is a much better candidate as an explanation for the invisibility of CIT1. Immobilization of a GFP-tagged matrix enzyme was observed recently by Partikian et al. (45Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R. Li Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). By contrast, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements on free GFP showed that its diffusion was relatively rapid, being only three to four times slower than in water (45Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R. Li Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In order to explain the rapid diffusion of GFP it was proposed that the matrix proteins are organized peripherally in membrane-associated complexes, thus creating a central aqueous region with relatively low protein density and low viscosity. Such a domain would allow the rapid and unrestricted diffusion of solutes. This model is consistent with the data presented here demonstrating immobilization of CIT1 in vivo and with previous studies showing that it binds with other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes to the mitochondrial membrane. We thank Paul Srere for the CIT1 purification protocol and for his encouragement, Balazs Sumegi for the plasmid pYESYCS1+, and Dr. Simon Williams and Dr. William Broadhurst for their assistance during this work.

A., Spier, A. D., Yakel, J. L., Lummis, S. C. R. & Vijverberg, H. P. M. (1998)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 11456–11461). To test the hypothesis that the α4 subunit contributes to the lining of the pore of the resulting 5-HT3R channel, a mutant nicotinic α4 subunit with a reactive cysteine residue engineered into the putative pore region was constructed by substituting the leucine at position 285 (α4-L285C). The sulfhydryl-modifying reagent [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) reduced the acetylcholine-induced current in oocytes expressing this mutant nicotinic α4-L285C subunit along with the nicotinic β2 subunit by ∼60%. When the α4-L285C subunit was co-expressed with the 5-HT3R subunit, both MTSET and silver nitrate (AgNO3), another cysteine-modifying reagent, significantly reduced the serotonin-induced current. No reduction was seen when the 5-HT3R was expressed alone or with the wild-type α4 subunit. These data provide direct molecular evidence that the nicotinic α4 subunit co-assembles with the 5-HT3R subunit and forms an integral part of the ion channel pore. To understand the wide variation of calcium permeability seen in native and recombinant 5-HT3receptor (5-HT3R) channels, we reported previously the novel hypothesis that the serotonin 5-HT3R subunit can co-assemble with the α4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (van Hooft, J.

The 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT3R, 5-HT3 receptor; nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; ACh, acetylcholine; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; MTSET, MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium. is a ligand-gated ion channel activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and belongs to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels; this group includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), γ-aminobutyric acid type A, and glycine receptor channels (2Jackson M.B. Yakel J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 447-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These other ligand-gated ion channels are comprised of structurally diverse subunits and are therefore hetero-oligomeric assemblies of receptor proteins. In this way, the same ligand can mediate a variety of cellular responses depending upon the particular subunit composition. Published results have yielded biophysical and pharmacological properties of 5-HT3Rs that vary greatly. Values for single channel conductances range from 0.36 to 19 picosiemens, and the permeability ratio of calcium to sodium ions has been reported to range from virtually undetectable (pCa/pNa < 0.09) (2Jackson M.B. Yakel J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 447-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to highly calcium-permeable (pCa/pNa = 1.12) (3Yang J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 1177-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). So far, there has only been one 5-HT3R gene cloned, along with one splice variant. Expression of the 5-HT3R in oocytes and mammalian cell lines does not reproduce all of the properties seen in native 5-HT3Rs from either neurons or neuroblastoma cell lines. This suggests that other, as yet unknown, 5-HT3R subunits may exist. Recently van Hooft et al. (1van Hooft J.A. Spier A.D. Yakel J.L. Lummis S.C.R. Vijverberg H.P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that co-expression of the nicotinic α4 subunit with the 5-HT3R subunit in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes produced 5-HT-activated channels with an enhanced permeability to calcium. They also showed that the 5-HT3R and nicotinic α4 subunit co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting an intimate interaction between these two subunits. However, it has not previously been determined whether or not the nicotinic α4 subunit actually formed part of the pore along with the 5-HT3R subunit. In this study, we tested directly whether the nicotinic α4 subunit can form part of the 5-HT3R ion channel pore. To do this we used a mutant form of the nicotinic α4 subunit with a reactive cysteine engineered into the presumed pore region. This mutant nicotinic α4 subunit was co-expressed along with the 5-HT3R in Xenopus oocytes, and we probed for the presence of a cysteine residue in the pore of the channels by covalently modifying it with either a methanethiosulfonate compound or silver nitrate. We report evidence that strongly suggests that the nicotinic α4 subunit forms an integral part of a 5-HT-activated channel. mRNA was transcribed in vitro from plasmids using the mMessage Machine kit (Ambion) under conditions suggested by the manufacturer. The 5-HT3R plasmid was provided by D. Julius (4Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and the rat nACh receptor α4 and β2 plasmids were provided by J. Patrick and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) before mutagenesis. The leucine to cysteine point mutation at position 285 was done with the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuickChange mutation kit. The following oligonucleotide primers (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) were used: AGGTCACACTGTGCATCTCGGTGCTGTGTTCTCTCACCG (sense strand) and CGGTGAGAGAACACAGCACCGAGATGCACAG (antisense strand). All conditions for the mutagenesis were as suggested by the manufacturer. The TM2 regions of the resulting plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. Oocytes were dissected from mature female Xenopus laevis frogs and defolliculated by treatment with collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim, 3 mg/ml) for 2–4 h. The total amount of RNA injected for each subunit was (in ng): 5-HT3R (0.5), α4 (native and mutant) (25), and β2 nACh subunits (25). Experiments were performed 1–4 days after injection. Current responses were obtained by two-electrode voltage clamp recording at a holding potential of −25 mV or −60 mV, using a Geneclamp 500 (Axon Instruments). Electrodes contained 3 m KCl with 0.4m BAPTA and had resistances of <0.5 megaohm. ACh (Sigma) and 5-HT (RBI) were freshly prepared in bath solution from a frozen stock and applied via a synthetic quartz perfusion tube (0.7 mm) operated by a computer-controlled valve. Oocytes were defolliculated in a solution containing (mm) NaCl (85.2), KCl (2Jackson M.B. Yakel J.L. Annu. Rev.

Yu C.R. Qu X. Perin F. Karlin A. Role L. Science. 1996; 380: 347-351Google Scholar) subunit forms an integral part of the pore region of the ion channel when co-expressed with other α and β nicotinic subunits. We mutated the leucine at position 285 of the α4 nicotinic subunit to cysteine (α4-L285C); this position corresponds to the leucine at position 251 of the nicotinic α1 subunit (6Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdecon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We then co-expressed the wild-type or mutant nicotinic α4 subunit along with the wild-type nicotinic β2 subunit and tested whether ACh-activated responses (5 μm) were sensitive to block by the positively charged MTS derivative, MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET). As shown in Fig.1, MTSET (5 mm; applied with 5 μm ACh and washed for 15 min) blocked 18 ± 6% (n = 5 cells) of the response amplitude from oocytes expressing the wild-type nicotinic α4 subunit (Fig. 1, Aand C) and 60 ± 4% (n = 5 cells) of the response amplitude from oocytes expressing the mutant nicotinic α4-L285C subunit (Fig. 1, B and C). The modest block of wild-type α4/β2 by MTSET was comparable with that previously reported by Ramirez-Latorre et al. (12Ramirez-Latorre J. Yu C.R. Qu X. Perin F. Karlin A. Role L.

When the 5-HT3R was expressed either alone or with the wild-type nicotinic α4 subunit, MTSET did not block serotonin-activated responses (percent block was 2.7 ± 3,n = 10 for 5-HT3R, and −5.0 ± 4,n = 3 for wild-type α4/5-HT3R; Fig.2, A and B). However, when the 5-HT3R was co-expressed with the mutant nicotinic α4-L285C subunit, MTSET significantly reduced the serotonin-activated response amplitude by 22 ± 5% (n = 16 cells) (Fig. 2 C). These data are summarized in Fig. 3 and strongly suggest that the nicotinic α4 subunit participates in lining the pore of the ion channel along with the 5-HT3R subunit. Furthermore, these data provide additional evidence that the 5-HT3 and nicotinic α4 receptor subunits co-assemble to form a heteromeric ligand-gated ion channel activated by serotonin.Figure 3Irreversible inhibition of 5-HT3and nicotinic α4/5-HT3 receptors by MTSET and AgNO3. Results are from 5-HT-induced currents from cells expressing the 5-HT3R subunit alone or with the wild-type nicotinic α4 subunit (MTSET only) or the mutant α4-L285C subunits. The concentration of MTSET was 5 mm and the concentration of AgNO3 was 500 nm; both were co-applied with 5-HT. 5-HT was used at a concentration of 10 or 50 μm and the results were pooled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fact that MTSET blocks only 22% of the response amplitude for the 5-HT3/α4-L285C channels whereas it blocks 60% of the α4-L285C/β2 current may be because of several factors. Even though we have injected a 50-fold excess amount of nicotinic α4versus 5-HT3R subunit RNA, it is likely that most of the current activated by serotonin is carried through homo-oligomeric assemblies of the 5-HT3R subunit; these are unaffected by MTSET (see Fig. 2). Previously it was reported that when a 3-fold excess amount of nicotinic α4 versus5-HT3R subunit DNA was injected in Xenopusoocytes, only up to 11% of the functional 5-HT3R channels appeared to contain the nicotinic α4 subunit (1van Hooft J.A. Spier A.D. Yakel J.L. Lummis S.C.R. Vijverberg H.P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar situation exists in the present study where a majority of the functional channels activated by serotonin are homo-oligomeric 5-HT3 receptors. Second, we do not know the precise stoichiometry of the 5-HT3/α4 receptor channels. If a 5-HT3/α4 channel contained only a single nicotinic α4 subunit, whereas two nicotinic α4 subunits are expected when co-expressed with the nicotinic β2 subunit, then the predicted block by MTSET would be smaller. When SCAM was previously used to demonstrate that the nicotinic α5 subunit formed part of the pore along with the nicotinic α4 and β2 subunits, MTSET blocked <35% of the response amplitude when the nicotinic α5-cysteine mutant was co-expressed with both the mutant α4 and β2 subunits (12Ramirez-Latorre J. Yu C.R. Qu X. Perin F. Karlin A. Role L. Science. 1996; 380: 347-351Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the physical dimensions of the pore of the 5-HT3/α4 receptor channels may be quite different from the nicotinic α4/β2 receptor channels. In this case, the accessibility of MTSET to the reactive cysteine may be reduced. To study this possibility we repeated the experiments using silver nitrate (AgNO3). Silver also forms a covalent bond with reactive sulfur groups and has been used with SCAM to study the pore regions of channels where the pore diameter may be too small for large organic cations to enter (9Eagan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We found that the percentage of block using silver nitrate (AgNO3) was not significantly different from MTSET (2.9 ± 4%, n = 5 block for 5-HT3R; and 23 ± 9%, n = 5 for 5-HT3/α4-L285C (Fig. 3)). These data suggest that the accessibility of cysteine-modifying reagents to the pore of the channel is not the limiting factor. Co-assembly of the 5-HT3R subunit and the nicotinic α4 subunit might help to explain some of the diverse functional and pharmacological properties of native 5-HT3Rs that cannot be accounted for by the different 5-HT3R splice variants that have currently been cloned. It is also very likely that other currently unknown 5-HT3R subunits, or non-5-HT3R subunits that interact with the 5-HT3R, may exist. For example, 5-HT3Rs purified from porcine brain appear to contain other non-5-HT3R proteins (14Fletcher S. Lindstom J.M. Ruth M.M. Barnes N.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); these proteins are not nicotinic α1, α3, α4, α5, α7, or β2 subunits (14Fletcher S. Lindstom J.M. Ruth M.M. Barnes N.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the co-assembly of 5-HT3R/nicotinic α4 subunits in vivo has yet to be rigorously proven, we have confirmed that it is possible in Xenopus oocytes. Nayak et al. (15Nayak S.V. Ronde P. Spier A.D. Lummis S.C.R. Nichols R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 1819Google Scholar) have recently reported that the 5-HT3R and nicotinic α4 subunits co-localize on a subset of rat striatal and cerebellar synaptosomes. This is particularly interesting in light of the fact that presynaptic 5-HT3Rs (e.g. those located on isolated nerve terminals) are thought to be significantly more calcium-permeant than somal 5-HT3Rs (16Ronde P. Nichols R.A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Ronde P. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that the nicotinic α4 subunit was reported to enhance the calcium permeability of the 5-HT3R (1van Hooft J.A. Spier A.D. Yakel J.L. Lummis S.C.R. Vijverberg H.P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the nicotinic α4 subunit lines the pore of the channel is consistent with the idea that it could modify the single channel conductance and calcium permeability of the 5-HT3R. This may be a general strategy used in neurons to produce the wide range of properties reported. We thank D. Armstrong and D. Pettit for advice in preparing the manuscript and D. Julius and J.

Whereas the precise function of hTRFP remains to be determined, the hTRFP-containing RNA polymerase II-SRB complex supports basal level transcription and, relative to RNA polymerase II alone, enhances transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 in the presence of cofactor PC4.

This has led to the proposal that the regulation of transcription during growth and differentiation of mammalian cells may involve multiple RNA polymerase II holoenzymes. Apart from the above mentioned proteins, a number of unidentified polypeptides also co-purified with mammalian holoenzymes. Here we describe the purification of a human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme by a combination of conventional chromatographic steps and affinity chromatography with an antibody specific for SRB7. We identified a component of the holoenzyme as a homologue of Drosophila TRF-proximal protein (27Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that TRF proximal protein (hTRFP) may be involved in the regulation of transcription via association with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. We are grateful to our colleagues for discussions and Z. X. Wang for providing anti-RPB6 antibody and core RNA polymerase II. Peptide sequencing was performed by the Protein Sequencing Facility of The Rockefeller University."

Here we show that progesterone activation of the gene is mediated by two clusters of hormone responsive elements located between 2.4 and 2.7 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Between these two clusters, genomic footprinting studies in the intact endometrial epithelium reveal the hormone-inducible occupancy of several cis-acting elements. One of the protected elements shows sequence homology to the consensus binding site of the transcription factor NF-Y, which binds to the element in gel shift experiments. This uteroglobin Y box is essential for enhancer activity in transient transfection experiments with endometrial and non-endometrial cell lines, in accordance with the ubiquitous expression of NF-Y. To understand why binding of this ubiquitous factor to the uteroglobin Y box in endometrium depends on hormone induction, we examined the chromatin structure of the relevant gene region. In the uninduced state, the enhancer region appears to be organized into positioned nucleosomes. Upon hormone induction, this nucleosomal pattern is lost and the enhancer region becomes hypersensitive to nucleases, suggesting that a hormone-induced change in the local chromatin structure unmasks previously unaccessible binding sites for transcription factors. Our results emphasize the limitations of using transient transfection assays for the functional analysis of cis-acting elements and underline the need for including the native chromatin organization in this kind of studies."
