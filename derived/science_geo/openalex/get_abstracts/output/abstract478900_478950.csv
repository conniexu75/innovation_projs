Diet influences the structure and function of the gut microbiota in the long term, but it is not clear how rapidly the microbiota is affected by short-term dietary change. Peter Turnbaugh and colleagues studied the effect of transition to a diet consisting entirely of either animal products or plant products on the composition and function of the human gut microbiota. They find that the community changes rapidly, within a single day, overwhelming the pre-existing inter-individual differences in microbiota composition to recapitulate expected patterns of composition and metabolic function for carnivorous and herbivorous mammals. The animal-based diet was associated with higher levels of bile-tolerant microorganisms, including the bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia, which has previously been linked to inflammatory bowel disease. The authors also detected intact foodborne fungi, bacteria and viruses in the distal gut. Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut1,2,3,4,5, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals2, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease6. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles."

Even within a single tissue, fibroblasts exhibit considerable functional diversity, but it is not known whether this reflects the existence of a differentiation hierarchy or is a response to different environmental factors. Here we show, using transplantation assays and lineage tracing in mice, that the fibroblasts of skin connective tissue arise from two distinct lineages. One forms the upper dermis, including the dermal papilla that regulates hair growth and the arrector pili muscle, which controls piloerection. The other forms the lower dermis, including the reticular fibroblasts that synthesize the bulk of the fibrillar ECM, and the preadipocytes and adipocytes of the hypodermis. The upper lineage is required for hair follicle formation. In wounded adult skin, the initial wave of dermal repair is mediated by the lower lineage and upper dermal fibroblasts are recruited only during re-epithelialization. Epidermal β-catenin activation stimulates the expansion of the upper dermal lineage, rendering wounds permissive for hair follicle formation. Our findings explain why wounding is linked to formation of ECM-rich scar tissue that lacks hair follicles. They also form a platform for discovering fibroblast lineages in other tissues and for examining fibroblast changes in ageing and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003993220,"Understanding how RNA structure influences its function has been hampered by a lack of approaches that can accurately quantify RNA structure in vivo; here, RNA structure is revealed on a global scale and with nucleotide-level resolution, showing that there is less structure within cells than expected from in vitro and in silico analyses. Being single-stranded, RNA can adopt a diversity of secondary structures via inter- and intramolecular base-pairing. Three studies published in this issue of Nature provide an in-depth view of the variety, dynamics and functional influence of RNA structures in vivo. Sarah Assmann and colleagues map the in vivo RNA structure of over 10,000 transcripts in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Their struc-seq (structure-seqence) approach incorporates in vivo chemical (DMS) probing and next-generation sequencing to provide single-nucleotide resolution on a genome-wide scale. Distinct patterns of structure are found to be correlated with coding regions, splice sites and polyadenylation sites. Comparison of these results with those obtained by earlier technologies reveals that, although predictions for some classes of genes were fairly accurate, others, such as those involved in stress response, were poorly predicted and may reflect changes that made them more adapted to that condition. Jonathan Weissman and colleagues have also developed a DMS-seq method to globally monitor RNA structure to single-nucleotide precision in yeast and mammalian cells. Comparing their findings with in vitro data, the authors conclude that there is less structure within cells than expected. Even thermostable RNA structures can be denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Howard Chang and colleagues asked a different question: how does RNA secondary structure change on a transcriptome-wide level in related individuals? By calculating the RNA secondary structures of two parents and their child, they find that about 15% of transcribed single-nucleotide variants affect local secondary structure. These 'RiboSNitches' are depleted in certain locations, suggesting that a particular RNA structure at that site is important. This study illustrates that there is much to be learned about how changes in RNA structure, particularly as imparted by genetic variation, can alter gene expression. RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA’s ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational1,2 and experimental3,4,5,6,7,8 efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo5. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues9, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome10. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo."

It remains unclear how different subpopulations of cancer cells contribute to this process. We developed three-dimensional (3D) organoid assays to identify the most invasive cancer cells in primary breast tumors. Collective invasion was led by specialized cancer cells that were defined by their expression of basal epithelial genes, such as cytokeratin-14 (K14) and p63. Furthermore, K14+ cells led collective invasion in the major human breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, luminal cancer cells were observed to convert phenotypically to invasive leaders following induction of basal epithelial genes. Although only a minority of cells within luminal tumors expressed basal epithelial genes, knockdown of either K14 or p63 was sufficient to block collective invasion. Our data reveal that heterotypic interactions between epithelial subpopulations are critical to collective invasion. We suggest that targeting the basal invasive program could limit metastatic progression. Carcinomas typically invade as a cohesive multicellular unit, a process termed collective invasion.

Our data reveal that heterotypic interactions between epithelial subpopulations are critical to collective invasion. We suggest that targeting the basal invasive program could limit metastatic progression. Invasion is a fundamental step in tumor progression and a driving force for metastasis. Although invasion is commonly conceptualized as a single-cell process, the majority of solid tumors display features of collective invasion in which cells invade cohesively as a multicellular unit (Friedl et al., 2012Friedl P.

A central problem in collective invasion is how a group of adherent epithelial cancer cells acquires motile invasive behavior (Friedl and Gilmour, 2009Friedl P. Gilmour D.

One solution is for cancer cells to rely upon the motility of migratory stromal cells, such as fibroblasts (Gaggioli et al., 2007Gaggioli C. Hooper S. Hidalgo-Carcedo C. Grosse R. Marshall J.F.

However, mammary tumors also contain multiple subpopulations of tumor cells with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Importantly, this cellular heterogeneity is associated with differences in metastatic potential and therapeutic response (Almendro et al., 2013Almendro V. Marusyk A. Polyak K.

The pathogenesis of cancer metastasis: the ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis revisited.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how these subpopulations of cancer cells contribute to collective invasion. Clinically, the transition from in situ to invasive breast cancer correlates with a strong reduction in overall survival, but the molecular basis of this transition has remained elusive (Polyak, 2010Polyak K. Molecular markers for the diagnosis and management of ductal carcinoma in situ.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2010; 2010: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The challenge of transitioning to a motile phenotype is particularly acute in mammary luminal epithelial cells, as these cells are normally connected by extensive intercellular junctions and display less spontaneous motility than myoepithelial cells in real-time analyses (Ewald et al., 2008Ewald A.J. Brenot A. Duong M. Chan B.S. Werb Z. Collective epithelial migration and cell rearrangements drive mammary branching morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 570-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept, luminal breast cancers have a more favorable average prognosis, but 8%–21% of cases eventually metastasize to liver, lung, or brain (Kennecke et al., 2010Kennecke H. Yerushalmi R. Woods R. Cheang M.C. Voduc D. Speers C.H. Nielsen T.O. Gelmon K. Metastatic behavior of breast cancer subtypes.J. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 28: 3271-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Furthermore, luminal breast cancer cell lines are weakly invasive in 2D culture compared to basal subtypes (Neve et al., 2006Neve R.M. Chin K. Fridlyand J. Yeh J. Baehner F.L. Fevr T. Clark L. Bayani N. Coppe J.P. Tong F. et al.A collection of breast cancer cell lines for the study of functionally distinct cancer subtypes.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that breast tumors accomplish collective invasion through cell-cell interactions among functionally distinct epithelial cancer cells within the primary tumor. To test this hypothesis, we developed 3D organoid assays to identify the most invasive cancer cells within a primary tumor in an unbiased fashion. In the present study, we applied these assays to demonstrate that the cells leading collective invasion are molecularly and behaviorally distinct from the bulk tumor cells and display a conserved, basal epithelial gene expression program. We developed a 3D primary culture model (Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2012Nguyen-Ngoc K.V. Cheung K.J. Brenot A. Shamir E.R. Gray R.S. Hines W.C. Yaswen P. Werb Z. Ewald A.J. ECM microenvironment regulates collective migration and local dissemination in normal and malignant mammary epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2595-E2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) that enabled us to observe cell behaviors during collective invasion and to interrogate the molecular phenotype of the most invasive cells (Figure 1A). Briefly, we isolate fresh primary tumors and use a combination of mechanical disruption and enzymatic digestion to generate “tumor organoids.” Tumor organoids are composed of 200–1,000 adherent tumor cells and reflect the cellular heterogeneity present in the primary tumor. To study collective invasion, we cultured tumor organoids in 3D collagen I gels, a model for the microenvironment surrounding invasive breast cancers (Conklin et al., 2011Conklin M.W. Eickhoff J.C.

Biol. 2009; 20: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We first characterized invasion in organoids derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer in which the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat drives expression of the polyoma virus middle T oncogene (MMTV-PyMT) (Guy et al., 1992aGuy C.T. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Induction of mammary tumors by expression of polyomavirus middle T oncogene: a transgenic mouse model for metastatic disease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). MMTV-PyMT mice develop highly invasive mammary tumors that metastasize spontaneously to the lung (Lin et al., 2003Lin E.Y. Jones J.G. Li P. Zhu L. Whitney K.D. Muller W.J. Pollard J.W. Progression to malignancy in the polyoma middle T oncoprotein mouse breast cancer model provides a reliable model for human diseases.Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2113-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). By gene expression profiles, MMTV-PyMT tumors cluster with the aggressive luminal B subtype of human breast cancer (Herschkowitz et al., 2007Herschkowitz J.I. Simin K. Weigman V.J. Mikaelian I. Usary J. Hu Z. Rasmussen K.E. Jones L.P. Assefnia S. Chandrasekharan S. et al.Identification of conserved gene expression features between murine mammary carcinoma models and human breast tumors.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R76Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Tumor organoids isolated from this model progressively extended multicellular strands of cancer cells into the collagen I over 48–72 hr (Figure 1B and Movie S1 available online). Because the cells leading these invasive strands were highly protrusive and migratory, we refer to them as “invasive leader cells” (Figure 1B, right). We were able to determine the molecular phenotype of invasive leader cells unambiguously due to their position at the front of invasive strands and their distinct protrusive morphology. Our analysis defined four molecular features of leader cells in this luminal mouse model. First, leader cells preferentially expressed multiple basal epithelial markers, including cytokeratin-14 (K14), p63, P-cadherin, and cytokeratin-5 (K5) (Figures 1C–1G). Among these markers, K14 was the most frequently associated with leader cells (94% of leaders, n = 1,523 leaders, from 10 mice, CI [93%–95%]). Second, leader cells coexpressed markers of luminal epithelium, including K8, K18, and E-cadherin (Figures 1G and S1A–S1C ). However, whereas basal markers were preferentially expressed in leader cells, K8 and E-cadherin also strongly stained the noninvasive K14− core of cells within the tumor organoid (Figures S1A and S1C). Third, leader cells typically did not express markers of smooth muscle contractility, such as SMA, MYH11, and CNN1 (Figures 1G, and S1D, and S1E) and did not contract in response to the hormone oxytocin, which induces smooth muscle contractility (Figures S1F and S1G). Because the smooth muscle program is a defining feature of myoepithelial cells in the normal mammary gland, we conclude that invasive leader cells are distinct from myoepithelial cells. Fourth, leader cells did not typically express Twist, Slug, or vimentin (Figure S1H), which are common markers of a molecular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, leader cells retained membrane localized E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact with follower cells (Figure S1C, blue arrows). Taken together, our observations reveal that invasive leader cells in this luminal breast cancer model are molecularly distinct from bulk tumor cells and preferentially express K14 and other basal epithelial markers. We next asked whether K14+ cells also led collective invasion in vivo in this luminal model. To address this question, we optically reconstructed large regions of the tumor-stromal border from fixed sections of intact tumors. K14+ cells were concentrated at tumor-stromal borders (n = 9 reconstructed tumors from 8 mice; Figure 2A) and led multicellular invasive strands into the adjacent muscle (Figures 2A and 2B and Movie S2). As in 3D culture, K14+ cells were negative for SMA and coexpressed luminal K8 (Figures 2B and S2A). Thus, K14+ cells lead collective invasion in 3D culture and in vivo.Figure S2K14+ Cells Are Enriched at the Tumor Invasive Border and in Lung Metastases, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Area of tumor invasion into muscle, stained with K14, K8, and phalloidin.

Cell counts were pooled into 50 μm bins. The scale bars represent 20 μm in (A-C) and 500 μm in (F). We next asked what fraction of collective invasion in vivo was led by K14+ cells. We employed an orthotopic transplant model to mark donor-derived tumor cells unambiguously. We transplanted MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor organoids coexpressing a red fluorescent reporter (mTomato) into the cleared mammary fat pads of nonfluorescent congenic hosts (FVB) and identified invasive units at the tumor-stromal border, blind to K14 expression (Figures 2C and 2D). These invasive units included multicellular groups of cells connected to the main tumor mass, which we defined as invasive strands, and groups of cells unconnected from the main tumor mass, which we defined as tumor nests (Figure 2D, middle). We then classified each invasive unit—in the case of strands, we asked whether the leader cells were K14+, and in the case of nests, we asked whether any cell in the group was K14+. By this measure, we observed that 88% of invasive strands and 80% of tumor nests were K14+ (Figure 2D, right). Next, we systematically quantified the distance of K14+ and K14− cells from the tumor-stromal border in large optically reconstructed montages (Figures S2E–S2G). We observed strong enrichment for K14+ cells in the first 100 μm from the stromal border, whereas K14− cells were relatively uniformly distributed (n = 5 montages from 4 tumors; Figure S2H). We conclude that K14+ cancer cells are strongly enriched at the tumor-stromal interface and lead the majority of collective invasion in vivo. Because MMTV-PyMT tumors develop metastases with high penetrance, we next quantified the K14 status of their lung metastases. Although K14 was absent in normal lung parenchyma, we observed K14 staining in >88% of metastatic lesions, from micrometastases up to large, 500 μm lesions (Figures 2E–2H). In contrast, K14+ cells constituted only a small percentage of the total cell population in the primary tumor (1.4% ± 0.2% by fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS], n = 3 mice; Figure S2D). Consistent with their phenotype in the primary tumor, K14+ metastases were negative for SMA in both micrometastatic and large metastatic lesions (Figures S2B and S2C). We conclude that, although K14+ cells are rare in the primary tumors of this luminal breast cancer model, they are strongly enriched in lung metastases. To test the generality of our observations, we next characterized invasion in two additional genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer: MMTV-Neu, a model of HER2+ luminal breast cancer, and C3(1)/Tag, a model of basal breast cancer (Guy et al., 1992bGuy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Expression of the neu protooncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tumor organoids isolated from these models displayed pronounced differences in the morphologic patterns and timing of invasion in 3D culture (Figures 3A and 3B and Movie S3). MMTV-Neu tumor organoids had the fewest leader cells, MMTV-PyMT organoids had an intermediate number, and C3(1)/Tag tumor organoids had the most leader cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Despite these differences in the frequency of invasion, >80% of leader cells in all three models were K14+ (Figure 3E). Similarly, the majority of K14+ leader cells coexpressed luminal K8 but did not express SMA in all three models (Figures 3B, 3E, S3A, and S3B).Figure S3K14+ Invasion in Primary Mouse Mammary Carcinomas and Human Breast Tumors, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Micrograph of a leader cell from a MMTV-Neu tumor organoid stained with K14 and K8.(B) Micrograph of leader cells from a C3(1)/Tag tumor organoid stained with K14 and K8.(C and D) Micrographs of leader cells in primary human breast tumor organoids stained with K14, p63 and DAPI (C), or K14, K18, and K8 (D).

We isolated organoids from primary tumor tissue obtained at initial breast surgery (n = 10; Figure 3F) using established protocols (Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2012Nguyen-Ngoc K.V. Cheung K.J. Brenot A. Shamir E.R. Gray R.S. Hines W.C. Yaswen P. Werb Z. Ewald A.J. ECM microenvironment regulates collective migration and local dissemination in normal and malignant mammary epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2595-E2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We classified each specimen using surrogate immunohistochemistry definitions (Goldhirsch et al., 2013Goldhirsch A. Winer E.P. Coates A.S. Gelber R.D. Piccart-Gebhart M. Thürlimann B. Senn H.J.

Oncol. 2013; 24: 2206-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). In total, there were nine luminal breast cancers, five of which were luminal B. In each case, human tumor organoids invaded into collagen I matrix (Figure 3F and Movie S3). Although the numbers of invasive strands and disseminated cells varied among tumor samples, >86% of leaders expressed K14 across all samples (Figures 3F, 3G, and S3E). K14+ cells typically coexpressed nuclear p63 (Figure S3C) and typically did not express SMA (Figures 3F and S3E). A subset of K14+ cells was also positive for luminal K8 and K18 (Figure S3D). Together, these data demonstrate that the cells that lead invasion in 3D culture express basal epithelial markers across multiple mouse models of breast cancer and in primary human breast tumors. We therefore hypothesized that K14+ cells would lead collective invasion in primary human breast tumors in vivo. We first examined fixed sections from intact tumor specimens corresponding to three cases from 3D culture. We observed that K14+ cells led collective invasion in each case (Figure S3F). We next assayed for K14+ cells in archival specimens of primary breast tumors (n = 39 specimens) from multiple subtypes of human breast cancer. Using consensus guidelines, we then assigned these specimens to breast cancer subtypes based on their ER, PR, HER2/Neu, and Ki-67 status, as assayed by immunohistochemistry (Goldhirsch et al., 2013Goldhirsch A. Winer E.P. Coates A.S. Gelber R.D. Piccart-Gebhart M. Thürlimann B. Senn H.J.

Oncol. 2013; 24: 2206-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). There were 16 luminal A cases, 17 luminal B cases (including 4 cases with HER2+ disease), and 6 triple-negative breast carcinomas (Figure 3I). We stained these samples for K14 using immunohistochemistry and classified their intensity to three levels: low (+), medium (++), and high (+++) (Figure S4A). We observed strong K14 staining (CK3) in collective invasive fronts in luminal A, luminal B (both HER2− and HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancers (Figures 3H, 3J, and S4D–S4G). Breast cancer subtype was not statistically significantly associated with K14 staining intensity (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.11). We also stratified samples by histologic grade (Figure 3K). In general, higher histologic grade was associated with higher K14 staining intensity (Figure 3L, Fisher’s exact test, p < 1 × 10−4). However, even among luminal B tumors with high grade (grade 3), we identified cases with low, medium, and high K14 staining (Figure S4A). We observed three distinct patterns of K14 staining in human tumors: cytoplasmic staining, cytoskeletal staining with intense staining bundles of K14, and a border-enriched pattern, in which staining appeared specific to cells at the border of the collective invasion front (Figure S4B). The triple-negative breast cancers showed a statistically significant increase in cytoskeletal staining pattern relative to luminal tumors (Figure S4C; Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.01). Together, these data demonstrate that K14 is expressed in collective invasion fronts across the major subtypes of human breast cancer. To address how K14+ leaders are generated, we asked when K14 was expressed in 3D culture of MMTV-PyMT tumor organoids. Consistent with the low in vivo frequency of K14+ cells in this luminal mouse model, tumor organoids were initially K8+, with few K14+ cells. During the first 48 hr of culture, the number of K14+ cells and p63+ cells in tumor organoids increased significantly (Figures 4A–4D, S5A, and S5B). This expansion in basal marker positive cells coincided closely in time with the onset of collective invasion (Figures 4E and S5C). K14+ and p63+ cells were most frequently observed on the basal surfaces of tumor organoids in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, tumor organoids start 3D culture primarily luminal in character and subsequently expand a population of cells with basal differentiation markers.Figure S5K14+ Leaders Originate from Luminal Tumor Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) K14 intensity was quantified into 0 (no or few), 1 (intermediate), 2 (bright) K14 signal.

Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms of SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation. We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment. The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the α/β hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception. We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degradation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses."

https://openalex.org/W1978058043,"Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that control plant shoot branching. SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction of DWARF 14 (D14), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling. Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation. Moreover, D53 can interact with transcriptional co-repressors known as TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS. Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14-D3 complex."

To understand the immunological pathways that lead to obesity-associated asthma, we fed mice a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, which resulted in obesity and the development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. This AHR was independent of adaptive immunity, as it occurred in obese Rag1(-/-) mice, which lack B and T cells, and was dependent on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and the NLRP3 inflammasome, as it did not develop in obese Il17a(-/-) or Nlrp3(-/-) mice. AHR was also associated with the expansion of CCR6(+) type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) producing IL-17A (ILC3 cells) in the lung, which could by themselves mediate AHR when adoptively transferred into Rag2(-/-); Il2rg(-/-) mice treated with recombinant IL-1β. Macrophage-derived IL-1β production was induced by HFD and expanded the number of lung ILC3 cells. Blockade of IL-1β with an IL-1 receptor antagonist abolished obesity-induced AHR and reduced the number of ILC3 cells. As we found ILC3-like cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of individuals with asthma, we suggest that obesity-associated asthma is facilitated by inflammation mediated by NLRP3, IL-1β and ILC3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092448486,"Over 30% of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), yet only ∼5-10% will develop clinical disease. Despite considerable effort, researchers understand little about what distinguishes individuals whose infection progresses to active tuberculosis (TB) from those whose infection remains latent for decades. The variable course of disease is recapitulated in cynomolgus macaques infected with Mtb. Active disease occurs in ∼45% of infected macaques and is defined by clinical, microbiologic and immunologic signs, whereas the remaining infected animals are clinically asymptomatic. Here, we use individually marked Mtb isolates and quantitative measures of culturable and cumulative bacterial burden to show that most lung lesions are probably founded by a single bacterium and reach similar maximum burdens. Despite this observation, the fate of individual lesions varies substantially within the same host. Notably, in active disease, the host sterilizes some lesions even while others progress. Our data suggest that lesional heterogeneity arises, in part, through differential killing of bacteria after the onset of adaptive immunity. Thus, individual lesions follow diverse and overlapping trajectories, suggesting that critical responses occur at a lesional level to ultimately determine the clinical outcome of infection. Defining the local factors that dictate outcome will be useful in developing effective interventions to prevent active TB."

Only ∼200–300 nm in diameter and a few micrometres long, they are separated from the cytoplasm by the ciliary neck and basal body. Often called sensory cilia, they are thought to receive chemical and mechanical stimuli and initiate specific cellular signal transduction pathways. When activated by a ligand, hedgehog pathway proteins, such as GLI2 and smoothened (SMO), translocate from the cell into the cilium1,2. Mutations in primary ciliary proteins are associated with severe developmental defects3. The ionic conditions, permeability of the primary cilia membrane, and effectiveness of the diffusion barriers between the cilia and cell body are unknown. Here we show that cilia are a unique calcium compartment regulated by a heteromeric TRP channel, PKD1L1–PKD2L1, in mice and humans. In contrast to the hypothesis that polycystin (PKD) channels initiate changes in ciliary calcium that are conducted into the cytoplasm4, we show that changes in ciliary calcium concentration occur without substantially altering global cytoplasmic calcium. PKD1L1–PKD2L1 acts as a ciliary calcium channel controlling ciliary calcium concentration and thereby modifying SMO-activated GLI2 translocation and GLI1 expression."

For several decades, the trisynaptic circuit entorhinal cortex layer II (ECII)→dentate gyrus→CA3→CA1 and the monosynaptic circuit ECIII→CA1 have been considered the primary substrates of the network responsible for learning and memory. Circuits linked to another hippocampal region, CA2, have only recently come to light. Using highly cell type-specific transgenic mouse lines, optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings, we found that dentate gyrus cells, long believed to not project to CA2, send functional monosynaptic inputs to CA2 pyramidal cells through abundant longitudinal projections. CA2 innervated CA1 to complete an alternate trisynaptic circuit, but, unlike CA3, projected preferentially to the deep, rather than to the superficial, sublayer of CA1. Furthermore, contrary to existing knowledge, ECIII did not project to CA2. Our results allow a deeper understanding of the biology of learning and memory."

The identification of mutations causing Alzheimer's disease in amyloid-β precursor protein, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 led to a better understanding of the pathobiology of the condition. Further mutations are expected to be implicated, but the identification of such variants has been challenging. These authors used exome sequencing to identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on late-onset Alzheimer's disease. They report several coding variants in the gene PLD3, coding for phospholipase D3, that increase disease risk at least twofold. PLD3 may have a role in the processing of amyloid-β and may have potential as a novel therapeutic target. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD)1,2. These common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case–control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer’s disease in seven independent case–control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer’s disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer’s disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-β peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40. Together, our genetic and functional data indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides an example of how densely affected families may help to identify rare variants with large effects on risk for disease or other complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W1977138279,"The evolutionary survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, depends on its ability to invade the host, replicate, and transmit infection. At its initial peripheral infection site in the distal lung airways, M. tuberculosis infects macrophages, which transport it to deeper tissues. How mycobacteria survive in these broadly microbicidal cells is an important question. Here we show in mice and zebrafish that M. tuberculosis, and its close pathogenic relative Mycobacterium marinum, preferentially recruit and infect permissive macrophages while evading microbicidal ones. This immune evasion is accomplished by using cell-surface-associated phthiocerol dimycoceroserate (PDIM) lipids to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of PDIM, these PAMPs signal a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of macrophages that produce microbicidal reactive nitrogen species. Concordantly, the related phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) promote the recruitment of permissive macrophages through a host chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-mediated pathway. Thus, we have identified coordinated roles for PDIM, known to be essential for mycobacterial virulence, and PGL, which (along with CCR2) is known to be associated with human tuberculosis. Our findings also suggest an explanation for the longstanding observation that M. tuberculosis initiates infection in the relatively sterile environment of the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper respiratory tract, where resident microflora and inhaled environmental microbes may continually recruit microbicidal macrophages through TLR-dependent signalling."

They determined that therapeutic modulation of stress granule–associated eIF2α phosphorylation rescues TDP-43 toxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease models in flies and primary mammalian neurons. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules. Unexpectedly, we found that genes that modulate stress granules are strong modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. eIF2α phosphorylation is upregulated by TDP-43 toxicity in flies, and TDP-43 interacts with a central stress granule component, polyA-binding protein (PABP). In human ALS spinal cord neurons, PABP accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis. We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2α phosphorylation in ALS models. Treatment with this inhibitor mitigated TDP-43 toxicity in flies and mammalian neurons. These findings indicate that the dysfunction induced by prolonged stress granule formation might contribute directly to ALS and that compounds that mitigate this process may represent a novel therapeutic approach."

The mutations alter mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has key roles in cell life and death. Physiological Ca2+ signaling regulates aerobic metabolism, whereas pathological Ca2+ overload triggers cell death. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is mediated by the Ca2+ uniporter complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane1,2, which comprises MCU, a Ca2+-selective ion channel, and its regulator, MICU1. Here we report mutations of MICU1 in individuals with a disease phenotype characterized by proximal myopathy, learning difficulties and a progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder. In fibroblasts from subjects with MICU1 mutations, agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at low cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations was increased, and cytosolic Ca2+ signals were reduced. Although resting mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged in MICU1-deficient cells, the mitochondrial network was severely fragmented. Whereas the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy3 and the core myopathies4 involves abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, the phenotype associated with MICU1 deficiency is caused by a primary defect in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling, demonstrating the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in humans."

We used a novel approach to metabolically label chlamydial PG using d-amino acid dipeptide probes and click chemistry. Replicating Chlamydia trachomatis were labelled with these probes throughout their biphasic developmental life cycle, and the results of differential probe incorporation experiments conducted in the presence of ampicillin are consistent with the presence of chlamydial PG-modifying enzymes. These findings culminate 50 years of speculation and debate concerning the chlamydial anomaly and are the strongest evidence so far that chlamydial species possess functional PG."

Housing components of the cell division apparatus between cell divisions, primary cilia also serve as specialized compartments for calcium signalling and hedgehog signalling pathways. Specialized sensory cilia such as retinal photoreceptors and olfactory cilia use diverse ion channels. An ion current has been measured from primary cilia of kidney cells, but the responsible genes have not been identified. The polycystin proteins (PC and PKD), identified in linkage studies of polycystic kidney disease, are candidate channels divided into two structural classes: 11-transmembrane proteins (PKD1, PKD1L1 and PKD1L2) remarkable for a large extracellular amino terminus of putative cell adhesion domains and a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site, and the 6-transmembrane channel proteins (PKD2, PKD2L1 and PKD2L2; TRPPs). Evidence indicates that the PKD1 proteins associate with the PKD2 proteins via coiled-coil domains. Here we use a transgenic mouse in which only cilia express a fluorophore and use it to record directly from primary cilia, and demonstrate that PKD1L1 and PKD2L1 form ion channels at high densities in several cell types. In conjunction with an accompanying manuscript, we show that the PKD1L1-PKD2L1 heteromeric channel establishes the cilia as a unique calcium compartment within cells that modulates established hedgehog pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2080973334,"A three-dimensional global climate model shows that the loss of a planet’s oceans through complete vaporization or evaporative escape to space will occur at considerably higher insolation than previously thought, owing to stabilizing atmospheric effects. The Sun is gradually increasing in brightness on a geological timescale. This could lead eventually to a 'runaway greenhouse' effect on Earth, a state that occurs when a planet absorbs more energy from the Sun than it can radiate back to space. The oceans would evaporate and the climate would warm to Venus-like temperatures. Jérémy Leconte et al. use a three-dimensional climate model to show that the threshold for the initiation of a runaway greenhouse is considerably higher than that previously estimated by simplified one-dimensional models. A crucial factor is cooling caused by changes in atmospheric circulation that more than offset cloud-induced warming. This finding is of importance in relation to extrasolar planets, since it extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars. The increase in solar luminosity over geological timescales should warm the Earth’s climate, increasing water evaporation, which will in turn enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can ‘run away’ until the oceans have completely evaporated1,2,3,4. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause evaporative loss of the oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state occurs5,6. The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing features of the Earth’s climate. Here we use a three-dimensional global climate model to show that the insolation threshold for the runaway greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W m−2, which is significantly higher than previously thought6,7. Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse limit to higher values of insolation than are inferred from one-dimensional models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains sufficiently cold and dry to hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for the possibility of liquid water existing on Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars."

GCs in vivo fired action potentials at low frequency, consistent with sparse coding in the dentate gyrus. GCs were exposed to barrages of fast AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), primarily relayed from the entorhinal cortex, and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), presumably generated by local interneurons. EPSCs exhibited coherence with the field potential predominantly in the theta frequency band, whereas IPSCs showed coherence primarily in the gamma range. Action potentials in GCs were phase locked to network oscillations. Thus, theta-gamma-modulated synaptic currents may provide a framework for sparse temporal coding of information in the dentate gyrus."

However, how C/EBPα accomplishes these effects is unclear. Here we find that in mouse primary B cells transient C/EBPα expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100-fold increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population. During this conversion, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes become markedly upregulated, and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days. C/EBPα acts as a 'path-breaker' as it transiently makes the chromatin of pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. C/EBPα also induces the expression of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated after OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances OSKM-induced B-cell reprogramming. Because the enzyme is also required for efficient C/EBPα-induced immune cell conversion, our data indicate that Tet2 provides a mechanistic link between iPS cell reprogramming and B-cell transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described here should help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2074701664,"Here a genome-wide RNAi library screen is used to identify components of the signalling pathway that allow transformation of Trypanosoma brucei spp., the protozoan parasite responsible for important human and livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, from proliferative slender forms to arrested stumpy forms which are transmitted to the tsetse fly vector. Trypanosoma brucei spp., the protozoan parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis and the livestock disease nagana in sub-Saharan Africa, proliferate as slender forms in the mammalian bloodstream then differentiate into to stumpy forms that are transmitted to the tsetse fly vector. This differentiation is regulated by a quorum-sensing-like process that depends on the 'stumpy induction factor' and a downstream signalling pathway, whose respective identity and competition have proven elusive. Here Keith Matthews and colleagues have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the components of the signalling pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases, phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. The identified molecules could be possible targets for quorum-sensing interference, a strategy with antimicrobial potential against bacterial pathogens. The protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei spp. cause important human and livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. In mammalian blood, two developmental forms of the parasite exist: proliferative ‘slender’ forms and arrested ‘stumpy’ forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring both infection chronicity and disease transmission1. This response is triggered by an elusive ‘stumpy induction factor’ (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway is also uncharacterized. Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling components driving stumpy formation. In separate screens, monomorphic parasites were exposed to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (pCPT-cAMP) or 8-pCPT-2′-O-methyl-5′-AMP to select cells that were unresponsive to these signals and hence remained proliferative. Genome-wide Ion Torrent based RNAi target sequencing identified cohorts of genes implicated in each step of the signalling pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases, phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. Genes at each step were independently validated in cells naturally capable of stumpy formation, confirming their role in density sensing in vivo. The putative RNA-binding protein, RBP7, was required for normal quorum sensing and promoted cell-cycle arrest and transmission competence when overexpressed. This study reveals that quorum sensing signalling in trypanosomes shares similarities to fundamental quiescence pathways in eukaryotic cells, its components providing targets for quorum-sensing interference-based therapeutics."

We found that in perceptual decision making without performance feedback, a decision on an ambiguous stimulus is repeated on the subsequent trial more often than a decision on a salient stimulus. This inertia of decision was not accounted for by biases in motor response, sensory processing, or attention.

Carcinogenesis and neoplastic progression are mediated by the accumulation of somatic mutations. Here we report that the local density of somatic mutations in cancer genomes is highly reduced specifically in accessible regulatory DNA defined by DNase I hypersensitive sites. This reduction is independent of any known factors influencing somatic mutation density and is observed in diverse cancer types, suggesting a general mechanism. By analyzing individual cancer genomes1, we show that the reduced local mutation density within regulatory DNA is linked to intact global genome repair machinery, with nearly complete abrogation of the hypomutation phenomenon in individual cancers that possess mutations in components of the nucleotide excision repair system. Together, our results connect chromatin structure, gene regulation and cancer-associated somatic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2062400835,"Lentiviruses contain accessory genes that have evolved to counteract the effects of host cellular defence proteins that inhibit productive infection. One such restriction factor, SAMHD1, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of myeloid-lineage cells as well as resting CD4(+) T cells by reducing the cellular deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) concentration to a level at which the viral reverse transcriptase cannot function. In other lentiviruses, including HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), SAMHD1 restriction is overcome by the action of viral accessory protein x (Vpx) or the related viral protein r (Vpr) that target and recruit SAMHD1 for proteasomal degradation. The molecular mechanism by which these viral proteins are able to usurp the host cell's ubiquitination machinery to destroy the cell's protection against these viruses has not been defined. Here we present the crystal structure of a ternary complex of Vpx with the human E3 ligase substrate adaptor DCAF1 and the carboxy-terminal region of human SAMHD1. Vpx is made up of a three-helical bundle stabilized by a zinc finger motif, and wraps tightly around the disc-shaped DCAF1 molecule to present a new molecular surface. This adapted surface is then able to recruit SAMHD1 via its C terminus, making it a competent substrate for the E3 ligase to mark for proteasomal degradation. The structure reported here provides a molecular description of how a lentiviral accessory protein is able to subvert the cell's normal protein degradation pathway to inactivate the cellular viral defence system."
https://openalex.org/W1980178343,"The mechanisms by which maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) causes reduced fetal growth are poorly understood. We hypothesized that MNR inhibits placental mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and insulin/IGF-I signaling, down-regulates placental nutrient transporters, and decreases fetal amino acid levels. Pregnant baboons were fed control (ad libitum, n=11) or an MNR diet (70% of controls, n=11) from gestational day (GD) 30. Placenta and umbilical blood were collected at GD 165. Western blot was used to determine the phosphorylation of proteins in the mTOR, insulin/IGF-I, ERK1/2, and GSK-3 signaling pathways in placental homogenates and expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), taurine transporter (TAUT), sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT), and large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT) isoforms in syncytiotrophoblast microvillous membranes (MVMs). MNR reduced fetal weights by 13%, lowered fetal plasma concentrations of essential amino acids, and decreased the phosphorylation of placental S6K, S6 ribosomal protein, 4E-BP1, IRS-1, Akt, ERK-1/2, and GSK-3. MVM protein expression of GLUT-1, TAUT, SNAT-2 and LAT-1/2 was reduced in MNR. This is the first study in primates exploring placental responses to maternal undernutrition. Inhibition of placental mTOR and insulin/IGF-I signaling resulting in down-regulation of placental nutrient transporters may link maternal undernutrition to restricted fetal growth.—Kavitha, J.

https://openalex.org/W2105702352,"Sirtuins have been widely reported to be involved in multiple biological processes; however, their function in oocyte meiosis has not been. Here, by confocal scanning and quantitative analysis, we show that specific depletion of Sirt2 in mouse oocytes results in spindle defects and chromosome disorganization (35.5±8.7 vs. 9.6±3.8% control; P<0.05), with impaired microtubule-kinetochore interaction. Moreover, knockdown and overexpression experiments reveal that Sirt2 modulates the acetylation status of histone H4K16 and α-tubulin in oocytes, which may in part mediate the defective phenotypes described above by influencing microtubule dynamics and kinetochore function. Finally, we find lower Sirt2 protein level in oocytes from aged mice by immunoblotting and that maternal age-associated meiotic defects can be ameliorated through overexpression of Sirt2 (33.2±5.1% old vs.12.7±5.2% old+Sirt2; P<0.05), providing support for the hypothesis that decreased Sirt2 is one of a number of factors contributing to oocyte age-dependent deficits. In summary, our data indicate a role for Sirt2 during oocyte meiosis and uncover a striking beneficial effect of increased Sirt2 expression on aged oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2046201903,"Aggressive cancers and embryonic stem (ES) cells share a common gene expression signature. Identifying the key factors/pathway(s) within this ES signature responsible for the aggressiveness of cancers can lead to a potential cure. In this study, we find that SALL4, a gene involved in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal, is aberrantly expressed in 47.7% of primary human endometrial cancer samples. It is not expressed in normal or hyperplastic endometrial. More importantly, SALL4 expression is positively correlated with worse patient survival and aggressive features such as metastasis in endometrial carcinoma. Further functional studies have shown that loss of SALL4 inhibits endometrial cancer cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, as a result of inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In addition, downregulation of SALL4 significantly impedes the migration and invasion properties of endometrial cancer cells in vitro and their metastatic potential in vivo. Furthermore, manipulation of SALL4 expression can affect drug sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to carboplatin. Moreover, we show that SALL4 specifically binds to the c-Myc promoter region in endometrial cancer cells. While downregulation of SALL4 leads to a decreased expression of c-Myc at both protein and mRNA levels, ectopic SALL4 overexpression causes increased c-Myc protein and mRNA expression, indicating that c-Myc is one of the SALL4 downstream targets in endometrial tumorigenesis. In summary, we are the first to demonstrate that SALL4 has functional role(s) in metastasis and drug resistance in aggressive endometrial cancer. As a consequence of its functional roles in cancer cell and absence in normal tissue, SALL4 is a potential novel therapeutic target for the high-risk endometrial cancer patient population."

https://openalex.org/W1999095237,"This study shows that neuroligin-1, a trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecule for excitatory synapses, is directly phosphorylated by Ca2+/CaM kinase II in a neuronal activity–dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. The authors also show that this post-translational modification of neuroligin-1 regulates excitatory synaptic potentiation. Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that are important for synaptic function through their trans-synaptic interaction with neurexins (NRXNs). The localization and synaptic effects of neuroligin-1 (NL-1, also called NLGN1) are specific to excitatory synapses with the capacity to enhance excitatory synapses dependent on synaptic activity or Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). Here we report that CaMKII robustly phosphorylates the intracellular domain of NL-1. We show that T739 is the dominant CaMKII site on NL-1 and is phosphorylated in response to synaptic activity in cultured rodent neurons and sensory experience in vivo. Furthermore, a phosphodeficient mutant (NL-1 T739A) reduces the basal and activity-driven surface expression of NL-1, leading to a reduction in neuroligin-mediated excitatory synaptic potentiation. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate a direct functional interaction between CaMKII and NL-1, two primary components of excitatory synapses."

We previously reported impaired angiogenesis in implanted tumors in AQP1-deficient mice and reduced migration of AQP1-deficient endothelial cells in vitro. Here, we investigated the consequences of AQP1 deficiency in mice that spontaneously develop well-differentiated, luminal-type breast adenomas with lung metastases [mouse mammary tumor virus-driven polyoma virus middle T oncogene (MMTV-PyVT)]. AQP1+/+ MMTV-PyVT mice developed large breast tumors with total tumor mass 3.5 ± 0.5 g and volume 265 ± 36 mm3 (se, 11 mice) at age 98 d. Tumor mass (1.6±0.2 g) and volume (131±15 mm3, 12 mice) were greatly reduced in AQP1–/– MMTV-PyVT mice (P<0.005). CD31 immunofluorescence showed abnormal microvascular anatomy in tumors of AQP1–/– MMTV-PyVT mice, with reduced vessel density. HIF-1α expression was increased in tumors in AQP1–/– MMTV-PyVT mice. The number of lung metastases (5± 1/mouse) was much lower than in AQP1+/+ MMTV-PyVT mice (31±8/mouse, P<0.005).

https://openalex.org/W1964818845,"In some organs, adult stem cells are uniquely poised to serve as cancer cells of origin. It is unclear, however, whether tumorigenesis is influenced by the activation state of the adult stem cell. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) act as cancer cells of origin for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and undergo defined cycles of quiescence and activation. The data presented here show that HFSCs are unable to initiate tumours during the quiescent phase of the hair cycle, indicating that the mechanisms that keep HFSCs dormant are dominant over the gain of oncogenes (such as Ras) or the loss of tumour suppressors (such as p53). Furthermore, Pten activity is necessary for quiescence-based tumour suppression, as its deletion alleviates tumour suppression without affecting proliferation. These data demonstrate that stem cell quiescence is a form of tumour suppression in HFSCs, and that Pten plays a role in maintaining quiescence in the presence of tumorigenic stimuli. Lowry and colleagues report the potential role of stem cell quiescence as a tumour suppressive mechanism. They show that although hair follicle stem cell activation allows tumour formation in response to oncogenic stimuli, tumours are not initiated during the quiescent phase of the hair cycle. They further find that the presence of Pten is important in maintaining hair follicle stem cell quiescence in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2076168092,"Unlike the tidal (in and out) breathing of mammals, bird lungs have unidirectional airflow patterns; here the savannah monitor lizard is shown to have unidirectional airflow too, with profound implications for the evolution of unidirectional airflow in reptiles, predating the origin of birds. Ventilation in mammals is tidal — breathe in then breathe out. In birds, however, the situation is more complicated. The lungs are just part of an extensive network of air sacs connected in such a way that airflow is unidirectional. It was thought that this arrangement was related to the energetic demands of flight but when similar systems were found in crocodilians and inferred in dinosaurs, it appeared that unidirectional airflow ventilation may have been primitive for archosaurs — the clade that includes birds, crocodiles and dinosaurs. But could the unidirectional airflow system be even more widespread? Lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes and allies) are the sister taxon to archosaurs and now a study of the monitor lizard shows that for this lepidosaur, at least some of its ventilation is tidal. This is an important discovery, but the jury is still out on whether unidirectional airflow is a convergent feature of archosaurs and lepidosaurs, or whether it is a basal character of both groups. If the latter, then unidirectional airflow evolved 100 million years before the first bird flew. The unidirectional airflow patterns in the lungs of birds have long been considered a unique and specialized trait associated with the oxygen demands of flying, their endothermic metabolism1 and unusual pulmonary architecture2,3. However, the discovery of similar flow patterns in the lungs of crocodilians indicates that this character is probably ancestral for all archosaurs—the group that includes extant birds and crocodilians as well as their extinct relatives, such as pterosaurs and dinosaurs4,5,6. Unidirectional flow in birds results from aerodynamic valves, rather than from sphincters or other physical mechanisms7,8, and similar aerodynamic valves seem to be present in crocodilians4,5,6. The anatomical and developmental similarities in the primary and secondary bronchi of birds and crocodilians suggest that these structures and airflow patterns may be homologous4,5,6,9. The origin of this pattern is at least as old as the split between crocodilians and birds, which occurred in the Triassic period10. Alternatively, this pattern of flow may be even older; this hypothesis can be tested by investigating patterns of airflow in members of the outgroup to birds and crocodilians, the Lepidosauromorpha (tuatara, lizards and snakes). Here we demonstrate region-specific unidirectional airflow in the lungs of the savannah monitor lizard (Varanus exanthematicus). The presence of unidirectional flow in the lungs of V. exanthematicus thus gives rise to two possible evolutionary scenarios: either unidirectional airflow evolved independently in archosaurs and monitor lizards, or these flow patterns are homologous in archosaurs and V. exanthematicus, having evolved only once in ancestral diapsids (the clade encompassing snakes, lizards, crocodilians and birds). If unidirectional airflow is plesiomorphic for Diapsida, this respiratory character can be reconstructed for extinct diapsids, and evolved in a small ectothermic tetrapod during the Palaeozoic era at least a hundred million years before the origin of birds."

https://openalex.org/W2077768019,"Chronic inflammation is frequently associated with tumorigenesis in elderly people. By contrast, young people without chronic inflammation often develop tumors considered independent of chronic inflammation but driven instead by mutations. Thus, whether inflammation has a significant role in tumor progression in tumors driven by mutations remains largely unknown. Here we show that TNFα is required for the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma, the most common tumor in children and adolescents. We show that transplantation of AX osteosarcoma cells, which harbor mutations driving c-Myc overexpression and Ink4a-deficiency, in wild-type mice promotes lethal tumorigenesis accompanied by ectopic bone formation and multiple metastases, phenotypes seen in osteosarcoma patients. Such tumorigenesis was completely abrogated in TNFα-deficient mice. AX cells have the capacity to undergo osteoblastic differentiation; however, that activity was significantly inhibited by TNFα treatment, suggesting that TNFα maintains AX cells in an undifferentiated state. TNFα inhibition of AX cell osteoblastic differentiation occurred through ERK activation, and a pharmacological TNFα inhibitor effectively inhibited both AX cell tumorigenesis and increased osteoblastic gene expression and increased survival of tumor-bearing mice. Lethal tumorigenesis of AX cells was also abrogated in IL-1α/IL-1β doubly deficient mice. We found that both TNFα and IL-1 maintained AX cells in an undifferentiated state via ERK activation. Thus, inflammatory cytokines are required to promote tumorigenesis even in mutation-induced tumors, and TNFα/IL-1 and ERK may represent therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2042884097,"Rab GTPases play key roles in the delivery, docking and fusion of intracellular vesicles. However, the mechanism by which spatial and temporal regulation of Rab GTPase activity is controlled is poorly understood. Here we describe a mechanism by which localized calcium release through a vesicular ion channel controls Rab GTPase activity. We show that activation of P2XA, an intracellular ion channel localized to the Dictyostelium discoideum contractile vacuole system, results in calcium efflux required for downregulation of Rab11a activity and efficient vacuole fusion. Vacuole fusion and Rab11a downregulation require the activity of CnrF, an EF-hand-containing Rab GAP found in a complex with Rab11a and P2XA. CnrF Rab GAP activity for Rab11a is enhanced by the presence of calcium and the EF-hand domain. These findings suggest that P2XA activation results in vacuolar calcium release, which triggers activation of CnrF Rab GAP activity and subsequent downregulation of Rab11a to allow vacuole fusion. Rab GTPases are important mediators of vesicle trafficking, but how they are regulated is not clear. Thompson and colleagues find that calcium efflux through the ion channel P2XA in the Dictyostelium discoideum contractile vacuole leads to activation of the Rab GTPase-activating protein CnrF, which in turn inactivates Rab11a to allow vacuole fusion."

Moreover, ectopic expression of wild-type HR, but not JmjC-mutant HR, led to pronounced demethylation of H3K9 in cultured human HeLa cells. We also show that two missense mutations in HR, which we and others described in patients with atrichia with papular lesions, abolished the demethylase activity of HR, demonstrating the role of HR demethylase activity in human disease.

https://openalex.org/W2048010724,"The maintenance of goal-directed behavior relies upon a cascade of covert mental actions including motor imagery and planning. Here we investigated how cues imbued with motivational salience can invigorate motor imagery networks preceding action. We adapted the Pavlovian-to-instrumental (PIT) paradigm to explore this by substituting motor action with motor imagery. Thus, reward was contingent upon a given level of imagery-induced neural activity using real-time fMRI. We found that the concomitant presentation of reward-related cues during motor imagery not only enhanced neural responses in motivational centers (ventral striatum and extended amygdala) but also exerted a motivational effect in the imagery network itself. Moreover, functional connectivity between ventral striatum (but not extended amygdala) and motor cortex was heightened during imagery in the presence of the reward-related cue. The concurrent activation of “value” and “action” networks may illuminate the neural process that links motivational cues to desires and urges to obtain goals."
https://openalex.org/W2076749701,"The β-strands of GFP form a rigid barrel that protects the chromophore from external influence. Herein, we identified specific mutations in β-strand 7 that render the chromophore sensitive to interactions of GFP with another protein domain. In the process of converting the FRET-based protein kinase A (PKA) sensor AKAR2 into a single-wavelength PKA sensor containing a GFP and a quencher, we discovered that the quencher was not required and that the sensor response relied on changes in GFP intrinsic fluorescence. The identified mutations in β-strand 7 render GFP fluorescence intensity and lifetime sensitive to conformational changes of the PKA-sensing domain. In addition, sensors engineered from the GCaMP2 calcium indicator to incorporate a conformation-sensitive GFP (csGFP) exhibited calcium-dependent fluorescence changes. We further demonstrate that single GFP sensors report PKA dynamics in dendritic spines of neurons from brain slices on 2-photon imaging with a high signal-to-baseline ratio and minimal photobleaching. The susceptibility of GFP variants to dynamic interactions with other protein domains provides a new approach to generate single wavelength biosensors for high-resolution imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2159560464,"In both insects and vertebrates, each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses one odorant receptor (OR) from a large genomic repertoire. How a receptor is specified is a tantalizing question addressing fundamental aspects of cell differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that the corepressor Atrophin (Atro) segregates OR gene expression between OSN classes in Drosophila. We show that the knockdown of Atro result in either loss or gain of a broad set of ORs. Each OR phenotypic group correlated with one of two opposing Notch fates, Notch responding, Nba (Non), and nonresponding, Nab (Noff) OSNs. Our data show that Atro segregates ORs expressed in the Nba OSN classes and helps establish the Nab fate during OSN development. Consistent with a role in recruiting histone deacetylates, immunohistochemistry revealed that Atro regulates global histone 3 acetylation (H3ac) in OSNs and requires Hdac3 to segregate OR gene expression. We further found that Nba OSN classes exhibit variable but higher H3ac levels than the Nab OSNs. Together, these data suggest that Atro determines the level of H3ac, which ensures correct OR gene expression within the Nba OSNs. We propose a mechanism by which a single corepressor can specify a large number of neuron classes.—Alkhori, L., Öst, A., Alenius, M.

Control rats consumed adequate iron (45 mg/kg diet) and were not irradiated. Combined treatments increased liver glutathione peroxidase, serum catalase, and colon myeloperoxidase while decreasing total fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. The high-iron diet alone increased leukocyte count. Radiation decreased the T-cell CD4: CD8 ratio. Plasma iron was negatively correlated with cytokine production in activated monocytes. Genes involved in colon microbial signaling, immune response, and injury repair were altered by radiation. Genes involved with injury repair and pathogen recognition changed with dietary iron.
