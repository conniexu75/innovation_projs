https://openalex.org/W1981128382,In all of six phosphate-resistant strains of Musca domestica L. a mutant gene is present which produces an altered ali-esterase. The modified enzymes are no longer irreversibly inhibited by the oxygen analogs of the insecticides to which the strains are resistant but can slowly convert them. In five of the strains the resistance is caused by this gene only.

The action and properties of the corresponding enzyme have been investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2030271335,"ONE of the principle factors to be considered in the preparation of media for the detection of fluorescent pigments by Pseudomonas is the content of available iron. When Totter and Moseley1 tested oxine (8-hydroxyquinoline) in an effort to lower the metal content of media by chelation they failed to demonstrate an increase in pigment formation. Despite this rather unexpected result the following method was evolved which, on testing with a wide range of pseudomonads, proved highly successful in stimulating pigment production from many organisms which were previously considered negative or very weakly positive in this character."

https://openalex.org/W2083843222,Antibiotic-resistant staphylococci of the same bacteriophage type were isolated from the external nares of asymptomatic domestic animals and from human beings during an epidemic of staphylococcal disease in veterinary students. Not all of the infections could be attributed to person-to-person contact; spread could be explained also by transmission of staphylococci from animals.

https://openalex.org/W2043800945,By quantitative techniques it has been shown that the expected tumor frequency after x-irradiation of spores of the fern Pteridium aquilinum can be reduced by the addition of casein hydrolyzate or amino acids to the medium upon which the spores are germinated and grown into either prothalli or tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2065664579,"THE ability of 150 larvæ to emerge as adults under 6 different temperature regimes for 3 inbred lines, their hybrids and the F 2 generation has been studied in Drosophila melanogaster 1. This work revealed that interactions between genotype and environment were smallest in the F 1 generation and largest in the inbred lines. The F 1's therefore show a higher degree of stability or homeostasis than the inbred lines. The F 2 gave a genotype × environment interaction intermediate between the F 1 and the inbred lines, as might intuitively be expected because of segregation in the F 2."

https://openalex.org/W2015470786,"IT was shown by Baisden1 that the addition of traces of bacillary ash to a synthetic medium prepared from chemically pure constituents was a very effective stimulant for the growth of Mycobacteria, and similar results could be obtained with a mixture of fourteen pure inorganic salts. Various other workers have demonstrated the growth-promoting effect of metal ions, especially zinc2–4 and manganese5. A simpler mixture of pure inorganic salts than that used by Baisden has been described recently by Paterson et al. 6. This is as effective an addition to Dorset's7 medium for growing large quantities of human type bacilli for the production of tuberculin as is Baisden's."

https://openalex.org/W2056311705,"A NUMBER of chemical systems have been employed for the measurement of the quantity of ionizing radiation. Among the most sensitive dosimeters are those employing dyes1. One system utilizes the destruction of a dye2,3 and another the production of a coloured dye by transformation of the leuco form4. These systems are not particularly sensitive and, for a 1-mm. thick sample, would require the order of 103–104 roentgens to give a perceptible effect. During the course of our studies on the photochemistry of thiazine dyes in rigid media5 we noticed that leuco forms of these dyes produced photochemically give a red species with ultra-violet light irradiation and a blue colour (normal form of the dye) with ionizing radiation. This latter effect is extremely sensitive, and we have pursued the matter further with the view of developing a sensitive dosimeter for ionizing radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2075685823,"THE recommendations of the International Commission for Radiological Protection, 19551, give in Table C.V. values of the effective half-life for iron-55 and iron-59 of 61 and 27 days respectively. The fact that these values are so similar in spite of the big difference in their physical half-lives (1.06 × 103 and 46 days respectively) results from the use of a biological half-life for iron in the blood and blood-forming organs of 65 days (Table C.IV). This result is probably based on early data obtained with animals (for example, Greenberg and Copp2) and would now appear to be considerably too low for the adult man."
