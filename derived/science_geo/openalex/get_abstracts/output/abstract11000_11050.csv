https://openalex.org/W1528764883,"[35S]Heparin was produced in vitro by incubation of rat peritoneal mast cells with [35S]sulfate and in vivo by injection of [35S]sulfate into rats. The [35S]heparin together with nonlabeled heparin in the mast cells was isolated in native form by mild methods that avoided the use of proteolytic enzymes or high alkali concentrations. The heparin had low anticoagulant activity. Incubations of mast cells with [35S]sulfate for less than several hours in vitro resulted in [35S]heparin of approximately Mr=200,000 to 400,000 based on gel filtration, while longer incubations yielded [35S]heparin of approximately Mr=750,000 that was similar to the nonlabeled heparin in the mast cells. When [3H]serine was included in the in vitro incubations, 3H-labeled material was found to co-chromatograph with the [35S]heparin. None of the heparin could be degraded by any of several proteolytic enzymes, but incubation for 14 h at 25 degrees with 0.5m NaOH degraded all samples to a size of approximately Mr=40,000. One-third of the [3H]serine label continued to co-chromatograph with the [35S]heparin after alkali treatment, while the remaining two-thirds appeared as smaller molecules completely separated from the [35S]heparin. Thus, native heparin of the mast cell may be an unusual proteoglycan that is resistant to proteolytic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1544394834,"When cell cultures were incubated with certain oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol which specifically depress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity (i.e. 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, or 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol), a number of consequences followed the decline in enzyme activity. DNA synthesis, expressed in terms of (methyl-3H)thymidine incorporation/mg of cellular protein, declined progressively after the addition of an inhibitor to L-cell cultures and had essentially ceased by 80 h. A decline in the rate of cell growth, as determined by the measurement of cellular protein, became apparent about 24h after the addition of the inhibitor. These effects of the inhibitory sterols were reversed when mevalonate or cholesterol was added to the medium within 48 h after the addition of the inhibitor. Specific rates of uridine incorporation into RNA and of leucine into protein were not significantly altered during 80 h of incubation with the inhibitor. Sterol synthesis was suppressed; and the concentration of desmosterol in L-cells declined to about one-half of the control level within 36 h. Since phospholipid concentrations were not altered significantly by the treatment, the molar ratio of sterol to phospholipids declined to levels lower than any previously reported for mammalian cells. Changes in the molar ratio of sterol to phospholipids in plasma membranes isolated from L-cells that had been incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol were in agreement with those found in cells under similar conditions. The inhibitory sterols caused a similar but slower decline in the concentrations of unesterified and total cholesterol in fetal mouse liver cell cultures and rat hepatoma cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1571270189,"Synaptic plasma membranes, synaptic junctions, and postsynaptic densities have been isolated from rat brain, the proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the glycoproteins identified. The synaptic junction is composed of a spectrum of polypeptides which range in Mr from 13,000 to 250,000. The overall pattern is similar to synaptic plasma memranes; however, the relative proportions of the polypeptides are distinctive. The postsynaptic density fraction consists primarily of one band with an Mr of 52,000. Polypeptides with an Mr of 55,000, and another five of higher Mr, make up the remaining protein. The polypeptides of the postsynaptic density fraction must be reduced with mercaptoethanol in order to permeate the polyacrylamide gel. Therefore, postsynaptic density proteins are cross-linked by disulfide bonds into supramacromolecular aggregates. Glycoproteins which bind concanavalin A were identified in synaptic junctions by studying the binding of 123I-concanavalin A directly to the polypeptides resolved on the polyacrylamide gels. Only four bands, each with an Mr greater than 95,000, bind concanavalin A. In contrast, the pattern of concanavalin A-binding polypeptides in synaptic plasma membranes is distinctive and more complex. In the postsynaptic density fraction, most of the concanavalin A binding occurs to a glyco-component which migrates at the dye front. These data, together with previous cytochemical data using concanavalin A-ferritin conjugates, indicate a limited and select group of high Mr concanavalin A glycoproteins resides within the synaptic cleft of asymmetric type synapses. Whereas a select group of polypeptides bind concanavalin A, all polypeptides resolved in the synaptic junction fraction are glycoproteins and contain galactosyl or galactosyl-like residues, since they label with tritiated borohydride following galactose oxidase treatment. This suggests that the carbohydrate composition of individual glycoproteins is different."
https://openalex.org/W1521042272,"The frog erythrocyte membrane provides an excellent model system for the study of beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase interactions since it possesses an adenylate cyclase enzyme which is very responsive to catecholamines. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate directly whether the functions of receptor binding and adenylate cyclase activity are carried out by a single macromolecule or separable molecular entities. Obtaining this information is a first step in understanding at a molecular level how receptor binding is coupled to enzyme activation. Binding and cyclase activities were solubilized from the frog erythrocyte membrane with digitonin and were observed to partition independently during gel exclusion chromatography in the presence of solubilizing detergent. This finding documents that the beta-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase enzyme are, in fact, separable macromolecules. Under the particular experimental conditions employed, the elution of beta-adrenergic receptor binding on Sepharose 6B was not altered by the absence or presence of beta-adrenergic agonist or antagonist ligands or by exposure of the membranes prior to solubulization to the guanyl nucleotide analog, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1543263247,"Trypsin was found to selectively destroy the high molecular weight (HMW) proteins associated with microtubules. Both major groups of high molecular weight bands observed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were destroyed at the same rate (t 1/2 = 1 min), while tubulin was little affected under the conditions employed. Destruction of the high molecular weight bands was correlated with the disappearance of the lateral projections observed on the surface of microtubules. The trypsin-treated protein was capable of reassembly to form microtubules and showed characteristic ring-shaped structures at low temperature. Analysis of fragments formed from the high molecular weight proteins indicated the initial appearance of a fragment of M = 255,000 which failed to bind to microtubules. These results suggest that a small fragment of the high molecular weight protein molecule may remain bound to the microtubule after removal of the lateral projection, and that this fragment may retain the ability to promote microtubule assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1494222284,"The findings (a) stereospecific counter transport; (b) equilibrium uptake of L-proline decreased with increasing medium osmolarity; and (c) L-proline and Na+ were taken up into identical intravesicular spaces, indicate that uptake of L-proline by rabbit renal brush border membranes represents transport into membrane vesicles, not surface binding to the membrane. An Na+ gradient between extravesicular and intravesicular media stimulated the initial rate of L-proline uptake about 10 times. Accumulation of the imino acid was maximal at 2 min, then decreased until the equilibrium level was attained. At the peak of this overshoot uptake of L-proline was 3-fold greater than the final equilibrium value. These results suggest that the electrochemical Na+ gradient drives the transient movement of L-proline into the membrane vesicles against its concentration gradient. Stimulation of L-proline uptake was specific for Na+. Increasing the Na+ gradient lowered the apparent Km for L-proline. Efflux of L-proline from the membrane vesicles, like uptake, showed stimulatory effects when the Na+ gradient and L-proline were on the same side, and inhibitory effects when the Na+ gradient and the imino acid were on opposite sides of the membrane. Uptake of L-proline, at a given concentration, reflected the sum of contributions from Na+ gradient-dependent and -independent transport systems. The dependent system was saturated at 4 mM L-proline. The independent system did not saturate but may represent the sum of passive diffusion and a carrier-mediated system. At physiological concentrations the rate of the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake was 5 times that in the absence of the gradient. In K+-loaded vesicles, valinomycin, but not nigericin, enhanced the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of L-proline. Gramicidin diminished uptake. These findings indicate that the Na+ gradient-dependent transport of L-proline is an electrogenic process and suggest that the membrane potential is a determinant of L-proline transport. The Na+ gradient-dependent rate of L-proline uptake was strongly inhibited by other imino acids, suggesting that L-imino acids have a common transport system. Glycine and neutral amino acids inhibited the rate of L-proline uptake moderately, acidic amino acid and D-glucose were very weak inhibitors, and basic amino acids were without effect. In the absence of Na+, the rate of L-proline uptake was independent of the presence of other amino acids. These findings indicate that the brush border membrane is a site of amino acid recognition during vectorial transepithelial transport. It is proposed that imino and neutral amino acids inhibit transport of L-proline by competitive interaction with the L-proline carriers in addition to competition for the electrochemical Na+ gradient or membrane potential. The findings are relevant to the understanding of genetic amino acid transport disorders, such as iminoglycinuria."
https://openalex.org/W1543394624,"The transport of L-alanine was studied using membrane vesicles derived from the brush borders of the rabbit renal proximal tubule. Preincubation of the renal membranes with L-alanine, but not D-alanine, accelerated exchange diffusion of L-alanine, i.e. stereospecific counter transport. The equilibrium uptake of L-alanine decreased with increasing medium osmolarity. Extrapolation to infinite medium osmolarity, i.e. zero intravesicular space, indicates no uptake. These findings demonstrate that the uptake of L-alanine represents transport into membrane vesicles and not surface binding to the membrane. The presence of a Na+ gradient between the external incubation medium and the intravesicular medium stimulated L-alanine uptake. Accumulation of the amino acid in the vesicles was maximal at 5 min and then decreased, indicating efflux. The final level of uptake in the presence of the Na+ gradient was identical with that obtained in the absence of the gradient, suggesting that equilibrium was established. At the peak of the overshoot the uptake of L-alanine was slmost twice the final equilibrium value. These results suggest that the imposition of a large extravesicular to intravesicular gradient of Na+ effects the transient movement of L-alanine into renal brush border membrane vesicles against its concentration gradient. Stimulation of L-alanine uptake was specific for Na+. When the intravesicular medium contained no Na+, the rate of uptake enhanced with increases in the concentration of Na+ in the external medium. Increasing the Na+ gradient lowered the apparent Km for L-alanine. In the absence of the Na+ gradient, the rates of uptake of L- and D-alanine were identical. In the presence of the Na+ gradient, the rate of D-alanine uptake was stimulated, but significantly less than that of L-alanine. The uptake of L-alanine, at a given concentration of amino acid reflected the sum of the contributions from Na+ gradient-dependent and -independent transport systems. The dependent system was saturated at about 2 mM L-alanine. The independent system exhibited minimal saturability and may itself represent the sum of passive diffusion and a carrier-mediated system. At physiological concentrations of L-alanine, the rate of the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake was 5-fold that in the absence of the gradient. Valinomycin enhanced the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of L-alanine, provided a K+ gradient (vesicle greater than medium) was present. This finding indicates that the Na+ gradient-dependent transport of L-alanine into renal brush border membrane vesicles is an electrogenic process and suggests that the membrane potential is a determinant of L-alanine transport. In the presence of a Na+ gradient, the uptake of L-alanine was strongly inhibited by other neutral L-amino-acids. Imino acids and glycine also inhibited, but acidic and basic amino acids were without effect. In the absence of a Na+ gradient, little selective competition was found..."
https://openalex.org/W1593206491,"A microsomal enzyme system from rat liver was shown to catalyze desaturation, in presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides and oxygen, of 1-acyl-2-[14C]eicosatrienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine to 1-acyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerophosphorylcholine. This desaturation was linear with time and proportional to microsomal protein concentration, and proceeded with no significant breakdown of the lecithin substrate. The microsomal enzyme system will also desaturate 1,2-di-[14C]eicosatrienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine and [14C]eicosatrienoyl-CoA, but not free [1-14C]eicosatrienoic acid in the absence of ATP, Mg2+, and CoA. Desaturation of 1-acyl-2-[14C]eicosatrienoyl-glycerophosphorylcholine as well as [14C]eicosatrienoyl-CoA was dependent on oxygen and either NADH or NADPH, and was inhibited by cyanide but not by carbon monoxide, indicating the involvement of cytochrome b5 and not P450. The activity of both eicosatrienoyl-glycerophosphorylcholine desaturase and the eicosatrienoyl-CoA desaturase was increased in rats that had been starved for 48 h and refed a fat-free diet. These data indicate the existence of a new route to synthesis of arachidonate, namely, by desaturation of eicosatrienoyl lecithin to arachidonoyl lecithin."
https://openalex.org/W1513507222,"Equilibrium constants for dimer-tetramer association of oxygenated human hemoglobin have been determined as a function of temperature, by analytical molecular sieve chromatography, yielding a van't Hoff enthalpy of 3.8 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol, and a unitary entropy of 48.4 +/- 5.7 e.u. Under the same conditions (0.1 M Tris/HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) the equilibrium constants for dimer-tetramer association of unliganded hemoglobin have been determined as a function of temperature from kinetic studies of the forward and reverse rate constants. The derived enthalpy and unitary entropy for association of unliganded hemoglobin are 0deltaH2 = 28.9 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol and 0deltaS2 = -41.8 +/- 1.7 e.u., respectively. Thus the oxygenation-linked enthalpy of subunit association is 32.7 +/- 1.7 kcal. The corresponding entropic coupling is 90.2 +/- 5.9 e.u. The thermodynamic parameters are consistent with an increased role of hydrophobic interactions within the dimer-dimer contact region upon oxygenation, or a decreased role of hydrogen bonds and ion pair interactions. The opposite signs for association entropies in unliganded and oxygenated states suggest the existence of two distinct subunit interaction processes during the course of oxygenation with a reversal in sign at some particular binding step. The results provide a necessary basis for interpretation of calorimetric results on reconstitution of hemoglobin, described in an accompanying paper."

https://openalex.org/W1553000235,"Abstract The homogeneous self-association of isolated alphaSH chains and betaSH chains from human hemoglobin has been studied by analytical molecular sieve chromatography over the concentration range 0.004 to 15.2 mg/ml. Detailed studies were carried out as a function of temperature at pH 7.4 in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA in order to establish stoichiometries, equilibrium constants, and enthalpies for the self-association reactions. The dissociation data best describe the alphaSH system as being a monomer-dimer equilibrium (2alpha1 in equilibrium alpha2). Under the same conditions the betaSH system is best described by a monomer-tetramer equilibrium (4beta1 in equilibrium beta4). van't Hoff enthalpies were determined from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants. For the 2alpha in equilibrium alpha2 reaction the molar enthalpy delta H = 4.3 +/- 0.5 kcal, and for the reaction 4beta1 in equilibrium beta4, deltaH = 23.5 +/- 1.0 kcal. Unitary entropies were determined to be: deltaSu = 40.6 e.u., deltaSu = 177.5 e.u., respectively. Thermodynamic parameters for association of the two types of chains are roughly comparable in magnitude if four bonding interactions are assumed in the beta4 tetramer. Both reactions are entropy-driven, and the overall results (including salt effects) are consistent with a dominant role of hydrophobic interactions. Increasing the NaCl concentration to 2 M at 21.5 degrees under the same buffer conditions increases the association constant for both the alphaSH and betatsh chains. This increase in the association constants with increasing salt concentration is attributable to the increased binding of salt, or the release of bound water upon formation of the association complexes, or both. The present results do not distinguish between these possibilities. The introduction of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) was found to have no effect upon subunit association in betaSH chains. This result and the previously observed effect of IHP upon oxygenation of beta chains imply that oxygenation and self-association are completely unlinked in this system. Accurate determinations of (a) the enthalpy changes for homogeneous reactions of isolated chains, carried out in this study and of (b) the enthalpy of forming alpha2beta2 tetramers from alphabeta dimers provide a basis for the interpretation of (c) calorimetric studies on reconstitution of hemoglobin from the isolated chains, described in accompanying papers."
https://openalex.org/W1518125377,"Incubation of leukocytes in buffer alone devoid of lipoproteins does not lead to the induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, but incubation of these cells in lipid-depleted serum, abetaliprproteinemic serum, or lipoprotein-deficient serum (d greater than 1.21) leads to sterol loss from the cells and the activation of sterol synthesis from acetate. The latter was shown previously to be proportional to the HMG-CoA reductase levels in the cells (Fogelman, A. M., Edmond, J., Seager, J., and Popjak, G. (1975)J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2045-2055). Sterol loss occurs from normal and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemic leukocytes within 15 min in lipid-depleted serum. Since induction of HMG-CoA reductase activity is not detectable until after the leukocytes have been incubated in the lipid-depleted serum for at least 3 h (Fogelman et al., see above), sterol loss clearly precedes the induction of the enzyme. In six out of six experiments, the nonisotopic sterol content of leukocytes incubated in lipid-depleted serum was equal to or lower than that of the same leukocytes incubated in full serum. This occurred at a time when the leukocytes in the lipid-depleted serum were incorporating 4 to 5 times more [14C]acetate into sterols than the same leukocytes in full serum. This strongly suggests that the induction of the reductase was a compensatory mechanism for sterol loss. Incubation of leukocytes in buffer, or buffer plus lecithin dispersions, or buffer plus albumin did not lead to sterol loss or induction of the reductase, but incubation in buffer and albumin together with lecithin dispersions caused sterol loss into the medium and the activation of sterol synthesis from acetate. It is concluded that a phospholipid-protein-cell interaction, which produces sterol loss, is necessary to induce the reductase in leukocytes. A close correlation between sterol loss and total sterol synthesis (a function of HMG-CoA reductase activity) was demonstrated in normal and heterozygous leukocytes incubated in a variety of incubation media (r = 0.95; p less than 0.005). Heterozygous leukocytes taken fresh from the blood contained no more cholesterol than the leukocytes of their age and sex-matched controls, despite the marked difference in their serum cholesterol concentrations. It is proposed that the abnormality in familial hypercholesterolemia can be accounted for by an abnormal efflux of cholesterol from heterozygous cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608848671,"This study demonstrates that a serine endopeptidase of pancreatic origin (elastase 2) circulates in human blood. A specific and highly sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed for pancreatic elastase 2 in human serum. The inactivation of elastase 2 employed as radioiodinated tracer with an active site-specific reagent (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was necessary to prevent its binding by serum alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha2-macroglobulin while maintaining its immunoreactivity. The assay is based upon competition of standard human pancreatic elastase 2 with 125I-labeled phenylmethanesulfonyl elastase 2 for specific antibody binding sites, after which a second antibody precipitation step is used to separate bound from free 125I-labeled phenylmethanesulfonyl elastase 2. The minimum detectable concentration of elastase 2 was 0.9 ng/ml. The average normal fasting serum level determined was 71 ng/ml, approximately 80-fold greater than the minimum detectable amount. The form of radioimmunoassayable elastase 2 in normal human serum has been investigated by gel filtration of serum samples on Sephadex G-200 followed by radioimmunoassay of column fractions. The majority of the immunoreactive elastase 2 is eluted from G-200 in the void volume. While a minor amount of elastase 2 is eluted in a position consistent with alpha1-antitrypsin-elastase 2 complex, no free elastase or free proelastase is detectable. Addition of exogenous elastase 2 to normal serum prior to gel filtration on G-200 produced an increase only in the peak of radioimmunoassayable elastase bound to alpha1-antitrypsin. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that while elastase 2 bound to alpha1-antitrypsin is immunologically reactive, alpha2-macroglobulin-bound elastase 2 cross-reacts less than 2% in this radioimmunoassay. The assay has been shown to be specific for elastase 2. Human pancreatic elastase 1, anionic trypsin, chymotrypsin I, and chymotrypsin II do not cross-react in this assay system. The major advantages of this radioimmunoassay over enzymatic assays are its high sensitivity and ability to measure the enzyme in terms of its total protein concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1607148010,"Significant amounts of H2O2 were produced when the polyamines, spermine, or spermidine were incubated with a Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer that contained bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). This effect was specific for certain amines and could be prevented by treatment of the albumin fraction with isoniazid or aminoguanidine. These features suggest that H2O2 is formed during oxidative deamination of the polyamines catalized by spermine oxidase, a known contaminant of Fraction V bovine serum albumin. The insulin-like effects elicited by polyamines in fat cells (e.g. enhancement of glucose transport and inhibition of cAMP-mediated lipolysis) were dependent on H2O2 production. Incubation of cells with catalase or treatment of the albumin fraction with isoniazid abolished the stimulation of glucose uptake by polyamines but did not alter the stimulatory effects of insulin or vitamin K5. The H2O2 generating activity was partially separated from the albumin by gel filtration; only those fractions which formed H2O2 provided support for the activation of glucose transport by polyamines. Also, the time needed to activate glucose uptake was markedly shortened by incubation of the albumin buffer with the polyamines before addition of the cells. These findings indicate that the polyamines do not themselves mimic the actions of insulin but that the insulin-like effects result from the formation of H2O2 which has been shown to stimulate glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1603767776,"The progesterone receptor B subunit has been purified to apparent homogeneity from hen oviduct cytosol using ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, and gel filtration on Agarose A-1.5m. The material is obtained (1 mug of purified protein/g of tissue) in about 17% yield. The protein is highly purified; a single band is seen on gel electrophoresis in acid-urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate gels as well as gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. In the latter system, labeled progesterone co-migrates with the protein band, demonstrating that the isolated protein is a progesterone-binding species. Labeled progesterone bound to the protein is displaced by progestational steroids but not by estradiol or hydrocortisone. The protein has a molecular weight of 116,000 g/mol as determined by gel electrophoresis and has a single polypeptide chain. The isolated protein contains 98% endogenous nonradioactive progesterone and is 2% labeled by incubation in vitro with radiolabeled progesterone. It behaves identically on all of the chromatographic steps to chick receptor B subunits described in earlier publications."

https://openalex.org/W1590668003,"During studies on the amino acid sequence of bovine nasal cartilage collagen, the cyanogen bromide peptide alpha1(II)-CB11 was degraded to smaller peptides with trypsin. One of the tryptic peptides, T5, which contained 39 residues was shown by amino acid and sequence analyses to occur in a predominant form that contained glutamine at position 5 and in a second form with leucine at this site. In addition to the heterogeneity at this position, amino acid analyses of five different preparations revealed that the peptide with leucine contained a seryl residue not found in the major form. Sequence heterogeneity at a third position of alpha1(II) was demonstrated by the isolation of a hexapeptide (T2) from the trypsin digest of alpha1(II)-CB11 which contained 0.21 residue of alanine and 0.77 of leucine. Both the leucine and alanine of T2 were removed after the second cycle of subtractive Edman degradation. These data show that at least two types of alpha1(II) chains, designated as alpha1(II)Major and alpha1(II)Minor, exist in bovine nasal cartilage. Further considerations suggest that these two chains are probably not variants derived from allelic genes but are the products of separate genes."

https://openalex.org/W1861967304,"The roles of the sterol and nonsterol pathways in the metabolism of circulating mevalonate have been estimated in the intact rat. On an average, the sterol pathway accounts for 74 per cent of the mevalonate metabolized, while the nonsterol, or shunt, pathway is responsible for 26 per cent of the mevalonate metabolized in the whole animal. The contribution of the kidneys to each of these processes was evaluated by two approaches. First, the localization of labeled sterols and sterol precursors derived from [14C]mevalonate was determined in each of the major tissues of the body and, second, the effect of nephrectomy upon mevalonate metabolism by the sterol and shunt mechanisms was examined. The results confirm our earlier conclusion that the kidneys represent the primary tissue site of conversion of circulating mevalonate to sterols and sterol precursors. In the present study, it was shown that by 6 h after administration of [14C]mevalonate, the major end product of mevalonate metabolism in the kidneys is cholesterol and that, moreover, the kidneys are responsible for most of the cholestreol synthesized in the intact animal from injected mevalonate. Following nephrectomy, the extrarenal tissues can readily assume the dominant role normally played by the kidneys in synthesizing cholesterol and other sterols from circulating mevalonate. The major observation of the present study is that the kidneys represent the primary site of mevalonate metabolism by the shunt pathway, in that nephrectomy results in approximately a 60 per cent decrease in the mevalonate metabolized by the shunt pathway. These studies, therefore, reinforce and expand the evidence that the kidneys represent the most important single tissue site for the metabolism of circulating mevalonate."

https://openalex.org/W1678116799,"A number of physical and chemical properties of pure hen oviduct progesterone receptor B subunit have been determined. The molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 115,000 g/mol as determined by gel filtration in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The labeled subunit has retained the biologically important properties which it displayed in cruder preparations: it binds to nuclei (Kd = 1 X 10(-9) M) and chromatin (Kd = 1.5 X 10(-9) M) but does not bind to DNA. Reaction of the purified subunit with dansyl (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) chloride revealed a single NH2-terminal lysine. The amino acid composition has been determined and has been shown to be distinct from that of other steroid-binding proteins and consistent with the known properties of the molecule. In addition, no evidence for carbohydrate or phosphorylated amino acids was observed. The protein contains about 12% alpha helix as determined by circular dichroism. The ultraviolet spectrum of intact steroid receptor complexes revealed that the purified subunit had no pyridine nucleotide cofactor or nucleic acid, and that each receptor molecule contains a single hormone binding site. Electron microscopic analysis confirms the prolate-ellipsoid shape of the protein, with a long axis of 114 A. The purified protein isolated as described in a companion paper is shown here to have the characteristics of the crude receptor subunit B. Due to the apparent role in the hormone response, this protein has been named progestophilin B."

https://openalex.org/W1602567079,"Liposomes containing trapped glucose were used to examine the interaction of the A and B protomers of choleragen with ganglioside GM1 and lipid model membranes. The B protomer (choleragenoid) was as effective as choleragen in causing release of trapped glucose from liposomes containing GM1; the A protomer did not release glucose from GM1 liposomes. Neither choleragen nor the A or B protomers caused release of trapped glucose from glycolipid-free liposomes. Anti-choleragen and complement, however, caused release of trapped glucose from ganlioside-free liposomes previously incubated with the A protomer but not from those incubated with the B protomer or choleragen. These results suggest that the A protomer, but not intact choleragen or B protomer, bound to ganglioside-free liposomes. Presumably, the A protomer must be freed of the constraints present in the intact choleragen in order to interact with the liposomal model membrane system."
https://openalex.org/W1497722825,"Solubilized cytochromes P-450 and P-448 have been prepared from liver microsomes of phenobarbital- and 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated rats, respectively. These hemoproteins can bind to microsomes and increase the microsomal monoxygenase activities. The binding of cytochrome P-450 enhances the microsomal benzphetamine demethylase activity, whereas cytochrome P-448 enhances the ethoxycoumarin dealkylase and benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activities. The added cytochrome P-450 is believed to be incorporated into the microsomal membrane, and the enriched microsomes can be separated from the free hemoprotein by gel filtration. A correlation between the increased cytochrome P-450 content and the enhanced catalytic activity of the microsomes is shown. Several lines of evidence suggest that the exogenous cytochrome P-450 molecules become catalytically active only when they are incorporated into the membrane. By measuring the enhanced ethoxycoumarin dealkylase activity, the rate of the proposed incorporation of cytochrome P-448 into microsomes can be measured, and the temperature dependence of the rate is reported. The addition of cytochromes P-448 and P-450 causes a great increase in the monoxygenase activities of microsomes which have been treated with linoleic acid hydroperoxide. The hydroperoxide treatment denatures almost all the cytochrome P-450 molecules in the microsomes but retains most of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity. Experiments with such microsomes indicate that the added cytochrome P-450 molecules, after incorporation into the membrane, have a direct access to the reductase molecules and are able to receive electrons directly from the latter. The present results are consistent with a nonrigid model for the organization of cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in the microsomal membrane."

The degradation of [3H]poly(C)-poly(I) by purified enzyme preparations yields labeled dinucleotides and octanucleotides; the latter oligonucleotide contained 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini. The enzyme cleaves high molecular weight RNAs such as RNA products formed in vitro by T3 phage-induced RNA polymerase from T3 phage DNA, heterogeneous RNA isolated from duck reticulocyte nuclei, and 45 S RNA isolated from rat liver nucleoli. The mode of degradation of RNA in vitro with the double-stranded RNase is similar to that of Escherichia coli RNase III and appears to act endonucleolytically. The degradation of 45 S RNA with the enzyme results in the production of 29 S and 19 S RNA fragments. These findings suggest that the enzyme may be involved in the processing of high molecular weight precursor RNAs to mRNA or rRNAs in a manner analogous to that reported for RNase III of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1584026509,"Raw extract in 2 m CaCl2 of bovine nasal septum cartilage was eluted from 4 per cent agarose gel to give a void volume Fraction v-4, which was indistinguishable in composition and behavior on viscometric and sedimentation analysis from the densest fraction obtained by associative centrifugation in a cesium chloride density gradient. The sulfated proteoglycan was precipitated (Fraction A) by cetylpyridinium chloride from acidic solutions of Fraction v-4 or of dialyzed raw ectract. Neutralization under conditions of low ionic strength precipitated a further small fraction (B), which contained from 0.5 to 1 per cent of the uronic acid in the original extract. Analysis by associative and dissociative density gradient centrifugation demonstrated that Fraction B resembled in effective density known samples of hyaluronic acid from other sources. Gel chromatography of proteolytic digests of Fractions A and B on 6 per cent agarose indicated that cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation essentially separated sulfated proteoglycan (A) from hyaluronic acid (B). A viscosity-average molecular weight of about 5 x 10(5) was estimated for a sample of Fraction B purified in a dissociative (4 M guanidine hydrochloride + CsCl) density gradient. Sedimentation velocity data were consistent with this result. Analysis of hexosamines showed that the sample contained 96 per cent glucosamine, confirming the identification of hyaluronic acid. The proteoglycan fraction (A) resembled subunits in its sedimentation behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2110487855,"The kinetics of the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi by beef heart submitochondrial particles were examined. When Pi was the variable substrate positive cooperativity was observed, whereas if ADP was varied, linear double reciprocal plots were obtained. The analog of Pi, thiophosphate, was a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP synthesis with respect to ADP, while the analog of ADP, AMP (CH2)P, was an uncompetitive Pi leads to ATP exchange inhibitor. The kinetics of the initial velocity isotopic exchanges of oxidative phosphorylation were also examined. When the Pi leads to ATP exchange was examined, it was found that if ADP concentration was held constant while ATP and Pi concentrations were varied at a constant ratio, linear double reciprocal plots were obtained. However, if Pi concentration was held constant and ADP and ATP concentrations were varied at constant ratio, apparent substrate inhibition was observed. The 2, 4-dinitrophenol-sensitive ADP leads to ATP exchange showed linear double reciprocal plots regardless of which components were varied. These results are interpreted to indicate that in the direction of ATP synthesis, the reaction is ordered, with Pi adding to the enzyme before ADP addition."
https://openalex.org/W1491819036,"A pregnenolone-binding component has been detected in the soluble fraction of the guinea pig adrenal cortex. Enzymatic degradation studies revealed that the binding component was a protein. The binding was destroyed at 60 degrees but was not inhibited by sulfhydryl reactants. Pregnenolone was bound optimally at pH 7 to 7.5 The equilibrium association constant at 0 degrees was 10(7) M-1. The pregnenolone-binding protein had an apparent molecular weight of 58,000, as determined by gel filtration. With the exception of pregnenolone sulfate, structurally similar steroids did not interfere with pregnenolone binding. No such binding activity was detected in the guinea pig liver and kidney. Serum contained pregnenolone-binding activity which was distinguishable from the adrenal cytosol factor by a variet of physicochemical means. The physiological importance of this finding remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1573922731,"Calorimetric heats generated upon mixing solutions of alphaSH and betaSH chains of human hemoglobin have been studied by isothermal heatburst microcalorimetry as a function of mixture composition. Based upon studies described in accompanying papers, the contributions to the measured heats arising from (a) alpha chain self-association, (b) beta chain self-association, (c) association of dimers to form tetramers, have been evaluated. Taking these processes into account, the calorimetric data have been used to determine the enthalpy of formation for alphabeta dimers, yielding a value of -15.71 +/- 0.96 kcal in the fully oxygenated state at 21.5 degrees in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4. The total enthalpy for assembly of a mole of hemoglobin tetramers from oxygenated chains is -27.6 +/- 2.1 kcal. Combining results of this study with independently determined information, limits can be placed upon the magnitude of the enthalpy for dimer formation in unliganded hemoglobin. The total enthalpy for assembly of a mole of unliganded hemoglobin tetramers from unliganded chains is -61.6 +/- 3.5 kcal, or approximately twice the value for oxygenated hemoglobin. This difference lies entirely in the dimer-tetramer stage of assembly. There are essentially no oxygenation-linked thermodynamic quantities (deltaG, deltaH, deltaS) associated with alphabeta dimer formation from isolated chains."
https://openalex.org/W1590606068,"Pyruvate carboxylase from chicken liver is a tetramer whose catalytic activity is completely dependent on the presence of acetyl-CoA. However, no direct evidence concerning the nature of the binding of the activator to the enzyme has been available. This is due in part to the instability of the enzyme and its ability to hydrolyze acetyl-CoA at an appreciable rate. The present studies on binding of the activator with the rapid flow dialysis method of Colowick and Womack ((1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 774-777) as modified by Klapper ((1970) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 38, 172-179) show four binding sites for acetyl-CoA. The binding dissociation constant at pH 7.2 is 13.9 muM as compared with an activation constant of 13.3 muM for the catalytic reaction at this pH. The relationship between acetyl-CoA concentration and catalytic activity is highly cooperative (nH = 2.9). The binding process also exhibits positive cooperativity but to a lower degree (nH = 1.9). Pyruvate carboxylase from chicken liver is rapidly inactivated and dissociated in the cold (0 degrees). The inactive protomeric form of the enzyme has been shown to be unable to bind acetyl-CoA at 0 degrees although the tetrameric species can do so. These results provide a plausible explanation for the catalytic inactivity of the protomer. The presence of acetyl-CoA results in an ultraviolet difference spectrum for the enzyme with a maximum at 280 nm. Half-maximal optical density difference is observed at an acetyl-CoA concentration of 9 muM, in reasonable agreement with the binding and activation constants."
https://openalex.org/W1510149907,"A 63-residue RNase A analog containing residues 26 to 35 then alanine, 41 to 59 and 73 to 84 then glycine, 100 to 110 then glycine, and 117 to 124 was synthesized by the solid phase method. The deletions comprised ordered (an alpha helix, parts of the beta sheet) and less ordered structures including 27 of the 56 residues invariant in mammalian ribonucleases. The synthetic 63-residue analog was cleaved from the insoluble support with liquid HF, reduced-reoxidized, fractionated by gel filtration, and purified further on an affinity column specific for the active site fold of RNase A. It had an activity of 8 to 14 per cent in the transphosphorylation step using poly(C) and poly(U) as substrates. It also had low synthetic and hydrolytic activity (0.2 per cent) and showed RNase A-like specificity toward the substrates tested. This indicated that all residues essential for substrate binding and catalysis were present and that their relative positions in the three-dimensional structure were probably very similar to those in native RNase A. Therefore, structure-function studies with the 63-residue RNase A analog should allow conclusions about the mode of action of the natural enzyme. As a first step in this direction, lysine 41 which is believed to be important for catalysis was replaced in the 63-residue analog by tyrosine or glutamine. The resulting (Tyr-41)- and (Gln 41)-63-residue analogs were also bound by the affinity column and had the same substrate specificity as native RNase A. They differed from each other, from the (Lys 41)-63-residue analog, and the 124-residue natural enzyme only with respect to the relative rates of the catalyzed reactions. Thus, lysine 41 does not seem to be essential for the functioning of RNase A."
https://openalex.org/W1585329166,"The topography of the external surface of the human red cell membrane has been studied using an impermeant radioactive probe, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid, which binds covalently to protein groups of the membrane following reaction with intact cells. The pattern of labeling was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis followed by sequential analysis of single gels for carbohydrates (by staining with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent), for proteins (by staining with Coomassie blue), and for radioactivity (by counting gels sliced in 2-mm segments). The radioactive probe bound to membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 94,200, 58,100, and 46,500 (Peaks A, B, and C, respectively). Peak A co-migrated with a small periodic acid-Schiff-positive band and protein Band 3 (nomenclature of Steck) (Steck, T.L. (1974)J. Cell Biol. 62: 1-19). Peak B migrated with protein Band(s) 4.5 slightly ahead of the major membrane glycoprotein (PAS-1). Peak C migrated like glycoprotein PAS-2 and protein Band 5, the actin-like, water-soluble membrane protein. In contrast to lactoperoxidase iodination and a number of other probes, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid reacted minimally with the major membrane glycoprotein, glycophorin. When it was reacted with isolated ghosts, all molecular weight classes of polypeptides were labeled. Treatment of labeled cells with neuraminidase or trypsin altered the glycoprotein staining pattern, but not the radioactive peaks. On the other hand, Pronase eliminated the Mr=94,200 radioactive peak, diminished the other two radioactive peaks, and profoundly changed the glycoprotein and protein staining patterns. Treatment of the membranes of labeled cells in a low ionic strength alkaline medium did not alter radioactive peaks and demonstrated that Peak C differed from the actin-like membrane protein. A nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, solubilized all radioactive components. The studies have defined the binding of [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid to external proteins of the human red cell membrane. Its pattern of reaction differs quantitatively and qualitatively from other commonly used reagents, and it provides a useful additional vectorial probe for the study of membrane topography. Its reactions provide further evidence of the organizational complexity of the red cell membrane and emphasize the fact that interpretation of information derived from the use of membrane probes must take into account the differences resulting from the properties of the probing reagents themselves."

https://openalex.org/W1509680800,"Abstract A complementary DNA (cDNA) copy of mouse globin mRNA was synthesized using the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus and the oligo(dT) covalently attached to cellulose as primer. All four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, NaCl, the globin mRNA template, and an oligo(dT) primer were required for optimal synthesis of cDNA. By saturating the primer sites using a 3-fold excess of mRNA, sufficient concentrations of immobilized cDNA could be synthesized to allow the hybridization reactions to be performed using an excess of globin cDNA. Conditions which permitted the annealing of globin mRNA to cDNA-cellulose were selected and the sequence specificity for hybridization to cDNA-cellulose was determined using 28 S ribosomal RNA, polyadenylic acid, and mouse L-cell RNA. Both analytical and preparative applications of this chromatographic medium were explored. When radioactively labeled poly(A)-containing 9 S RNA isolated from nucleated erythroid cells was analyzed by affinity chromatography on globin cDNA-cellulose, 46 per cent of the applied radioactivity hybridized to the cDNA-cellulose column. Only 1 per cent of the labeled RNA was retained by the column during reapplication of the unbound fraction, while 96 per cent of the bound RNA reannealed to cDNA-cellulose. Hybridizations utilizing unfractionated RNA extracts from either mouse reticulocytes or nucleated erythroid cells provided a one-step purification method for globin mRNA sequences. The relative purity of the RNA isolated by cDNA-cellulose affinity chromatography was determined by hybridization kinetic analysis. The cDNA-bound fraction obtained from the unfractionated RNA of either cell type was shown to have a Crt1/2 of 2.7 x 10-3. This represents a 60-fold purification of the globin sequences present in reticulocyte polysomal RNA and a 280-fold enrichment of the globin mRNA in nucleated erythroid cells. Hybridization to cDNA-cellulose did not result in any change in the sedimentation rate of globin mRNA. Furthermore, experiments were performed which demonstrated that the globin mRNA isolated by hybridization to cDNA-cellulose retained its biological activity when assayed in a wheat germ cell-free lysate."
https://openalex.org/W1561916648,"Ribosomal proteins are rapidly taken up by isolated rat liver nuclei. The proteins are localized mainly in the nucleolus and are found associated with a nucleolar 80 S particle containing newly synthesized 45 S RNA. Ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm were associated with particles containing 18 and 28 S RNAs. In the absence of ribosomal proteins in the incubations, there was a decrease in the amount of newly synthesized 45, 18, and 28 S RNAs and an increase in low molecular weight RNA in both the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. This in vitro system appears to be useful for studies on the formation of ribosomal particles in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1556135538,"Others have concluded that beta-fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is a substrate for muscle aldolase on the basis of rapid kinetic measurements. In view of new data showing excellent aldol cleavage of an analog of the keto form and a very high rate of spontaneous ring opening, Midelfort et al. (Midelfort, C. F., Gupta, R., and Rose, I.A. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 2178-2185) have suggested that the beta form may be used only after spontaneous conversion to the keto form in solution, followed by reaction of the keto form with the aldolase. In order to determine whether beta-fructose-1, 6-P2 is itself a substrate a steady state approach was devised in which the beta form is specifically produced by phosphofructokinase for use by the aldolase present. Since aldolase binds very tightly to bisphosphates similar in size to beta-fructose-1, 6-P2, it was expected that if a spontaneous ring opening were essential for catalysis, it would be possible to decrease the rate of production of triose-Ps by using very high concentrations of aldolase. If the beta form were itself a substrate, the rate would reach a constant value with increasing aldolase, limited by the phosphofructokinase rate. It was found that under conditions where only approximately 2 per cent of the total fructose-1, 6-P2 present in the steady state would be free, the turnover of the complexed fructose-1, 6-P2 was about 20-fold greater than that in which spontaneous ring opening is a required step. Using similar methods, the turnover of enzyme-bound glyceraldehyde-P and dihydroxyacetone-P were determined. It was concluded that at saturation both the beta and acyclic forms have about the same rates as substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1587907289,"Synthesis of luciferase, an alpha beta dimer, occurs during a relatively short period of time near the end of exponential growth of Beneckea harveyi. The rates of synthesis of the individual alpha and beta chains of luciferase are compared by quantitating the molar ratio of total cellular alpha to that of beta at different growth stages. The addition of exogenous alpha or beta subunit to crude lysates of cells taken prior to and during the luciferase induction produces no increase in luciferase activity. This result, together with previous evidence that there are no antigenically cross-reacting precursors, allows us to conclude that luciferase alpha and beta chains are synthesized pari passu, i.e. in equal proportions, and exist primarily in the alpha beta dimeric form. It is also shown that insoluble sedimentable cellular materials contain no detectable luciferase subunits."
