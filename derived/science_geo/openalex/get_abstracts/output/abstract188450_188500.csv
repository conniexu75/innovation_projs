Although α-synuclein is found predominantly in the cytosolic fractions, membrane-bound α-synuclein has been suggested to play an important role in fibril formation. The effects of α-synuclein on lipid bilayers of different compositions were determined using fluorescent environment-specific probes located at various depths. α-Synuclein-membrane interactions were found to affect both protein and membrane properties. Our results indicate that in addition to electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions are important in the association of the protein with the bilayer, and lead to disruption of the membrane. The latter was observed by atomic force microscopy and fluorescent dye leakage from vesicles. The kinetics of α-synuclein fibril formation were significantly affected by the protein association and subsequent membrane disruption, and reflected the conformation of α-synuclein. The ability of α-synuclein to disrupt membranes correlated with the binding affinity of α-synuclein for the particular membrane composition, and to the induced helical conformation of α-synuclein. Protofibrillar or fibrillar α-synuclein caused a much more rapid destruction of the membrane than soluble monomeric α-synuclein, indicating that protofibrils (oligomers) or fibrils are likely to be significantly neurotoxic.

The two pathological hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain, and the presence of intracellular inclusions, Lewy bodies, and Lewy neurites. The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown. Recent observations indicate that PD is a protein deposition disease involving the aggregation of α-synuclein. The evidence includes the discovery that α-synuclein is the major fibrillar protein in Lewy bodies (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), and the finding of mutant α-synucleins (A53T (2Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B.

Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3321) Google Scholar)) in rare cases of familial early-onset Parkinson's disease. Substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that “pathological” or abnormal aggregation (4Fink A.L. Folding Design. 1998; 3: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) arises from a key partially folded intermediate precursor. Such intermediates have sizable non-polar patches (i.e. contiguous hydrophobic side-chains) on their surface, which lead to hydrophobic interactions between molecules, resulting in specific intermolecular interactions and aggregation. These hydrophobic patches are absent in the fully unfolded state. Factors that increase the concentration of such intermediates will favor aggregation. A partially folded conformation has been shown to be a critical amyloidogenic intermediate in the formation of α-synuclein fibrils (5Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In addition, soluble oligomers, in the form of annular protofibrils, have been shown to lead to vesicle permeability (6Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 7Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is a relatively abundant brain protein of 140 amino acids and of unknown function, and is intrinsically unstructured, i.e. natively unfolded (8Weinreb P.H. Zhen W.G. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 9Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human α-synuclein shows seven repeats of 11 residues in the N-terminal half of the molecule, with a consensus sequence of KTKEGV. This repeat is reminiscent of the lipid-binding domains of some apolipoproteins, and the first five repeats are predicted to form an amphiphilic helix (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein has been shown to be present in high concentrations at presynaptic terminals (11Irizarry M.C. Kim T.W. McNamara M. Tanzi R.E. George J.M. Clayton D.F. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and to inhibit phospholipase D2 (12Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The existing literature on the interactions of α-synuclein with membranes is very contradictory. It has been reported that small oligomeric forms of α-synuclein preferentially associated with lipid droplets and cell membranes (13Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and that α-synuclein binds preferentially to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) containing acidic phospholipids (PLs), such as PA and PS (PS is abundant (12-22% of total phospholipid) in nerve tissue, whereas PA comprises only 1-3%) but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). In contrast, strong binding of α-synuclein (and its mutants and β-synuclein) to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with either anionic or zwitterionic head groups has also been reported (14Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Differential affinity of α-synuclein for specific phospholipids may play an important role in determining the location of the protein and the rate of fibril formation. The A30P mutation has been reported to either abolish lipid binding (15Jo E. Fuller N. Rand R.P. George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or not (16Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant α-synucleins are reported to associate with neural membranes, via strong interactions of both N- and C-terminal regions (17McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8812-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A lipid binding motif and strong binding of α-synuclein to oleic acid have been reported (18Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Previous reports have indicated that α-synuclein interaction with phospholipids may transform it into a helical conformation (13Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Membranes have been reported to accelerate the fibrillation of α-synuclein (19Lee H.J. Choi C. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and to inhibit its fibrillation (14Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that α-synuclein aggregation may occur on membrane surfaces (13Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and that membranes preferentially induce α-synuclein oligomers. Oligomers of α-synuclein have been reported to be induced in the presence of vesicles containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (20Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41958-41962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), with similar effects observed for β- and γ-synuclein and the familial mutants of α-synuclein. Recently, we have shown that lipid-bound, helical α-synuclein does not form fibrils (21Zhu M. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16873-16877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cell death in PD is unknown, but it has been suggested that membrane permeability, induced by some form of aggregated α-synuclein could be a factor (7Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 22Volles M.J. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). It is likely that interactions between hydrophobic residues of the amphipathic α-helices of α-synuclein play an important role in the association of the protein to the membrane. The significance of the presence of oligomers of α-synuclein is that they are suspected of being cytotoxic (6Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 24El Agnaf O.M. Irvine G.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 559-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was triggered by results of preliminary investigations that suggested that the outcome of the interaction of α-synuclein with membranes is very dependent on factors such as the relative concentrations of α-synuclein and lipids, nature of the vesicles, nature of the head groups etc. These factors could explain many of the apparently contradictory reports regarding the interaction of α-synuclein with membranes. We show that α-synuclein-membrane interactions affect both protein and membrane properties, and lead to disruption of the membrane, as well as affecting the kinetics of α-synuclein fibril formation. The presence of protofibrillar (oligomeric) or fibrillar α-synuclein caused a much more rapid destruction of the membrane than soluble monomeric α-synuclein. Expression and Purification of Protein—Recombinant α-synuclein was expressed (in Escherichia coli) and purified as described preciously (5Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and stored at -80 °C. A stock solution of purified α-synuclein with a concentration <100 μm was treated with NaOH, then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to remove insoluble aggregated species, and used within 1 day. Materials—1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol) (PG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), and NBD (7-nitrobenzofurazan)-labeled PA, PG, and PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids as chloroform solutions. Laurdan was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Thioflavin T and calcein (2,4-bis(N,N′-di(carboxymethyl)aminoethyl)fluorescein) were purchased from Sigma, and were used without further purification. Preparation of SUVs by Sonication—SUVs of PA/PC, PS/PC, PG/PE, and PG/PC (all at a molar ratio of 1:1), and PC alone were prepared by sonication. Lipids, dissolved in chloroform stock solutions, were mixed, and dried under N2 while shaking gently to form a thin film on the wall of the vial. The thin film was hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, and then vortexed. The hydrated sample was sonicated at 4 °C with a probe sonicator with the microprobe energy at level 3. The sonicator program was set at 1-min pauses after a 1-min sonication period to prevent overheating. The sonication time varied from 2.5 to 10 min depending on the size of the samples. This procedure routinely produced small unilamellar vesicles with diameters of 20-25 nm (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Preparation of LUVs—Hydrated vesicles were obtained as described above, frozen at -80 °C, and then thawed at 70 °C (above the phase transition temperature). The freeze-thaw procedure was repeated 10 times, and the solution was then extruded through two stacked poly-carbonate filters of 100-nm pore size for 12 times. The lipid concentration of the final vesicle solution was determined by a lipid phosphate assay (25Stewart J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The sizes of vesicles were examined by EM imaging. Protein was mixed with pre-formed SUVs or LUVs, and incubated for 20 min before circular dichroism, fluorescence, or kinetic measurements. Encapsulation of α-Synuclein in Lipid Vesicles—Encapsulated α-synuclein was prepared as describe previously (26Semble S.C. Klimuk S.K. Harasym T.O. Santos N.D. Ansell S.M. Wong K.F. Maurer N. Start H. Cullis P.R. Hope M.J. Scherrer P. J. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 27Walde P. Ichikawa S. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 18: 143-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), simply by slowly adding the lipids to the α-synuclein, while mixing constantly. The mixture was then sonicated or subjected to freeze-thaw cycling to obtain SUVs and LUVs, respectively. Intrinsic Fluorescence—Steady-state emission and excitation spectra were measured with a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence of the four α-synuclein tyrosine side chains was measured to monitor lipid binding to α-synuclein. Emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm with excitation at 281 nm, with or without lipid vesicles. Spectra were corrected by subtracting the contributions of buffer and vesicle scattering. Laurdan Fluorescence—Stock solutions of Laurdan (0.05%) and 0.03 mm PA/PC (1:1), PG/PC (1:1), or PC were made in chloroform. SUVs of Laurdan-labeled lipid were prepared as described above. Excitation spectra from 350 to 410 nm were recorded with emission wavelength at 434 nm. Spectra were corrected for background scattering produced from buffer or vesicles. The generalized polarization, GPem, values for Laurdan were calculated by using 434 nm emission wavelength and 375 (I B) and 395 nm (I R) wavelengths for the excitation intensities according to the following expression. GPem=(IR-IB)/(IR+IB)(Eq. 1) For lipid titration experiments, aliquots of α-synuclein, protofibrils, or fibrils of α-synuclein were titrated directly into the fluorescence cuvette, and measurements were taken after incubating the solution for 20 min. NBD Fluorescence—SUVs of NBD-incorporated lipid were prepared as described above, with 5 mol % NBD-PA or NBD-PG incorporated into 0.03 mm lipid vesicles. Emission spectra of NBD were recorded from 490 to 560 nm with excitation at 485 nm. Anisotropy (r) was calculated as follows, r=(IVV-gIVH)/(IVV-2gIVH)(Eq. 2) where I VV and I VH are parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensities, respectively, and g factors were calculated as I HV/I HH. Vesicle Membrane Permeability—Calcein-loaded LUVs were prepared by hydrating lipid films in the presence of 40 mm calcein, and separated from free dye using a Sepharose 4B column (Sigma) (1.5 × 12 cm). The encapsulated fluorophore has a low fluorescence intensity because of self-quenching by the high concentration of calcein in the vesicle. The fluorescence intensity increases on release of the dye from the vesicle core by the addition of an aliquot of a membrane-disruptive agent. The change in the fluorescence intensity was monitored at 510 nm (excitation 490 nm) after incubating α-synuclein and dye-containing vesicles at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, until the dye release reached its end point, around 30 min. Total dye release was completed by the addition of 0.2 vol % Triton X-100. Vesicles containing dye were diluted to 10 μm before the dye release to avoid probe-molecule interaction. For the same reason, the probe concentrations were checked before starting the experiments, and were less than 0.5 μm after complete release in all experiments. The percentage of probe release was calculated as follows, &x0025;Dyerelease=(IF-IB)×100/(IT-IB)(Eq. 3) where I F, I T, and I B are the fluorescence intensity of the dye released by the protein, total dye released, and control blank. The percentage released was ignored if it was less than 15%. The percent release was reproducible within ±10%. Circular Dichroism Measurements—The concentrations of protein were kept at 14 μm, with the mass ratio of protein to phospholipid varied from 5:1 to 1:10. Far-UV CD spectra were collected from 195 to 250 nm at a step resolution of 1 nm, band width 1.5 nm, and averaging time 5 s using an Aviv model 60DS (Lakewood, NJ) spectrometer. The final spectra were obtained by calculating the mean of five individual scans and subtracting the background consisting of buffer or vesicles without protein. The percentage of α-helix for α-synuclein was estimated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, as described (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Preparation of Planar Phospholipid Bilayer for AFM Measurements—Freshly cleaved mica was hydroxylated by submerging it in a solution consisting of concentrated H2SO4 (95 vol %) and 50 mm potassium dichromate for 20 min, rinsed with water, and dried with a stream of nitrogen. Samples of planar unilamellar bilayer were prepared by the vesicle fusion as previously reported (29Fang Y. Yang J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, mica was submerged into 2.5 mg/ml LUVs lipid solution at 4 °C for 4 h to form a self-assembled bilayer. The excess vesicles were removed by rinsing the mica surface with buffer. The pre-formed bilayer was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then stored in buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 100 mm NaCl) at 4 °C prior to use. The properties of the planar bilayers were checked by AFM imaging. AFM Measurements—Mica-adsorbed samples were washed with water and blown dry with N2. AFM imaging was done using an Autoprobe CP multiple AFM (Park Scientific, CA) in tapping mode. Measurements were carried out using silicon cantilevers with a spring constant of 50 N/m and a resonance frequency of 290-350 kHz. The images were acquired using a 100-μm Scanmaster, and a 5-μm scanner for high-resolution imaging with a pixel number of 512 × 512. Height sizes in the range of 2.5 to 50 nm were estimated by section analysis using the PSI program (Park Scientific, CA) without calibration, and lateral sizes were calibrated with various standard gold colloid particles using the same type of probe and similar set-point for imaging. Some of images were modified using SPIP software (Image Metrology, Lyngby, Denmark). At least four regions of the mica surface were examined to verify that similar structures existed throughout the sample. AFM is ideal for quantitatively measuring the surface roughness on a nanometer scale. The arithmetic roughness average R a, which is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the measured profile height deviations, was estimated using SPIP. The arithmetic roughness average is given by, Ra=∑i=1n|zi-z¯|(Eq. 4) where R a is the arithmetic roughness average, n the number of height positions along the line profile, z i the height at position i, and z the average height. EM Measurements—Aliquots of 5-μl samples were applied to carbon-coated pioloform copper grids and incubated for 10 min. Salts were washed out with distilled water, and samples were dried, negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and visualized in transmission electron microscopy mode operated at 85 kV. Kinetics of Fibril Formation—α-Synuclein fibrils were formed by incubating 0.5 mg/ml protein in the presence of 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer) for 60 h. Aliquots of 5 μl of solution were added to 1 ml of 20 μm thioflavin T solution, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 482 nm with excitation at 450 nm. Kinetics curves were plotted as a function of time, and lag times were calculated from curve-fitting (30Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Fibril formation was confirmed by EM and AFM images. Preparation of Protofibrils and Fibrils—Protofibrils were prepared by incubating α-synuclein under standard conditions until the end of the lag period (14-16 h), at which time their population is maximal. Any fibrils formed were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm. Similarly, fibrils were prepared using centrifugation at the completion of fibrillation, followed by washing the pellet twice in buffer, a procedure that eliminates soluble oligomers. Binding of Different Forms of α-Synuclein to Unilamellar Bilayers Characterized by Laurdan Fluorescence Spectra—Laurdan (Fig. 1) is a fluorescence dye that incorporates into membranes and is sensitive to lipid packing density, which is manifest by changes in both fluorescence intensity and polarization. Membrane binding of soluble monomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrillar α-synuclein was monitored as a function of protein concentration to vesicles containing Laurdan. The fluorescence excitation spectra of Laurdan in PA/PC vesicles with or without α-synuclein or α-synuclein protofilaments and fibrils are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The intensity of the excitation spectra substantially increases as a function of protein concentration. For a fixed concentration of α-synuclein (0.025 mg/ml) the effects on the spectrum for protofibrillar and fibrillar α-synuclein are much more pronounced (Fig. 2B), suggesting much stronger interactions with the membrane, compared with the soluble monomeric protein. Similar effects are seen for other lipid compositions, e.g. Fig. 2C for PA/PC and Fig. 2D for PG/PC vesicles, in which the changes in fluorescence intensity are shown as a function of protein concentration for monomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrillar α-synuclein. The change in the fluorescence intensity reflects the interactions between α-synuclein and the membrane (31Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Fidelio G.D. Gratton E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The much larger effects of the protofibrillar and fibrillar forms of α-synuclein indicate that these have a much greater effect on the membrane structure than the monomeric form. Both protofibrils and fibrils appear to have very similar effects on the membrane structure, based on the almost identical effects on Laurdan.Fig. 2The interaction of α-synuclein with vesicles, monitored by Laurdan fluorescence. Panels A and B show the excitation spectra of Laurdan (0.05% in vesicles) in PA/PC (0.03 mm) SUVs with emission at 434 nm. A, the intensity of the spectra increases with increasing concentration of soluble monomeric α-synuclein concentration; concentrations were: 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.100 mg/ml from lowest to highest fluorescence intensity. B, the intensity of the spectra increases in the presence of protofibrils (dashed line) and fibrils (dash-dot line) relative to soluble monomeric α-synuclein (dotted line); protein concentration was 0.025 mg/ml in each case. Panels C and D show the fluorescence increases as a function of the concentration of monomeric α-synuclein (squares), protofibrils (filled circles), and fibrils (open circles) for PA/PC (C) and PG/PC (D). Panels E and F illustrate that the generalized polarization (GPem) (see text) shows a linear decrease as a function of concentration of α-synuclein (squares), protofibrils (filled circles), and fibrils (open circles) for PA/PC (E) and PG/PC (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2A also shows that the excitation spectrum of Laurdan in PA/PC vesicles has well separated electronic transition maxima at 375 and 395 nm. Generalized polarization, GPem, values were calculated from the relative intensity of the two bands. Increasing protein concentration leads to increased mobility of the membranes, together with increased water penetration in the lipid bilayer, as indicated by the increase in intensity of the excitation bands of Laurdan, especially the blue excitation (375 nm). The ratio of blue band intensity to red band intensity increases, indicating the the Laurdan environment is more hydrophobic after interaction of the protein with the membrane. Fig. 2, E and F, shows that the relative intensities of the red and blue excitation bands of Laurdan-labeled PA/PC and PG/PC, indicated as GPem values, decrease with increasing protein concentration. All three forms of α-synuclein induce significant changes in GPem, but fibrillar and protofibrillar protein had a much stronger effect. Equilibrium measurements showed that the fibrillar form of α-synuclein binds to the lipid bilayer immediately following the addition of protein, and binding (and associated effects) is complete within 5 min. However, binding of soluble α-synuclein monomer required prolonged incubation times, typically from 20 to 30 min. Binding of α-Synuclein to PA/PC and PG/PC Vesicles as Characterized by NBD Fluorescence—NBD-PA and NBD-PG are acyl-modified lipid probes that can be incorporated into the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1). The NBD fluorophore on the amphiphilic NBD-labeled PA or PG is sensitive to the polarity of the environment (32Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Changes in its fluorescent properties such as intensity and anisotropy were used to monitor the interaction of α-synuclein with lipid vesicles. Fig. 3 shows an increase in both fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of NBD-labeled PA/PC SUVs upon the addition of either soluble or fibrillar α-synuclein. The fluorescence undergoes a marked linear increase in both intensity and anisotropy with increasing concentrations of fibrillar α-synuclein. This effect is much greater with fibrillar α-synuclein compared with soluble α-synuclein monomer. The anisotropy reached a constant value within 3 min with fibrils, whereas the soluble monomer required 10 min. Because of the low concentration of α-synuclein and the short time of incubation, there will be negligible oligomers present, so the latter ob"

The mechanisms that control the specification of these two structures during lung development are currently unknown. Here we show that β-catenin signaling is required for the formation of the distal, but not the proximal, airways. When the gene for β-catenin was conditionally excised in epithelial cells of the developing mouse lung prior to embryonic day 14.5, the proximal lung tubules grew and differentiated appropriately. The mice, however, died at birth because of respiratory failure. Analysis of the lungs by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, using molecular markers of the epithelial and mesenchymal components of both proximal and peripheral airways, showed that the lungs were composed primarily of proximal airways. These observations establish, for the first time, both the sites and timing of specification of the proximal and peripheral airways in the developing lung, and that β-catenin is one of the essential components of this specification.

Lung morphogenesis depends upon precise regulation of reciprocal interactions between the endodermally derived respiratory epithelium and the surrounding lung mesenchyme. The primordial lung buds, derived from the foregut endoderm, invade the splanchnic mesenchyme at approximately embryonic (E) 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic; Fgf, fibroblast growth factor; Shh, sonic hedgehog; Bmp4, bone morphogenetic protein 4; Vegf, vascular endothelial growth factor; Titf1 and TTF-1, thyroid transcription factor 1 gene and protein, respectively; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; Fzd, Frizzled; CRE, Cre recombinase; SP-C, surfactant protein C; CCSP, Clara cell secretory protein; rtTA, reverse tetracycline transactivator; +, wild-type; tg, transgene; flx, floxed; PECAM, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (10:1); SP-A, surfactant protein A; SP-B, surfactant protein B; lox, loxP; FgfR2IIIb, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2IIIb. 9 to E9.5 in the developing mouse embryo. During the embryonic stage of development (E9.5 to E11.0), the buds undergo stereotypic branching to form the main stem and lobar bronchi. Extensive branching and budding of the airways continues throughout the pseudoglandular stage (E11.5 to E16.5), during which the intrapulmonary conducting airways and peripheral lung are formed. With advancing gestation, cytodifferentiation of distinct respiratory epithelial cell types occurs, producing the various cells lining the conducting (basal, ciliated, non-ciliated columnar, and neuroendocrine cells) and peripheral (alveolar Type I and Type II cells) airways. During the canalicular and saccular stages of lung development (E16.5 to E17.5 and E17.5 to postnatal day 4, respectively), the acinar tubules dilate into terminal alveolar saccules and the mesenchyme thins in association with formation of an extensive capillary network, forming the gas exchange region required for respiration after birth (1Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, formation of the lung is dependent upon precise temporal and spatial control of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, processes that are mediated by complex reciprocal interactions between cell types. Numerous signaling and transcriptional pathways, including those associated with fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), sonic hedgehog (Shh), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), vascular endothelial growth factors (Vegfs), thyroid transcription factor 1 (Titf1), and Wnts have been implicated in these interactions during lung morphogenesis (2Shiratori M.

The β-catenin gene encodes a 781-amino acid protein that regulates developmental processes mediating cell adhesion and gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 11Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). β-Catenin serves multiple roles in the maintenance of cell architecture, binding directly to the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin while simultaneously binding to α-catenin, a protein linked to actin filaments. β-Catenin also acts in complex intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene transcription via members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of high mobility group domain-containing, DNA-binding proteins. The WNT/β-catenin signal transduction pathway controls a variety of biological processes, including embryonic patterning, development of the nervous system, and stem cell proliferation in Drosophila (reviewed in Ref. 13Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), as well as dorsal mesoderm induction and axis specification in Xenopus (14Heasman J. Crawford A.

In the mouse embryo, targeted mutagenesis of the β-catenin gene resulted in defects in anterior/posterior axis formation, as well as loss of mesoderm and head structures. Intercellular junctions were maintained in the β-catenin-targeted embryos by plakoglobin (also known as γ-catenin), which substituted for β-catenin in cell adhesion but not in transcriptional signaling (15Huelsken J.

The Wnt gene family encodes secreted glycoproteins that interact via seven transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled gene (Fzd) family. In the mouse, at least 19 Wnt genes and 10 Fzd genes have been identified (Wnt gene Homepage). 2www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html. WNT proteins signal through several potential signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 16Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In the WNT/β-catenin pathway, specific WNT proteins interact with specific Fzd receptors, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. Hypophosphorylated β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, is translocated to the nucleus, and interacts with members of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family to become components of a transcription complex that regulates the expression of downstream target genes (reviewed in Refs. 13Wodarz A.

Dev. 2001; 109: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the potential role of β-catenin in lung morphogenesis has not been determined. Because deletion of β-catenin is lethal before the initiation of lung development in the mouse embryo, a doxycycline-induced, Cre recombinase (CRE)-mediated, homologous recombination strategy was utilized to specifically eliminate β-catenin expression in epithelial cells of the embryonic mouse lung. Transgenic Mice—Floxed β-catenin mice were previously generated by inserting loxP sites into introns flanking exons 3 and 6 (22Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination between loxP sites was accomplished utilizing the (tetO)7 -CMV-Cre transgene (23Sauer B. Methods. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). For lung-specific, doxycycline-induced recombination, the surfactant protein C/reverse tetracycline transactivator (SP-C-rtTA) or Clara cell secretory protein/reverse tetracycline transactivator (CCSP-rtTA) transgenes were used. In this system, continuous administration of doxycycline to the dam initiates recombination of floxed alleles prior to lung bud formation, targeting most peripheral airways as well as subsets of tracheobronchial epithelial cells (24Perl A.K. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Perl A.K. Wert S.E. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3.7-kilobase (kb) human SP-C promoter is expressed selectively in pulmonary epithelial cells in the embryonic lung and in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells after birth (26Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The 2.3-kb rat CCSP promoter is first expressed at E14.5-E15 in epithelial cells lining the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, as well as subsets of Type II cells later in development (27Stripp B.R.

Compound mutant animals (SP-C-rtTA +/tg, (tetO) 7-CMV-Cre +/tg or tg/ tg, β-catenin flx/flx or CCSP +/tg or tg/tg, (tetO) 7-CMV-Cre +/tg or tg/tg, β-catenin flx/flx) were generated by breeding. Littermates of all other genotypes served as controls. Staging of embryos was based on the day of detection of a vaginal plug, which was then designated as embryonic day E0.5. Pregnant females were maintained on doxycycline-containing food (625 mg/kg; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and water (0.8 mg/ml; Sigma) from E0.5 until the time of sacrifice. Litters were maintained on doxcycline-containing food after weaning. Mice were genotyped by PCR for the β-catenin alleles, as well as for the SP-C-rtTA and CCSP-rtTA transgenes, as previously described (22Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W.

CRE forward (5′-TGCCACGACCAAGTGACAGCAATG-3′) and reverse (5′-AGAGACGGAAATCCATCGCTCG-3′) primers were used to genotype mice for the (tetO) 7 -CMV-Cre transgene. PCR parameters used were: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. Mice used in this study were housed and maintained in pathogen-free conditions according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation. Pregnant dams were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine, acepromazine, and xylazine, and then exsanguinated by severing the inferior vena cava and descending aorta. Fetuses were removed, the chest cavity opened, and the tissue fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The lungs of postnatal mice were inflation fixed as previously described (29Wert S.E. Yoshida M.

Immunohistochemistry—At least three to five compound mutant animals and littermate controls at E13.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5 were analyzed for each immunohistochemical stain. Antibodies used were generated to: pro-SP-C (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, AB3428, Chemicon), CCSP (1:7500, rabbit polyclonal, kindly provided by Dr. Barry Stripp, University of Pittsburgh), β-tubulin IV (1:200, mouse monoclonal, MU178C, Biogenex), FOXj1 (1:4000, rabbit polyclonal, kindly provided by Dr. Robert Costa, University of Illinois), calcitonin gene-related protein (1:4000, rabbit anti-rat polyclonal, Sigma), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) (1:500, rat polyclonal, clone CD31, BD Pharmigen), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (1:20000, mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Sigma). Biotinylated secondary antibodies and a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) were used to localize the antibody-antigen complexes in the tissues, as previously described (30Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A mouse-on-mouse blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was used with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies. Antigen detection was enhanced with nickel-diaminobenzidine and Tris-cobalt, followed by counterstaining with Nuclear Fast Red. For β-catenin immunostaining, a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:50, clone 14, BD Biosciences) was used. Unmasking was performed using an antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Primary antibody was incubated with sections overnight at room temperature, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary antibody (1:200, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) was added to the sections and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, slides were developed using a commercially available kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). No counterstaining was used. To detect mitotic cells, pregnant dams were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd labeling reagent, 100 μl per 10 g of body weight (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Fetuses were harvested 2 h after injection. Paraffin-embedded tissues were stained for BrdUrd incorporation using the Zymed BrdUrd staining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed using [35S]UTP or -CTP-labeled riboprobes for SP-A (a 850-bp mouse cDNA) (31Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciralol P.J. Whitsett J.A.

In situ hybridizations were performed at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5 as previously described (26Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Lung whole mount in situ hybridization was performed at E13.5 as previously described (34Wilkinson D. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization of Vertebrate Embryos. IRL Press, New York1992Google Scholar), using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for Titf1 (a 2.2-kb mouse cDNA from the Whitsett laboratory), Bmp4 (a 1.55-kb mouse cDNA, a gift from Dr. Brigid Hogan, Duke University), Shh (a 642-bp mouse cDNA, a gift from Dr. Andrew McMahon, Harvard University), and Fgf10 (a 743-bp mouse cDNA, a gift from Dr. Nobuyuki Itoh, Kyoto University). Compound Mutant Mice—CCSP +/tg or tg, (tetO)7 -CMVCre +/tg or tg/tg, β-catenin flx/flx, and SP-C +/tg, (tetO)7 -CMVCre +/tg or tg/tg, β-catenin flx/flx (termed compound mutant mice) were generated by breeding CCSP tg/tg, (tetO)7 -CMV-Cre tg/tg or SP-C +/tg, (tetO)7 -CMV-Cre tg/tg mice to β-catenin lox/lox mice. The strategy used for the doxycycline-induced CRE/loxP system is outlined in Fig. 1. The reverse tetracycline transactivator gene (rtTA) was expressed using the 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter or the 2.3-kb rat CCSP promoter (latter not shown). In the presence of doxycycline, the rtTA protein binds to the (tetO)7-CMV promoter, thus activating the expression of the CRE protein, which recognizes loxP sites, causing recombination and deletion of genomic sequences including exons 3-6 of the β-catenin gene. Deletion of β-Catenin Causes Lung Malformations—All SP-C compound mutant mice that had been maintained on doxycycline from E0.5 died of respiratory failure at birth. While lobulation were normal, pulmonary malformations consisting of multiple, enlarged and elongated bronchiolar tubules (Figs. 2, B, D, F, and H) and little to no formation of peripheral terminal alveolar saccules were observed in comparison to littermate controls (Fig. 2, A, C, E, and G). The enlarged bronchiolar tubules were lined primarily by pseudostratified columnar epithelium (Fig. 2H) or simple columnar epithelium with features typical of conducting airways (Fig. 2G). Dilated terminal structures were lined with columnar or cuboidal cells, and squamous cell differentiation was not observed. The lack of peripheral respiratory structures was consistent with respiratory failure in these mice. Abnormally enlarged and elongated bronchial tubules were detected as early as E13.5. In contrast, CCSP compound mutant mice maintained on doxycycline survived birth and did not exhibit altered lung structure or function, although β-catenin immunostaining was absent in most epithelial cells of the conducting airways (data not shown). Deletion of β-Catenin Proximalizes the Embryonic Lung—β-Catenin was detected in lateral cell membranes and less frequently in nuclei of epithelial cells lining trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and peripheral acinar/alveolar structures in the control embryos (Figs. 3, A, C, and E). Nuclear staining was most prominent in epithelial cells lining the more peripheral lung tubules, and was not frequently observed in larger conducting airways (Fig. 3G and data not shown). In compound mutant littermates, immunostaining for β-catenin was decreased or absent in the atypical bronchioles of the mutant lungs (Fig. 3, B, D, F, and H). β-Catenin was generally absent in epithelial cell lining of many of the atypical bronchiolar-like tubules characteristic of the mutant mice. Variability in the extent and sites of deletion of β-catenin in the pulmonary epithelium was observed at all ages analyzed (E13.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5) (data not shown). β-Catenin was not deleted in the pulmonary mesenchyme, consistent with the use of epithelial-specific promoters used to drive rtTA expression. These results were confirmed by in situ hybridization analysis for β-catenin expression (data not shown). In the control littermates at E18.5, CCSP immunostaining was detected in the bronchi and bronchioles of conducting airways, but not in the peripheral acinar tubules and buds (Fig. 4A). In the lungs of SP-C compound mutant animals, a dramatic increase in CCSP positive cells was observed, consistent with the increased formation of bronchiolar tubules (Fig. 4B). Likewise, FOXj1 and β-tubulin IV, both markers of ciliated cells that are normally restricted to the conducting airways (Fig. 4, C and E), were detected in the atypical bronchiolar tubules (Fig. 4, D and F). Pro-SP-C immunostaining was detected in alveolar Type II epithelial cells in the lungs of control fetuses at E18.5 (Fig. 4G). In SP-C compound mutant mice, proSP-C staining was nearly absent, being detected in a limited number of cells in the peripheral lung (Fig. 4H). In contrast, no differences in CCSP or proSP-C immunostaining staining were detected in CCSP compound mutant mice and control littermates at E18.5 (data not shown). Immunostaining for calcitonin gene-related protein, a marker for neuroepithelial cells found in bronchial/bronchiolar tubules, was present but the number of stained cells was reduced in the bronchiolar epithelium of SP-C compound mutant mice in comparison to littermate controls at E18.5 (data not shown). In situ hybridization analysis for the surfactant proteins and VegfA further confirmed the loss of alveolar structures in the SP-C compound mutant lungs at E18.5. In the lungs of control mice, SP-A, SP-C, and VegfA are normally expressed in alveolar Type II cells, whereas SP-B is expressed in epithelial cells of both the conducting airway and gas exchange region (Figs. 5, A, C, E, and G). In SP-C compound mutant mice, the sites of SP-A, SP-C, and VegfA expression were reduced (Fig. 5B, F, and H) and, in some cases, absent (data not shown). In contrast SP-B mRNA was expressed in the bronchiolar and residual alveolar saccules, consistent with its expression in both conducting and peripheral airways of the normal lung (Fig. 5D). Deletion of β-Catenin Disrupts Peripheral Vasculogenesis—While PECAM immunostaining was extensive in the peripheral regions of the normal lung at E18.5 (Fig. 6A), staining was markedly reduced in the SP-C compound mutant mice, indicating decreased peripheral vessel formation (Fig. 6B). Immunostaining for α-SMA, which is normally detected in myofibroblasts surrounding the conducting airways (Fig. 6C), was detected in the stroma surrounding the atypical bronchiolar tubules in the β-catenin compound mutant mice (Fig. 6D). Titf1, Bmp4, Shh, Fgf10, and Pod1 Expression Is Unaltered in Compound Mutant Lungs—Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis for Titf1, Bmp4, Shh, and Fgf10 mRNAs was performed at E13.5. Titf1 is normally expressed in epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchial tubules at E13.5 (Fig. 7A) and is required for formation of the peripheral lung (35Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Although Titf1 expression was detected in the bronchial tubules of the SP-C compound mutant lung at E13.5, the number of tubules was reduced, indicating a defect in branching morphogenesis (Fig. 7B). The tips of the bronchiolar tubules were enlarged and poorly branched. Likewise, Bmp4 and Shh mRNAs were detected in distal lung epithelial cells of control and compound mutant embryos (Fig. 7, C-F). Fgf10, normally expressed in the mesenchyme near the tips of lung buds at E13.5 (Fig. 7G), was also still present at the tips of the bronchiolar tubules after deletion of β-catenin (Fig. 7H). Expression of Pod1, a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was detected in the pulmonary mesenchyme of both compound mutant and control animals at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5 by in situ hybridization of lung sections (data not shown). Cell Proliferation Is Unchanged but Nuclear Fragmentation Is Increased in Compound Mutant Lungs—Cell proliferation indices were estimated after BrdUrd injection of the dam prior to sacrifice at E14.5 and E18.5. BrdUrd labeling indices in the bronchiolar epithelium were unchanged in SP-C compound mutant mice in comparison to littermate controls (Fig. 8, A-D). Nuclear fragmentation was observed in the lung mesenchyme of compound mutant animals at E14.5, consistent with apoptosis. The number of fragmented nuclei in the lung mesenchyme was increased from 0.24 fragmented nuclei per lobe (n = 17) in control animals (Fig. 8E) to 14.5 fragmented nuclei per lobe (n = 12) in SP-C compound mutants (Fig. 8F). Nuclear fragmentation was not observed in epithelial cells in control or compound mutant mice. In addition, there was no evidence of necrosis or inflammation in the lungs of compound mutant mice at any gestational age examined. Deletion of β-catenin in epithelial cells of the embryonic lung disrupted lung morphogenesis, restricting formation and differentiation of the peripheral lung and enhancing formation of the conducting airways. While the correct number of main stem bronchi and pulmonary lobes formed in the floxed β-catenin mutant mice, branching of secondary bronchi was altered and the number of small peripheral acinar tubules and terminal saccules was markedly reduced. The atypical bronchiolar tubules found in these mice were lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium that expressed SP-B and stained positive for CCSP, β-tubulin IV, and FOXj1, but lacked proSP-C immunostaining and VegfA mRNA expression. These bronchiolar tubules often extended to the pleural surfaces. Tubular diameter was increased and small terminal bronchioles and acinar structures failed to form, resulting in a marked reduction of peripheral alveolar ducts and saccules. The stroma surrounding the atypical bronchiolar tubules stained for α-smooth muscle actin, whereas PECAM staining (a marker of alveolar capillaries) was reduced, consistent with the proximalization of the mesenchyme surrounding the tubules. In the normal lung, nuclear staining for β-catenin was detected most frequently in epithelial cells of the peripheral lung structures at E13.5 to E16.5. In contrast, β-catenin was detected primarily in cell membranes in the more proximal conducting airway tubules during these stages of development. Deletion of β-catenin from E14.5 to E15.5 and thereafter, with the CCSP-rtTA compound mice, did not alter lung structure or postnatal survival. Taken together, β-catenin expression in the respiratory epithelium of the embryonic lung is required for the growth and differentiation of peripheral epithelial cell progenitors. The SP-C-rtTA conditional system utilized to delete β-catenin is active primarily in progenitor cells of the peripheral lung, but is not highly active in the trachea or main stem bronchi. The timing and extent of recombination with the SP-C-rtTA/tetO-Cre system has been previously documented, utilizing floxed lacZ alleles to activate alkaline phosphatase or green fluorescent protein (25Perl A.K.

When maintained on doxycycline, recombination in this system was widespread, and often complete, occurring before the formation of proximal lung buds on E9.0. Recombination extended to subsets of bronchial and lower tracheal epithelial cells in a pattern established by E10.5 to E12.5. In contrast, expression of CCSP-rtTA in respiratory epithelial cells was first detected at E14.5-E15.5, which caused widespread recombination in the conducting airways when dams were continuously treated with doxycycline (Ref. 24Perl A.K. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, and data not shown). The sites and extent of deletion of β-catenin, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, were consistent with the activities of the SP-C and CCSP promoter elements used to express the rtTA protein. In the present studies, β-catenin was deleted in subsets of cells forming the peripheral lung early in lung morphogenesis. Nevertheless, because branching of the main stem bronchi and lobe formation was not perturbed in the SP-C compound mutant mice, β-catenin does not appear to be required for initial bronchial branching. Because branching morphogenesis and budding after E11.5 to E12.0 normally resu"

https://openalex.org/W2120988516,"Maintaining electron flow through the photosynthetic apparatus, even in the absence of a sufficient amount of NADP+ as an electron acceptor, is essential for chloroplast protection from photooxidative stress. At least two different pathways are thought to participate in this process, i.e. cyclic electron flow and the water-water cycle. Although the function of the water-water cycle was inferred from a number of biochemical and physiological studies, genetic evidence for the function of this cycle is very limited. Here we show that knockdown Arabidopsis plants with suppressed expression of the key water-water cycle enzyme, thylakoid-attached copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (KD-SOD), are suppressed in their growth and development. Chloroplast size, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic activity were also reduced in KD-SOD plants. Microarray analysis of KD-SOD plants, grown under controlled conditions, revealed changes in transcript expression consistent with an acclimation response to light stress. Although a number of transcripts involved in the defense of plants from oxidative stress were induced in KD-SOD plants, and seedlings of KD-SOD plants were more tolerant to oxidative stress, these mechanisms were unable to compensate for the suppression of the water-water cycle in mature leaves. Thus, the localization of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase at the vicinity of photosystem I may be essential for its function. Our studies provide genetic evidence for the importance of the water-water cycle in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants from photooxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W1993544825,"Reelin is a large secreted signaling protein that binds to two members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and the very low density lipoprotein receptor, and regulates neuronal positioning during brain development. Reelin signaling requires activation of Src family kinases as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1). This results in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the serine/threonine kinase Akt, and the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, a protein that is implicated in the regulation of axonal transport. Here we demonstrate that PI3K activation by Reelin requires Src family kinase activity and depends on the Reelin-triggered interaction of Dab1 with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α. Because the Dab1 phosphotyrosine binding domain can interact simultaneously with membrane lipids and with the intracellular domains of apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very low density lipoprotein receptor, Dab1 is preferentially recruited to the neuronal plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated. Efficient Dab1 phosphorylation and activation of the Reelin signaling cascade is impaired by cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane.

Mice that lack either reelin, dab1, or apoer2 and vldlr display the typical reeler phenotype, which is characterized by inversion of cortical layers, cerebellar dysplasia, and ataxia. We have recently reported that Reelin activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) in neurons, leading to activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, a major kinase for the microtubule-associated protein tau. Reelin-dependent activation of this signaling pathway is apoE receptor-dependent and requires Dab1 (9Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H. Reyna H. Brady S.T. Herz J. J. Biol.

These membrane lipids function as second messengers and also mediate the recruitment of adaptor and scaffolding proteins to specific membrane compartments. PI3K signaling, thus, participates in diverse cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, differentiation, cell motility, membrane trafficking, endocytosis, metabolic regulation, and neoplastic transformation (for reviews, see Refs. 10Cantley L.C.

Only class 1 PI3 kinases are sensitive to the widely used inhibitors wortmannin and LY2944002, which inhibit the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and, thus, prevent the PI3K-dependent activation of Akt. Class 1 PI3Ks are heterodimers of the p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. The latter are multidomain proteins that exist in several isoforms, of which p85α is the longest one. Binding of the regulatory subunit to activating membrane-associated proteins, such as insulin-regulated substrate 1 (IRS1), frequently occurs at phosphorylated tyrosine residues (for review, see Ref. 13Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar).

Dab1, like IRS1, is a PTB domain protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to an extracellular signal and binds to NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of several transmembrane proteins (for review, see Ref. 4Herz J. Bock H.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These similarities prompted us to examine whether Dab1 is directly involved in the Reelin-mediated PI3K activation. We also investigated the role of PIs in Dab1 membrane targeting and Reelin signaling. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate has been reported to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization through accumulation in cholesterol-rich plasma membrane compartments called rafts or caveolae (for reviews, see Refs. 19Caroni P.

Here we show that activation of PI3K in neurons is regulated by a Reelin-dependent interaction of phosphorylated Dab1 with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α. We show that the Dab1-containing Reelin signaling complex is associated with the plasma membrane and that the signaling can be modulated by cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that PI3K activity is required for formation of a normal cortical plate in an in vitro cortical slice migration assay.

Primary Rat Embryonic Neuron Culture—All animal experiments were conducted according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Primary forebrain neurons were prepared from E18-20 embryos as described (8Bock H.H. Herz J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and cultured at ∼ 1 million cells/cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated cell culture dishes in a defined serum-free medium (Neurobasal, 2% B-27 supplement, 1 mm glutamine, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Between culture days 4 and 6 primary neurons were treated with partially purified Reelin or control-conditioned serum-free medium for the indicated times as described (8Bock H.H. Herz J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cultured Neurons with Inhibitors, Cholesterol Depletion, and Filipin Stain—Neurons were incubated with various inhibitor compounds for 60 min at a final concentration of Me2SO in the culture medium of ≤0.1% (v/v) without any detectable adverse effect. For cholesterol depletion experiments, neurons were treated with 5 mm MβCD or with 5 mm MβCD preloaded with cholesterol (final cholesterol concentration, 100 μg/ml). For detection of free cholesterol, neurons were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 50 μg/ml filipin for 30 min, washed 3 times with PBS, mounted using the Pro-Long antifade kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (excitation at 360 nm). Cellular Fractionation of Primary Embryonic Neurons—After stimulation, neurons were harvested in ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails), subjected to a pressure of 500 p.s.i. for 15 min, and forced through a small hole by slowly releasing the pressure. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, and the postnuclear supernatants were separated into membrane and soluble fractions by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. Membrane fractions were resuspended in Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (50 mm, 0.15 m NaCl, with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails) containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated at room temperature, and homogenized by repeatedly forcing them through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the protein contents of solubilized membrane and soluble fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible assay. Denatured and reduced samples were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis (15 μg of protein/lane) and analyzed by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Control or Reelin-treated neurons were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). The neurons were homogenized by forcing through a 27-gauge needle and incubated on ice for 30-60 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. 800-1000 μg of protein were mixed with 4 μg of the indicated IgG or 10 μl of antiserum in a total volume of 1 ml and incubated on ice for 1 h. Immune complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (for rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose (for mouse monoclonal antibodies) slurry. Pelleted beads were washed once with immunoprecipitation buffer, then three times with washing buffer (immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100), resuspended in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer, reduced with β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and boiled. Approximately 5% of the total immunoprecipitate was used to detect the respective immunoprecipitated protein; the rest was used to detect co-precipitated proteins by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Neuronal lysates were harvested in 16 μl/cm2 surface area of ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v), Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C and 20,000 × g for 20 min, adjusted for protein content, mixed with 4× concentrated gel-loading buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis (10 μg of protein/lane), and transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 and 4% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies diluted in blocking buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Bound IgG was detected by ECL (Pierce). Embryonic Slice Culture Assay—Entire fetal brains at E13.5 were embedded in 4% low melting agarose (prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hanks' F-12 medium with glutamine, glucose, and HEPES, from BioWhittaker) and glued on a vibratome support using cyanoacrylate. 3000-μm-thick coronal sections were cut, and a slice was processed for histology immediately after sectioning to verify the developmental status before culture. Sections were cultured on collagen-coated polytetrafluoroethylene membranes (Transwell-COL, Costar cat. 3494) in 12-well plates, and 1.5 ml of medium was added to a level just covering the section. Cultures were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with B-27 (1/50), G-5 (1/100), penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days in the absence or presence of 50 μm LY294002. Slices were fixed in Bouin's fixative for 2 h before embedding in paraplast, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin/eosin. Activation of PI3 Kinase by Reelin Requires SFK Activity—Activation of SFKs and PI3K in neurons in response to Reelin requires Dab1 and the apoE receptors VLDLR and apoER2. To determine the order in which SFKs and PI3K are activated by Reelin we used kinase inhibitors on cultured primary embryonic neurons (Fig. 1). The SFK inhibitor PP2 blocked not only the Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation and SFK activation but also the activation of PI3K by Reelin, as determined with an antibody directed against activated Akt (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Because PP2 can also inhibit c-Abl and c-Kit, we used the inhibitor STI571 to block these kinases without affecting SFK activity (for review, see Ref. 31Buchdunger E. O'Reilly T. Wood J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 528-536Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This had no effect on PI3K activation by Reelin (Fig. 1A, lane 6). By contrast, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin had no effect on the activation of SFKs by Reelin, as detected with an antibody directed against a tyrosine-phosphorylated epitope in the activation loop (α-pY418), whereas Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 was completely blocked (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8). Thus, SFK activation precedes PI3K activation by Reelin. Potential Mechanisms Leading to Reelin-induced PI3K Activation—Ligand-induced PI3K activation often involves binding of the SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit p85α (Fig. 2A) to phosphotyrosine motifs in growth factor receptor tails or adaptor proteins. Using web-based algorithms (scansite.mit.edu and www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) for detecting sequence motifs that mediate binding to protein interaction domains, we identified conserved putative SH2 domain binding motifs in Dab1 (Fig. 2B) that include Tyr-198 and Tyr-220. These amino acids are specifically phosphorylated in response to Reelin stimulation. The NetPhos algorithm (29Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) correctly predicts the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated residues (6Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Keshvara L. Benhayon D. Magdaleno S. Curran T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16008-16014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in the cluster of five tyrosine residues located immediately C-terminal of the Dab1 PTB domain (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of the potential site involving Tyr-300 has so far not been detected experimentally (6Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). An alternative mode of interaction between Dab1 and p85α could involve an SH3 domain interaction with proline-rich sequences within Dab1. Such a predicted site surrounds Pro-424. Conceivably, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-198 and Tyr-220 might induce a conformational change exposing this site. p85α would be unlikely to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domains of apoER2 and VLDLR. Although NetPhos identifies the NPXY motif as a likely interaction site for PTB domains, the other tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of apoER2 and VLDLR are not predicted to be in the proper sequence context where they could mediate SH2 domain interactions with p85α (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this prediction, we were unable to find any indication of tyrosine phosphorylation of apoER2 in immunoprecipitates from Reelin-treated neuronal lysates (Fig. 3A). However, a small amount of a phosphoprotein that comigrates with Dab1 was co-precipitated with apoER2 from Reelin-treated neuronal lysates and likely corresponds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Reelin Does Not Cause Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the PI3K Subunits—SFK-dependent phosphorylation of the PI3K subunit p85α can activate PI3 kinase by relieving inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. We, therefore, tested if Reelin, which activates SFKs in neurons, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α. Neuronal lysates were immunoprecipitated with a p85α antibody, and the precipitates were immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). The tyrosine-phosphorylated 85-kDa protein that is detected in the Reelin-induced lysate (lane 2) corresponds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 (p-Dab1; see also Fig. 3C). Although p85α is no longer detectable in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation with an α-p85α antibody, the 85-kDa phosphoprotein was not depleted by the p85α immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B, lane 4), and no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p85α was detected (lanes 5 and 6). The weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated precipitated protein band at ∼85 kDa (lane 6) likely is phosphorylated Dab1 (see next paragraph). The strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated band at ∼ 110 kDa (top panel) corresponds to the catalytic PI3K subunit, which co-precipitates constitutively with p85α. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of p110 were also not affected by Reelin treatment. These results suggest that modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3K itself is not a major regulatory mechanism for Reelin-induced PI3K activation in neurons. Reelin Induces Interaction of Dab1 and p85α in Neurons—A common mechanism of ligand-induced PI3K activation involves recruitment of p85α to autophosphorylated receptor kinases or their substrates, resulting in disinhibition of the p85α-bound catalytic subunit p110. Because SFK inhibition blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 and PI3K activation by Reelin (Fig. 1A), we hypothesized that Reelin might trigger the recruitment of p85α to p-Dab1. To test this, we immunoprecipitated Dab1 protein from lysates of control and Reelin-treated primary neuronal cultures and tested for the presence of p85α in the precipitated immune complexes. As shown in Fig. 3C, total Dab1 protein and p-Dab1 were immunodepleted from the immunoprecipitation supernatants (lanes 3 and 4), and p85α indeed co-immunoprecipitated with Dab1 in a manner that correlated with the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 (lanes 6 and 7). No p85α was immunoprecipitated from a Reelin-treated sample with a control antiserum (lane 8) or from lysates in which Dab1 phosphorylation by Reelin had been blocked by the SFK inhibitor PP2 (lane 11). These data suggest that Reelin induces the recruitment of p85α into a complex with Dab1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. The converse experiment, in which Dab1 was co-precipitated with an α-p85α antibody in a Reelin-dependent manner supports this conclusion (Fig. 3D). Dab1 was detected only in p85α immunoprecipitates from Reelin-treated neuronal lysates (lane 4) but not from control-treated lysates (lane 3), lysates immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant immunoglobulin (lane 5), or lysates from Reelin-treated cells in which SFKs, and thus, Dab1 phosphorylation had been inhibited with PP2 (lane 11). Neither Fyn (Fig. 3C, lane 6 and 7) nor Src (not shown) could be detected in Dab1 immunoprecipitates from control (lane 6) or Reelin-treated (lane 7) neuronal lysates. This suggests that the interaction between SFKs and p-Dab1 that has been observed in vitro and in transfected cell lines (33Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and which involves the SFK-SH2 domain is either transient under these conditions or mutually exclusive and weaker than the p85α-Dab1 interaction. We found the latter to be stable even in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl or 60 mm octyl-glucopyranoside, a detergent that disrupts cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane (data not shown). Activation of the Reelin Signaling Cascade Occurs at the Plasma Membrane—The Dab1 PTB domain can mediate simultaneous interaction of the protein with the NPXY motif of apoE receptor cytoplasmic domains and with PIs at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (34Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The affinity of the Dab1 PTB domain for PIs might be important for increasing the apparent affinity for the NPXY motifs in the Reelin receptor tails, which on their own have a relatively low affinity for the Dab1 PTB domain in the micromolar range. The PI interaction might also serve to direct Dab1 into PI-rich specialized membrane compartments such as caveolae and rafts. To investigate whether other known components of the Reelin signaling pathway are recruited into this membrane-associated complex, we separated postnuclear supernatants of control (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3) and Reelin-treated neurons (lanes 2 and 4) into membrane (lanes 1 and 2) and cytosolic (lanes 3 and 4) fractions. The distribution of several components of the Reelin signaling cascade between these fractions was then examined by immunoblotting. Dab1, its major physiological kinase Fyn, and the Reelin receptor apoER2 were found predominantly in the membrane fraction. By contrast, Akt was restricted almost completely to the cytosolic fraction, whereas p85α and Cdk5, a neuronal serine/threonine kinase that can also phosphorylate Dab1, were present in both fractions. The phosphorylation state of the proteins (p-Dab1, SFK-(Tyr(P)-418) and Ser(P)-473-Akt) did not affect their subcellular distribution. In particular, no significant redistribution of p85α to the membrane compartment in response to Reelin treatment was observed. It cannot be ruled out, however, that changes in the subcellular localization of a small but nevertheless important subfraction of a protein might escape detection at this level of sensitivity. Indeed, only ∼ 5% of the total p85α pool associate with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor upon ligand stimulation (35Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

In repair of the N-alkylated purine base lesion, for example, alkyl adenine DNA glycosylase (Aag) recognizes and removes the base, and DNA polymerase β (β-pol) contributes the gap tailoring and DNA synthesis steps. It is the loss of β-pol-mediated 5′-deoxyribose phosphate removal that renders mouse fibroblasts alkylation-hypersensitive. Here we report that the hypersensitivity of β-pol-deficient cells after methyl methanesulfonate-induced alkylation damage is wholly dependent upon glycosylase-mediated initiation of repair, indicating that alkylated base lesions themselves are tolerated in these cells and demonstrate that β-pol protects against accumulation of toxic BER intermediates. Further, we find that these intermediates are initially tolerated in vivo by a second repair pathway, homologous recombination, inducing an increase in sister chromatid exchange events. If left unresolved, these BER intermediates trigger a rapid block in DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, both the cytotoxic and genotoxic signals are independent of both the p53 response and mismatch DNA repair pathways, demonstrating that p53 is not required for a functional BER pathway, that the observed damage response is not part of the p53 response network, and that the BER intermediate-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic effects are distinct from the mechanism engaged in response to mismatch repair signaling. These studies demonstrate that, although base damage is repaired by the BER pathway, incomplete BER intermediates are shuttled into the homologous recombination pathway, suggesting possible coordination between BER and the recombination machinery.

Cancer, or tumor development, is generally the result of one or more genetic changes in critical growth or cellular maintenance genes. Such changes may be inherited or may occur from environmental exposure (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar, 2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). In many cases, these genetic changes induce a “mutator” phenotype due to sequence changes in DNA repair or DNA damage checkpoint genes, among others (3Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of maintaining the structural and informational integrity of the genome is further highlighted by the plethora of DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint pathways (2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is important to understand the diverse cellular systems for DNA damage repair available for protection from an enormous array of DNA lesions (4Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar).

Such DNA damage can be caused by exposure to environmental agents or by normal cellular metabolic processes that produce alkylating molecules, reactive oxygen species, and other reactive metabolites capable of modifying DNA. In the mammalian BER pathway, the damaged base residue is removed by a lesion-specific DNA glycosylase. Subsequently, the resulting abasic site is recognized by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APendo), which incises the damaged strand, leaving a single-nucleotide gap with 3′-OH and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (5′-dRP) groups at the margins. A DNA polymerase β (β-pol)-mediated DNA synthesis step extends from the 3′-OH (7Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

DNA ligase I or a complex of DNA ligase III and x-ray cross-complementing factor 1 conducts the final, nick sealing, step in the pathway. In addition, several proteins have been observed to form functional partnerships with these BER proteins, including p53, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p300, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (15Lavrik O.I.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with a homozygous null mutation in the β-pol gene are nonviable after birth, thereby preventing studies on the in vivo function of β-pol (20Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). However, we utilized β-pol (+/–) mice to establish embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines homozygous for a null mutation in the β-pol gene (21Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). β-pol (–/–) cells are normal in viability and growth characteristics but are more sensitive to monofunctional alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) than wild type cells (21Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). β-pol possesses both polymerase and 5′-dRP lyase activity, but we found previously that only the 5′-dRP lyase activity of β-pol is essential for resistance to MMS and that β-pol appears to be the major, if not only, protein capable of efficiently removing 5′-dRP groups formed as BER intermediates (22Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, these earlier studies did not determine the source of these repair intermediates, and it was not yet determined if the 5′-dRP groups were formed as a result of BER initiation by a lesion-specific glycosylase. Further, no study to date has begun to unravel the mechanism of cytoxicity induced by the BER intermediate 5′-dRP. In this report, we describe the development and characterization of a series of single and double knockout cell lines and mouse models to detail the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of both alkylated base lesions and the resultant BER intermediate 5′-dRP. We show that 5′-dRP formation (the lethal lesion causing the MMS-sensitive phenotype of β-pol (–/–) cells) is critically dependent on the alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag), known to remove 3-methyladenine (3-MeA), 7-methylguanine, and other alkylated bases from DNA. Surprisingly, the unrepaired N-alkylated purine base lesions are well tolerated in these cells. Interestingly, our results suggest that BER intermediates are associated with an increase in homologous recombination and eventually trigger a block in DNA synthesis. Both the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in these cells are independent of p53 and the mismatch DNA repair pathway. These studies suggest a possible coordination between BER and the recombination machinery.

Extracts were incubated in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 330 nm [α-32P]dCTP, and 100 nm double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single uracil (U) residue: 5′-GCC CTG CAG GTC GAU TCT AGA GGA TCC CCG GGT AC-3′. The reaction was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 16% polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea, TBE). Gels were fixed, dried and autoradiographed.

The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea, TBE). Gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Cytotoxicity Assays—Cytotoxicity was determined by growth inhibition assays as described previously (22Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to the DNA-damaging agent, MMS or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 24 h after seeding (40,000 cells/well) in 6-well dishes. Cells (triplicate wells) were then treated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator with serial dilutions of mutagen in growth medium. For each experiment, cells were counted after 3 days (untreated cells are found to be <80% confluent). Cell numbers will be determined by a cell lysis protocol. Results are the mean of at least two separate experiments. Percentage of control growth is as follows: (number of treated cells)/(number of control cells)·100. Flow Cytometric Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle and DNA synthesis was analyzed simultaneously by staining with propidium iodide and incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) with some modifications (30Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 327,000 cells/dish. (equivalent to the cell density used in the cytotoxicity experiments). The following day, cells were treated for 1 h with MMS. At 2 or 8 h after MMS treatment (as indicated), 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) was added to the dishes for 30 min to pulse-label the cells. Cells were then washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and washed a second time with PBS. The cell pellet obtained after centrifugation was resuspended in 100 μl of cold PBS, and the cells were dropped slowly into 70% ethanol and allowed to fix at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed, suspended in 2 n HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to denature the DNA. The cell samples were pelleted, resuspended in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5) to neutralize the acid and then washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μl of anti-BrdUrd-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (BD Biosciences) in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase (Sigma) stock solution. The following day, the cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle populations are designated G0/G1 (2 n DNA content with no BrdUrd incorporation), S (variable DNA content with BrdUrd incorporation), and G2/M (4 n DNA content without BrdUrd incorporation). Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay—For sister chomatid exchange (SCE) measurements, 1 × 106 cells were seeded onto 75-cm2 tissue culture dishes 8 h before drug treatment. The cells were treated with MMS in complete McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Following drug treatment, cells were incubated in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10 μm BrdUrd for 20 h. Colcemid (0.1 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was included for the last 2 h of incubation, and the cells were subsequently harvested by mitotic shake-off, resuspended, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in hypotonic solution (0.2% potassium chloride, 0.2% sodium citrate, and 10% fetal bovine serum) and then fixed in Carnoy's solution. To produce “harlequin” chromosomes, a modified fluorescence plus Giemsa technique was used (31Perry P. Wolff S. Nature. 1974; 251: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3026) Google Scholar). Slides were stained in Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml) for 20 min, mounted in 0.067 m Sorensen's buffer with a coverslip, and exposed to a General Electric 15-watt black light bulb at 65 °C for 20 min. Slides were then heated at 65 °C in 20× SSC for 20 min, rinsed, and stained in a 5% Giesma solution in 0.067 m Sorensen's buffer. Twenty second-division metaphase spreads were counted per data point. Aag Is Required to Initiate BER of MMS- and MNNG-induced Lesions to Generate the Toxic 5′-dRP Repair Intermediate—To study the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of both alkylated DNA bases and BER repair intermediates, we developed a set of isogenic MEF cell lines with homozygous null mutations in the Aag gene, in the β-pol gene or in both the Aag and β-pol genes (Fig. 1). To ensure that no significant backup or compensatory enzymatic activity was present, extracts from each were analyzed for Aag-specific activity (Fig. 2a) and β-pol-specific BER gap-filling activity (Fig. 2b). Wild type and β-pol (–/–) cells showed the expected levels of Aag activity, with little or no Aag-specific activity in the Aag (–/–) and β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells (Fig. 2a), whereas each had similar levels of uracil-DNA glycosylase activity (data not shown). Conversely, the wild type and Aag (–/–) cells reported robust β-pol-specific BER activity with little or no activity seen in extracts from β-pol (–/–) or β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Evidence that methylation damage is noncytotoxic, yet Aag induces the formation of cytotoxic β-pol substrates. a, Aag activity.

Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and β-pol (–/–) MEFs (21Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), implying that both methylated bases and BER intermediates are cytotoxic. We therefore compared the cytotoxicity of MMS in wild type and isogenic β-pol (–/–) (Fig. 2c) and Aag (–/–) MEFs (Fig. 2d). Consistent with the known phenotype of these cells and the hypothesis that the 5′-dRP lyase activity of β-pol is essential for reversing MMS-induced cytotoxicity (22Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), β-pol (–/–) MEFs were more sensitive to MMS than wild type MEFs, as expected (Fig. 2c). We next tested Aag (–/–) MEFs to directly evaluate the cytotoxicity of Aag substrates, since MMS causes a significant buildup of the principal Aag substrate 3-MeA in Aag (–/–) ES cells (33Engelward B.P. Allan J.M. Dreslin A.J. Kelly J.D. Wu M.M. Gold B. Samson L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5412-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Smith S.A. Engelward B.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3294-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Aag substrates generated by MMS exposure conferred no increase in cytotoxicity (Fig. 2d). This finding suggests that lesion avoidance mechanisms are more robust in MEFs than ES cells (see below). The lack of MMS-induced cytotoxicity allowed us to characterize the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of BER intermediates in these cells. Next, we compared β-pol (–/–) cells with β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells for MMS-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2e). We found that the MMS-sensitive phenotype of β-pol (–/–) cells is critically dependent on Aag activity, because β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells were much more resistant to MMS than β-pol (–/–) cells (Fig. 2e). β-pol (–/–) MEFs have also been reported to be hypersensitive to alkylation damage caused by MNNG (21Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Using the same set of four isogenic cell lines, we compared the cytotoxicity profile induced by MNNG to determine whether this induced cytotoxic response is also mediated by repair intermediates initiated by Aag. Identical to the results for MMS treatment, β-pol (–/–) MEFs but not Aag (–/–) MEFs were hypersensitive to MNNG, and the genetic loss of Aag prevented the formation of repair intermediates that cause the cytotoxicity in the absence of β-pol (Fig. 3). It should be noted that all four cell lines exhibited similar cytotoxic profiles following UV exposure (data not shown). Therefore, both MMS and MNNG generate Aag substrates in DNA; if left unrepaired, these Aag substrates are not cytotoxic in these cells, yet accumulation of the 5′-dRP repair intermediate (formed following Aag-mediated lesion removal and APendo hydrolysis of the abasic site) induces a dramatic cytotoxic response. To further demonstrate that Aag-mediated lesion removal contributes to the generation of cytotoxic β-pol substrates, we transduced wild type, β-pol (–/–), Aag (–/–), and β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells with the MMP retrovirus expressing either GFP or human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (hAAG). To ensure uniform hAAG expression levels, individual clones were isolated and selected for similar AAG activity. As shown in Fig. 2a, all hAAG overexpressing lines had activity levels approaching 5 times that seen in wild type cells. Consistent with the model that Aag-mediated lesion removal is required for the formation of cytotoxic β-pol substrates, hAAG overexpression increased the MMS-induced cytotoxicity in a β-pol (–/–) background. As shown in Fig. 2f, β-pol (–/–)[+hAAG] cells were significantly more sensitive to MMS treatment than the control β-pol (–/–)[+GFP] cells. Further, hAAG overexpression in β-pol (–/–)/Aag (–/–) cells restored the MMS-induced hypersensitivity that is the hallmark of the β-pol (–/–) phenotype (21Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by a similar phenomenon. Clearly, spontaneous generation of Aag substrates does not lead to lethality in mice, since Aag (–/–) mice are viable and are without an obvious phenotype (23Engelward B.P. Weeda G. Wyatt M.D. Broekhof J.L. de Wit J. Donker I. Allan J.M. Gold B. Hoeijmakers J.H. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore bred a colony of β-pol (+/–)/Aag (–/–) mice to determine if genetic loss of Aag would rescue the β-pol (–/–)-associated lethality. As shown in Table I, the Aag (–/–) mutation did not rescue the β-pol( –/–) lethality. At a minimum, this reveals that the β-pol (–/–) lethal phenotype is not due to Aag-initiated repair intermediates. Similar studies with APendo (+/–)/Aag (–/–) mice suggest that the APendo (–/–) lethal phenotype is also not due to Aag-initiated repair intermediates. It remains to be determined whether genetic loss of any or all of the damage-spec"
https://openalex.org/W2090312476,"MinD is a ubiquitous ATPase that plays a crucial role in selection of the division site in eubacteria, chloroplasts, and probably also Archaea. It was recently demonstrated that membrane localization of MinD is mediated by an 8-12-residue C-terminal motif termed the membrane targeting sequence or MTS. In this study we show that the MinD MTS is a transplantable lipid-binding motif that can effectively target heterologous proteins to the cell membrane. We demonstrate that eubacterial MTSs interact directly with lipid bilayers as an amphipathic helix, with a distinct preference for anionic phospholipids. Moreover, we provide evidence that the phospholipid preference of each MTS, as well as its affinity for biological membranes, has been evolutionarily tuned to its specific role in different bacteria. We propose a model to describe how the MTS is coupled to ATP binding to regulate the reversible membrane association of Escherichia coli MinD during its pole-to-pole oscillation cycle."

It has been shown previously that p56 is able to bind the eukaryotic initiation factor 3e(eIF3e) (p48/Int-6) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3 and function as an inhibitor of translation in vitro and in vivo.

Peters K.L. Sen G.C. Virology. 2000; 267: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Previous work has characterized the transcriptional regulation of the p56 gene, also known as the 561 gene, ISG56, and IFIT1 (2Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genomics. 1998; 54: 266-277Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the other members of the family are not as well characterized nor are their cellular functions known. Structurally, the only significant feature of p56 is the presence of eight tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, motifs shown in other proteins to mediate protein-protein interactions (9Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized interactions with p56 identified thus far has been with Int-6/p48 (also known as eIF3e), a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (10Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Binding of p56 to the eIF3e subunit has been shown to have a functional effect by inhibiting overall cellular translation (3Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whereas the functional effect of p56 has been mapped to TPR motifs 6–8, the mechanism by which p56 inhibits translation is not known (10Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). eIF3 is one of the 11 or more initiation factors that are involved in the first stage of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. Mammalian eIF3 is the largest (650 kDa) of all the initiation factors and is composed of 11 or 12 individual subunits eIFa-eIFj (11Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-55Google Scholar). The exact interactions and stoichiometry of the eIF3 subunits are poorly understood. eIF3 is a multifunctional initiation factor that has been shown to operate at different levels of the initiation pathway. eIF3 serves as a dissociation factor by binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing reassociation with the 60 S subunit and thereby increasing the size of the 40 S subunit pool (12Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Merrick W.C. Lubson N.H. Anderson W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). eIF3 also functions by interacting with eIF2 and stabilizing the interaction between the ternary complex (composed of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi) and the 40 S ribosomal subunit, thereby forming the 43 S ribosomal complex (14Chadhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 521-526Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, eIF3 has been shown to interact with initiation factor eIF4G of the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex, which also consists of eIF4A and eIF4E (16Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The interaction between eIF3 and eIF4F·mRNA serves to bring the mRNA to the 43 S ribosomal complex, thereby forming the 48 S complex (17Lamphear B.J.R. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). eIF3 is also known to play a role in alternative, cap-independent mechanisms of translation that are still being elucidated. Many viral, as well as cellular, mRNAs have evolved internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) to provide a site for ribosome attachment. Although the initiation factor requirements for translation appear to be different depending on the IRES, eIF3 has already been shown to be required for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES-mediated translation (18Sizova D.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF3 provides a possible site of regulation by p56 at both the cap-dependent and cap-independent levels. Based on the known functions of eIF3, the role of p56 and the mechanism of inhibition were examined further by using inhibition of eIF3-function assays. It was found that p56 inhibits translation specifically at the level of eIF3·ternary complex formation. Furthermore, the inhibition appears to act preferentially on cap-mediated translation, whereas EMCV IRES-mediated translation was apparently insensitive to inhibition. The addition of exogenous eIF2 stimulated cap-mediated translation, but not IRES-mediated translation, suggesting that excess levels of eIF2 (and thereby ternary complex) may be able to compete with p56 for binding to either free eIF3 or 40 S bound eIF3. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody against p56 was obtained by injection of purified p56 protein expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (3Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C.

Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then immediately quenched with 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (quenching buffer). Ternary complex was bound to the nitrocellulose filter (25 mm, 0.45-mm pore size, Millipore) by adding the entire reaction mixture to the filter, followed by vacuum filtration. Filters were washed twice with 5 ml of quenching buffer, followed by vacuum filtration. Filters were dried under a heat lamp, and then radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To test the effect of p56 on ternary complex formation, 30 pmol (1.7 μg) of purified p56 or 30 pmol (1.2 μg) of mutant p56 was pre-incubated with eIF3 for 10 min at 30 °C prior to their addition to the ternary complex reaction mixture. Generation of a Bicistronic Reporter mRNA—A bicistronic plasmid, containing the EMCV IRES (420 nucleotides) intervening between the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT, ORF1) and firefly luciferase (LUC, ORF2) reporter genes and designated pGEM-CAT-EMCV-LUC (24Van Der Velden A. Kaminski A. Jackson R.J. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1995; 214: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The bicistronic (CAT-EMCV-LUC) insert was introduced downstream of the viral T7 RNA polymerase promoter and contains a unique restriction site, XhoI, that was used to linearize the plasmid prior to transcription. In vitro transcription was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of m7G (5′)ppp(5′)G using Megascript transcription kit and procedures outlined by Ambion. Following the transcription reaction, samples were treated with RNase-free DNase for 10 min and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extracted twice, ethanol-precipitated, and washed in 70% ethanol. RNA samples were recovered in water and quantitated using a Hewlett-Packard Chemstation 8453 spectrophotometer and monitored for integrity by ethidium bromide staining following electrophoresis on acrylamide/urea gels. In Vitro Translation Inhibition Assay—In vitro translations in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were programmed with the capped CAT-EMCV-LUC transcript in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro translations were performed with nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate under conditions recommended by Promega. A typical 15-μl reaction contained 10 μl of lysate, 0.2 mm amino acid mixture (minus methionine), 6 μCi of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol), 24 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.4 μg of transcript (constituting 25 μg/ml). Purified eIF2 was added in increasing amounts as indicated in the figure legends (20Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Translations were performed at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of increasing amounts of wild type or mutant p56. Following translation, an aliquot of the lysate was resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and incorporated radioactivity was quantitated using the ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. p56 Does Not Interfere with eIF3-mediated Ribosome Dissociation—Because eIF3 is an essential initiation factor whose function in the initiation of translation is implicated at the earliest step of the initiation pathway, studies with p56 began at the level of ribosome dissociation. Fig. 1 shows the results of a size-separation assay by using sucrose gradient centrifugation to analyze the dissociation of ribosomes by eIF3. In this assay, individual preparations of purified 40 S and 60 S ribosomal units were used rather than salt-washed ribosomes, because they produced clearer UV profiles, separating into distinct peaks (data not shown). The UV profile of the gradient remained unchanged in the presence of p56 protein buffer as shown in Fig. 1A. Because eIF3 serves as an anti-association factor, addition of eIF3 to the reaction would be expected to “dissociate” 80 S ribosomes by binding to the small pool of 40 S ribosomal subunits and prevent reassociation with 60 S subunits, effectively shifting the equilibrium to free 40 S subunits. In Fig. 1B, 60 pmol of eIF3 in an approximate 2:1 molar excess of ribosomes resulted in a dramatic decrease in the 80 S peak and a corresponding increase in the 60 S peak, which suggests an increase in the amount of 60 S formed. We did not observe an equivalent increase in the 40 S ribosomal subunit pool. In part, this appears to reflect a tendency of mammalian 40 S subunits to dimerize (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 25Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this peak did not resolve well from the peak of 60 S subunits. To investigate the possibility of p56 interfering with the function of eIF3 as a dissociation factor, an equimolar amount of p56 protein was pre-incubated with eIF3 prior to the addition of the ribosomal subunits. After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the activity of eIF3 as a “dissociation factor” was unaffected, as the peak corresponding to 80 S subunits was still reduced, and the peaks corresponding to the 40 S and 60 S subunit pool increased (Fig. 1C). As expected, a mutant form of p56, lacking the interaction domain (TPR6–8) (10Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), did not affect the dissociation of ribosomes, producing a profile similar to only eIF3 added (data not shown). p56 Does Not Interfere with eIF3·40 S Ribosomal Subunit Interactions—To confirm that p56 was indeed binding to eIF3 and was subsequently able to form a complex with 40 S subunits, Western blot analysis of fractions from sucrose gradients containing 40 S subunits, eIF3, and p56 was performed. Presented in (Fig. 2A) is the general UV profile for 0.7 A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits used in this assay. Under these conditions, the 40 S ribosomes migrated in fraction 8. When both 60 pmol of p56 and 60 pmol of eIF3 were added to the reaction containing ∼20 pmol of 40 S ribosomal subunits, p56 was able to bind to eIF3, which formed a complex with the 40 S subunit, as shown by Western blot analysis of gradient fractions using an antibody to p56 (Fig. 2C). p56 migration with the 40 S ribosomal subunit was dependent on the interaction with eIF3, as p56 incubated alone with 40 S subunits did not bind and remained in the upper region of the gradient (Fig. 2B). Similarly, eIF3 alone remained at the top of the gradient in the absence of 40 S ribosomal subunits, as visualized by Coomassie staining of sucrose gradient fractions (data not shown). To confirm that p56 was not interfering with the ability of eIF3 to bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits, a Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal antibody against eIF3. As seen in Fig. 3A, this antibody was able to recognize primarily the p110 subunit of eIF3 (eIF3c), but at longer exposure times other subunits could also be detected, although to a lesser degree. When fractions from a sucrose gradient containing 0.7 A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits and 60 pmol of eIF3 (at an ∼3-fold molar excess to ribosomal subunits) were subjected to Western blot analysis, eIF3 could be seen migrating in the fractions corresponding to 40 S subunits (Fig. 3B). This association remained unaffected, even in the presence of equimolar p56 (Fig. 3C), indicating that p56 had no effect on the ability of eIF3 to bind to 40 S subunits. p56 Does Not Interfere with the eIF3·eIF4F Interaction—eIF3 is also known to play an important role in binding and stabilization of the eIF4F complex on the 40 S subunit. The eIF4F complex is responsible for binding and unwinding the mRNA prior to translation. Because p56 was shown not to interfere with the ability of eIF3 to dissociate ribosomes, inhibition could be mediated through the disruption of the eIF3·eIF4F interaction. To examine the effect of p56 on the eIF3·eIF4F interaction, a sucrose gradient separation assay was performed using radiolabeled eIF4F (200 kDa) and unlabeled eIF3 (650 kDa). As shown in Fig. 4A, 150 pmol of radiolabeled eIF4F remained in the upper region of a 5–18% sucrose gradient, as measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry of sucrose gradient fractions. When equimolar (150 pmol) eIF3 was incubated in the presence of eIF4F, a shift in radioactivity was observed from the upper region of the gradient, toward the middle of the gradient, corresponding to fractions containing eIF3 (Fig. 4B). The shift in radioactivity represents the formation of the complex of eIF3 and eIF4F. The efficiency of eIF4F binding to eIF3 was ∼50%, which is consistent with previous findings (22Yoder-Hill J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5566-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reporting the eIF3·eIF4F interaction. To test the effect of p56 on the formation of the eIF3·eIF4F complex, an equimolar (150 pmol) amount of purified p56 was pre-incubated with eIF3 prior to incubation with eIF4F. After separation on the gradient, the radioactivity profile remained unchanged, showing that eIF4F was still able to form a complex with eIF3, even in the presence of p56 (Fig. 4C). To confirm that p56 was present in the eIF3·eIF4F complex, Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient fractions with the p56 antibody demonstrated the presence of p56 in the fractions containing eIF3 (data not shown). As expected, the mutant form of p56 did not change the radioactivity profile of the eIF4F (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the eIF3·eIF4F interaction is unaffected by p56 and is unlikely to be responsible for the p56-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis. p56 Inhibits the Enhancement of Ternary Complex Formation by eIF3—Another step of the initiation pathway that eIF3 is known to operate at, and thus representing a possible target site for p56 inhibition, is the formation and stabilization of the ternary complex. eIF3 binds the ternary complex, which consists of eIF2, initiator Met-tRNAi, and GTP, and in doing so shifts the equilibrium toward ternary complex and ternary complex·eIF3 (15Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 521-526Crossref Google Scholar). To investigate the possible effect of p56 on ternary complex formation, a filter binding assay was employed. This assay is based on the principle that Met-tRNAi binding to a nitrocellulose filter is dependent on the binding to an initiation factor (26Yarus M. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 42: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of eIF2, which is retained on nitrocellulose, Met-tRNAi will be retained on the filter by binding to eIF2 in the presence of GTP. By using radiolabeled Met-tRNAi, formation of the ternary complex can be quantitatively measured. Presented in Fig. 5 are the cumulative results of 5 separate filter-binding assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” As expected, [14C]Met-tRNAi was not retained on the nitrocellulose filter, and all other values were normalized to the background levels of radioactivity detected (Fig. 5, column A). In the presence of 8 pmol (1 μg) of eIF2 and GTP, [14C]Met-tRNAi was retained on the filter, representing ternary complex formation (Fig. 5, column B). The addition of 30 pmol of eIF3 to the reaction resulted in a 4-fold increase in radioactivity retained on the nitrocellulose filter (Fig. 5, column C), representing the effect of eIF3 on the stabilization of ternary complex formed. Of particular interest, when 30 pmol of p56 was pre-incubated with equimolar eIF3, the result was a complete abrogation of the eIF3 stimulatory effect on ternary complex formation (Fig. 5, column E), providing the first evidence of a possible mechanism of inhibition. Additional evidence supporting this observation was the relative inability of mutant p56 to inhibit the eIF3-mediated stimulation of ternary complex (Fig. 5, column F), presumably due to its inability to bind to eIF3 (10Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). p56 Exhibits Differential Effects on m7G Cap and IRES-mediated Translation Initiation—Once the specific stage of the initiation pathway at which p56 inhibits translation had been implicated, p56 was investigated for its ability to inhibit in vitro translation in two different contexts, cap-mediated and IRES-mediated translation initiation. The reporter used was a bicistronic mRNA, containing the EMCV IRES. The EMCV IRES requires all canonical initiation factors for translation to initiate internally (19Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because ternary complex is required for both cap-mediated and IRES-mediated translation, it would seem likely that both modes of translation would be equally inhibited by p56. Surprisingly, p56 did not appear to inhibit IRES-mediated translation at the levels of p56 added. Translation of the cap-dependent open reading frame, CAT was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–6), which is consistent with our findings reported previously (3Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, translation of the IRES-dependent open reading frame, luciferase (LUC), was not inhibited upon addition of p56, suggesting that the EMCV IRES has an alternative mechanism of translation that is less sensitive to levels of ternary complex. Addition of exogenous eIF2 was able to partially restore cap-dependent translation (Fig. 6A, lane 7). Quantitation of the two products is shown in Fig. 6B, demonstrating the dose-dependent inhibitory effect on CAT translation by increasing amounts of p56, whereas LUC translation remained unaffected. Consequently, the ratio of CAT translation to LUC translation decreased (Fig. 6C). In a similar experiment, mutant p56 did not inhibit either cap- or IRES-mediated translation, even when tested at higher concentrations (560 nm; data not shown). Previous efforts identified that p56 was capable of binding the p48 (Int-6) subunit of eIF3 and that this binding could lead to the inhibition of protein synthesis, although the mechanism of inhibition was not defined (3Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). eIF3 is a large, multisubunit complex and appears to coordinate a number of events in the 80 S initiation pathway (11Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-55Google Scholar). The best characterized of these interactions is the ability of eIF3 to bind to 40 S subunits, eIF4F, and the ternary complex (11Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-55Google Scholar, 15Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S.

Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have systematically examined the ability of p56 to interfere with each of these processes and observed that only the third interaction was affected. It has been shown that under conditions of limiting Met-tRNAi, eIF3 enhances retention of Met-tRNAi on nitrocellulose filters (15Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 521-526Crossref Google Scholar) presumably by forming an eIF3·ternary complex and thus pulling the following equilibrium (Reaction 1) to the right: Met-tRNAi+eIF2·GTP↔eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi+eIF3↔eIF3·eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi(ternarycomplex)Reaction1(Eq. 1) At present it is not clear whether this interaction reflects a sequence whereby eIF3 binds to 40 S subunits as an eIF3·ternary complex or whether this reflects the intimate interaction of these proteins on the surface of the 40 S subunit. As seen in Fig. 5, p56 completely inhibited this interaction. The consequence of limiting the eIF3·ternary complex interaction is depicted in Fig. 7. Arrows labeled A and B show the possible sites where p56 might have its effect, either by blocking the binding of the ternary complex to the 40 S·eIF3 complex (A) or by blocking the direct interaction between eIF3 and the ternary complex (B). Either of these steps would lead to reduced levels of 40 S·eIF3·ternary complexes and a general overall slowing of protein synthesis initiation. This study demonstrates the first example of differential regulation of the three functions of eIF3 in translation initiation. Although binding of p56 inhibited the interaction of eIF3 with the ternary complex, its other two interactions (either with 40 S subunits or eIF4F) remained unaffected. This observation suggests that different domains of eIF3 interface with different interacting partners, and these domains can function independently of one another. It remains to be seen if there are other cellular proteins that can bind to other subunits of eIF3 and regulate the functions unaffected by p56. Independent regulation of the different activities of eIF3 may be needed for selective, but not global, regulation of translation initiation as observed for the effect of p56 on translation of the bicistronic mRNA. eIF3-interacting proteins, such as p56, may be useful tools for mapping the functional topology of this multiprotein complex. As a further test of p56 action, p56 was tested for its ability to inhibit the translation of the bicistronic mRNA, pGEM-CAT-EMCV IRES-LUC. Surprisingly, there appeared to be little or no inhibition of the IRES-mediated translation of LUC. This observation is consistent with preliminary studies using heme-deficient lysate or normal lysate supplemented with dsRNA. 2R. Bhasker, unpublished observations. Both of these translation systems contain reduced levels of ternary complex, relative to either normal lysate or lysate supplemented with exogenous eIF2, and only inhibition of the cap-dependent translation was observed. Does this preferential inhibition of cap-dependent protein synthesis make sense? The answer would appear to be yes. First, the preferential inhibition of cap-dependent translation appears to be exactly the same as that observed with PKR, an interferon induced eIF2α kinase that is activated by dsRNA, the proverbial “calling card” of viral infection. Second, interferon action is not exclusively restricted to a protective effect against viral infections. Interferons have been shown to have a broad range of biologically protective functions. In this light, it should be noted that many, but not all, proteins associated with response to stressing events contain IRES elements (27Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear that these cellular IRES all behave identically to the EMCV IRES, it could be imagined that many would. Thus, these IRES containing mRNAs would be resistant to the general reduction in ternary complexes that could have resulted from the action of any of the four eIF2α kinases (HRI, PKR, PERK, and GCN2). In addition, many stressing agents also influence eIF4F activity, primarily through the eIF4E/4E-BP interaction (27Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The reduction of eIF4F activity under stress directly down-regulates cap-dependent translation as expected and simultaneously allows for the up-regulation of IRES-mediated translation (28Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10218-10226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In sum, the ability to maintain IRES-mediated translation for the expression of a variety of protective proteins in the presence of stressing agents or in response to interferon stimulation, which may influence ternary complex levels and/or eIF4F activity, ensures optimal protection for the cell. The unanswered question is why is IRES-mediated translation less sensitive to ternary complex levels? The general 80 S initiation pathway would predict that both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation initiation should be reduced when the level of 40 S·eIF3·ternary complexes (43 S complexes) fall as the mRNA binding event requires the 43 S complex as a substrate (11Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-55Google Scholar). At present, there appear to be three possible alternatives. First, the IRES-containing mRNA may be more competitive and thus out-compete cap-dependent initiation for the limiting amounts of 43 S complexes. Second, due to the stickiness of the translation factors, a large factor aggregate, which is eIF3·ternary complex·eIF4F·mRNA, may form and bind directly to the 40 S ribosome. Finally, the IRES element may bind to either 40 S or 40 S·eIF3 (but not 40 S·eIF3·ternary complexes) and thereby form a more effective trap for the limiting amounts of ternary complex. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to decide which of these is correct, either in general or for the pGEM-CAT-EMCV-LUC construct used in these studies. Preliminary competition studies indicate that for this construct, cap-dependent translation is more efficient2; however, this will obviously vary depending on the 5′-untranslated region used for cap-dependent translation and the specific IRES used to direct internal initiation. Evidence for the binding of the mRNA to the 40 S subunit in the absence of the ternary complex is not well substantiated in general; however, for HCV and cricket paralysis virus mRNAs, the evidence is rather good (29Jan E. Sarnow P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 889-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Lytle J.R. Wu L. Robertson H.D. J.

Although there is ample evidence demonstrating a degree of “stickiness” between translation initiation factors (15Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S.

Zhang F. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that such larger aggregates are an integral part of any initiation pathway. Clearly, it is of extreme interest to examine in greater mechanistic detail the binding of IRES-containing mRNAs to the 40 S subunit. It will also be of interest to see if the effectiveness of interferon treatment in vivo is generally better against viruses that generate mRNAs that are translated in a cap-dependent manner than against viruses that rely on IRES-mediated translation of their mRNAs. It is curious to note that the lack of inhibitory effects of p56 on EMCV IRES-mediated translation observed in the current study may not be universally applicable to all IRES elements in all cell types. Wang et al. (35Wang C. Pflugheber J. Sumpter Jr., R. Sodora D.L. Hui D. Sen G.C. Gale Jr., M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3898-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported that in Huh7 cells, p56 could strongly inhibit translation directed by the HCV IRES. This inhibition was less pronounced for both cap-dependent and EMCV IRES-dependent translation. The higher sensitivity of HCV IRES to p56, as compared with cap-dependent translation, was also observed in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (35Wang C. Pflugheber J. Sumpter Jr., R. Sodora D.L. Hui D. Sen G.C. Gale Jr., M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3898-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Taken together with the conclusions of Wang et al. (35Wang C. Pflugheber J. Sumpter Jr., R. Sodora D.L. Hui D. Sen G.C. Gale Jr., M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3898-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), our study suggests a hierarchy of p56 susceptibility; EMCV IRES is much less sensitive than cap-dependent initiation, and HCV IRES is more sensitive. The underlying biochemical mechanism responsible for this hierarchy is currently unclear, although the known difference in the ways EMCV IRES and HCV-IRES recruit the 40 S subunit is expected to play an important role (36Sarnow P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Nahum Sonenberg for the pGEM-CAT-EMCV-LUC construct.

In summary, hypoxia-elicited alterations in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro closely resemble the epithelial pathophysiology of ARF. Our data indicate that although this event may rely heavily on HIF-1-dependent gene transcription, it is likely that separate hypoxia-dependent transcriptional regulators also play a role. Epithelial cells represent a primary target for hypoxia-elicited injury in a diverse array of ischemic conditions (1Taylor C.T. Colgan S.P. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 16: 1498-1505Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Brady H.R. Brenner B.M. Clarkson M. Lieberthal W. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. W. B.

In such pathologies, non-lethal epithelial dysfunction is typified by increased paracellular permeability and unregulated movement of molecules between compartments normally separated by the tightly controlled epithelial barrier (2Taylor C.T.

Hy. 2000; 9: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Hypoxia has been demonstrated to alter the expression of a number of individual genes that contribute to epithelial cell injury (1Taylor C.T. Colgan S.P. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 16: 1498-1505Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Taylor C.T. Fueki N. Agah A. Hershberg R.M. Colgan S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19447-19454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypoxia has also been demonstrated to inhibit cellular proliferation (7Goda N. Ryan H.E. Khadivi B. McNulty W. Rickert R.C. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Conversely, pre-exposure of cells to hypoxia/reoxygenation induces genes associated with ischemic pre-conditioning, which protects cells against subsequent ischemic insult (8Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hy. 2002; 11: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The global transcriptional mechanism(s) underlying these events are not fully understood. Here we have taken an unbiased approach using oligonucleotide microarrays to define the transcriptomic response induced by hypoxia in an epithelial model of non-lethal proximal tubular cell dysfunction.Transcriptional responses to hypoxia can be adaptive or inflammatory (1Taylor C.T. Colgan S.P. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 16: 1498-1505Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Adaptive responses are controlled primarily through the nuclear accumulation of the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; ARF, acute renal failure; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HRE, hypoxia-response elements; CREB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; ARF, acute renal failure; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HRE, hypoxia-response elements; CREB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays. which is composed of α and β subunits. In hypoxia, decreased oxygen-dependent HIF-1α proline hydroxylation at Pro-402 and Pro-564 (and subsequent ubiquitination/degradation) leads to HIF-1α stabilization (9Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A.V. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). HIF-1α dimerizes with HIF-1β to form HIF-1. Accumulated HIF-1 translocates to the nucleus where abrogation of oxygen-dependent asparagine (Asp-803) hydroxylation of HIF-1α leads to HIF-1 transactivation (11Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). HIF-1 binds to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) and regulates the expression of a number of adaptive genes coding for angiogenic and glycolytic and other proteins (e.g. erythropoietin and inducible nitric-oxide synthase), which support tissue survival in hypoxia (12Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar).A distinct tissue specific inflammatory response has been described in intestinal epithelial cells in response to hypoxia which occurs temporally downstream of the adaptive response. Such events are mediated through the activation of NF-κB and co-incidental degradation of CREB (5Taylor C.T. Fueki N. Agah A. Hershberg R.M. Colgan S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19447-19454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Taylor C.T. Furuta G.T. Synnestvedt K. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These events result in the induction of pro-inflammatory genes, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, which may contribute to ongoing disease processes (2Taylor C.T. Dzus A.L. Colgan S.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 657-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A common event in the regulation of hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulators is the targeted degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (13Taylor C.T. Furuta G.T. Synnestvedt K. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).In our study, the hypoxic renal proximal tubular epithelial phenotype in vitro closely resembled the epithelial pathology of ARF. Furthermore, although the vast majority of genes remained unaltered, a specific cluster of 48 genes with a closely shared expression profile was induced in hypoxia. These hypoxia-responsive genes could be separated into HIF-1-dependent and -independent groups. HIF-1 bound to HRE motifs in the promoters of a number of these genes in hypoxia. In normoxia, overexpression of HIF-1α was sufficient to drive transcriptional events; however, it did not mimic the pathophysiologic phenotype implicating a role for coincidental HIF-1-independent mechanisms in the induction of a pathophysiologic phenotype in proximal tubular epithelial cells in response to hypoxia.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2; American Tissue Type Culture Collection) (15Ryan M.J. Johnson G. Kirk J. Fuerstenberg S.M. Zager R.A. Torok-Storb B. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 48-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 36 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 4 pg/ml triiodo-l-thyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere under hypoxic (1% O2, 20 torr) or normoxic/reoxygenation (21% O2, 147 torr) conditions with a balance of 95% N2, 5% CO2. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum.Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed by measurement of [3H]thymidine uptake. In brief, cells were incubated in medium containing 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed 4 times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized overnight with 2% SDS, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments). Results are expressed as disintegrations/min as a percentage of control.Morphologic Analysis—Fluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (16Maderna P. Cottell D.C. Berlasconi G. Petasis N.A. Brady H.R. Godson C. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2275-2283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, for analysis of F-actin arrangement, cells were stained using FITC-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Staining was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope. For light and electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, post-fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in phosphate-buffered saline, and dehydrated through ascending grades of ethanol, 70, 90, and 100%. Cell preparations were then treated with propylene oxide for 30 min before embedding in EPON resin at 60 °C overnight. Ultra-thin sections cut with a diamond knife were stained with toluidine blue and visualized by light microscopy or stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a JEOL 200FX transmission electron microscope.Transepithelial Dextran Paracellular Permeability Assay—Transepithelial paracellular permeability was assessed as described previously (17Furuta G.T. Turner J.R. Taylor C.T. Hershberg R.M. Comerford K. Narravula S. Podolsky D.K. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured on polycarbonate-permeable inserts (3-μm pore size, 6.5-mm diameter; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Following treatment, apical to basolateral permeability of a FITC-labeled dextran (70 kDa; 25 mg/ml; Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) was measured as basolateral fluorescence at intervals up to 60 min using a CitiFluor multiwell fluorescence plate reader. Paracellular dextran flux was calculated by linear regression using GraphPad Prism 2.01 software.Cell Viability Assays—To evaluate necrosis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in cell culture medium and cell lysates using a quantitative biochemical assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Necrosis was assessed as LDH activity released into the medium as a percentage of total LDH (cellular + extracellular).Apoptotic cells were detected by staining for externalized phosphatidylserine using FITC-conjugated annexin V (Roche Diagnostics). Distinction from necrotic cells was determined by staining for propidium iodide. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and incubated with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed for fluorescence staining using a Coulter EPIC elite flow cytometer.Gene Microarray and Bioinformatic Analysis—RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription, and microarray analysis were carried out as described previously (13Taylor C.T. Furuta G.T. Synnestvedt K. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction and subsequently purified through an RNeasy Mini Column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript Choice kit (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled cRNA prepared from template cDNAs was fragmented and hybridized to HG U95A arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were then washed and fluorescently labeled before being scanned using a confocal scanner. Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix) was used to analyze the relative abundance of each gene from the average difference of fluorescent intensities. Calculated signal/log ratios for each gene at all time points of hypoxia were compared with normoxia, and those genes with a value greater than 1 or less than -1 (2-fold difference) for at least 1 time point were selected for further cluster analysis. Signal/log ratio data for selected genes were normalized and subjected to k-means clustering (k = 60) using Cluster™ and Treeview™ software (19Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13132) Google Scholar) (www.rana.lbl.gov). Approximately 5000 bp of sequence upstream from the NCBI predicted mRNA start site was selected for further analysis for common TF binding motifs between species. These sequences were then aligned using Clustal X1.81 (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35185) Google Scholar) (www.matfys.kvl.dk/bioinformatik/exercise6.html) before analysis for potential transcription factor regulatory binding site matrices using MatInspector™ software (21Prince L.S. Karp P.H. Moninger T.O. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 6: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (www.genomatix.de).Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Confirmation of selected gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR from cDNA prepared from total cell RNA using random primers as described previously (5Taylor C.T. Fueki N. Agah A. Hershberg R.M. Colgan S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19447-19454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primers (obtained from Sigma-Genosys) for selected genes are listed as follows: VEGF, GGGCAGAATCATCACGAAGT and AAATGCTTTCTCCGCTCTGA; AK3, AGGGGAGGGGTTGTCTTAAA and ATGTTCTCCCGCAAGAAGTG; PPP1R3C, AGCGAACAGTGACAGGGACT and AGGAGACGTCTGGTGGAATG; AM, GGCGCAAGCCTCACTATTAC and CGGCGAACAACTTTACACCT; STC2, AGGAAGAGTGGGAGGAGGAG and GTAAGCCCCGAATCTCACAA; GLUT III, CACGCTTGCGTATGTCTGTT and CCAAGAAGGGAAAGGGAGAC; p57 (KIP2) TCTCGCTGTCCTCTCCTCTC and TGTCCACTTCGGTCCACTG; MUC1, ATCTCATTGCCTTGGCTGTC and ACCTGAGTGGAGTGGAATGG; HOXA4, AACACCAAGATGCGATCCTC and CCAATTTGGGTTTGTTTTGG; P4HA1, ACCCCATTTTGACTTTGCAC and GGAGAAAAAGGGAAGCCTGT; p27 (KIP1), ACCCCTAGAGGGCAAGTACG and ATCAGTCTTTGGGTCCACCA; CYCLIN G2, CTGCAGGTCATGATGTTTGG and CTCTTGCTGGAGAGGGTGAC; GADD153, TGGAAGCCTGGTATGAGGAC and CCAATTGTTCATGCTTGGTG; glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), CCTAAGGACGGTCTGAAGAGC and GCCAAGTCTTGGCCCTCTAT; HIF-1α, CTCAAAGTCGGACAGCCTCA and CCCTGCAGTAGGTTTCTGCT; and 18 S, GTGGAGCGATTTGTCTGGTT and CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGTAG. cDNA was amplified by an initial incubation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 25-35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55-58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.HIF-1-DNA Binding—HIF-1 binding to specific HRE motifs from various genes was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Briefly, radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing evolutionarily conserved HRE sequences for VEGF (5′-TGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAG-3′), adrenomedullin (5′-GACAAACGTGTCTAGCGTGAT-3′), RTP801 (5′-ACGTTGCTTACGTGCGCCCGG-3′), and stanniocalcin 2 (5′-GGAGACGTGAGCGTGCACACGT-3′) were incubated with lysates from normoxic and hypoxic HK-2 cells. DNA-protein interactions were documented by EMSA as described previously (17Furuta G.T. Turner J.R. Taylor C.T. Hershberg R.M. Comerford K. Narravula S. Podolsky D.K. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To investigate HIF-1 binding to the consensus HRE sequence, we utilized the TransAM HIF-1 kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif).HIF-1α Overexpression—Constructs expressing HIF-1α (wild type and double mutant) were a gift from Thilo Hagen, UCL, London, UK. Prolines 564 and 402 were mutated to alanine, as these are the residues important for targeted degradation in normoxia (14Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of each construct using Effectene. Cells were transfected for 6 h, medium was replaced with fresh Hela medium, and cells were cultured for a further 30 h. Cells were then assessed for proliferation, or RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test with p < 0.05 for n independent samples being deemed statistically significant.RESULTSHypoxia-elicited Epithelial Phenotype—To model the proximal tubular epithelial pathology associated with ischemic ARF, we exposed human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) to hypoxia and investigated the impact on cell proliferation, morphology, function, and viability. Cellular proliferation was diminished in hypoxia and returned to control levels upon reoxygenation (n = 3; p < 0.01: Fig. 1A) as determined by [3H]thymidine uptake assay. The impact of hypoxia on cellular morphology was investigated by light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy (Fig. 1B). Hypoxia elicited an increase in intercellular spacing (top panels), which was associated with a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (middle panels). Electron microscopy (lower panels) further revealed dramatically decreased numbers of intercellular junctions (arrowheads) between adjacent cells. Although cells remained viable (non-necrotic and non-apoptotic) throughout hypoxic exposure (0-48 h; Fig. 1C), paracellular permeability to a 70-kDa FITC-labeled dextran molecule was significantly increased by 36 h (n = 4; p < 0.05; Fig. 1C). This non-lethal dysfunction accurately reflects the proximal tubular epithelial pathobiology of acute renal failure.Global Gene Expression in Hypoxia—We investigated the transcriptomic response, which underlies the induction of the hypoxia-elicited phenotype in HK-2 cells. The Affymetrix human U95A microarray system was utilized to profile changes in global gene expression in hypoxia (18Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). This approach allows analysis of expression of 12,558 gene transcripts simultaneously. Analysis of pooled mRNA from independent experiments (n = 4) exposed to increasing periods of hypoxia (with or without reoxygenation) revealed expression of 7693 (61.1%) genes in at least one time point investigated (Affymetrix suite 5.0 analysis software). Approximately 12.5% (1571) of analyzed genes were differentially regulated in hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation, using a cut-off of 2-fold change (signal/log ratio >1 or < -1) in expression between any two exposures. Following normalization of expression values, k-means clustering allowed distinct cohorts of genes with shared expression profiles in a time course of hypoxia and reoxygenation to be identified (Fig. 2A). Such cohorts include genes that are up- (red) or down-regulated (green) in hypoxia. Within this cohort, we identified a cluster of genes with a tightly shared hypoxia-dependent expression profile (outlined in yellow in Fig. 2A). Comparison of all genes expressed in a temporal manner in hypoxia reveals that the numbers of both up- and down-regulated gene numbers increase quantitatively with time (Fig. 2B) indicating that a number of the late genes may be activated secondarily to early gene expression.Fig. 2Microarray analysis of global gene expression in hypoxia and reoxygenation. A, global gene expression in increasing periods of hypoxia (8-36 h) and reoxygenation (R) for 6 h was assessed using Affymetrix DNA microarray analysis. All measurements were relative to normoxic expression, and genes with a signal/log ratio greater than 1 or less than -1 (2-fold difference) for at least 1 time point were selected for further analysis. 1571 genes selected under these criteria were subjected to normalization before expression pattern clustering analysis using Cluster and Treeview software. Each gene is represented by a single row of colored boxes, and each time point is represented by a single column. The color scale ranges from saturated green for normalized signal/log ratios of -1 and below to saturated red for normalized signal/log ratios of 1 and above. A cluster of genes with an expression pattern of up-regulation at all time points of hypoxia and down on re-oxygenation is indicated (arrowhead). B, temporal detection of 1571 up and down-regulated genes revealed by comparison between each time point of hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hypoxia-dependent Gene Expression—Prominent among the total cohort of hypoxia-induced genes was a tightly regulated cluster of 48 genes that demonstrated time-dependent up-regulation in response to hypoxia and a distinct down-regulation upon reoxygenation. Importantly, these genes were up-regulated at early time points of hypoxia indicating that they were within the early wave of hypoxia-responsive genes rather than being secondarily induced. Genes within this cluster were separated according to proposed functionality, and an exhaustive review of the literature was carried out to determine whether individual genes within the cluster had been associated previously with hypoxia. Furthermore, the role of HIF-1α in the regulation of these genes was reviewed. Table I demonstrates that a significant number of hypoxia-dependent genes had previously documented HIF-1α dependence (35%). These include well defined HIF-1α-dependent genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adenylate kinase 3 (AK3), and adrenomedullin (30Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 37Garayoa M. Martinez A. Lee S. Pio R. An W.G. Neckers L. Trepel J. Montuenga L.M.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The detection of increased expression of these genes indicates the success of this experiment in identifying a physiologically relevant cluster of hypoxia-responsive genes. Notably, for a number of hypoxia-dependent genes (e.g. VEGF, MXI-1, and KIP-2), two individual identifiers were present within this cluster (data not shown). Because each identifier corresponds to a distinct set of oligonucleotide probe sequences representing an individual gene on the microarray, the ability to cluster specific identifiers to the same expression pattern demonstrates a high degree of accuracy of the microarray experiment and also the clustering algorithm used. The hypoxia-responsive cluster also contained a number of genes not previously demonstrated as HIF-1 dependent including stanniocalcin 2, PPP1R3C and DDIT3 (GADD153). The detection of hypoxia-inducible genes, which had not been associated previously with regulation by HIF-1, led us to investigate whether HIF-1 regulates the expression of these genes or whether HIF-1α-independent gene regulation in hypoxia is also occurring.Table IFunctional ontology of genes up-regulated in hypoxia and down-regulated on re-oxygenationAccession No.8hrs16hrs36hrsReoxHypoxia UpregulatedTranscription factor (Ref)DNA synthesis, Cell CycleD64137CDKN1C p57kip21.40.21.80.6YesHIF-1α(24Schipani E.

https://openalex.org/W2139981532,"The molecular mechanism leading to the cancer metastasis to bone is poorly understood but yet determines prognosis and therapy. Here, we define a new molecular pathway that may account for the extraordinarily high osteotropism of prostate cancer. By using SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine)-deficient mice and recombinant SPARC, we demonstrated that SPARC selectively supports the migration of highly metastatic relative to less metastatic prostate cancer cell lines to bone. Increased migration to SPARC can be traced to the activation of integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 on tumor cells. Such activation is induced by an autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 loop on the tumor cells, which also supports the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. A consequence of SPARC recognition by αVβ5 is enhanced VEGF production. Thus, prostate cancer cells expressing VEGF/VEGFR-2 will activate αVβ3 and αVβ5 on their surface and use these integrins to migrate toward SPARC in bone. Within the bone environment, SPARC engagement of these integrins will stimulate growth of the tumor and further production of VEGF to support neoangiogenesis, thereby favoring the development of the metastatic tumor. Supporting this model, activated integrins were found to colocalize with VEGFR-2 in tissue samples of metastatic prostate tumors from patients.

If prostate cancer is locally confined, the 5-year survival rate is nearly 100%; however, if the cancer metastasizes to distant sites, the 5-year survival rate is only 31%. Bone is by far (80 - 85%) the primary site of prostate cancer metastasis. Despite the high incidence and serious consequences of skeletal metastasis of prostate cancer, the mechanisms underlying this osteotropism are poorly understood. However, it is clear that bone-specific matrix proteins and their receptors on the surface of prostate cancer cells play a pivotal role in the process (1Smit J.W. van der Pluijm G. Vloedgraven H.J. Lowik C.W. Goslings B.M. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Salih M.A. Orhii P.B. Chen C. Kalu D.N. Mol. Cell.

Recent analysis of bone extracts has revealed that a key factor that mediates prostate cancer cell invasion is the protein osteonectin or SPARC 1The abbreviations used are: SPARC, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor; LNCaP, lymph node carcinoma of prostate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; cRGDfV, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-(d-Phe)Val; Ct, threshold cycle; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.1The abbreviations used are: SPARC, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor; LNCaP, lymph node carcinoma of prostate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; cRGDfV, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-(d-Phe)Val; Ct, threshold cycle; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) (4Jacob K. Webber M. Benayahu D. Kleinman H.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4453-4457PubMed Google Scholar). SPARC is a component of bone matrix that modulates cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix, exerting an anti-adhesive, promigratory effect on cells (5Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 815-827Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPARC is expressed by certain metastatic tumors, and its expression correlates with invasive activity. Therefore, in recent publications, SPARC has also been referred to as the “proinvasive” protein (6Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious importance of this particular bone matrix protein in cancer development and metastasis, the mechanisms of its recognition by prostate cancer cells remain unclear. Cell-surface receptors on prostate tumor cells that are particularly important for bone matrix recognition and that could contribute to the directed metastasis of prostate cancer cells to bone are members of the integrin family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors. In particular, the integrins that share a common αv subunit, αvβ3 and αvβ5 subunits, have been implicated in prostate cancer cell biology (7Rokhlin O.W. Cohen M.B. Prostate. 1995; 26: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 9Lang S.H.

Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2271-2277PubMed Google Scholar). For example, changes in αvβ3 expression correlate with the progression to androgen independence of prostate cancer (12Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar) and with differences in the adhesive and migratory properties of different prostate cancer cell lines (13Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Fornaro M. Tallini G. Languino L.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1655-1664PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in vivo have demonstrated that tumor growth is inhibited by αvβ3-blocking antibodies (14Sokoloff M.H. Chung L.W. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Central to the function of integrins is their capacity to be activated (15Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Integrin activation can modulate ligand repertoire or can markedly enhance their apparent affinity for a particular ligand. In previous studies, we reported that the functional activity of αvβ3 on endothelial and tumor cells could be regulated by VEGF (16Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF has also been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis and metastasis as well as in angiogenesis. VEGF and VEGFRs are expressed by prostate carcinoma cells at a high level (17Ferrer F.A. Miller L.J. Andrawis R.I. Kurtzman S.H. Albertsen P.C. Laudone V.P. Kreutzer D.L.

Urology. 1999; 54: 567-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and their expression correlates with increasing grade, vascularity, and tumorigenicity (19Weidner N. Carroll P.R. Flax J. Blumenfeld W. Folkman J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ferrer F.A. Miller L.J. Andrawis R.I. Kurtzman S.H. Albertsen P.C. Laudone V.P. Kreutzer D.L. J. Urol. 1997; 157: 2329-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These relationships have been observed in humans as well as in animal models of prostate cancer. High VEGF levels in prostate cancer are associated with poor prognosis (17Ferrer F.A. Miller L.J. Andrawis R.I. Kurtzman S.H. Albertsen P.C. Laudone V.P. Kreutzer D.L. Urology. 1998; 51: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF produced by tumor cells affects bone remodeling and might, therefore, facilitate nesting of metastatic cells in bone (21Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify an interrelationship between SPARC, the αv integrins, and VEGF, which may define the mechanism responsible for the metastasis of prostate cancer to bone: (i) SPARC attracts and subsequently anchors metastatic tumor cells within the bone; (ii) cell-surface αv integrins mediate the migration of prostate tumor cells to bone and, subsequently, the retention and adaptation of the tumor cells within their new microenvironment; (iii) VEGF and its receptors regulate integrin activity to influence the recognition of the bone matrix; and finally, (iv) engagement of SPARC by the integrins induces VEGF production to support bone remodeling and neovascularization to nourish the metastatic tumor. Cell Lines and Materials—The LNCaP lineage-derived human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP-C4-2, is androgen-independent and highly tumorigenic, with a proclivity to metastasize to bone (33Thalmann G.N.N. Sikes R.A. Wu T.T. Degeorges A. Chang S.M. Ozen M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Prostate. 2000; 44: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). All human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, LNCaP-C4-2, PC3, and lacZ-transfected CWR22R (H-clones), kindly provided by Dr. Lloyd A. Culp (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant SPARC was expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously (34Bradshaw A.D. Bassuk J.A. Francki A. Sage E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived purified SPARC was obtained from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Fibronectin was purchased from Roche Diagnostics, and collagen type I was obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies against αvβ3 (LM609), αvβ5 (P1F6), α5β1 (JBS5), and α2β1 (BHA2.1) integrins were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-VEGF and anti-VEGFR-2 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was obtained from Sigma, and WOW-1 was provided by Dr. Shattil, La Jolla, CA. cRGDfV peptide was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (San Carlos, CA). Preparation of Bone Extracts—SPARC-null and control mice of the same genetic background were generated as described previously (23Delany A.M. Amling M. Priemel M. Howe C. Baron R. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The SPARC-null mice do not contain detectable amounts of SPARC mRNA or protein. Bones excised from 6-week-old male wild-type and SPARC-null littermates (from pelvic region and limb) (1 g) were crushed and extracted for 24 h at 4 °C, as described previously (4Jacob K. Webber M. Benayahu D. Kleinman H.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4453-4457PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays on Transwell plates (8-μm pore size) were performed as described previously (27Byzova T.V. Kim W. Midura R.J. Plow E.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ligand (recombinant or purified SPARC or bone extract, fibronectin, and collagen) was diluted to a selected concentration, and 10 μl of this solution was placed on the lower surface of a polycarbonate filter and air-dried. Cell migration was performed in the presence of blocking antibodies against αvβ3, αvβ5, α5β1, and α2β1, neutralizing antibodies to VEGF, VEGFR-2, and PDGF (20 μg/ml each) or cRGDfV peptides (20 μm). Flow Cytometry—WOW-1, a Fab fragment, reacts selectively with activated αvβ3 and αvβ5 (29Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Its binding to cells was assessed by flow cytometry, as described previously (16Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In selected experiments, cells were preincubated for 5 min in the presence of an inhibitor (anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibodies or VEGFR2/Fc chimera; 20 μg/ml each). WOW-1 Fab was then added at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml, followed by the addition of Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 15 μg/ml. After 30 min, the cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Specific binding of WOW-1 Fab was defined as that which could be inhibited by 10 mm EDTA. Flow cytometry was performed with a FACScan instrument, and the data were analyzed with the CellQuest software program (version 1.2). Proliferation Assays—These assays were performed as described (35Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in 1% serum for 20 h prior to experiments. Trypsinized cells were distributed into 96-well microtiter plates (2 × 105 cells/well) in the presence or absence of inhibitors. The cells were labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine per well. After 24-48 h, the cells were washed, and the radioactivity was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and quantified by scintillation counting. Soft Agar Assays—LNCaP-C4-2 cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in 0.4% Bacto-agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) prepared in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on the top of 0.7% agar in the presence or absence of VEGFR-2/Fc chimera or anti-VEGFR-2 blocking antibodies (10 μg/ml each). After 5 days, the colonies were photographed, and the number of colonies per power field was quantified 7 days after plating. Relative Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA from two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LNCaP-C4-2) was prepared with RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were plated in wells, which were left uncoated (control) or were coated with SPARC (200 ng/well), anti-αvβ5 integrin antibodies (P1F6), or control nonimmune IgG (10 μg/ml each). In selected experiments cRGDfV (20 μm) was added to the cells; after specific time periods of incubation at 37 °C, RNA was isolated. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The forward primer was 5′-GAGGAGTCCAACATCACCATGC-3′, located on exon 3; the reverse primer was 5′-CGTTTAACTCAAGCTGCCTCGCC-3′, located on exon 6. A comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method as described previously by Livak and Schmittgen (36Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar) was used to detect relative gene expression where gene expression in treated samples was measured by the quantitation of cDNA converted from an mRNA. The mRNA corresponded to a VEGF gene relative to an untreated control sample, which served as a physiological reference. All quantitations of VEGF gene were normalized to an endogenous control, GAPDH. Relative quantitation of VEGF mRNA expression was performed by the comparative Ct method (36Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar) with the formula 2-ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = [ΔCt VEGF (treated sample) - ΔCt GAPDH (treated sample)] - [ΔCt VEGF (calibrator/control sample) - Δ Ct GAPDH (calibrator/control sample)]. ΔCt represents the mean Ct value of each sample, and GAPDH is the endogenous control used to normalize all the quantifications of VEGF gene. Alternatively, VEGF was measured by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems). Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of prostate cancer and bone metastasis were cut into 6-μm sections and stained with monoclonal antibodies against SPARC (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), CD31 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), αVβ3 integrin (Chemicon), and WOW-1 Fab and with antibody against VEGFR-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), using the antigen retrieval technique described previously (37Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Jankau J. Chen J. Cabrera G. Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Carnevale K.A. Siemionow M. Deitcher S.R. DiCorleto P.E. Blood. 2002; 99: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin (Vector). A negative control was performed to ensure the specificity of peroxidase immunostaining by using nonimmune IgG. Sections were examined on an Olympus microscope, and representative areas were photographed using an Olympus digital camera. The quantitative data for the density of blood vessels and intensity of WOW-1 staining was obtained with the Image-Pro Plus program (version 4.5.1.22). Eight paired samples for primary prostate cancer and bone metastasis were analyzed. For each sample, five fields were quantified for the area of CD31-positive blood vessel and the density of WOW-1 staining. These two parameters were normalized to those of normal prostate tissue. The significance was calculated by using the paired t test in Excel. SPARC Plays a Critical Role in Prostate Cancer Cell Migration to Bone—In a previous study, SPARC was isolated as a protein for bone extracts that supported the preferential migration of prostate cancer cells. The development of SPARC-null mice (22Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1643A-11643PubMed Google Scholar, 23Delany A.M. Amling M. Priemel M. Howe C. Baron R. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) provides a means to critically address the role of SPARC in prostate tumor cell migration. Bone matrix proteins were extracted from wild-type (WT) and SPARC-null animals and were assessed for their ability to promote migration of prostate cancer cells that are known to metastasize to bone. In a Transwell system, migration of PC3 cells was directly proportional to the amount of bone extract and reached a maximum at 200 ng/well (Fig. 1A). Maximal migration of PC3 cells toward wild-type bone extract was about 4-fold higher than their migration toward SPARC-null bone extract. The deficient migration of PC3 cells toward the SPARC-deficient bone extracts was increased by 2.1-fold in the presence of recombinant SPARC at the concentration of 100 μm and completely restored by the addition of 300 μm SPARC (∼10-fold increase) (Fig. 1B). Addition of the most prominent cell matrix protein, fibronectin, also improved PC3 cell migration toward SPARC-null bone extract; however, the effect of fibronectin was relatively modest (∼2.5-fold in the presence of 300 μm) compared with SPARC at the same concentration (Fig. 1B). No significant improvement in PC3 cell migration was observed in the presence of collagen at the same concentrations (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when SPARC purified from platelets was added (data not shown). Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells Exhibit Increased Migration to SPARC—Next we compared the migration of LNCaP cells to that of its highly metastatic variant, LNCaP-C4-2. The maximal migration of LNCaP-C4-2 cells was 1.85-fold higher than that of LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). These data indicate a correlation between the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells and their migration to SPARC. We obtained similar results with other representative metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, namely PC3 and CWR22Rv1-H (not shown). By using wild-type and SPARC-null bone extracts, we demonstrated that SPARC is a crucial factor for the migration of highly metastatic LNCaP-C4-2 cells. In these experiments, migration toward wild-type bone extract was optimal at 100 ng of bone extract per well and was 2.87-fold higher than migration toward SPARC-null bone extract (Fig. 1C). Prostate Cancer Cell Migration to SPARC and Bone Matrix Proteins Is Mediated by Integrins and Controlled by VEGF—Because αvβ5 and αvβ3 have been implicated in the recognition of a number of bone-specific matrix proteins (24McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), we assessed the effects of specific anti-integrin blocking antibodies on prostate cancer cell migration to SPARC (Fig. 2). Blockade of αvβ3 and αvβ5 resulted in 35 and 70% inhibition of LNCaP-C4-2 cell migration to SPARC, respectively, indicating a role of both integrins in the response (Fig. 2B). In contrast, blockade of either α5β1 or α2β1 integrin had no effect on the migration of LNCaP-C4-2 cell to SPARC (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with PC3 cells (data not shown). Significant inhibition with cyclic RGDfV peptide (70-80%), which is a relatively specific antagonist of αvβ5, substantiates a primary role for this integrin in migration to SPARC. Direct interaction of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells with SPARC and the cooperative roles of αvβ5 and αvβ3 were also demonstrable in adhesion assays (not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that recognition of SPARC is mediated by these integrins. In previous studies, we and others (16Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Masood R. Cai J. Zheng T. Smith D.L. Hinton D.R. Gill P.S. Blood. 2001; 98: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the adhesive and migratory phenotypes of certain tumor cells are sustained by an autocrine loop initiated by VEGF. Prostate cancer cells express high levels of VEGF (18Ferrer F.A. Miller L.J. Lindquist R. Kowalczyk P. Laudone V.P. Albertsen P.C. Kreutzer D.L. Urology. 1999; 54: 567-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and VEGF production correlates with the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells (26Soker S. Kaefer M. Johnson M. Kagsbrun M. Atala A. Freeman M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The highly metastatic variant LNCaP-C4-2 produces higher amounts of VEGF compared with its nonmetastatic counterpart LNCaP (73.8 ± 8 pg/ml versus 19.5 ± 2.5 pg/ml after 72 h, respectively). Because prostate cancer cells not only produce VEGF but also express VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 by FACS), we postulated that the migration to SPARC could be controlled by a VEGF-dependent autocrine loop. Therefore, we assessed the effects of VEGF and VEGFR antagonists on the migration of prostate cancer cells to SPARC. As shown in Fig. 2C for LNCaP and LNCaP-C4-2, anti-VEGF- and anti-VEGFR-2-neutralizing antibodies antagonized the migration of prostate cancer cells to SPARC to a level similar to that obtained with anti-integrin-blocking antibodies and the cRGDfV peptide (∼80% inhibition). In contrast, anti-PDGF-neutralizing antibodies inhibited the migration rate by ∼35%. These results suggest that αvβ5 and αvβ3, together with VEGF/VEGFR-2, play a critical role in prostate cancer cell migration to SPARC. Similar results were obtained when bone extracts were substituted for SPARC (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of SPARC, migration was significantly lower but still depended on αvβ5 and αvβ3 integrins and VEGF. We attribute this residual activity to the presence of other matrix proteins (e.g. bone sialoprotein and osteopontin), which are known to interact with αvβ5 and αvβ3 (27Byzova T.V. Kim W. Midura R.J. Plow E.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Tallini G. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). VEGF Supports Prostate Tumor Growth by Autocrine Stimulation of VEGFR-2—As shown in Fig. 4A, proliferation of LNCaP-C4-2 cells was inhibited by a blockade of VEGFR-2 by >70%. These data indicate that a VEGF-dependent autocrine loop, initiated by engagement of VEGFR-2, influences LNCaP-C4-2 growth. Because the anchorage-independent tumor growth is one of the defining characteristics of neoplastic transformation, we determined how the blockade of VEGF affects the growth of these prostate tumor cells in soft agar. When LNCaP-C4-2 cells were grown in the presence of anti-VEGF-neutralizing antibodies and VEGFR2/Fc, the number of colonies was significantly decreased (Fig. 4C). Of note, the size of colonies was also altered. In the presence of VEGF inhibitors, tumor colonies were significantly smaller (Fig. 4B). VEGF Activates Integrins on Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells by an Autocrine Loop in Vitro and in Vivo—To assess the molecular basis for increased recognition of SPARC by integrins on metastatic prostate cancer cells, we analyzed the activation state of their αv integrins using WOW-1 Fab (29Pampori N.

As monitored by FACS (Fig. 5A), WOW-1 binding to LNCaP-C4-2 cells is 4.2 times higher than to LNCaP cells, despite the expression of similar levels of αVβ3 and αVβ5 by both cell lines (specific fluorescence intensity values were 15 ± 3 and 13 ± 5 for αVβ3 and 18 ± 4 and 20 ± 6 for αVβ5). These data indicate that the functional activity of αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins is higher on the metastatic variant of prostate cells. In addition, Fig. 5A demonstrates that integrin activation can be inhibited by neutralization of VEGF, because anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies inhibited WOW-1 binding by >60%. We also analyzed two other metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and CWR22Rv1. Integrin activation monitored by WOW-1 binding was inhibited by >50% when VEGF or VEGFR-2 were neutralized. αVβ3 and αVβ5 are present in an activated state on prostate tumor cells in vivo (Fig. 5B). Tumor areas were stained with WOW-1. The pattern of WOW-1 staining was similar but more restricted than that of LM609, the first demonstration of αVβ3 activation in vivo. VEGFR-2, which is critical for induction of the VEGF-dependent autocrine loop, colocalized with activated αVβ3 and αVβ5, supporting the concept that engagement of VEGFR-2 by VEGF induces integrin activation. Interestingly, in the sites of bone metastasis, but not in the primary prostate adenocarcinoma, SPARC expression within or around invading tumor follows WOW-1 expression, indicating colocalization and possible interaction (Fig. 6, A and C). SPARC Increases VEGF Levels via α v β 5 Integrin Ligation in Prostate Cancer Cells—Because VEGF affects SPARC engagement by integrins, we considered whether SPARC engagement might alter VEGF production and hence the autocrine loop. Accordingly, we assessed VEGF production in LNCaP and LNCaP-C4-2 cells plated on SPARC. After 3 or 4 h, the VEGF mRNA level in the LNCaP-C4-2 cells was increased 1.35- or 1.75-fold, respectively, and reached a maximum value (2.8-fold) after 6 h (Fig. 5C). The increase detected in metastatic LNCaP-C4-2 cells in VEGF mRNA after 6 h was 1.65-fold greater than in nonmetastatic LNCaP cells, and in all of these cases, the Ct value of GAPDH was ∼16. Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that VEGF expression was also altered at the protein level and that blockade of αVβ5 with cRGDfV peptide suppressed VEGF production in LNCaP-C4-2 and LNCaP cells by 3.57 ± 0.16- and 2.1 ± 0.1-fold, respectively. Thus, ligation of αVβ5 by SPARC amplifies VEGF production and provides metastatic prostate cancer cells with a significant growth advantage in the bone matrix. In similar experiments using M21 melanoma cells that do not metastasize to bone but which express comparable amounts of αVβ3 and αVβ5 to LNCaP-C4-2 cells, we did not observe any increase in VEGF production at 3, 4, 6, or 12 h after plating onto SPARC. In fact, VEGF expression decreased by 40% compared with control (data not shown). We can tentatively conclude that the increased production of VEGF by SPARC via αVβ5 is a characteristic displayed by the prostate cancer cells tested. Activation State of α V β 3 and α V β 5 Integrins Is Increased in Bone Metastasis—The intensity of WOW-1 staining in primary tumor located within the prostate and tumor that metastasized to bone (matched pairs of tissue samples obtained from the same patient) were compared. An example of such paired specimens is shown in Fig. 6, B and D. Quantitative aspects of WOW-1 staining in prostate in comparison to bone metastasis are shown in Fig. 6E. This analysis reveals that the intensity of WOW-1 staining was 4-fold higher at the sites of bone metastasis. As anticipated, vascular density was significantly (19-fold) higher at these sites compared with the tumor within the prostate itself (Fig. 6F). Our results indicate that αVβ3 is activated in prostate tumors in vivo. Moreover, the extent of activation is significantly increased in the sites of bone metastasis compared with the localized tumor. Previous studies have implicated SPARC, integrins, and VEGF as major players in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Our study develops a cohesive model which may explain the interrelationship between these molecules and account for the high osteotropism of prostate cancer metastasis. The major elements of this model are shown in Fig. 7 and are supported by the following findings. (i) SPARC is a key protein that attracts prostate cancer cells to bone. SPARC-deficient bone extracts support minimal migration of prostate cancer cells, and the addition of purified SPARC restores the rate of cell migration. (ii) Recognition of SPARC correlates with the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cell lines. High metastatic variants exhibit increased migration to SPARC compared with nonmetastatic ones. (iii) SPARC recognition is mediated by αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins and is controlled by an autocrine loop in which VEGF engages VEGFR-2. (iv) VEGF supports prostate cancer cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. (v) Increased migration of metastatic cells to SPARC can be traced to the activation of αVβ3 and αVβ5 as monitored by WOW-1. Activation of these integrins is substantially higher on metastatic versus nonmetastic prostate cancer cells. Moreover, activated integrins are expressed by prostate tumors in vivo and colocalize with VEGFR-2. (vi) A particularly relevant pathophysiological consequence of SPARC recognition by αVβ5 is the up-regulation of VEGF production, which provides prostate cancer cells with a significant growth advantage in bone tissue. (vii) At sites of metastasis characterized by abundant SPARC, high VEGF production, and enhanced neovascularization, αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrin activation is substantially higher in comparison to the tumor localized in the prostate. Metastatic prostate cancer cells exhibit low migration to SPARC-deficient bone extracts, and the addition of recombinant SPARC completely rescues this response in a concentration-dependent manner. Although fibronectin was ∼5-fold less potent compared with SPARC, it also provided a certain increase in prostate cancer cell migration, which was due to the high level of expression of α5β1 (fibronectin receptor) on these cells. Our results strongly support the findings of Jacob et al. (4Jacob K. Webber M. Benayahu D. Kleinman H.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4453-4457PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that extracts from bones but not from other tissues promoted a 4-fold increase in the invasive ability of human prostate carcinoma cells, with SPARC but not any other matrix protein as the factor responsible for this activity. In our studies, purified SPARC supported the enhanced migration of the metastatic prostate cancer cells LNCaP-C4-2 and PC3, compared with the nonmetastatic variant LNCaP. Thus, migration to SPARC positively correlates with a characterized metastatic potential of cell lines. We demonstrated that the cell adhesion receptors responsible for migration to SPARC are integrin αVβ5 and, to a lesser extent, αVβ3, but not α5β1 and α2β1. The differences in the migratory activity of metastatic versus nonmetastatic cell lines can be explained by the differences in the activation state of the bone matrix receptors αVβ5 and αVβ3, as demonstrated by WOW-1 binding. Activated integrins are known to be responsible for increased cell migration and adhesion on a variety of cell types, including tumor cells. Thus, our results provide an explanation for the previously reported increased usage of αVβ3 by the metastatic subline LNCaP-C4-2 versus LNCaP cells in the migration to laminin (30Edlund M. Miyamoto T. Sikes R.A. Ogle R. Laurie G.W. Farach-Carson M.C. Otey C.A. Zhau H.E. Chung L.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). The integrin activation state and the recognition of SPARC are controlled by a VEGF-dependent autocrine loop, because the neutralization of VEGF or the inhibition of its receptor VEGFR-2 decreases WOW-1 binding and cell migration. Furthermore, activated αVβ3 colocalizes with VEGFR-2 on tumor cells in vivo. The existence of growth factor-dependent autocrine loop, which, in addition to the effect on the integrin functions, also supports tumor growth, is the most recently uncovered characteristic of malignant phenotype (16Byzova T.V.

Atala A. Freeman M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of the increased VEGF production and autocrine stimulation, integrin activation is significantly higher on the metastatic prostate cancer cells compared with the nonmetastatic cells in vitro and, at sites of bone metastasis compared with the original prostate tumor, in vivo. Thus, at least two lines of evidence demonstrate that the integrin activation state controlled by VEGF contributes to the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer. These findings link together previously published observations that increased integrin function (31Pecheur I. Peyearuchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J. Voland C. Bourre F. Margue C. Cohen-Solal M. Buffet A. Kieffer N. Clezardin P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1266-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) as well as increased VEGF plasma levels in patients (32Jones A. Fujiyama C. Turner K. Fuggle S. Cranston D. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. B. J. U. Int. 2000; 85: 276-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are hallmarks of metastasis development. We found that SPARC not only attracts prostate cancer cells to bone but also, by means of the ligation of integrin αVβ5, further increases VEGF production by metastatic cancer cells and provides an additional enhancement of the VEGF autocrine loop. In turn, VEGF facilitates the accommodation of tumor cells in the bone environment by stimulation of the growth of the tumor itself by a further increase of integrin activation on the tumor and by the induction of neovessel formation. Thus, high levels of SPARC at sites of bone metastasis lead to an increase in VEGF and integrin activation. Our results not only suggest a model to explain the osteotropism of prostate cancer metastasis but also to identify potential targets to prevent the process. For example, SPARC, activated integrins, VEGF, or VEGFR-2 would be candidate targets to interfere with metastatic process. Because prevention of bone metastasis is paramount to effective treatment of prostate cancer, these targets are particularly worthwhile pursuing."

Despite extensive studies, its biological function has remained obscure. Here we show that apolipoprotein J inhibits neuroblastoma cell invasion. Since this function can be regulated by NF-κB, we explored the possibility that apolipoprotein J might interfere with NF-κB signaling. Ectopic apolipoprotein J expression strongly inhibited NF-κB activity in human neuroblastoma cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts by stabilizing inhibitors of NF-κB (IκBs). Steady state levels of IκB proteins are drastically reduced in mouse embryo fibroblasts after disruption of the apolipoprotein J gene. Absence of apolipoprotein J causes reduction of IκB stability, a tumor necrosis factor-dependent increase in NF-κB activity, increased transcription of the NF-κB target gene c-IAP and down-modulation of p53 protein. These results suggest that an unexpected physiological role of apolipoprotein J is to inhibit NF-κB signaling through stabilization of IκBs and that this activity may result in suppression of tumor cell motility.

Sci. 2000; 25: 95-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The product of the apoJ gene consists of a predominant form of about 75 kDa, which is secreted in the extracellular spaces and body fluids. The 449-amino acid primary polypeptide chain of human apoJ is proteolytically cleaved into the α and β chains. Five disulfide bridges link the two subunits to obtain the mature form of the protein. ApoJ is highly conserved in different species, showing a 70–80% protein homology in mammals (1Jones S.E. Jomary C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Its expression is low in normal conditions but is greatly induced by oxidative, thermal, and apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that apoJ function could be directly or indirectly related to the cell suicide program and/or the stress response. The biological role of apoJ is still controversial. Several studies have suggested that apoJ has antiapoptotic activity, protecting cultured cell lines against a variety of stress signals. Exogenously supplied apoJ protects tumor cells from cytokine- or drug-induced apoptosis and inhibition of apoJ results in the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (3Miyake H.

However, a nuclear apoJ form has been described which marks cells for apoptosis through its association with the DNA-repair protein KU70 (7Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J.

Mouse development is not affected by the absence of apoJ (8McLaughlin L. Zhu G. Mistry M. Ley-Ebert C. Stuart W.D. Florio C.J. Groen P.A. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Witte D.P. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, apoJ null mice show increased sensitivity to autoiimune myocarditis, suggesting a role for apoJ in protecting the heart tissue from postinflammatory destruction (8McLaughlin L. Zhu G. Mistry M. Ley-Ebert C. Stuart W.D. Florio C.J. Groen P.A. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Witte D.P. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of apoJ, mice are partially protected after hypoxic injury, suggesting that it can have a negative role in neuronal survival (9Han B.H. DeMattos R.B. Dugan L.L. Kim-Han J.S. Brendza R.P. Fryer J.D. Kierson M. Cirrito J. Quick K. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The prevailing hypothesis on the biological role of clusterin suggests that it is involved in the clearance of toxic substances from extracellular spaces through its ability to bind to unfolded proteins, cell debris, or immune complexes. ApoJ binds to the endocytic receptor Megalin (LRP-2), and the clearance effect would be achieved by internalization of the receptor-ligand complex and lysosomal degradation of the toxic substances (1Jones S.E. Jomary C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Trends Biochem.

ApoJ has been shown to be highly regulated during tumor progression and to be a B-MYB oncoprotein target gene (10Trougakos I.P. Gonos E.S. Int. J. Biochem.

In this study we have investigated whether apoJ expression may change tumor cell characteristics by impinging on specific signal transduction pathways. Cell Cultures and in Vitro Invasion Assay—The human neuroblastoma cell line LAN5 (11Seeger R.C. Danon Y.L. Rayner S.A. Hoover F. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 983-989PubMed Google Scholar), the amphotropic-packaging cell line Phoenix A (ATCC SD3444), and early passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 2 mm penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For in vitro invasion assays 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of medium containing no serum and seeded on top of the invasion assay chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with medium containing 5% fetal calf serum that served as chemo-attractant. After 24 h, cells were collected in the bottom chamber and scored as described in the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Retroviral infection of LAN5 and MEFs cells was carried out as described previously (12Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The complete apolipoprotein J cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from LAN5 cells. Correct amplification was assessed by sequencing. The blunt PCR product was cloned into HpaI-digested MIGR1 retroviral vector (12Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). The apoJ cDNA was cloned into BamHI, EcoRV-digested pCDNA3 to obtain pCDNA3-APOJ. The NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid pNFκB-LUC, containing four copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence, is from Clontech. A c-Jun-responsive reporter vector, containing AP1-binding sites from the c-Jun promoter cloned upstream the luciferase gene, was obtained from Dr. J. Ham. The mutant IκB superrepressor cDNA was obtained by mutagenesis of the RT-PCR-amplified product, which was subcloned into the MIGR1 vector. Expression of the construct was verified by WB analysis with IκB α antibody, and its inhibitory function was verified by its ability to suppress activity of the pNFκB-LUC plasmid in luciferase assays. The retroviral vector encoding for the constitutively active IKK kinase (IKKee) was published previously (13Huber M.A. Denk A. Peter R.U. Weber L. Kraut N. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—MEFs and LAN5 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg of the pNFκB-LUC reporter plasmid in combination with 0.5 μg of empty pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-APOJ in 35-mm wells. After 18 h, cells were exposed to 0.5 μg/ml doxorubicin or 50 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for 8 h, harvested, and monitored for luciferase activity with a dual-luciferase assay kit, following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Light emission was evaluated with the aid of a luminometer and expressed as light units, which were normalized with a Renilla luciferase reference plasmid. RT-PCR—After reverse transcription, PCR was performed with the following primers: APOJ forward, 5′-ATGAAGATTCTCCTGCTGCG-3′; APOJ reverse, 5′-CTTCACCACCACCTCAGTG; GAPDH forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC; GAPDH reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the linear range of amplification. c-IAP-1 primers were the following: forward primer, 5′-GGACATTAGGAGTCTTCCC; reverse primer, 5′-GCTGGGAGTGACAGTGAAC. Protein Stability and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For protein stability experiments, 293 cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding for the IκB mutant (Ser32/36) and incubated with cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) for the indicated times with or without protease inhibitor. Protease inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO, which was added (0.2%) to untreated cells as a control. We have assessed IκB mutant expression by Western blotting with a hemagglutinin-tag antibody. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (14Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ApoJ Negatively Regulates Neuroblastoma Cell Invasion— We wanted to determine whether ectopic apoJ expression interferes with the invasive behavior of neuroblastoma cells. Since human neuroblastoma cells are difficult to transiently transfect, we subcloned the apoJ cDNA into the MIGR1 retroviral vector and we transduced LAN5 cells with the apoJ-expressing, or control, retroviruses. The MIGR1 vector contains the enhanced GFP gene and allows simultaneous expression of the inserted cDNA through the presence of an IRES sequence (l2). GFP-positive cells were isolated by FACS sorting and subjected to in vitro invasion assays. ApoJ overexpression drastically reduced the number of cells migrating in the bottom of the well, suggesting that it may suppress cell invasion (Fig. 1A). Cells transduced with a dominant-negative IκB (inhibitor of κ)-α molecule, which behaves as a NF-κB super-repressor (15Didonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were less prone to invade the matrigel substrate, suggesting that, as in other tumor models (16Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), NF-κB activity is important for neuroblastoma cell-invasive properties (Fig. 1B). Consistent with this hypothesis, a constitutively active IKK kinase (IKKee), which induces degradation of inhibitors of κB (IκB) and activation of NF-κB, significantly promotes invasion of LAN5 cells in vitro (Fig. 1C). Notably, concurrent apoJ expression drastically reduced the number of IKKee-transfected cells migrating through the matrigel membrane, suggesting that apoJ activity impinges on the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 1C). To assess whether apoJ could directly interfere with the IKK kinase, we carried out in vitro kinase assays, which established that apoJ does not inhibit IKK kinase activity (Fig. 1D). The conclusion drawn from these experiment is (a) NF-κB is required for in vitro invasion of neuroblastoma cells and (b) apoJ inhibits this function downstream the IKK kinase. ApoJ Specifically Inhibits NF-κB Activity and Enhances Stability of Inhibitors of NF-κB in Cancer Cell Lines—To directly assess whether ectopic apoJ expression can modulate NF-κB activity, we transfected LAN-5 cells with a CMV-driven apoJ cDNA together with a NF-κB-responsive promoter linked to luciferase. Basal or doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activity is strongly inhibited in LAN5 cells transfected with the apoJ expression vector (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with another neuroblastoma cell line, SHSY5Y (not shown). The experiments described in the above section (Fig. 1) insinuate that apoJ biological effects could be achieved, at least in part, by interfering with factors downstream the IKK kinase. Indeed, we found that apoJ expression enhances IκB-α/β, but not tubulin, levels and that doxorubicin down-modulates IκB expression more efficiently in control than in apoJ-transduced cells (Fig. 2B). IκB proteins play a key role in maintaining the NF-κB molecule in an inactive state (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, extrinsic expression of apoJ prolongs the half-life of the IκB Ser32/36 mutant (IκB-M, used in the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 1B), which is refractory to signal-dependent (i.e. IKK-dependent) degradation (Fig. 2C). Both signal-dependent and -independent IκB degradation can occur through IκB ubiquitination, which is followed by proteasome degradation (19Pando M.P. Verma I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21278-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and apoJ, but not the calpain inhibitor calpeptin, prolongs ectopically expressed IκB-M half-life. (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that apoJ modulates both signal-dependent and -independent IκB turnover downstream the IKK kinase. To assess the specificity of the apoJ-suppressing effect on NF-κB activity, we transfected neuroblastoma cells with NFκB- or AP-1-responsive promoters, with or without the apoJ expression vector, and carried out luciferase assays. ApoJ induced a ∼70% inhibition of the NF-κB-responsive promoter, but it decreased only slightly Jun promoter activity, suggesting that apoJ significantly suppresses NFκB-dependent, but not AP-1-dependent, transactivation (Fig. 2, E and F). Deletion of the apoJ amino terminus, containing the protein export signal, did not change its activity, indicating that cytoplasmic, but not secreted, apoJ is involved in suppression of NF-κB activity (data not shown). ApoJ Knock-out Causes Enhanced NF-κB Response after Genotoxic Stress in Primary Fibroblasts—To explore the role of apoJ signaling in a normal cell context, we assessed NF-kB activity in embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from normal or apoJ knock-out mice. Basal activity of the NF-κB reporter plasmid was higher in apoJ knock-out MEFs compared with control cells (3.6 ± 0.65 versus 6.8 ± 1.2, Fig. 3). Notably, apoJ null, but not control, MEFs show a peak of NF-κB activity after exposure to doxorubicin (Fig. 3, A and B). Reconstitution of apoJ expression results in suppression of the NF-κB response in doxorubicin-treated apoJ null MEFs (Fig. 3B). Expression of endogenous apoJ in primary fibroblasts was detectable in control but not in apoJ knock-out MEFs, as expected (Fig. 3C). Reduced IκB Protein Levels in ApoJ Knock-out Fibroblasts—A classical signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB activation is that triggered by the tumor necrosis factor receptor. IκB-β, and to a lesser extent IκB-α, protein levels are significantly reduced in fibroblasts from apoJ knock-out embryos in the presence of TNF stimulus (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, IκB β protein expression is drastically decreased in apoJ knock-out MEFs, even in the absence of TNF (Fig. 4A). While protease inhibitors did not modulate IκB-β levels in normal fibroblasts, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the calpain inhibitor calpeptin, rescued IκB protein levels in apoJ knock-out cells (Fig. 4B). This experiment demonstrates that, even in the absence of specific stimuli, IκB-β is more susceptible to proteasome-dependent degradation in the apoJ knock-out background, which probably justifies the higher basal NF-κB activity observed in apoJ-null cells. Northern analysis shows that IκB-β mRNA is robustly expressed in apoJ knock-out cells, indicating that endogenous apoJ expression does not affect transcription of the IκB-β gene (Fig. 4C). Reconstitution of apoJ expression restores, at least in part, IκB-β protein levels in apoJ knock-out cells (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 2 and 3), confirming that differences in IκB expression are related to the absence of apoJ and not due to clonal variations. Overall these results indicate that endogenous levels of apoJ are critically required for steady state IκB-β, and to a less extent IκB-α, protein levels. NF-κB Target Genes Expression Is Altered in ApoJ Knockout Cells—An important prediction drawn from these experiments is that NF-κB target genes expression should be modulated in the absence of apoJ. We have verified this hypothesis by transiently transfecting apoJ knock-out, or control, MEFs with the NF-κB reporter vector in the presence of TNF. TNF-dependent, as well as independent, NF-κB activity is substantially increased in apoJ knock-out cells, as compared with wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 5A, bottom). We furthered this finding by examining mRNA levels of the NF-κB-target gene c-IAP (20Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). In comparison with wild type cells, c-IAP-1 mRNA levels were increased in both TNF-treated, or untreated, apoJ knock-out fibroblasts (Fig. 5A, upper side). We have repeated this experiment with two more independent MEF preparations with similar results. It has been shown, by Verma and co-workers (21Tergaonkar V. Pando M. Vafa O. Wahl G. Verma I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), that p53 protein stability is negatively regulated by endogenous levels of NF-κB and that p53 levels are decreased in mouse embryo fibroblasts with activated NF-κB. In agreement with this observation, we found that p53 protein levels are significantly decreased in apoJ knock-out fibroblasts (Fig. 5B). Albeit basal expression of p53 protein is reduced in apoJ knockout fibroblasts, it is detectable after longer Western blot exposures, and it is induced by chemotherapeutic drugs treatment (data not shown). Overall these experiments demonstrate that the gene and protein expression patterns of apolipoprotein J knock-out fibroblasts are consistent with that of cells with activated NF-κB. NF-κB is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes and is constitutively expressed in many cancer cell types. Its activity is regulated through interaction with inhibitory molecules (IκBs) that modulate NF-κB function by sequestering it in inactive cellular sites or by suppressing its transcriptional activity (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). IκBs, are, in turn, subjected to phosphorylation by kinases (IKKs) that mark for their destruction, or inactivation, resulting in the release of active NF-κB (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Modulation of NF-κB activity is though to be important for cell survival, stress response, immunity, cell motility, proliferation, and transformation (16Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). In this investigation we have reported the crucial role of apoJ in controlling IκB expression and NF-κB activity in normal and tumorigenic cells. Regulation of NF-κB activity could satisfactorily explain apoJ opposing effects in different systems. Heart damage is exacerbated in apoJ-deficient mice subjected to experimental autoimmune myocarditis (8McLaughlin L. Zhu G. Mistry M. Ley-Ebert C. Stuart W.D. Florio C.J. Groen P.A. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Witte D.P. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ApoJ expression could be required to suppress excessive NF-κB activation, which determines inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in autoimmune myocarditis in the rat (22Yokoseki O. Suzuki J. Kitabayashi H. Watanabe N. Wada Y. Aoki M. Morishita R. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Futamatsu H. Kobayashi Y. Isobe M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also suggested by our observation that disruption of the apoJ gene results in increased NF-κB response evoked by the inflammatory cytokine TNF (Fig. 5). In contrast, apoJ contributes to brain injury in a study of experimental hypoxia-ischemia, where it has been shown that exogenous clusterin increases cortical neuron death induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation (9Han B.H. DeMattos R.B. Dugan L.L. Kim-Han J.S. Brendza R.P. Fryer J.D. Kierson M. Cirrito J. Quick K. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since NF-κB activation is required for the survival of cortical neurons subjected to ischemia (23Blondeau N. Widmann C. Lazdunski M. Heurteaux C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4668-4677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suppression of NF-κB function could be at the base of clusterin neurotoxicity. Loss of apoJ expression in cells that depend on NF-κB activity for chemoresistance, proliferation, or invasion could lead to tumor progression. In this regard, we show that acutely expressed apoJ can drastically reduce the in vitro invasive properties of neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1). Consistent with our results, Sivamurthy et al. (24Sivamurthy N. Stone D.H. Logerfo F.W. Quist W.C. J. Vasc. Surg. 2001; 34: 716-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have recently shown that exogenously supplied apoJ inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration in microchemotaxis chambers. TNF-induced vascular smooth cell migration depends on NF-κB-mediated regulation of key cytokines (25Wang Z. Castresana M.R. Newman W.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments we have observed that apoJ suppresses the metastatic phenotype of neuroblastoma xenografts in immunocompromised mice. 2G. Santilli, J. Anderson, and A. Sala, manuscript in preparation. The apoJ gene chromosomal location is at 8p21, a region commonly deleted in human cancers. We propose that apoJ could be a tumor suppressor protein required to control tumorigenic signals emanating from the NF-κB pathway. This could explain why advanced testicular tumors show greatly reduced expression of apoJ compared with lower grade tumors or normal tissue (26Behrens P. Jeske W. Wernert N. Wellmann A. Pathobiology. 2001; 69: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In other cancer types, apoJ expression could be advantageous through reduced expression of NF-κB-regulated death receptors and increased resistance to genotoxin-induced apoptosis, as reported previously (27Spalding A.C. Jotte R.M. Scheinman R.I. Geraci M.W. Clarke P. Tyler K.L. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Deletion of the protein export signal does not change the ability of apoJ to regulate NF-κB (data not shown), suggesting that this biological function depends on intracellular apoJ. How apoJ mechanistically regulates IκB protein turnover needs to be clarified. We have determined that apoJ does not directly bind to IκB α or β (data not shown). The stabilization effect could be achieved by direct regulation of IκB-interacting proteins or relevant ubiquitin ligases. In this regard, a recently described new class of RAS-like proteins suppress NF-κB function by directly binding to IκB molecules, resulting in their stabilization (14Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Verification of these hypotheses will be the subject for future investigations.

SM is also a dietary component and is mainly present in milk, eggs, meat, and marine products (1Zeisel S.H. Char D. Sheard N.F. J.

Hydrolysis of SM generates ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate that have regulatory effects on numerous cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Hannun Y.A.

An enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of SM with optimal alkaline pH was first identified in the intestinal content of human and intestinal mucosa of rat and pig by Nilsson (10Nilsson Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and was named alkaline SMase (alk-SMase) thereafter (11Duan R.-D. Nyberg L. Nilsson Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that alk-SMase may be responsible for digestion of dietary SM and for hydrolysis of endogenous SM derived from bile and from the brush borders of sloughed mucosal cells. SM metabolism in the intestine may have implications in colon cancer development. Dietary supplement with SM and ceramide analogues was found to inhibit development of chemically induced colon cancer in animal studies (12Dillehay D.L. Webb S.K. Schmelz E.-M. Merrill A.H. J.

We previously found that alk-SMase activity was significantly reduced in the tissues of human colon adenomas and carcinomas (15Hertervig E. Nilsson Å. Nyberg L. Duan R.-D.

Lofberg R. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2002; 8: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), indicating that the reduced SM hydrolysis in the gut may increase the susceptibility of the colonic mucosa to carcinogenic factors. SM metabolism in the gut may also affect cholesterol absorption, because both dietary SM in the gut (18Nyberg L. Duan R.-D. Nilsson Å. J. Nutr.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The enzyme has several properties that distinguish it from acid and neutral SMases. Its activity was not dependent on divalent ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, not inhibited by glutathione, and was resistant to trypsin digestion (11Duan R.-D. Nyberg L. Nilsson Å. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was specifically dependent on taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate, two taurine-conjugated primary bile salts, and was inhibited by other common detergents such as Triton X-100 and CHAPS (21Cheng Y.

By using the immunogold technique, the enzyme was demonstrated on the surface of human intestinal brush borders, in endosome-like structures, and in Golgi complexes (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G.

Western blotting of rat tissues only found the enzyme protein in the intestine and not in other organs including brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and pancreas (21Cheng Y. Nilsson Å. Tömquist E. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot also demonstrated that the enzyme protein was reduced in human colon cancer tissues compared with the surrounding normal tissues (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J.

In this paper, from the purified enzyme we identified the full amino acid and cDNA sequences for the human intestinal alk-SMase. We found that the enzyme is a novel ecto-enzyme related to the nucleotide phosphodiesterase (NPP) family with specific features in terms of substrate specificity and metal ion dependence. Human small intestinal contents were collected from ileostomy stomas of six individuals as described (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J.

DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF, [32P]dCTP, [14C]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, [3H]choline chloride, and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Uno Q anion exchange chromatography cartridge, pre-packed SE gel chromatography column, biologic HR protein purification system, and isoelectrofocusing instrument Rotofor were obtained from Bio-Rad. pCMV-Sport 6 with a cDNA insert (clone ID IMAGE 5186743) was purchased from ResGen (Huntsville, AL). pCDNA4/myc-His™B, anti-Myc antibody, and all primers used were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-human alk-SMase antibody was developed in AgriSera AB (Vännäs, Sweden) using our purified human alk-SMase (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human digestive system Northern blot was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). p-Nitrophenyl thymidine 5′-monophosphate (pNTMP), p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphate (pNPP), taurocholate (TC), ATP, ADP, AMP, neutral SMase from Bacillus cereus, and other chemicals used in characterization were purchased from Sigma. SMase Assay—Alk-SMase activity was determined by methods described previously (24Duan R.D. Nilsson Å. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 276-286Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the purification experiment, 5 μl of samples were mixed with 95 μlof50mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm TC (assay buffer), 0.1 mm SM, and 0.80 μm [14C]SM (∼8000 dpm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 s. An aliquot (100 μl) of the upper phase containing the cleaved phosphocholine was analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation. For characterization studies, unless otherwise stated, the purified human intestinal alk-SMase sample was first diluted to 2.5 μg/ml. Five μl of the diluted sample was added in the assay buffer described above containing the reagents tested to a final volume of 80 μl. The reaction was started by adding 80 pmol of [14C-SM] (∼8000 dpm) in 20 μl of assay buffer. After 30 min of incubation, the reaction was terminated as above. The activity of neutral SMase was determined in a similar way with modifications of the buffer as described (21Cheng Y. Nilsson Å. Tömquist E. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Human Intestinal Alk-SMase—The purification of human intestinal alk-SMase has been described recently (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly the intestinal content collected was lyophilized and redissolved in ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl containing 1 mm benzamidine and 1 mm PMSF. The soluble proteins were precipitated by ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing 1 mm benzamidine and 1 mm PMSF and subjected stepwise to DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography, Uno Q high affinity ion exchange chromatography, native isoelectrofocusing, and SE gel chromatography. The purity of the enzyme was visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained by silver staining. Determination of Amino Acid Sequence and MALDI Mass Mapping of Fragments—The purified enzyme was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the enzyme was stained by Coomassie Blue. The stained protein band was cut from the gel and placed in an Eppendorf tube for in-gel digestion (25Oppermann M. Cols N. Nyman T. Helin J. Saarinen J. Byman I. Toran N. Alaiya A.A. Bergman T. Kalkkinen N. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4713-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Washing was carried out in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 50% acetonitrile. The protein was reduced by dithiothreitol and alkylated by iodoacetamide, followed by in-gel digestion with 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega, modified) in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were extracted using acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, first at 60% and then at 40%. The peptide extracts were separated, and fragments were isolated on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for sequence analysis using a Microblotter system (Applied Biosystems). Edman degradation of polyvinylidene difluoridebound peptides was carried out with a Procise cLC sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (26Bergman A.-C. Oppermann M. Oppermann U. Jörnvall H. Bergman T. Kamp R.M. Kyriakidis D. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Proteome and Protein Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 81-87Crossref Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments from in-gel digestion was carried out using Voyager DE Pro instrument (Applied Biosystems). Identification was based on comparison of theoretical mass values for tryptic fragments derived from the cDNA sequence and the masses detected in the in-gel digest (26Bergman A.-C. Oppermann M. Oppermann U. Jörnvall H. Bergman T. Kamp R.M. Kyriakidis D. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Proteome and Protein Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 81-87Crossref Google Scholar). Transient Expression—Based on the information of amino acid sequence (415 amino acid residues) obtained from the purified enzyme, we found in the GenBank™ an incomplete cDNA segment (clone ID, IMAGE 5186743) which was derived from a pool of colon, kidney, and stomach and encodes our alk-SMase sequence. A plasmid containing the cDNA clone (pCMV-Sport 6) was then found commercially available and was purchased from ResGen. The cDNA insert of the pCMV-Sport 6 was amplified and sequenced. The translated amino acid sequence of the cDNA was compared with that obtained from purified human alk-SMase. To confirm that the cDNA does encode for human alk-SMase, COS-7 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cDNA insert in pCMV-Sport 6 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TCGGTACCGAAAGCATGAGAGGCCCGGCCGTACTC-3′ and 5′-TAGCGGCCGCCTGCGACCTCAGACAGAAGAAT-3′ and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA4/TO/myc-His B at KpnI and NotI sites. The COS-7 cells were transfected with the constructed plasmid in the presence of LipofectAMINE, followed by incubation of the cells for 48 h. Control cells were transfected with the mock plasmid in the same way as the transfected cells. At the end of incubation, the cell culture medium was collected, and the cells were lysed by a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm TC, followed by sonication for 10 s. After centrifugation at 12,000 relative centrifugal force for 10 min at 4 °C, the alk-SMase activity in the cell-free extract as well as in the cell culture medium of both transfected and control cells was determined. To confirm alkaline pH optimum, the SMase activities in the lysate of transfected cells were assayed in buffers with various pH values as described previously (21Cheng Y. Nilsson Å. Tömquist E. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The lysate of COS-7 cells (100 μl) after transfection was first pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μl of anti-Myc antibody for 1 h and then with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% suspension) for 2 h. The Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The Sepharose beads were then resuspended in 10 μl of lysis buffer, and alk-SMase activity in 5 μl of the suspension was determined. Another aliquot of the Sepharose beads (10 μl) was boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoresis. The membranes were probed with either anti-Myc antibody (1:2000) according to the method of the manufacturer or with anti-human alk-SMase antibody (1:500) according to the procedures described previously (22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used, and color development was carried out by a kit from Bio-Rad. Determination of SM, Phosphatidylcholine (PC), and Lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) in Cells—The determination of SM, PC, and lyso-PC in cells was performed as described previously (27Hedlund M. Svensson M. Nilsson A. Duan R.D. Svanborg C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief, COS-7 cells were labeled with [3H]choline chloride (0.5 μCi/ml) for 48 h and then transfected with the cDNA of alk-SMase or the vector alone as control. After 48 h of incubation, the total lipids in the cells were extracted and applied on a Silica Gel plate (60F, 0.25 mm) for thin layer chromatography. The plates were developed by chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:4, v/v/v) and the SM, PC, and lyso-PC bands were visualized by iodine vapor. The bands were scraped according to the internal standard, and the radioactivities in the bands were determined by liquid scintillation. Northern Blotting Analyses—A 439-bp DNA fragment of pCMV-Sport 6 with the cDNA insert was amplified by PCR using primer (5′-GGCCCGAGACGGGGTGAAGGCACGCTACATGACCCCCGCC-3′) and (5′-TGGCCCGTGGAGTCCGGCTCCCC-3′). The DNA fragment and a control probe (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method to specific activities of 3–7 × 108 cpm/μg. Human digestive system Northern blot membrane was hybridized with the labeled probes at 50 °C. After washing, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C for 3 days. The membrane was then stripped with boiled water in the presence of 0.5% SDS for 10 min and rehybridized with the control probe. Phylogenetic Tree—The protein sequences of several members of ecto-NPP family including NPP1 human (P22413), NPP1 rat (NP_445987), NPP1 mouse (NP_067547), NPP2 rat (Q64610), NPP2 mouse (Q9R1E6), NPP2 human (Q13822), NPP3 human (O14638), NPP3 rat (P97675), NPP4 human (NP_055751), NPP5 human (NP_067547), the rat protein (XP_221184), and the mouse protein (XP_137914), which are similar to NPP5 human with unknown functions, were downloaded from the GenBank™ (28Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Rapp B.A. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). To compare with human alk-SMase sequence, multiple sequence alignment was generated using Clustal W (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar). The pairwise distances were calculated using the program PROTDIST, and the phylogenetic tree was created using the program NEIGHBOR from the PHYLIP program package. One hundred replicates of distance matrices were calculated for bootstrapping. Characterization of Purified Human Alk-SMase—The purified human alk-SMase was diluted to 2.5 μg/ml. Unless otherwise stated, 5 μl of the samples were used in the characterization studies. Effects of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ were studied by determining the alk-SMase activities in the presence of various concentrations of the ions in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 9.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm TC. The influences of ATP, ADP, and AMP were examined by preincubation of alk-SMase in the assay buffer containing one of the nucleoside phosphates for 15 min before addition of the substrate [14C-SM]. The effects of sodium orthovanadate and imidazole were studied by assaying the enzyme activity in the assay buffer with the presence of the substances. Whether alk-SMase has NPP activities was examined by using pNTMP and pNPP as substrates in four different buffers with various divalent ions as described below. First the NPP activity of alk-SMase was determined in the buffer optimal for its activity against SM. In a second experiment, the activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, and 1 mm Mg2+ (30Clair T. Lee H.Y. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 996-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In a third experiment, activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m KCl and 1 mm Ca2+ (32Moe Jr., O.A. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6941-6946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the activities were assayed in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl with different concentrations of Zn2+ ranging from 0.0125 to 2 mm. In all determinations described above, 1 mm pNTMP or pNPP was present as substrate, and the production of p-nitrophenyl was kinetically analyzed at 405 nm every 15 min up to 1 h on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Activity of Alk-SMase against Lyso-PC—To examine whether alk-SMase has activity against lyso-PC, purified alk-SMase (30 ng) was incubated with 25 nmol of [14C]palmitoyl-labeled lyso-PC in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6 mm TC, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+ to a final volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The upper phase was acidified by acetic acid to pH about 4 and discarded after stirring and centrifugation. The total lipids in the lower phase were dried under nitrogen, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), and applied on a Silica Gel plate (60F, 0.25 mm) for thin layer chromatography. The plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50: 40:3:0.6) and stained with iodine vapor. The bands of lyso-PC and lyso-phosphatidic acid (lyso-PA) were scraped according to the positions of standard lyso-PC and lyso-PA. Under these conditions, the monoglyceride migrates with the solvent front and was also scraped. The radioactivity in each band was determined by liquid scintillation. Purification of Human Alk-SMase and Amino Acid Sequence—The procedure for alk-SMase purification followed the methods described recently, and the results obtained were similar (21Cheng Y. Nilsson Å. Tömquist E. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, the enzyme was not retained in DEAESepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.075 m NaCl. In phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the enzyme was retained on the column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris maleate buffer containing 1 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, and eluted by ammonium sulfate at about 0.75 m. In Uno Q high affinity anion exchange chromatography using 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.2, the enzyme was retained on the matrix and eluted by the buffer with 0.05 m NaCl. In native electrofocusing, the enzyme was focused at pH 6.6. In final SE gel chromatography, the activity of the enzyme was identified in a single protein peak. The purity of the protein was shown in Fig. 1. One protein band with molecular mass of 60 kDa was demonstrated (lane C), which is slightly bigger than that of rat intestinal alk-SMase (lane D). The amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was determined by MALDI mass mapping and Edman degradation. By this method, we were able to obtain a sequence that consisted of 415 amino acid residues as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2The amino acid sequence of alk-SMase identified via in-gel digestion and combination of Edman degradation and MALDI mass spectrometry. The mass mapping data (MALDI) are underlined, and the data from Edman degradation are marked with *.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transient Expression—NCBI searching with the amino acid sequence obtained, we found a plasmid (pCMV-Sport 6) from ResGen containing a cDNA insert that encodes our sequence. We amplified the cDNA insert, cloned it into an expression vector with a Myc tag, and transfected COS-7 cells. Both the cell number and cell protein concentration did not change significantly 48 h after transfection. However, as shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, the alk-SMase activity was markedly increased in the cDNA-transfected cells by about 689-fold. The activity was also increased by 27-fold in the culture medium of transfected cells (middle panel). When the activity of the cell-free extract was determined in the buffers with different pH values, similar to purified alk-SMase (21Cheng Y. Nilsson Å. Tömquist E. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the expressed enzyme showed the highest activity at pH 9.0 (bottom panel). To confirm further that the expressed protein did have SMase activity, the protein was precipitated by the antibody against the Myc tag, and the alk-SMase activity was determined in the immunoprecipitated proteins. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4, high alk-SMase activity was identified in the precipitated proteins in the cDNA-transfected cells. On the right panel, the proteins were further subjected to Western blot. Anti-Myc antibody identified a major protein o"

Wild type Pol ϵ synthesizes DNA accurately, generating single-base substitutions and deletions at average error rates of ≤2 × 10-5 and ≤5 × 10-7, respectively. Pol ϵ lacking 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity is less accurate to a degree suggesting that wild type Pol ϵ proofreads at least 92% of base substitution errors and at least 99% of frameshift errors made by the polymerase. Surprisingly the base substitution fidelity of exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ is severalfold lower than that of proofreading-deficient forms of other replicative polymerases. Moreover the spectrum of errors shows a feature not seen with other A, B, C, or X family polymerases: a high proportion of transversions resulting from T·dTTP, T·dCTP, and C·dTTP mispairs. This unique error specificity and amino acid sequence alignments suggest that the structure of the polymerase active site of Pol ϵ differs from those of other B family members. We observed both similarities and differences between the spectrum of substitutions generated by proofreading-deficient Pol ϵ in vitro and substitutions occurring in vivo in a yeast strain defective in Pol ϵ proofreading and DNA mismatch repair.

We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of Pol ϵ polymerase activity in DNA replication. Replication of chromosomes in eukaryotes is believed to require three DNA polymerases, Pol α, 1The abbreviations used are: Pol, DNA polymerase; Exo-, exonuclease-deficient; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. Pol δ, and Pol ϵ (for reviews, see Refs. 1Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Shcherbakova P.V. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Pol α has an associated DNA primase activity and synthesizes short RNA-DNA primers to initiate replication at origins and start Okazaki fragments on the lagging DNA strand. The roles of Pol δ and Pol ϵ in chromosomal replication are not clearly defined. Evidence for essential roles of Pol δ and Pol ϵ in replication comes from genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutational inactivation of catalytic subunits and some of the additional subunits of both polymerases is lethal. Strains carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in POL3 gene (encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol δ), POL2, or DPB2 genes (encoding subunits of Pol ϵ) arrest in S phase of the cell cycle with a terminal morphology characteristic of a DNA replication defect upon shift to non-permissive temperature (4Araki H.

Incorporation of labeled precursors into DNA stops in these mutants at non-permissive temperature (4Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The POL3, POL2, and DPB2 genes, as well as the DPB3 gene encoding the third subunit of Pol ϵ, are expressed periodically in the cell cycle with a peak in G1 to S phase transition (4Araki H.

Both Pol δ and Pol ϵ have intrinsic 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities that correct polymerase errors during replication (9Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mutations in POL3 or POL2 inactivating the exonucleases result in a mutator phenotype (11Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To accommodate roles for Pol δ and Pol ϵ at a replication fork, it was proposed that Pol ϵ elongates the leading DNA strand, while Pol δ elongates Okazaki fragments on the lagging DNA strand (13Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Other models for the roles of Pol δ and Pol ϵ in chromosomal replication have also been considered (14Linn S. Cell. 1991; 66: 185-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “One strand-one polymerase” models are consistent with the observation that both polymerases are monomers in solution (16Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and with our earlier genetic studies demonstrating that the 3′ → 5′ exonucleases of Pol δ and Pol ϵ correct replication errors on opposite DNA strands (18Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Genetics. 1996; 142: 717-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether Pol δ and Pol ϵ always correct their own errors in vivo, and genetic data on the roles of Pol δ and Pol ϵ exonucleases are not sufficient to conclude that the two polymerases perform synthesis on opposite DNA strands. Pol ϵ belongs to the B family of DNA polymerases that includes Pol α and Pol δ as well as DNA polymerases that replicate genomes of bacteriophages T4 and RB69. The B family also includes the eukaryotic DNA polymerase ζ, a translesion synthesis polymerase that is not essential for chromosomal DNA replication in yeast. A unique feature of Pol ϵ is that the catalytic subunit contains a large C-terminal domain that is not present in other B family DNA polymerases. This domain is needed for interaction of the catalytic subunit with the other subunits of the Pol ϵ holoenzyme and for the function of Pol ϵ in S phase checkpoint control (13Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The essential role of Pol ϵ polymerase activity in replication was questioned by the observation that only the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit is required for cell viability, while mutants with a deletion of the N-terminal domain, which contains all the conserved DNA polymerase motifs, survive (22Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, these mutants display severe growth and replication defects (23Ohya T. Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Kanbara S. Nakajo K. Nakashima N. Suzuki A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28099-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover single amino acid substitutions in the polymerase active site of Pol ϵ are lethal (20Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Pavlov Y.I. Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for these observations is that Pol ϵ is normally a component of the replication machinery, but when absent, it can be partially substituted for by another DNA polymerase. It was also suggested that Pol ϵ participates in DNA replication during late but not early S phase in human cells (25Fuss J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8658-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A property of replication that is critical for genome stability is the fidelity of DNA synthesis. An initial study conducted 12 years ago (26Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the catalytic subunit of calf thymus Pol ϵ synthesized DNA with high fidelity. A more recent kinetic analysis of fidelity (27Shimizu K. Hashimoto K. Kirchner J.M. Nakai W. Nishikawa H. Resnick M.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37422-37429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that yeast Pol ϵ efficiently prevents nucleotide misinsertion at one template position and that two of the three possible mismatches at that site can be excised by the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease of Pol ϵ, indicating that yeast Pol ϵ can conduct accurate DNA synthesis. Just how accurate yeast Pol ϵ is for all 12 mispairs in different sequence contexts and how efficiently it prevents and proofreads insertion and deletion errors are unknown. With this in mind and with the goal to eventually understand the role of yeast Pol ϵ in replicating one or both strands of the 12 million-nucleotide yeast genome and stably maintaining it in the face of DNA damage, here we characterize the fidelity of DNA synthesis by wild type and proofreading-deficient forms of yeast Pol ϵ holoenzyme. We provide a comprehensive description of error rates in many sequence contexts for all 12 single-base mismatches as well as for single-base additions and single-base and larger deletions. We confirm that Pol ϵ is highly accurate, describe the contribution of proofreading to fidelity, report two unanticipated aspects of fidelity suggesting that the polymerase active site is unique among family B members, and compare Pol ϵ fidelity to mutational specificity data in vivo to support a replication function. Purification of Yeast DNA Polymerase ϵ —A protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain was constructed for this study by disrupting the PEP4 gene in strain GC379Δ (MATα ade5–1 lys2-Tn5–13 trp1–289 his7–2 leu2–3,112 ura3Δ, Ref. 28Shcherbakova P.V. Noskov V.N. Pshenichnov M.R. Pavlov Y.I. Mutat. Res. 1996; 369: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using a heterologous kanMX cassette as described previously (29Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The chromosomal POL2 allele of this strain was replaced with the pol2–4 allele as described previously (11Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The pol2–4 mutation results in the FDIET → FAIAT amino acid replacement in the Exo I motif of Pol ϵ. Wild type Pol ϵ was overproduced in the POL2 + strain, and the exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ with the FDIET → FAIAT substitution was overproduced in the pol2–4 strain. The enzymes were purified in parallel by conventional chromatography as described previously (17Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Assay for 3′ → 5′ Exonuclease Activity—We used a primer, 5′-TTCTGTCTTCGAAGAGTAAA-3′, annealed to one of the two template oligonucleotides, 3′-AAGACAGAAGCTTCTCATTTTTTAACATGAACCGCCTAT-5 (S6 primer-template) or 3′-AAGACAGAAGCTTCTCATTCTTTAACATGAACCGCCTAT-5′ (S7 primer-template), as a substrate for the exonuclease reactions. The S6 substrate has a correctly matched primer terminus, and the S7 substrate has a mismatch at the 3′ end of the primer. The primer (0.8 μm) was labeled by 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a 100-μl reaction with 25 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h. The reaction was heated for 10 min at 56 °C and cleaned using a Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. The labeled product and unlabeled primer were annealed to the template in a final 100-μl volume at a ratio of 1 μm primer to 1.04 μm template by 5-min incubation at 86 °C and cooling to room temperature. The substrate (100 nm) was tested for completeness of annealing by performing a 10-min reaction with 15 nm Exo- T4 DNA polymerase and 50 μm dNTPs in a buffer described under “Processivity Assay.” Exo- T4 DNA polymerase was kindly provided by F.

For determining exonuclease activity, 2.5 μl of substrate (50 nm) was incubated with various concentrations of Pol ϵ in a 50-μl reaction in standard buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol; see Ref. 31Maki S.

Ten μl of the reaction was mixed with 10 μl of deionized formamide dye solution, and 5 μl of the mixture was loaded on 18% urea-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 80 watts. Processivity Assay—An oligonucleotide (PAGE-purified, Oligos Etc.) was annealed to a single-stranded M13mp2 DNA template such that DNA synthesis initiates at nucleotide 191 of the lacZ gene, 6 bases from the start of synthesis in the gap-filling mutagenesis assay (see below). The primer sequence was 5′-CGGAAACCAGGCAAAGCGCCATTCGCCATTCAGGCTGCGCAG-3′. The primer (0.8 μm) was labeled with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a 100-μl reaction with 25 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h. The reaction was heated for 10 min at 56 °C and cleaned using a Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. Unlabeled primer and 10 μl of labeled primer were annealed in a total volume of 100 μl to single-stranded M13mp2 template DNA at a ratio of 0.25 μm primer to 0.25 μm template by 30-min incubation at 52.5 °C in 100 mm potassium acetate. After cooling to room temperature, the substrate was desalted using a Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin 30 column. When tested for complete annealing as described above, more than 80% of the primer was elongated. For processivity assays, the substrate (5 nm) was incubated with various concentrations (0.05–1 nm) of Pol ϵ (at 30 °C) and other polymerases (at 37 °C) in 50-μl reactions in standard buffer (see below) with 250 μm dNTPs for the times listed in the legend to Fig. 2. Ten μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 μl of deionized formamide dye solution, and 5 μl of the mixture was loaded onto a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis for 2 h at 80 watts. The catalytic subunits of human Exo- Pol γ and Pol α were kindly provided by W. Copeland (Refs. 32Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol.

Buffers used were the following: for T4 Pol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol; for Pol γ, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2; and for Pol α, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The sequencing ladder standard was produced by using the same substrate and a thermostable polymerase manual sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Assay to Measure Polymerase Fidelity in Vitro—DNA synthesis fidelity was measured using the bacteriophage M13mp2 forward mutation assay described previously (34Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded M13mp2 DNA with a 407-nucleotide single-stranded region containing a portion of the lacZ gene was used a substrate for in vitro DNA synthesis. Reactions mixtures contained ∼1.5 nm DNA template, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 25 or 250 μm dNTPs, and 1.5–14 nm wild type or exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of the reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm complete gap filling, and another aliquot of DNA was introduced into Escherichia coli to score the frequency of light blue and colorless plaques reflecting errors made during in vitro DNA synthesis. Single-stranded DNA was isolated from independent mutant plaques, and the lacZ gene was sequenced using either an ABI Prism 377 or ABI Prism 3100 sequencer. Error rates for individual types of mutation were calculated according to the following equation: ER = [(N i/N) × MF]/(D × 0.6) where N i is the number of mutations of a particular type, N is the total number of mutants analyzed, MF is frequency of lacZ mutants, D is the number of detectable sites for the particular type of mutation, and 0.6 is the probability of expressing a mutant lacZ allele in E. coli (34Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Yeast Strains for Measuring Forward Mutation Rates in Vivo—We started with derivatives of yeast strain CG379Δ containing the ura3–24 allele inserted into the BIK1 locus on chromosome III in two orientations relative to the nearest replication origin ARS306 (MATα ade5–1 lys2-Tn5–13 trp1–289 his7–2 leu2–3,112 ura3Δ bik1::ura3–24, Ref. 18Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Genetics. 1996; 142: 717-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type allele of the POL2 gene in these strains was replaced by the pol2–4 allele as described previously (11Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ura+ revertants of these pol2–4 bik1::ura3–24 strains were obtained, yielding pol2–4 mutants with the wild type URA3 gene in two orientations relative to ARS306. The mismatch repair gene MSH6 was disrupted in the pol2–4 bik1::URA3 strains by the TRP1 gene as described previously (35Pavlov Y.I. Mian I.M. Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 744-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Forward Mutation Assay in Vivo—Independent colonies of the pol2–4 msh6 bik1::URA3 derivatives of CG379Δ were streaked on yeast extract peptone dextrose plates, grown for 2 days at 30 °C, and replicaplated onto medium with 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (36Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) to select for ura3 mutants. One colony resistant to FOA (FOAr) was picked from each patch, and the URA3 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and sequenced by using either ABI Prism 377 or ABI Prism 3100 sequencer. The rate of FOAr mutation in the pol2–4 msh6 strains was measured by fluctuation analysis as described previously (37Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The majority of FOAr colonies result from mutations in the URA3 gene in wild type strains (36Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). For more accurate estimation of the ura3 mutation rate in the pol2–4 msh6 strains, we determined the proportion of FOAr mutants that were due to ura3 mutations in our fluctuation tests. To do this, the FOAr colonies were randomly picked and crossed to strain E68 (MAT a ade2–1 arg4–8 leu2–3,112 thr1–4 trp1–1 ura3–52 lys2Δ cup1–1) (37Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The hybrids were replica-plated onto medium lacking uracil to monitor complementation of the ura3–52 mutation. To estimate the ura3 mutation rate, the FOAr mutation rate was multiplied by the proportion of ura3 mutants among FOAr clones. Mutational Spectra Analysis—The frequencies of different types of substitutions were compared using the Pearson χ2 test as implemented in the COLLAPSE program (38Khromov-Borisov N.N. Rogozin I.B. Pegas Henriques J.A. de Serres F.J. Mutat. Res. 1999; 430: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Monte Carlo modification of the Pearson χ2 test of spectra homogeneity (39Adams W.T.

Mutat. 2001; 17: 83-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were used to compare spectra. Pcc is the probability that an observed correlation between two spectra is due to random fluctuations. Calculations were done using the programs HG-PUBL (44Cariello N.F. Piegorsch W.W. Adams W.T. Skopek T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2281-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), CORR12, and COMP12 (41Babenko V.N. Rogozin I.B. Biofizika. 1999; 44: 632-638PubMed Google Scholar). The CLUSTERM program (43Rogozin I.B. Kondrashev F.A. Glazko G.V. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 83-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Glazko G.B. Milanesi L. Rogozin I.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 192: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used for hot spot prediction. The known list of detectable positions in lacZ (46Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Pamphilis M.D. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells: Concepts, Enzymes and Systems. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 217-247Google Scholar) was used for analysis of spectra. Alignment of Amino Acid Sequences and Secondary Structure Prediction—Multiple alignment of Pol ϵ homologs was constructed using the MAXHOM program (47Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction was made using the PSIPRED (48McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar) and PHD (49Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) programs. Purity and 3′ → 5′ Exonuclease Activity of Wild Type and Mutant Pol ϵ —We recently described purification of the four-subunit S. cerevisiae Pol ϵ complex in 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry (17Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we used this procedure to overproduce and purify wild type Pol ϵ and a variant with a double amino acid change (D289A,E291A) in the Exo I motif of the catalytic subunit. Both protein preparations contained all four subunits in the expected ratios (Fig. 1A). The additional faint bands seen on the colloidal Coomassie-stained gel represent minor contaminants and not Pol2 proteolytic fragments as confirmed by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to Pol2 (data not shown). The double amino acid change in the exonuclease active site of the catalytic subunit was previously shown to reduce the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of Pol ϵ with no significant effect on polymerization activity (11Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Shimizu K. Hashimoto K. Kirchner J.M. Nakai W. Nishikawa H. Resnick M.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37422-37429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When we examined our enzyme preparations for exonuclease activity, wild type Pol ϵ readily digested a labeled, correctly paired DNA primer (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). No digestion was seen for the Pol ϵ D289A, E291A preparation (lanes 5–7). Similar results were obtained when a primer with a terminal mismatched nucleotide was used as a substrate for the exonuclease reaction (data not shown). Therefore the catalytic subunit of the Pol ϵ D289A,E291A as well as the three accessory subunits lacks 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity detectable in this assay. Processivity of Pol ϵ —Next we compared the processivity of DNA synthesis by Pol ϵ D289A,E291A to that of several other B family DNA polymerases (Fig. 2). Reactions were performed with excess primer-template over polymerase such that once the polymerase synthesizes DNA and dissociates the probability of using the extended product again is very low (see legend to Fig. 2 for further details). Analysis of the products of the reactions catalyzed by exonuclease-deficient variants of Pol ϵ, T4 Pol (gp43 protein only), and Pol γ (catalytic subunit only) shows that all three enzymes terminate synthesis at numerous template positions (Fig. 2). Some of the sites of frequent termination are shared by the three polymerases, while others are not shared, suggesting that these polymerases interact somewhat differently with template-primers even in the same DNA sequence context. All three polymerases incorporated up to 170 nucleotides in one cycle of polymerization (up to approximately template nucleotide 20, Fig. 2). Maximum processivity could be even higher with other DNA templates since the termination band observed at position 20 corresponds to the location of the palindromic lacZ operator sequence. The DNA synthesis reached this point in 11% of the Pol ϵ reactions as compared with 6 and 3% for T4 Pol and Pol γ, respectively (the values are calculated by phosphorimagery as the amount of product at that location divided by the total products). This suggests that Pol ϵ holoenzyme is the most processive of these three replicative polymerases. Additional studies will be required to determine whether high processivity is intrinsic to the catalytic subunit of Pol ϵ or is influenced by the accessory subunits. In contrast to Pol ϵ, T4 Pol, and Pol γ and in agreement with earlier studies (50Wang T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 51Fisher P.A. Wang T.S. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6128-6137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Copeland W.C. Wang T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the catalytic subunit of human Pol α is less processive, incorporating from 1 to about 20 nucleotides per cycle. Fidelity of Wild Type Pol ϵ —We first analyzed fidelity of the wild type Pol ϵ during gap-filling DNA synthesis using the M13mp2 forward mutation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that Pol ϵ filled the 407-nucleotide gap (data not shown but similar to Fig. 3 in Ref. 34Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The frequency of lacZ mutants obtained after transfection of E. coli with these reaction products (0.00194, Table I) was reproducibly only slightly elevated over the background mutant frequency measured upon transfection with the unfilled gapped DNA subs"
https://openalex.org/W2034870531,"Adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) is one of the major virulence factors produced by Bordetella pertussis, the whooping cough agent. CyaA belongs to the repeat in toxin protein family and requires a post-translational fatty acylation to form cation-selective channels in target cell membranes and to penetrate into cytosol. We have demonstrated recently that CyaA uses the αMβ2 integrin (CD11b/CD18) as a specific cellular receptor. Here we show that the acylation of CyaA is required for a productive and tight interaction of the toxin with cells expressing CD11b. In addition, we demonstrate that the catalytic domain is not required for binding of CyaA to CD11b and that the main integrin interacting domain of CyaA is located in its glycine/aspartate-rich repeat region. These data decipher, for the first time, the interaction of CyaA with CD11b-positive cells and open new prospects for understanding the interaction of Bordetella pertussis with innate and adaptive immune systems.

Bordetella pertussis is the etiological agent of whooping cough, a highly contagious childhood respiratory disease, characterized by bronchopneumonia and paroxysmal coughing interrupted by inspiratory whoops. Among the variety of toxins produced by B. pertussis, the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) 1The abbreviations used are: CyaA, adenylate cyclase toxin; RTX, repeat in toxin family protein; AC, adenylate cyclase; Hly, hemolysin moiety; OVA, ovalbumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; PE, phycoerythrin; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; biotin-HPDP, N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio) propiamide.1The abbreviations used are: CyaA, adenylate cyclase toxin; RTX, repeat in toxin family protein; AC, adenylate cyclase; Hly, hemolysin moiety; OVA, ovalbumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; PE, phycoerythrin; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; biotin-HPDP, N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio) propiamide. is a crucial factor in the virulence strategy of the bacteria during the early phases of respiratory tract colonization (1Goodwin M.S.

The toxin allows the pathogen to escape host immune surveillance, mainly by intoxicating neutrophils and macrophages causing phagocyte impotence and inducing macrophage apoptosis (3Confer D.L. Eaton J.W. Science. 1982; 217: 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4Gueirard P. Druilhe A. Pretolani M. Guiso N. Infect.

The role of CyaA in the pathogenesis of B. pertussis was clearly demonstrated in the mouse respiratory model. Indeed, genetically modified B. pertussis strains deficient in the expression of CyaA were impaired in their ability to induce pulmonary lesions and to cause lethal infection (8Khelef N. Bachelet C.M. Vargaftig B.B. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2893-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weiss A.A. Goodwin M.S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, CyaA was shown to induce protective immunity against B. pertussis lung colonization in a mouse model (10Betsou F. Sebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Betsou F. Sebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3309-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hormozi K. Parton R. Coote J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 23: 273-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CyaA is a 1706-amino acid-long polypeptide consisting of four functional domains: the adenylate cyclase activity (AC) domain (residues 1–400), the hydrophobic channel-forming domain (residues 500–700), the calcium-binding glycine/aspartate-rich repeat domain (residues 1000–1600), and the C-terminal domain harboring a secretion signal (residues 1600–1706). CyaA is able to invade eukaryotic cells and translocate its catalytic domain into the cytoplasm where, upon activation by endogenous calmodulin, it catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP (13Ladant D. Ullmann A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 172-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The accumulation of cAMP in the cell cytosol is considered to be responsible for the toxic effect of this toxin (14Rogel A. Meller R. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3154-3161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main consequences of this intoxication are cell apoptosis and the alteration of phagocytic abilities and superoxide production (3Confer D.L. Eaton J.W. Science. 1982; 217: 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Khelef N. Zychlinsky A. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4064-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Friedman R.L.

Immunol. 1987; 139: 2749-2754PubMed Google Scholar).CyaA requires calcium to acquire a translocation-specific conformation that allows the delivery of the catalytic domain into the cell cytosol (18Rogel A. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22599-22605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CyaA is first produced as an inactive protoxin, pro-CyaA, and it is converted to the active toxin upon post-translational fatty acyl modification that is catalyzed by the accessory protein acyltransferase, the product of the cyaC gene. Acylation of pro-CyaA consists of covalent palmitoylation at the ϵ-amino groups of two lysine residues, Lys-983 and Lys-860, located within conserved RTX acylation sites (20Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), located within conserved RTX acylation sites (20Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J.

Although acylation of Lys-860 seems not to be necessary for CyaA activity, acylation of Lys-983 was shown to be crucial (22Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 348-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The covalent post-translational fatty acylation is required for translocation of the catalytic AC domain of the toxin through target cell membranes, as well as for the formation of hemolytic cation-selective CyaA channels.CyaA can penetrate at least to some extent a wide range of cell types, including the mammalian erythrocytes lacking membrane trafficking (18Rogel A. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22599-22605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect.

However, CyaA toxicity effects such as the abrogation of phagocytic capacity and the induction of apoptosis were mainly elucidated on immune cells, namely neutrophils and macrophages (3Confer D.L. Eaton J.W. Science. 1982; 217: 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Khelef N. Zychlinsky A. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4064-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CyaA was shown to display specific intoxication toward alveolar macrophages and to play a key role in mouse respiratory infection by B. pertussis (4Gueirard P. Druilhe A. Pretolani M. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently (25Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Guiso N. Ladant D. Leclerc C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that CyaA binds specifically to target cells through the αMβ2 integrin (CD11b/CD18) receptor. This binding was saturable and completely inhibited by anti-CD11b monoclonal antibodies. CyaA displayed a selective cytotoxicity toward CD11b+ cells showing that its interaction with CD11b is required for the translocation of the catalytic domain and the subsequent increase of intracellular cAMP concentration and cell death. Moreover, sensitivity of CHO cells to CyaA cytotoxicity was dramatically increased upon expression of the CD11b/CD18 heterodimer. Furthermore, Ca2+ ions that are required for translocation of the catalytic domain into cells were also strictly necessary for CyaA interaction with CD11b (25Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E.

The importance of CD11b for interaction of CyaA with cells was further demonstrated in a system where CyaA is used as a vector to deliver foreign antigens into antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. Only dendritic cells of the CD11c+ CD8α–CD11bhigh subset were, indeed, able to display major histocompatibility complex class I peptide complexes corresponding to the epitope inserted in the recombinant CyaA (26Guermonprez P. Fayolle C. Rojas M.J. Rescigno M. Ladant D. Leclerc C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The CD11b protein is a member of the large family of β2 integrins, the leukocyte adhesion molecules, which comprises LFA1 (CD11a), MAC-1 (CD11b), and p150,95 (CD11c). The members of this family differ by their α-chain, which is expressed as an obligate heterodimer with a β-chain (CD18) (27Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD11b, also known as complement type 3 receptor (CR3), is expressed on macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, NK cells, peritoneal B-1 cells, and a subset of CD8+ T cells (27Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bell D. Young J.W. Banchereau J. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 255-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It plays a key role in leukocyte adhesive functions and triggers phagocytosis of complement-coated particles (29Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). CD11b binds various ligands, such as the intracellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1, fibrinogen, coagulant factor X, and inactivated complement component C3b (iC3b) (30Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in the Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) as host cells. The plasmids coding for a non-acylated wild type pro-CyaA (pACT7), acylated wild type CyaA (pT7CACT1), and a recombinant detoxified CyaA-E5-CysOVA harboring a unique cysteine residue and the OVA epitope in its catalytic domain (pCACT-E5-CysOVA) were described previously (25Guermonprez P.

The plasmid pTRCyaAΔ-(1–373) encoding the hemolytic moiety (CyaA-(373–1706)) is a derivative of pTRCAG (35Gmira S. Karimova G. Ladant D. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in which the DNA sequence coding for the catalytic domain of the toxin (comprised between the NdeI and BstBI sites) was deleted and replaced by an appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence Met-Gly-Cys-Gly-Asn.Protocol for CyaA production has already been described elsewhere (38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed in E. coli BLR strain (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and were purified to more than 95% homogeneity (as judged by SDS gel analysis, not shown) from inclusion bodies by a two-step procedure including DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies as described previously (39Guermonprez P. Fayolle C. Karimova G. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 527-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified CyaA-E5-CysOVA protein was labeled on its unique cysteine residue with the sulfhydryl reagent N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propiamide (biotin-HPDP) (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylated-CyaA was re-purified on DEAE-Sepharose in order to remove the unreacted biotin-HPDP reagent. CyaA-(1–384) (AC domain) was expressed and purified as described previously (40Ladant D. Glaser P. Ullmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2244-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Toxin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically from the adsorption at 278 nm using a molecular extinction coefficient of 141 mm–1 cm–1 for the full-length CyaA toxins, 113 mm–1 cm–1 for the CyaA-(373–1706) and 28 mm–1 cm–1 for CyaA-(1–384).The CyaA-FLAG molecules were constructed using the previously defined permissive insertion sites along the CyaA molecule (36Osicka R. Osickova A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a set of 17 CyaA constructs, which carried at the individual permissive positions a synthetic octapeptide insert Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys of the FLAG epitope (Sigma). To achieve this, three double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide pairs (5′-GTACTGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAATCAC + 5′-GTACGTGATTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCA; 5′-GTACTTATCGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAA + 5′-GTACTTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCGATAA; and 5′-GTACGTGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAAGC + 5′-GTACGCTTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCCAC, respectively), encoding the FLAG epitope in the required reading frames, were inserted into the unique BsrGI sites previously introduced within the cyaA gene on the plasmid pT7CACT1 (36Osicka R. Osickova A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insertions were verified by DNA sequencing, and the recombinant CyaA molecules were expressed in E. coli and purified. The cell-invasive capacities of selected CyaA/FLAG molecules were characterized, using sheep erythrocytes as target cells as described previously (36Osicka R. Osickova A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Production of Anti-CyaA Monoclonal Antibodies—BALB/c mice were initially immunized intraperitoneally with CyaA toxin (20 μg in alum). At approximately 2-week intervals, mice were boosted 3 times with 10 μg of CyaA in alum. Throughout the immunization protocol, mice were bled and their sera tested for the presence of anti-CyaA antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When significant sera titers were detected, a last boost was given to these mice, and their splenocytes were fused with P3X63 myeloma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) 3 days later. The generated hybridomas were screened for the production of CyaA-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Highly productive hybridomas were then selected and cloned by single-cell limiting dilutions and subsequently used to make ascites in BALB/c nude mice to generate large amounts of anti-CyaA mAb. The mAb were purified from ascites using T-Gel™ purification kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody concentration was measured with Bio-Rad protein assay. Two of these monoclonal antibodies were used in this study: antibody 5G12 that reacts with an epitope localized within amino acids 1–190, and antibody 6D7 that reacts with an epitope localized within amino acids 1006–1706 (data not shown).Cells and Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human CD11b/CD18 (CHO-CD11b cells), human CD11c/CD18 (CHO-CD11c cells), or transfected with the vector alone (CHO cells) were a kind gift of D. Golenbock (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston) and were cultured in the presence of neomycin as described previously (41Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Delude R.L. Flaherty S. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1998; 397: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar).Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies specific for human CD11b (ICRF44, mouse IgG1, κ) and human CD11c (B-Ly6, mouse IgG1, κ) were purchased from Pharmingen.Binding Assays—The assays were performed as described previously (25Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Guiso N. Ladant D. Leclerc C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CyaA molecules in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose (Invitrogen), without serum, in 96-well culture plates for 30 min on ice. After washing, anti-CyaA catalytic domain mAb (5G12) or anti-CyaA repeat domain mAb (6D7) was added at 25 μg/ml. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of CyaA molecules for 30 min on ice. Then CyaA-biotin (30 nm), anti-CD11b mAb (2 μg/ml), or anti-CD11c mAb (2 μg/ml) (Pharmingen) were added separately in the continuous presence of the toxins.After washing and removing supernatant, cells were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG-PE (Caltag, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) or with streptavidin-PE (Pharmingen) at 1:300 dilution. After the last wash, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACStar™ (BD Biosciences) in the presence of 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Aggregated and dead cells were subtracted by gatings based on propidium iodide exclusion. The binding data were deduced from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and expressed as ΔMFI = (MFI value of cells incubated with CyaA) – (MFI value of cells incubated without CyaA) or as percentage of binding = (sample binding)/(maximum binding) × 100. The maximum binding corresponds to (MFI value of cells incubated with CyaA or anti-CD11b in the absence of competitor) – (MFI value of cells incubated with medium alone). The sample binding corresponds to (MFI value of cells incubated with CyaA or anti-CD11b in the presence of competitor) – (MFI value of cells incubated with medium alone).Cyclic AMP Assay—Cyclic AMP accumulated in cells exposed to the CyaA toxin was performed essentially as described previously (25Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Guiso N. Ladant D. Leclerc C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CyaA in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + glucose for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing, cAMP accumulated in cell cytosol was released by lysis with 0.1 n HCl and boiling for 5 min at 120 °C. After neutralization with 0.1 n NaOH, the samples were then added to microtiter plates previously coated with a cAMP-bovine serum albumin conjugate and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of anti-cAMP rabbit anti-serum. After washing, anti-cAMP antibodies were revealed with anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The cAMP content of each sample was determined from comparison with a standard curve obtained by adding known cAMP concentration.Binding of Recombinant CyaAs to Erythrocytes—Toxin binding to sheep erythrocytes was assayed essentially as described previously (38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Toxins in 8 m urea, 20 mm Hepes-Na were directly diluted (at least 200-fold) into suspensions of sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108/ml) in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. An aliquot was removed to determine the total adenylate cyclase activity added to each sample. The cell suspensions were chilled on ice and centrifuged 5 min at 3,000 × g and 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer A; the suspension was transferred to fresh tubes to avoid carryover of toxin bound to tube walls, and cells were pelleted again by centrifugation and finally lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. The enzymatic AC activities in the cell extracts corresponded to that of the toxin associated with the cellular membrane and was expressed as a percentage of total activity added to the cells. The adenylate cyclase activity was measured as described previously (40Ladant D. Glaser P. Ullmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2244-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of adenylate cyclase activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed in 1 min at 30 °C and pH 8.0.RESULTSCyaA Specifically Binds to CD11b + Cells and Inhibits CyaA-biotin and Anti-CD11b Binding to CD11b + Cells—In order to investigate the role of biological and structural properties of CyaA in its interaction with CD11b, we developed two complementary assays: a binding assay and a competition assay. In the binding assay, CyaA molecules were incubated either with transfected CHO cells expressing human CD11b/CD18 (CHO-CD11b cells) or with mock transfected CHO cells, and subsequently, the cell-associated toxin was detected with an anti-CyaA monoclonal antibody (5G12) specific for the catalytic domain. As shown in Fig. 1A, using this assay, CyaA binding was specifically detected on CD11b+ cells. In the competition assay, different CyaA molecules (mutants or fragments) were tested for their ability to compete with binding of CyaA-biotin or anti-CD11b mAb to CD11b+ cells. Here the CHO-CD11b cells were incubated with CyaA at different concentrations for 30 min on ice. Then CyaA-biotin (30 nm) or anti-CD11b mAb (2 μg/ml) were added in the continuous presence of CyaA, and their binding to the cells was evaluated by FACS. As shown in Fig. 1B, CyaA efficiently inhibited both CyaA-biotin and anti-CD11b binding to CHO-CD11b cells in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was specific for CD11b since CyaA was unable to compete with another ligand (anti-CD11c mAb) for its specific receptor (CD11c) expressed by CHO cells (Fig. 1B).Lack of CyaA Acylation Affects Its Binding to CD11b + Cells— Because it is well established that CyaA needs a post-translational palmitoylation to acquire its invasive activity and capacity to form hemolytic membrane channels, we tested whether the lack of acylation affects CyaA interaction with CD11b+ cells. In a binding assay, control CHO cells or CHO-CD11b cells were incubated with either CyaA or the non-acylated pro-CyaA. The binding was evaluated using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the catalytic domain of CyaA (AC). As shown in (Fig. 2A), at low concentrations, binding of both CyaA and pro-CyaA molecules to CD11b+ cells was rather comparable, with a slightly more efficient binding of the acylated CyaA. This could be due to its enhanced interaction with cell membrane, a better adapted conformation of CyaA for binding and/or higher affinity of the acylated CyaA for the CD11b receptor. Indeed, the pro-CyaA binding reached saturation at substantially higher protoxin concentrations, as compared with CyaA binding. The simplest explanation of this observation would be that pro-CyaA binds CD11b+ cells with lower affinity than CyaA. At high protoxin concentration, aggregates and/or oligomers of pro-CyaA would bind to the cells, and consequently, higher amounts of pro-CyaA would be detected. In contrast, very low binding of CyaA or pro-CyaA to control CHO cells was detected.Fig. 2Direct binding of CyaA or pro-CyaA to CHO transfectants. A, CHO-CD11b cells (▪, ▴) or CHO cells (□, ▵) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CyaA (▪, □) or pro-CyaA (▴, ▵). Surface-bound CyaA was detected with anti-CyaA mAb (5G12). Results are expressed as ΔMFI = (MFI value of cells incubated with CyaA) – (MFI value of cells incubated without CyaA) and are representative of two independent experiments. B and C, CHO-CD11b cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of CyaA or pro-CyaA. CyaA-biotin (B) or anti-CD11b mAb (C) was then added, in the continuous presence of CyaA or pro-CyaA. Surface-bound CyaA-biotin or anti-CD11b mAb was measured by FACS. Results are expressed as percentage of binding = (sample binding)/(maximum binding) × 100 and are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acylation Stabilizes Interaction of CyaA with CD11b + Cells— To analyze further the role of acylation in interaction of the toxin with CD11b+ cells, we tested the ability of non-acylated pro-CyaA to compete with CyaA for binding to CHO-CD11b cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, when compared with the acylated CyaA, the non-acylated pro-CyaA exhibited a substantially reduced capacity to compete with biotinylated CyaA for binding to CD11b+ cells. To determine whether the lack of inhibition was due to an inefficient interaction with CD11b, we evaluated the capacity of pro-CyaA to block anti-CD11b binding to CHO-CD11b cells. Indeed, as compared with CyaA, pro-CyaA was unable to inhibit binding of the anti-CD11b mAb to the CHO-CD11b cells (Fig. 2C).Because supraphysiological production of cAMP and cell intoxication are the consequences of CyaA interaction with CD11b+ cells, we then analyzed, using the CHO-CD11b cells, if these toxin functions are dependent on CyaA acylation. As expected, the pro-CyaA did not induce any cAMP increase in CHO-CD11b cells (Fig. 3A) and had no significant cytotoxic effect on these cells, as compared with the acylated CyaA (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that acylation of CyaA is necessary for a functional interaction of the toxin with CD11b+ cells and that the binding of pro-CyaA to CD11b is non-productive and does not trigger cytotoxic effects on CD11b-expressing cells.Fig. 3CyaA acylation is required for CyaA induced-cAMP accumulation and cytotoxicity. CHO-CD11b cells were incubated with either CyaA or pro-CyaA at the indicated concentrations for 20 min at 37 °C. Then cells were lysed and cAMP was measured (A). In parallel, toxicity was determined by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase released in the medium after incubation of CHO-CD11b cells for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of either CyaA or pro-CyaA (B). Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large"

Under normoxia, GABA is catabolized to succinic semialdehyde and then to succinate with the latter reaction being catalyzed by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Complementation of an SSADH-deficient yeast mutant with an Arabidopsis cDNA library enabled the identification of a novel cDNA (designated as AtGH-BDH for Arabidopsis thaliana γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), which encodes a 289-amino acid polypeptide containing an NADP-binding domain. Constitutive expression of AtGHBDH in the mutant yeast enabled growth on 20 mm GABA and significantly enhanced the cellular concentrations of γ-hydroxybutyrate, the product of the GHDBH reaction. These data confirm that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide with GHBDH activity. Arabidopsis plants subjected to flooding-induced oxygen deficiency for up to 4 h possessed elevated concentrations of γ-hydroxybutyrate as well as GABA and alanine. RNA expression analysis revealed that GHBDH transcription was not up-regulated by oxygen deficiency. These findings suggest that GHBDH activity is regulated by the supply of succinic semialdehyde or by redox balance. It is proposed that GHBDH and SSADH activities in plants are regulated in a complementary fashion and that GHBDH and γ-hydroxybutyrate function in oxidative stress tolerance.

Helpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in mammals, it functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter (4Bormann J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 112-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The role of GABA in plants is uncertain; however, GABA accumulates rapidly in response to a variety of abiotic stresses such as oxygen deficiency or cold temperature (1Bown A.W. Shelp B.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Shelp B.J. Bown A.W.

These stresses initiate a signal transduction pathway in which increased cytosolic Ca2+ stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of the anabolic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (Fig. 1). Under normoxia, GABA is catabolized via GABA transaminase (GABA-T, EC 2.6.1.19) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), which in turn is oxidized via an NAD-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH, EC 1.2.2.16) to succinate. Under oxygen deficiency, SSADH activity is probably restricted by increases in reducing potential and adenylate energy charge (7Busch K.B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Busch K.B. Piehler J. Fromm H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10110-10117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to the accumulation of GABA. Research on bacterial and animal systems indicates the existence of an alternative pathway for SSA catabolism to γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) that involves the enzyme γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (GHBDH, might also be designated as succinic semialdehyde reductase, EC 1.1.1.61) (GenBank™ accession numbers AJ250267, L21902, and AAC41425) (9Andriamampandry C.

Recently, Allan et al. (12Allan W.L. Smith R. Shelp B.J. Application Bulletin AB-0015. Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada2003: 4Google Scholar, 13Allan, W. L., Peiris, C., Brown, A. W., and Shelp, B. J. (2003) Can. J. Plant Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar) detected GHB in plant tissues and reported that it accumulates in response to oxygen deficiency. The conversion of SSA to GHB is reductive (i. e. fermentative), and like other common fermentation reactions such as lactate and alcohol dehydrogenases (14Drew M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), GHBDH may be involved in the stress tolerance of plants. In this report, we identify an Arabidopsis GHBDH cDNA by functional complementation of an SSADH-deficient yeast mutant in conjunction with metabolite analysis. We further demonstrate that GHB accumulation in Arabidopsis subjected to oxygen deficiency does not result from up-regulation of gene expression and propose that GHBDH activity and GHB play a role in oxidative stress tolerance. Isolation of a Putative GHBDH cDNA from Arabidopsis by Complementation of an SSADH-deficient Yeast Mutant—A Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant of uga2 is unable to use GABA as a nitrogen source and is defective in SSADH activity, suggesting that UGA2 is the structural gene for this enzyme (15Ramos F.

To demonstrate that SSADH activity is attributable to UGA2 and resides at the YBR006w locus, a ura3 uga2 mutant (strain 22641c) was transformed by a centromere-based plasmid library representing the genome of strain Σ1278b (16Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. Andre B. EMBO J. 1994; l13: 3456-3463Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Several genomic clones restored normal growth to the uga2 mutant on GABA (0.1%) as the sole nitrogen source. An Arabidopsis thaliana [L.] Heynh (Landsberg erecta ecotype) cDNA library (entire seedlings at two-leaf stage) constructed in a yeast expression vector (pFL61) containing the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and the yeast URA3 gene (17Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacoute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by M. Minet. Wild type yeast Σ1278b and its mutant strain 22641c (15Ramos F. El Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were maintained on yeast minimal medium (18Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Competent yeast cells were made and transformed with the Arabidopsis cDNA expression library (19Dohlmen R.J. Strasser A.W. Höner C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). URA + transformants were selected on solid SD medium (0.67% bactoyeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 2% bacto-agar) supplemented with 0.5% ammonium sulfate and 0.35 mm uracil (18Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), washed from each plate with liquid SD medium, and re-selected on SD medium supplemented with 20 mm GABA as the sole nitrogen source. Plasmids were isolated from selected colonies, amplified in Escherichia coli strain dH5α cells on LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) according to standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and re-introduced into the yeast mutant for re-selection on 20 mm GABA. Plasmid DNA was isolated from a 2-ml overnight culture derived from a single colony (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Plasmids bearing one of four independent cDNA clones isolated by complementation were sent to Genologics (Agricultural and Food Laboratory Services Branch, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) for sequencing (ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit on the ABI PRISM Sequencer Model 377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Vector primers used for sequencing were PGK5′ (5′-TCA AGA TCA TCA AGG AAG TAA TTA T-3′) and PGK3′ (5′-TAT TTT AGC GTA AAG GAT GAG GAS A-3′). All four of the cDNAs encoded the gene product. Growth and Metabolite Analyses of an SSADH-deficient Yeast Mutant Expressing the Putative Arabidopsis GHBDH cDNA—The transformed yeast strains were grown in 50 ml of liquid SD medium to an A 600 of 0.5. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in nitrogen-free SD medium. Approximately equal volumes (full inoculating loop) were streaked onto nitrogen-free SD plates supplemented with GABA, proline, or (NH4)2SO4 (20 mm N). Growth on the plates was checked after 4 days at 28 °C. Single colonies from wild type yeast (Σ1278b) and 22641c yeast transformed with the empty yeast vector (pFL61) or Arabidopsis complement (GHBDH) were used to inoculate 1-ml aliquots of liquid SD medium and grown overnight in a rotary shaker (150 rpm, 28 °C). The overnight culture was divided into three aliquots and used to inoculate 50 ml of nitrogen-free liquid SD medium supplemented with GABA, proline, or (NH4)2SO4 (20 mm N). The cells were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 of 1.0 ± 0.1) at 28 °C for 12–96 h depending on the strain. Approximately 1.2 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), and the pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of cold 0.3 m sorbitol and suspended in 1 ml of 95% methanol and1gof silica sand. This mixture was vigorously vortexed (3 × 20 s) and centrifuged (20,500 × g, 5 min). The supernatant then was transferred to a second Microfuge tube, and the pellet was extracted with an additional 1 ml of 70% methanol by vortexing. After centrifugation (20,500 × g, 5 min), the second supernatant was combined with the first. These methanol-derived extracts were analyzed for GHB and GABA levels by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (22Gibson K.M. Aramaki S. Sweetman L. Nyhan W.L. DeVivo D.C. Hodson A.K. Jakobs C.

Metabolite and Expression Analyses of Arabidopsis—Arabidopsis seeds were stratified at 4 °C for 48 h and then grown in Fox sandy loam (pH 6.5) at 22/18 °C day/night temperature and a 11/13-h day/night photoperiod. Plants were grown individually and with sufficient spacing in seedling trays to preclude shading between adjacent plants. They were fertilized twice weekly with a half-strength modified nutrient solution (24Shelp B.J. Penner R. Zhu Z. Can. J. Plant Sci. 1992; 72: 883-888Crossref Google Scholar) and subirrigated as needed with water. To investigate gene expression as a function of development and organ, rosette leaves 1–3, rosette leaves 4–6, rosette leaves 7–8, roots, flowers, and siliques were collected from three 6-week-old plants. To investigate the response to oxygen deficiency, all of the rosette leaves were harvested from six 4-week-old plants at time zero with the 24 plants remaining divided equally and randomly between two washbasins covered with tin foil. One contained sufficient water to cover the entire plants (i.e. flooded or treated plants), whereas the other did not contain water (i.e. control plants). At 2 or 4 h, leaves from six plants in each basin were quickly harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For each harvest, the leaves were divided into three replicates of two plants each (mean fresh weight ± S.E. of 0.27 ± 0.002 g) and stored at –80 °C until analysis. For metabolite analysis, the frozen leaf tissue was extracted with 80% ethanol containing 5 nmol of GHB-d6 as an internal control and the water-soluble fraction after washing with chloroform was dried in a Speedvac concentrator. The dried residue was suspended in 500 μl of de-ionized water, and then the extract was filter-sterilized through a 45-μm membrane. Analysis and quantification of GHB content were performed using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc.) as described previously (12Allan W.L. Smith R. Shelp B.J. Application Bulletin AB-0015. Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada2003: 4Google Scholar). For GABA and alanine analysis, a 100-μl aliquot of each extract was derivatized on-line with o-phthalaldehyde and separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a 4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5-μm Zorbax Eclipse AAA column (Agilent Technologies Inc.) and fluorescence was detected at 340 nm essentially as described by Henderson et al. (25Henderson J.W. Ricker R.D. Bidlingmeyer B.A. Woodward C. Technical Note 5980-1193E. Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada2000: 8Google Scholar). For expression analysis by relative quantification reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, total RNA was extracted from leaf tissue using reagents in the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase I (MBI Fermentas) in the presence of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2) and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (MBI Fermentas) for 30 min at 37 °C to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. First strand cDNA synthesis was prepared using a two-step RT-PCR protocol as described in the Enhanced Avian RT-PCR kit (Sigma) using 1 μg of the purified RNA and 2.5 μmol of random nonamers during the RT step. Two microliters of cDNA was used for each subsequent PCR reaction. The PCR protocol was as described in the QuantumRNA 18s Internal Standards kit (Ambion, Inc). To obtain relative quantification of gene expression, 18 S ribosomal cDNA was co-amplified, producing a 315-bp fragment along with the gene of interest using an optimized primers:competimers mixture of 8:2 ratio as provided in the kit. Optimized amplification of these two genes was ensured by adding the gene-of-interest primers and primers:competimers mixture to the PCR reaction at a ratio of 5:1. The primers used to amplify GHBDH and GABA-T (pyruvate-dependent isoform is described elsewhere (26Van Cauwenberghe O.R. Makhmoudova A. McLean M.D. Clark S.M. Shelp B.J. Can. J. Bot. 2002; 80: 933-941Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) cDNAs, respectively, were as follows: 5′-ATG GAA GTA GGG TTT CTG G-3′ (forward), 5′-CAA GTA AAA CGA TCT CTT CC-3′ (reverse) and 5′-ATG GTC GTT ATC AAC AGT C-3′ (forward), 5′-ATC TCT AAA AGA ACC TTA GC-3′ (reverse). These primers amplify gene fragments of 480 and 428 bp for GHBDH and GABA-T, respectively. The PCR-cycling parameters were 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a 5-min extension period at 72 °C for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed with 1.5% agarose gels as described previously (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Negative control reactions did not contain reverse transcriptase, whereas positive control reactions contained the cDNA of interest in a custom vector. Quantification of amplified signals were performed using Spot densitometry (Fluorchem™ 8800 Imaging System, Alpha Innotech Inc.). Identification of an Arabidopsis GHBDH cDNA by Yeast Complementation—Functional complementation of an NADP-dependent SSADH-deficient yeast mutant 22641c was used to isolate an Arabidopsis GHBDH cDNA. This mutant had only approximately 10% of the SSADH activity of the wild-type strain when grown on GABA as the sole nitrogen source (2.3 and 24.8 μmol/h/mg protein, respectively) and was found to overlap the YBR006W locus (data not shown), confirming that UGA2/YBR006w is the yeast SSADH (27Coleman S.T. Fang T.K. Rovinsky S.A. Turano F.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 244-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The mutant was transformed with a cDNA expression library synthesized from entire seedlings of Arabidopsis, and several plasmids containing a 1032-bp cDNA were recovered. These plasmids, when reintroduced into mutant 22641c, allowed growth on GABA. The cDNA insert in the plasmids was sequenced and found to encode a hydrophobic polypeptide, which contains 289 amino acids (Fig. 2A) and has a predicted molecular mass of 30.3 kDa, an isoelectric point of 5.59, and a net charge of –2.88 at neutral pH (Edit Sequence, DNAstar software, London, UK). The gene encoding the polypeptide has been designated AtGHBDH for A. thaliana GHBDH. A search of the GenBank™ data base does not identify significant homology with NADP-dependent SSA reductase from rat (9Andriamampandry C. Siffert J.-C. Schmitt M. Garnier J.-M. Staub A. Muller C. Gobaille S. Mark J. Maitre M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or human brain (10Schaller M. Schaffhauser M. Sans N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and NAD-dependent GHBDHs from Clostridium aminobutyricum (GenBank™ accession number AJ250267), Clostridium kluyveri (GenBank™ accession number L21902), or Ralstonia utropha (GenBank™ accession number AAC41425). However, the predicted amino sequence of AtGHBDH does exhibit 20–33% similarity to several hypothetical and known dehydrogenases, including 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, threonine dehydrogenase, and 6-phoshogluconate dehydrogenase from several sources (data not shown). The highest degree of similarity between AtGHBDH and these dehydrogenases is found at the N terminus (Fig. 2B), a region containing a strict consensus sequence (A/G)XXGL(A/L)XMGX 5NX 4G) that is typical of the dinucleotide cofactor-binding fold of many dehydrogenases (28Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Preceding this motif by seven amino acids is an arginine residue that is conserved in AtGHBDH, threonine dehydrogenase, and all of the NADP-dependent 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases. This residue is implicated in the specific binding of NADP. In contrast, all of the NAD-dependent 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases examined thus far have an aspartate residue at this position. Several other residues that have been implicated in substrate binding in 6-phosphogluconate and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases appear to be strictly conserved within AtGHBDH. These include Val-119, Ser-120, Gly-121, Lys-168, and Asn-172 numbered according to AtGHBDH. Thus, the AtGHBDH polypeptide appears to possess an NADP-binding domain and to belong to a family of dehydrogenases that has not been previously identified. The wild-type yeast and the mutant 22641c expressing AtGHBDH grew well on 20 mm GABA as well as 20 mm proline or NH4+ , whereas mutant cells expressing the empty vector, pFL61, did not grow on GABA (Fig. 3). Mutant cells expressing either AtGHBDH or pFL61 had significantly higher concentrations of GABA than wild-type cells (Table I). This was accompanied by higher concentrations of GHB; however, the concentrations in cells expressing AtGHBDH were 8-fold higher than in those expressing pFL61. Negligible GHB was synthesized by all of the strains when grown on proline or NH4+ as the sole nitrogen source. These experimental data confirm that the isolated Arabidopsis cDNA encodes a polypeptide with GHBDH activity.Table IComparison of GABA and GHB pool sizes in wild type yeast (Σ1278b) and the SSADH-deficient mutant (22641c) transformed with the empty vector (pFL61) or AtGHBDHYeast strainNitrogen sourceGABA poolGHB poolμmol g-1 DWμmol g-1 DWWild typeGABA59.8 ± 2.00.199 ± 0.042Proline0.666 ± 0.0790.082 ± 0.051NH4SO40.081 ± 0.0070.012 ± 0.012pFL61GABA604 ± 2610.9 ± 0.3Proline0.445 ± 0.0260.117 ± 0.042NH4SO40.096 ± 0.013N.D.GHBDHGABA561 ± 2990.0 ± 5.9Proline0.467 ± 0.0200.059 ± 0.031NH4SO40.091 ± 0.0040.023 ± 0.012 Open table in a new tab Role of GHBDH/GHB in Arabidopsis—To investigate the role of GHBDH in planta, we first demonstrated using relative RT-PCR that the expression of GHBDH or GABA-T was similar among various plant parts (leaves 1–3, leaves 4–6, leaves 7–8, roots, flowers, and siliques) from untreated Arabidopsis plants (data not shown) and therefore independent of organ-specific and developmental regulation. We then subjected Arabidopsis plants to flooding for up to 4 h to induce oxygen deficiency and determined the expression of both genes in leaves as well as the concentrations of GHB, the product of the GHBDH reaction, and related metabolites (Fig. 1). The relative levels of both gene transcripts at 2 and 4 h were lower in flooded plants than in control plants (Fig. 4), whereas the concentrations of GABA and alanine as expected (5Bown A.W. Shelp B.J. Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1989; 8: 21-25Google Scholar) were significantly higher in leaves of flooded plants (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by a 60% greater accumulation of GHB in flooded plants. Green tea and soybean sprouts exhibit a similar increase in the pool size of GHB during exposure to oxygen deficiency (13Allan, W. L., Peiris, C., Brown, A. W., and Shelp, B. J. (2003) Can. J. Plant Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar).Fig. 5Metabolite pool sizes in Arabidopsis plants subjected to flooding for up to 4 h. All of the plants were placed in the dark during the time course. The closed and open symbols represent control and flooded plants, respectively.

Shelp B.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Shelp B.J. Bown A.W.

Plant Sci. 2000; 19: 479-509Crossref Google Scholar); 2) restricted SSADH activity due to altered NAD/NADH ratios (7Busch K.B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Busch K.B. Piehler J. Fromm H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10110-10117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thereby causing the accumulation of SSA and the feedback inhibition of GABA-T activity (29Van Cauwenberghe O.R. Shelp B.J. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 575-581Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and 3) the induction of alanine transaminase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of alanine from pyruvate and glutamate (30Good A.G. Muench D.G. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 99: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite uncertainty regarding the relative contribution to pool size of these mechanisms, it seems probable that a significant portion of the SSA derived form GABA under flooding-induced oxygen deficiency was converted to GHB and that this result could not be attributed to up-regulation of gene transcription. Recent research using SSADH knock-out mutants in yeast (27Coleman S.T. Fang T.K. Rovinsky S.A. Turano F.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 244-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and plants (31Bouché N. Fait A. Bouchez D. Moller S.G. Fromm H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6843-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) established that the GABA shunt plays a role in preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, probably by providing a source of reducing equivalents for the maintenance of antioxidant pools or by scavenging SSA. Earlier research on mammals suggested that GHB also functions in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, probably by providing NADPH (11Mamelak M. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1989; 13: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, oxygen deficiency increases the production of NADPH (32Harding S.A. Oh S.-H. Roberts D.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Lee S.H. Seo H.Y. Kim J.C. Heo W.D. Chung W.S. Lee K.J. Kim M.C. Cheong Y.H. Choi J.Y. Lim C.O. Cho M.J. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar); however, the oxidation of NADPH as well as NADH via the mitochondrial respiratory chain is limited (34Moller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings could suggest that GHBDH and SSADH activities in plants are regulated in a complementary fashion by redox balance and that GHB functions in oxidative stress tolerance. Other studies using anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp. and R. utropha have shown that GHB is part of a fermentation pathway from SSA to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, acetate, and butyrate (35Hardman J.K. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2088-2093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wolf R.A. Urben G.W. O'Herrin S.M. Kenealy W.R. Appl. Environ.

In animals, GHB serves as both product and precursor of the neurotransmitter GABA (40Rumigny J.F. Maitre M. Cash C. Mandel P.

Indeed, its sedative and mood-elevating properties have contributed to its use as a recreational drug (45Galloway G.P. Frederick S.L. Staggers Jr., F.E. Gonazales M. Stalcup S.A. Smith D.E.

To elucidate the signaling events triggered by TL1A-DR3 interaction and to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating DR3-mediated apoptosis, we have studied the effect of TL1A and an agonistic DR3 monoclonal antibody in human erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, which express DR3 endogenously. TL1A induced the formation of a DR3 signaling complex containing TRADD, TRAF2, and RIP and activated the NF-κB and the ERK, JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. However, TL1A or an agonistic DR3 monoclonal antibody did not induce apoptosis in these cells nor were there detectable levels of FADD or procaspase-8 seen in the signaling complex. Interestingly, DR3-mediated apoptosis was induced in TF-1 cells in the presence of a NF-κB pathway-specific inhibitor but not in the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, either alone or in combination, suggesting that DR3-induced NF-κB activation was responsible for resistance to apoptosis in these cells. Consistent with this, we found that TL1A significantly increased the production of c-IAP2, a known NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic protein, and that the NF-κB inhibitor or cycloheximide prevented its synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of c-IAP2 production by RNA interference significantly sensitized TF-1 cells to TL1A-induced apoptosis. Our study identifies a molecular mechanism by which TL1A and DR3 regulate cell fate in TF-1 cells.

Although TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of DR4 or DR5 is important in eliminating cancer and virus-infected cells, FasL-mediated Fas activation leads to activation-induced T cell death and lymphocyte homeostasis. Identification of the signaling molecules and signal transduction pathways activated by the death receptors has greatly enhanced our understanding of this death receptor-dependent extrinsic apoptosis pathway as well as the physiological and pathological functions of the death receptors (Refs. 6Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 7Baud V. Karin M.

Med. 2001; 1: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and references within). Among them, TNFR1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 are the best studied. Binding of FasL or TRAIL to cell surface Fas or DR4 (or DR5), respectively, triggers the association of the intracellular adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to the death domain of the receptor and the activation of caspase-8 and/or caspase-10. These initiator caspases induce a cascade of caspase activation that leads to the activation of effector caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7, and ultimately cell death. On the other hand, signal transduction induced by TNF binding to TNFR1 first recruits intracellular TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD). As a platform adaptor, TRADD then recruits the adaptor protein FADD, TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), and receptor interactive protein (RIP) to stimulate apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and NF-κB activation, respectively. Consistent with their ability to activate different signaling pathways, death receptors such as Fas, DR4, and DR5 preferentially induce apoptosis, whereas TNFR1 mediates cell growth, survival, differentiation, or death depending on the cellular context. From the study of TNF-induced apoptosis, it became apparent that NF-κB is a key regulator of a the life or death decision of a cell because it plays a major role in inhibition of apoptosis by activation of gene expression (9Beg A.

Among the many NF-κB target genes, members of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (c-IAP), such as c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, have been shown to prevent cell death by directly inhibiting effector caspases (15Roy N.

DR3 appeared to bind to downstream signal transducers TRAF2, RIP, FADD, and caspase-8 through the association with TRADD (21Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Yu G.L. Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R. Xing L.

Similar to TNFR1, DR3-induced apoptosis is FADD- and caspase-8-dependent in embryonic fibroblasts (27Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W.

However, these results were obtained in transient systems where DR3 and/or the signaling molecules were overexpressed. The physiological signal transducers activated by DR3 through engaging its cognate ligand have not been studied. Recently, we have reported the identification and initial characterization of TL1A, a new member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines and a long sought ligand for DR3 (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A.

Interestingly, we found that 24 h of TL1A treatment of the TF-1 human erythroleukemic line or PHA-activated T cells, which both naturally express DR3, did not result in significant apoptosis. Programmed cell death was induced in TF-1 cells when TL1A was used together with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Wei P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the physiological role of DR3 in thymocyte apoptosis was suggested by DR3 knockout studies, in which targeted disruption of DR3 expression in mice led to reduced removal of autoreactive T cells in the thymus (29Wang E.C. Thern A. Denzel A. Kitson J. Farrow S.N. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3451-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for this cell context-dependent apoptosis induction by DR3, we investigated the signal transducers and signaling pathways activated by TL1A-DR3 interaction and studied the roles of these pathways in DR3 apoptosis induction in TF-1 cells. TF-1 cells are CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells, and understanding the role of TL1A and DR3 in the growth regulation of these cells could have physiological importance and clinical relevance. Our study demonstrated that in these cells, TL1A binding to endogenous DR3 initiates the formation of a signaling complex containing TRADD, TRAF2, and RIP but no detectable amount of FADD, procaspase-8, or c-IAP1. Although both the NF-κB and all three MAPK pathways were activated by either TL1A or a DR3 agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb), we found that only DR3-induced NF-κB activation played a major role in cell fate determination in these cells, and it is mediated at least in part through c-IAP2, a known NF-κB-induced anti-apoptosis factor. Constructs, Recombinant Proteins, and Stable Cell Lines—Constructs for human DR3Δ DD, rhTL1A, and DR3-Fc, as well as stable cell lines expressing pcDNA3.1 vector control and DR3Δ DD, have been described previously (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P.

Death domain-truncated mouse DR3 (mDR3Δ DD, amino acids 1-324) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1. Stable cell lines expressing human DR3Δ DD or mouse DR3Δ DD were selected in HEK293F cells with 500 μg/ml of genticin (Invitrogen). Individual clones were isolated by two rounds of serial dilution and confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and flow cytometry. Antibodies and Reagents—DR3 mAbs and a control mAb (mIgG1) were generated in mice using hybridoma technology as described (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies against phosphorylated ERK (detect phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2), phosphorylated c-Jun, IκBα, TRADD, TRAF2, and actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK and anti-ERK were from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-c-IAP1, anti-c-IAP2, and anti-XIAP were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-caspase-8 and anti-caspase-3 (detecting both the pro and cleaved forms), anti-Bcl-2, and anti-Bcl-xL were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Anti-FADD and anti-c-FLIP were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SODD was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The NF-κB pathway-specific peptide inhibitor SN50 (AAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRKRQKLMP) and control peptide SN50M (AAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRNGQKLMP) were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth, PA) The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, U0126, JNK inhibitor SP600125, and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Caspase Assay and Flow Cytometry—TF-1 cell caspase assays were essentially as described (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Wei P.

Briefly, the cells were seeded at 75,000 cells/well in clear bottom, black 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were then treated with rhTL1A or F05 with or without cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 6 h or in the presence or absence of different kinase inhibitors for different time points. Total caspase activity was measured directly in the wells using a homogeneous caspase assay kit (Roche Applied Science) that detects activation of caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 (catalog number 3005372). Release of rhodamine 110 was measured using a fluorescence plate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. The procedures for flow cytometry have been described in detail previously (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S.

Immunoprecipitation—TF-1 cells in log phase growth were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were treated with rhTL1A (0.2 μg/ml), and a 1-ml aliquot was taken at each time point, spun down, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, plus freshly added 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell pellet was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell lysates were incubated with 50 μg of F05 mAb or control mIgG1 and 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at 4 °C for 5 h with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl and twice again with lysis buffer before boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SEAP Reporter Assay—-TF-1 cell lines stably expressing the SEAP reporter under the control of NF-κB or SRE enhancer were described previously (31Shi Y. Wang W. Yourey P.A. Gohari S. Zukauskas D. Zhang J. Ruben S. Alderson R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells in log phase growth were washed and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% FBS overnight before being treated with different concentrations of rhTL1A or F05 in the presence or absence of SN50 or SN50M. The supernatants were collected 8-24 h later, and SEAP activity was measured using a Phospha-Light BP300 system (Applied Biosystems). Western Blot Analyses of rhTL1A- and F05-induced Activation of Various Signaling Pathways—TF-1 cells in log phase growth, at 1 × 106 cells/ml, were kept in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% FBS for overnight. The cells were then treated with various amounts of rhTL1A, F05, or control proteins for different time points. At the end of each time point, 1 ml of cells were removed and spun at 5000 rpm for 1 min before being boiled in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. The signaling molecules were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with primary antibodies (1 μg/ml) followed by secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and detected with ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Each membrane was stripped and probed for up to five times. Western Blot Detection of Anti-apoptotic Proteins in TF-1 Cells—TF-1 cells in log phase growth were washed and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing1% FBS and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2 ng/ml) at 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were treated with buffer or rhTL1A (500 ng/ml) for different time points or for 3 h with or without inhibitor CHX (10 μg/ml), SN50 (100 μg/ml), or SN50M (100 μg/ml). Aliquots of cells were removed at each time point and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) at 4 × 107 cells/ml. The lysates were then removed of cell debris and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. c-IAP2 siRNA Generation and Electroporation—Twenty-one nucleotide double-stranded siRNAs corresponding to nucleotides 387-407 (siRNA-1, 5′-aacagtggatatttccgtggc-3′) and 997-1017 (siRNA-2, 5′-aagttcaagccagttaccctc-3′) of the human c-IAP2 coding region and nonsilencing siRNA control (5′-aattctccgaacgtgtcacgt-3′) were purchased from Qiagen. 1.5 nmol of siRNA was transfected into 1.5 × 107 TF-1 cells in 0.5 ml of cold RMPI-1640 medium by electroporation using a Gene Pulser Electroporator II (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 400 microfarads. The cells were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml with complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% FBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before treated with rhTL1A or F05 mAb for another 24 h. The caspase activity was then measured as described above. Generation and Characterization of a Monoclonal Antibody against DR3—To study the signal transduction pathways and signaling molecules activated by DR3, we generated mouse mAb against human DR3 using conventional hybridoma technology (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibodies were tested by flow cytometry for their ability to bind HEK293F cells stably expressing a death domain-deleted human DR3 (DR3Δ DD, amino acids 1-345) (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A.

Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Wei P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), antibody F05 bound to HEK293F/DR3Δ DD cells but not the HEK293F/pcDNA3.1 vector control cells. An isotype control antibody (mIgG1) did not bind HEK293F/DR3Δ DD cells, nor did F05 bind HEK293F cells stably expressing the mouse DR3Δ DD (amino acids 1-324), whose extracellular domain is about 50% identical to that of human DR3 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that F05 specifically inhibits the binding of Biotin-TL1A to HEK293F/DR3Δ DD cells, and TL1A competes with F05 for binding to the same cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated that antibody F05 specifically recognizes the extracellular domain of human membrane-bound DR3. To determine whether antibody F05 is an agonistic antibody, we took advantage of the fact that the soluble recombinant human TL1A protein (rhTL1A) induces caspase activation and programmed cell death in TF-1 cells in the presence of CHX (1Migone T.S. Zhang J. Luo X. Zhuang L. Chen C. Hu B. Hong J.S. Perry J.W. Chen S.F. Zhou J.X. Cho Y.H. Ullrich S. Kanakaraj P. Carrell J. Boyd E. Olsen H.S. Hu G. Pukac L. Liu D. Ni J. Kim S. Gentz R. Feng P. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Wei P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and tested antibody F05 in the same system. Similar to the Escherichia coli-produced rhTL1A (amino acids 72-251), anti-DR3 mAb F05 potently induced caspase activation (Fig. 1B) and apoptosis (Fig. 1C) in TF-1 cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml of CHX, whereas an isotype control mouse IgG1 (mIgG1) or the heat-inactivated rhTL1A (TL1A HI) had no effect. The EC50 values for rhTL1A and F05 in caspase assays were 56 and 71 ng/ml, respectively. No effect on apoptosis or caspase activation was seen when TL1A or F05 was used in the absence of CHX (Fig. 1C and data not shown). These results demonstrated that F05 is an agonistic antibody against DR3, and neither rhTL1A nor F05 alone can trigger apoptosis in TF-1 cells. However, apoptosis can be induced by rhTL1A or F05 when protein synthesis was inhibited. This study also confirmed that caspase activation is closely correlated with the induction of apoptosis in TF-1 cells. Therefore, caspase activation was used as an indication of apoptosis in the rest of the study. TL1A-DR3 Signaling Complex Formation—Although DR3 has been shown to interact with TRAF2, RIP, FADD, and caspase-8 through TRADD in transient systems (21Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Yu G.L. Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R. Xing L. Gentz R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1996; 274: 990-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), DR3-induced signaling complexes have not been studied in cells that naturally express DR3. To identify the physiological signal transducers recruited to DR3 immediately after TL1A binding, we treated TF-1 cells with rhTL1A for various time periods (0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min), and the DR3 signaling complex was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates with antibody F05 or control mIgG1. After analysis of the precipitated protein content by Western blotting, we consistently found that TRADD, the platform adaptor, and signal transducers TRAF2 and RIP were recruited to DR3 (Fig. 2 and data not shown). This DR3 signaling complex can be detected as early as 5 min after TL1A stimulation and remains intact for at least 60 min (Fig. 2). Interestingly, more RIP proteins appear to be recruited to the complex at the 60-min time point than any of the earlier time points. Very little, if any, FADD, procaspase-8, or c-IAP1 protein was detected in the same complex, whereas significant amounts of these molecules were present in TF-1 cells (Fig. 2, compare Input lane with others). We also noted that untreated TF-1 cells lack a detectable amount of the c-IAP2 protein (see Figs. 6 and 7).

Nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph1 are the other proteins of this complex. The Presenilins probably contribute the catalytic activity to the protease complex. However, several investigators reported normal Aβ-peptide generation in cells expressing Presenilins mutated at the putative catalytic site residue Asp-257, contradicting this hypothesis. Because endogenously expressed wild type Presenilin could contribute to residual γ-secretase activity in these experiments, we have reinvestigated the problem by expressing mutated Presenilins in a Presenilin-negative cell line. We confirm that Presenilins with mutated Asp residues are catalytically inactive. Unexpectedly, these mutated Presenilins are still partially processed into amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments by a “Presenilinase”-like activity. They are also able to rescue Pen-2 expression and Nicastrin glycosylation in Presenilin-negative cells and become incorporated into large ∼440-kDa complexes as assessed by blue native gel electrophoresis. Our study demonstrates that the catalytic activity of Presenilin and its other functions in the generation, stabilization, and transport of the γ-secretase complex can be separated and extends the concept that Presenilins are multifunctional proteins.

Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The observation that site-directed mutagenesis of either Asp-257 or Asp-385 toward alanine (and also other amino acid) residues resulted in a dominant negative version of PS was pivotal for this hypothesis (34Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). These investigators found that strong overexpression of such “aspartate mutants” could suppress the expression of wild type PS, resulting in the complete inactivation of γ-secretase activity. This “replacement phenomenon” of endogenously expressed wild type PS by overexpressed mutant PS is not well understood. Probably, the competition of endogenously and exogenously expressed PS for “limiting cellular factors” responsible for the stabilization of newly synthesized PS could explain this phenomenon (53Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is possible that the recently discovered Aph1, Pen-2, and Nicastrin are these limiting factors (5Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Precisely because of this replacement phenomenon, experiments studying overexpressed PS containing Asp mutations (PSD/A) in a wild type background are difficult to interpret. Effects can indeed be the result of a loss of catalytic function of the mutated PS itself, but it is as likely that these aspartyl mutations distort the three-dimensional structure of PS and therefore hamper the assembly of a “normal” active γ-secretase complex (4Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

Both groups of investigators claimed the total replacement of endogenously synthesized PS by the mutant PS, making it difficult to explain this discrepancy. Although the second series of observations are in essence not compatible with the hypothesis that Asp-257 is part of the catalytic site, these results are not conclusive because it is extremely difficult to rule out the possibility that variable small amounts of endogenously expressed wild type PS confuse the interpretation of the experiments (58De Strooper B. Annaert W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E221-E225Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to reevaluate the effects of the Asp mutations on PS function in a PS-deficient cell line (39Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W.

We also analyzed the role of these aspartyl residues in the proteolytic cleavage of PS itself, the so-called “Presenilinase” activity that previously was proposed to be autocatalytic (34Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar), and the incorporation of these mutant PSs into the γ-secretase complex. Cell Culture, Generation of Stable Cell Lines, and Transduction with Adenovirus—PS1- and PS2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum. At 50% confluency, MEFs were transduced using a replication-defective recombinant retroviral system (Clontech) harboring the respective inserts (human PS1, PS1/D257A, PS1/D385A, and PS1/D257A/D385A). Stable transfected cell lines were selected using 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Confluent stable MEF cell lines were transduced with human APP-695 by infection at 50 multiplicity of infection for 2 h at 37 °C with recombinant adenovirus Ad5/CMV-APP (see below) using a minimal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 2 h, cells were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and maintained overnight at 37 °C. Conditioned medium then was collected and immunoprecipitated with mAb 4G8 (Senetek) recognizing Aβ and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The bound material was eluted from the beads using Nu-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min, and proteins were separated on a 12% Nu-PAGE precasted gel (Invitrogen). After the transfer, Western blot analysis was performed using mAb WO2 (1 μg/ml) (60Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Recombinant Adenovirus—Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus Ad5/CMV-APP that expresses wild type human APP-695 was prepared by direct ligation as described previously (61Yuan H. Zhai P. Anderson L.M. Pan J. Thimmapaya B. Koo E.H. Marquez-Sterling N.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The APP-695 expression cassette, which includes a 5′-CMV immediate-early promoter and a 3′-polyadenylation sequence, was inserted into the E1a genomic region of human type 5 adenovirus (Ad5), and the resulting construct was propagated in permissive (human embryonic kidney 293) cells. NotchΔE and Notch intracellular domain (NICD) cDNA was cloned in the pIPspAdapt6 plasmid and transfected with the appropriate cosmid into PerC6/E2A cells, yielding the Ad5/dE1dE2A/CMV NotchΔE virus (62Michiels F. van Es H. van Rompaey L.

The 5–13.5% polyacrylamide gradient as well as all of the buffers used for electrophoresis were prepared as described by Schägger et al. (63Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The cathode buffer consisted of 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and Coomassie Blue G-250 (0.01%). The gel buffer contained 150 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, 1.5 m aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0, and the anode buffer finally contained 50 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 (4 °C). Microsomal membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 0.5% dodecylmaltoside, 20% glycerol, and 25 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, for 30 min on ice. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min), the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured (protein assay of Bio-Rad). Finally, extracts were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until use. For Blue native-PAGE, 30-μl extract was mixed with 3 μl of the following buffer: 5% Coomassie Blue G-250, 200 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, 1 m 6-aminocaproic-acid, pH 7.0, and 30% sucrose. 70 μg of total protein extract was loaded in each lane. Blue native-PAGE was performed at 4–6 °C. After an initial run at 80 V to allow the protein sample to run into the stacking gel, electrophoresis was continued at 200 V for 1 h. The Coomassie Blue G-250 containing cathode buffer was replaced by a buffer without the dye and run for another 1.5 h. The gel was incubated in 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol for 10 min at room temperature and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blot was de-stained for 1 h in distilled water/methanol/acetic acid (60/30/10) and reacted with the appropriate antibodies.

MNLERVSNEEKLNLC in the COOH terminus of Pen-2 and CSRVMVYSALRIPPED in the COOH terminus of the long splice variant of Aph1a were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce Imject). All of the polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified against the peptide antigen immobilized on a NHS-Sepharose matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).

The p38 MAPK pathway stabilizes many otherwise unstable ARE-containing mRNAs encoding proteins involved in inflammation; however, the mRNA decay step(s) regulated by the signaling pathway are unknown. To investigate whether it regulates deadenylation or the decay of the mRNA body, we used a tetracycline-regulated β-globin mRNA reporter system to transcribe pulses of mRNA of uniform length. We measured on Northern gels the migration of reporter mRNAs isolated from cells transfected only with reporter plasmid or co-transfected with an active mutant of MAPK kinase-6, and treated either with or without the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580. Differences in migration were shown by RNase H mapping with oligo(dT) to be due to poly(A) shortening. Insertion of an ARE into the β-globin reporter mRNA promoted rapid deadenylation and decay of hypo-adenylated reporter mRNA. p38 MAPK activation inhibited the deadenylation of reporter mRNAs containing either the cyclooxygenase-2 or tumor necrosis factor AREs. The regulation of deadenylation by p38 MAPK was found to be specific because deadenylation of the β-globin reporter mRNA either lacking an ARE or containing the c-Myc 3′-untranslated region (which is not p38 MAPK-responsive) was unaffected by p38 MAPK. It was concluded that the p38 MAPK pathway predominantly regulates deadenylation, rather than decay of the mRNA body, and this provides an explanation for why p38 MAPK regulates mRNA stability in some situations and translation in others.

The control of mRNA stability is fundamental in regulating gene expression. This is reinforced by the fact that mRNA stability can be modulated by cell signaling events (1Dean J.L. Brook M.

It is now known to stabilize a wide range of mRNAs, particularly those encoding proteins that are involved in inflammation. These include tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-8, MIP-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), GRO-α, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 (see Ref. 21Clark A.R. Dean J.L. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar for references). Two other MAPKs, namely c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p42 MAPK (or extracellular signal-regulated kinase), have also been shown to stabilize IL-2 and GM-CSF mRNAs, respectively (2Chen C.Y.

The best characterized p38 MAPK-regulated mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs), consisting of multiple, frequently overlapping copies of the AUUUA motif. An important property of the ARE is its ability to direct instability of an mRNA. A wide range of AREs destabilize mRNAs in vivo by promoting rapid deadenylation (4Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 24Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 25Chen C.Y.

Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear if this is performed by a Dcp1-like or scavenger activity (20Wang Z. Jiao X. Carr-Schmid A. Kiledjian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12663-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPK stabilizes mRNA by blocking the ability of AREs to destabilize mRNA (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

Despite the identification of numerous ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs), it is unclear which (if any) provides a link between p38 MAPK and the ARE. One ARE-BP, tristetraprolin (TTP), is destabilizing and directs deadenylation (29Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is an in vitro substrate of MAPKAPK-2 (30Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); however, TTP is not necessarily involved in the basic stabilization mechanism because it is not expressed in HeLa cells in which regulation of reporter mRNAs by p38 MAPK has been studied. 2J.

HuR is thought to stabilize mRNA by inhibiting the decay of hypo-adenylated intermediates (35Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B.

In order to identify the link between mRNA stability and p38 MAPK, it is necessary to ascertain which specific mRNA decay steps are regulated by the signaling pathway. To do this we transcribed pulses of reporter mRNA in cells containing active or inactive p38 MAPK and followed poly(A) tail length and decay of the mRNA by Northern blotting. We show that p38 MAPK stabilizes mRNA by blocking ARE-directed deadenylation. Materials—General laboratory reagents were supplied by Sigma and VWR Scientific (Lutterworth, Leicestershire, UK).

Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) by inserting a 123-nt sequence that spans the main regulatory ARE of the human COX-2 3′-UTR into the unique BglII site in the β-globin 3′-UTR in pTet-BBB (a kind gift of A.-B. Shyu, Houston Medical School, Houston, TX). pTet-BBB-c-Myc 3′-UTR was constructed previously (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Tet-BBB-TNF ARE was constructed by inserting a 44-nt oligonucleotide spanning the human TNF ARE into the BglII site in the β-globin 3′-UTR of pTet-BBB as described previously (37Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The sequences inserted into the BglII site of pTet-BBB are shown in Fig. 5. Cell Culture—HeLa tet-off cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and G418 (100 ng ml–1). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Transfection—100,000 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 500 μl of serum-containing medium was added. 100 ng of mRNA reporter plasmid with or without 100 ng of pCMV-MKK6E DNA (a gift of J. Han) and pBluescript DNA (enough to give a total of 1 μg of DNA) were combined with 5 μl of Superfect in 100 μl (final volume) of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and overlaid onto the cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 3 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and culture medium containing tetracycline was added. Transcriptional Pulse—This was performed as described previously (38Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, pulses were produced by culturing HeLa tet-off cells in a low concentration of tetracycline (50 ng ml–1 unless stated otherwise) to block transcription of reporter mRNA for 24 h following transfection. The cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and culture medium (lacking the antibiotic) was replaced. Cells were cultured for3hto allow transcription to proceed, and then tetracycline at a high concentration (500 ng ml–1) was added to switch off transcription. Cells were then treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor or left untreated and then harvested and lysed for RNA isolation at appropriate time points. In Vitro Transcription of Riboprobes—α-32P-Labeled riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription from linearized DNA templates using T7 RNA polymerase, 12 μm cold UTP, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci mmol–1) as described previously (31Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from cells using a kit. 10 μg of RNA together with 1 μg of RNA size markers was electrophoresed on denaturing gels (2% agarose and 0.41 m formaldehyde). RNA was capillary-transferred to a nylon membrane and fixed by UV cross-linking. Prehybridization (2 h) and hybridization (overnight) with α-32P-labeled riboprobes were performed at 65 °C in Ultrahyb. Blots were washed three times for 30 min at 65 °C with 5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Signals were visualized and quantified on a Fuji (Tokyo, Japan) FLA-2000 PhosphorImager. RNase H Mapping—10 μg of RNA was mixed with 0.3 μg of oligo(dT) in distilled H2O (final volume 9.8 μl) and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. 0.8 units of RNase H, 1.2 μlof10× REact 2 buffer, and 40 units of RNasin were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. RNA was precipitated using ethanol and sodium acetate and resuspended in distilled H2O. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—This was performed as described previously (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) using β-globin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) riboprobes. Signals were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImaging. Determination of Poly(A) Tail Length—This was calculated by plotting a calibration curve of log (RNA marker length) against migration on the Northern gel. The difference in migration between BBB-COX-2 ARE and GAPDH was measured, added to a fixed value of GAPDH migration (measured from the lane adjacent to the RNA markers), and plotted on the calibration curve. This allowed for correction of any slight differences in migration due to distortions in mobility during electrophoresis. BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA length was then determined from the calibration curve. Poly(A) tail length was calculated by subtracting the theoretical length of poly(A)– BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA (712 nt) from the measured values. All measurements of mRNA migration were taken from the peak band intensity determined by PhosphorImager analysis. A Transcriptional Pulse Strategy to Generate mRNA of Uniform Poly(A) Tail Length—To investigate whether p38 MAPK inhibits deadenylation or blocks the decay of the mRNA body of ARE-containing mRNAs, we used a tetracycline-regulated transcriptional pulse-chase mRNA reporter system (38Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This system comprises HeLa cells stably transfected with a tetracycline-sensitive transcription factor (HeLa tet-off). The cells are transiently transfected with a plasmid containing a genomic rabbit β-globin gene which is under the control of the tet operon. The reporter mRNA consisted of the β-globin 5′-UTR, β-globin open reading frame, and β-globin 3′-UTR (BBB mRNA) without or with different AREs inserted into its 3′-UTR. This system allows pulses of mRNA with uniform poly(A) tail lengths to be transcribed, enabling deadenylation rates to be measured, and the decay of deadenylated intermediates to be followed. To check that the stability of mRNA produced using this pulse-chase approach was regulated by p38 MAPK, HeLa tet-off cells were transiently transfected with pTet-BBB-COX-2 ARE reporter plasmid together with or without a plasmid expressing MKK6E, an active mutant of the p38 MAPK upstream activator (MAPK kinase-6). Cells were cultured overnight in the presence of a low concentration (25 ng ml–1) of tetracycline to inhibit transcription. Tetracycline was removed for 3 h to allow a pulse of transcription to occur and then added back at a high concentration (500 ng ml–1) to re-impose transcriptional blockade. Cells were harvested at various time points; RNA was isolated, and mRNA levels in the lysates were measured by ribonuclease protection assay for β-globin and GAPDH (as a loading control). In the absence of p38 MAPK activation, no reporter mRNA was detected after overnight incubation of cells in 25 ng ml–1 tetracycline, but the transcript accumulated over 3 h following withdrawal of the antibiotic (Fig. 1). The re-addition of 500 ng ml–1 tetracycline was followed by rapid decay of the reporter mRNA, with a slight lag of around 1 h (Fig. 1). In cells co-transfected with the MKK6E expression plasmid, a small amount of BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA was detected after overnight incubation with 25 ng ml–1 tetracycline, and strong accumulation of this mRNA was observed after tetracycline withdrawal. Under these conditions the reporter mRNA level remained constant following re-addition of 500 ng ml–1 tetracycline (Fig. 1). These observations confirm that a transcriptional pulse can be generated in HeLa tet-off cells and that the stability of this reporter mRNA produced in this way is controlled by the p38 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK Increases the Rate of Deadenylation of BBB-COX-2 ARE Reporter mRNA—To examine the effect of p38 MAPK activation on the deadenylation rate of the ARE reporter mRNA HeLa tet-off cells were co-transfected with pTet-BBB-COX-2 ARE and the MKK6E expression plasmid. Cells were cultured overnight in the presence of tetracycline (50 ng ml–1) to block transcription. The antibiotic was removed for 3 h and then re-added at a higher concentration (500 ng ml–1) to generate a pulse of transcription. The cells were then either left untreated, or SB 203580 (1 μm) was added to block p38 MAPK activity. The cells were then harvested and lysed at different times, and RNA was isolated and examined by Northern blotting to measure the deadenylation rates of the reporter mRNA in the presence or absence of p38 MAPK activity. Immediately after transcriptional blockade, BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA isolated from cells containing active p38 MAPK was ∼900 nt long (Fig. 2, A and B). The parental poly(A)– BBB transcript is 589 nt (6Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA contains a 123-nt insert spanning the COX-2 ARE, giving a theoretical length of 712 nt for the poly(A)– BBB-COX-2 ARE transcript. Thus immediately after the transcriptional pulse ARE reporter mRNA had an estimated poly(A) tail length of ∼200 nt. In the absence or presence of SB 203580, the poly(A) tail was shortened to ∼50 nt, followed by rapid degradation of the mRNA body, with no further decay intermediates detected (Fig. 2). The rates of decay of the hypo-adenylated transcript appeared very similar in the absence or presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 2C); however, rates of deadenylation were markedly different (Fig. 2D). In the absence of SB 203580, it took ∼4 h for the mRNA to become hypo-adenylated and begin rapid decay, whereas in the presence of SB 203580 deadenylation was essentially completed by 2 h. Similar results were also obtained for cells that had not been transfected with the MKK6E expression plasmid. In these, the BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA signal was much weaker, but a long exposure showed that deadenylation was rapid, and following an initial lag phase the mRNA also decayed rapidly (Fig. 3A). The decay of reporter mRNA following the lag phase was slightly faster than in cells transfected with pCMV-MKK6E and treated with SB 203580 (Fig. 3B). Because deadenylated BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA decayed more slowly in cells transfected with the MKK6E expression plasmid than in cells lacking it, p38 MAPK activation may make a small contribution to the overall stabilization by slowing the decay of the mRNA body. Differences in the Mobility of BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA Are Due to Differences in Poly(A) Tail Length—To verify that the differences in mobility of BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA (Figs. 2 and 3) were due to differences in poly(A) tail length, the RNA was treated with RNase H and oligo(dT) prior to electrophoresis to remove the poly(A) tails of the mRNA. RNase H/oligo(dT) treatment of RNA from cells transfected with or without pCMV-MKK6E and isolated immediately after the transcriptional pulse caused the reporter mRNA to increase in mobility on the gel (Fig. 4). Reporter mRNA that was treated with RNase H and oligo(dT) and which now lacked a poly(A) tail migrated to the same extent (Fig. 4). This confirms that the differences in mobility seen in Figs. 2 and 3 are due to different poly(A) tail lengths and not to shortening of the mRNA from the 5′ end. The mobility of the ARE reporter mRNA isolated from pCMV-MKK6E-transfected cells 6 h after tetracycline addition also increased slightly following RNase H/oligo(dT) treatment. This confirms that the most deadenylated intermediates of BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA (Fig. 2D) still possess a short poly(A) tail. Deadenylation of BBB mRNA That Lacks an ARE Is Not Regulated by p38 MAPK—It was necessary to check that the regulation of deadenylation by p38 MAPK was specific for mRNAs that are stabilized by p38 MAPK. To do this the effect of p38 MAPK activation on the deadenylation of the parental BBB reporter mRNA was examined. In cells transfected with pTet-BBB, either with or without pCMV-MKK6E, the reporter mRNA was deadenylated at an identical rate (Fig. 6A), showing that p38 MAPK specifically inhibits ARE-directed deadenylation and not deadenylation in general. The BBB mRNA underwent very slow shortening of the poly(A) tail, and no decay was detected over the 12-h time course (Fig. 6A). Examination of BBB mRNA at later times showed that no further deadenylation occurred after 12 h (data not shown). In experiments in which the time course was extended to 24 h following tetracycline addition, no decay of the mRNA was discernible (data not shown). The marked difference in stability between deadenylated BBB mRNA and deadenylated ARE-containing reporter mRNA (Figs. 2 and 3) strongly suggests that in addition to directing rapid deadenylation, the ARE also promotes decay of the mRNA body. The BBB mRNA levels increased about 2-fold upon p38 activation (Fig. 6A). This is likely to arise from a slightly elevated rate of transcription upon activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Deadenylation Directed by the c-Myc ARE Is Not Regulated by p38 MAPK—To check that p38 MAPK only regulated deadenylation of mRNAs that contain p38 MAPK-sensitive AREs, we investigated the effect of activating the kinase on deadenylation directed by the c-Myc ARE. The c-Myc 3′-UTR contains four dispersed AUUUA motifs and several long stretches of uridylates (Fig. 5C). When inserted into the β-globin 3′-UTR it causes instability but does not respond to p38 MAPK activation (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As shown previously, BBB-c-Myc 3′-UTR mRNA decayed rapidly following blockade of transcription, and its stability was unchanged in cells co-transfected with pCMV-MKK6E (Fig. 6B). As for BBB-COX-2 ARE mRNA (Fig. 2), decay only commenced once the BBB-c-Myc mRNA was deadenylated. The smaller shift in mobility upon deadenylation seen here compared with that seen in Figs. 2 and 3 is due to the larger size of this reporter mRNA because of the insertion of 442 nt spanning the entire c-Myc 3′-UTR. Deadenylation of this mRNA was rapid and was not regulated by p38 MAPK (Fig. 6B), showing that p38 MAPK-regulated deadenylation is specific for only some AREs. As seen for BBB mRNA, the levels of the c-Myc reporter mRNA increased upon p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 6B), again possibly due to some increase in transcrip"

To understand the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser505 and Ser727 activates cPLA2, we systematically analyzed the effects of S505A, S505E, S727A, S727E, S505A/S727A, S505A/S727E, and S505E/S727E mutations on its enzyme activity and membrane affinity. In vitro membrane binding measurements showed that S505A has lower affinity than the wild type or S505E for phosphatidylcholine membranes, which is exclusively due to faster desorption of the membrane-bound S505A. In contrast, neither S727A nor S727E mutation had a significant effect on the phosphatidylcholine vesicle binding affinity of cPLA2. The difference in in vitro membrane affinity between wild type (or S505E) and S505A increased with the decrease in Ca2+ concentration, reaching >60-fold at 2.5 μm Ca2+. When HEK293 cells transfected with cPLA2 and mutants were stimulated with ionomycin, the wild type and S505E translocated to the perinuclear region and caused the arachidonic acid release at 0.4 μm Ca2+, whereas S505A showed no membrane translocation and little activity to release arachidonic acid. Further mutational analysis of hydrophobic residues in the active site rim (Ile399, Leu400, and Leu552) indicate that a main role of the Ser505 phosphorylation is to promote membrane penetration of these residues, presumably by inducing a conformational change of the protein. These enhanced hydrophobic interactions allow the sustained membrane interaction of cPLA2 in response to transient calcium increases. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for cPLA2 activation by calcium and phosphorylation.

Among multiple forms of PLA2s found in mammalian tissues, the 85-kDa group IVA PLA2 (cPLA2) has been shown to play a key role in the agonist-induced release of arachidonic acid (AA) that acts as a precursor to eicosanoids (1Clark J.D.

A central role of cPLA2 in agonist-induced AA release, which is in line with its ubiquitous distribution in mammalian tissues, has been demonstrated by recent studies using cPLA2-deficient mice (4Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 5Bonventre J.V.

Cellular cPLA2 activities are tightly regulated by different factors, including Ca2+ and phosphorylation (1Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has also been shown to activate cPLA2, but this regulatory mechanism appears to be complex. It was initially found that the phosphorylation of Ser505 by mitogen-activated protein kinases is essential for agonist-induced AA release in Chinese hamster ovary cells (12Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown, however, that the effect of Ser505 phosphorylation on agonist-induced AA release is cell type- and agonist-dependent. For instance, Ser505 phosphorylation of cPLA2 is not required for the AA release in thrombinstimulated platelets (13Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In macrophages, Ser505 phosphorylation is not essential for AA release in response to agonists that induce a sustained increase in calcium, but appears to be important when there is a transient increase in calcium (14Qiu Z.H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation analysis of cPLA2 expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells showed that the protein is phosphorylated on multiple Ser residues, including Ser454, Ser437, Ser505, and Ser727 (15de Carvalho M.G.

It was reported that among these sites, Ser454, Ser437, and Ser505 are constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated Sf9 cells but that only Ser505 phosphorylation partially contributes to cPLA2 activation (11Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies with human platelets, HeLa, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells indicated that Ser505 and Ser727 are phosphorylated in response to agonists and that phosphorylation of both sites plays an important role in agonist-induced AA release (16Borsch-Haubold A.G.

More recently, it was reported that phosphorylation of Ser515 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in vascular smooth muscle cells increased the enzymatic activity of cPLA2 (18Muthalif M.M. Hefner Y. Canaan S. Harper J. Zhou H. Parmentier J.H. Aebersold R. Gelb M.H. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39653-39660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can specifically activate cPLA2 (19Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by inducing conformational changes of the enzyme and thereby juxtaposing its active site and the membrane surface (20Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the sites of cPLA2 phosphorylation, the agonists and the protein kinases that cause cPLA2 phosphorylation, and the effects of cPLA2 phosphorylation on agonist-induced AA release, little is known about the mechanism by which cPLA2 phosphorylation activates the enzyme. Also, it is poorly understood how calcium, phosphorylation, and potentially phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate work in concert to achieve the subcellular targeting and the activation of cPLA2. This study is undertaken to address these questions with an emphasis on phosphorylation of Ser505 and Ser727. Systematic biophysical and cell studies of wild type and phosphorylation site mutants reveal that the Ser505 phosphorylation activates cPLA2 by significantly slowing the dissociation of membrane-bound cPLA2, thereby improving its overall membrane binding affinity.

Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of cPLA2—Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNAs of cPLA2 with appropriate phosphorylation site mutations were generated by the overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pVL1392-cPLA2 (21Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as a template. Transfection of Sf9 cells with mutant pVL1392-cPLA2 constructs was performed using the BaculoGold™ transfection kit from Pharmingen. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to avoid possible endotoxin contamination. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 350-ml suspension cultures and infected with high titer recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. For harvesting, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 35 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for1hat4 °C. To the supernatant, 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added, and the mixture was kept shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h. The protein was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. cPLA2 fractions were concentrated and desalted in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). In Vitro cPLA2 Activity Assay—Activity of cPLA2 was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [14C]SAPC hydrolysis as described (22Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures (50 μl) contained small unilamellar vesicles of [14C]SAPC (0.5–50 μm)in 20mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl, 10 μm Ca2+, and 16 μm BSA. Free calcium concentration was adjusted using a mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (23Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding cPLA2 to the mixture (to a final concentration of ∼10 nm) and quenched by adding 370 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (2:1:0.01, v/v/v) solution after a given period of incubation (2–4 min) at room temperature. Liberated [14C]AA was separated from the reaction mixture on small silica gel columns, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Membrane binding kinetics was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a BIAcore X biosensor system and a Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore, AB) as described previously (24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The control surface was coated with 1000 resonance unit (RU) of BSA. The sensor surface was coated with extruded large unilamellar vesicles of DHPC at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until the RU reached 2000. After lipid coating, 30 μl of 50 mm NaOH was injected at 100 μl/min to remove loosely bound vesicles. Typically, no further decrease in SPR signal was observed after one wash cycle. To probe for any uncovered surface, the flow cell was subjected to a 5-min injection of 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After coating, the drift in signal was allowed to stabilize below 0.3 RU/min before any kinetic experiments were done. Analyses were performed at 23 °C and at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. Ninety microliters of protein sample was injected for the association time of 90 s, although the dissociation was monitored for 4 min in the running buffer. After each protein injection, the lipid surface was regenerated with a 10-μl pulse of 50 mm NaOH. The regeneration was repeated until the SPR signal reached the initial background value before the next protein injection. Typically, a set of binding data include five or more protein concentrations (typically 10-fold range above or below Kd), each measured in triplicate. After each set of measurements, the entire sensor surface was removed with a 5-min injection of 40 mm CHAPS followed by a 5-min injection of 40 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was recoated for the next set of experiments. For each trial, the signal was corrected against the control surface in order to eliminate any refractive index changes due to buffer change. Furthermore, the derivative plot was used to monitor potential mass transport effects. Once these factors were checked for each set of data, the association and the dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein-binding site on the vesicle) ↔ (complex) using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore). The association phase was analyzed by using Equation 1, R=(kaC/(kaC+kd))Rmax(1-e-(kaC+kd)(t-t0))+RI(Eq. 1) where RI is the refractive index change; R max is the theoretical binding capacity; C is the protein concentration; ka is the association rate constant; and t 0 is the initial time. The dissociation phase was analyzed by using Equation 2, R=R0e-kd(t-t0)(Eq. 2) where kd is the dissociation rate constant, and R 0 is the initial response. The dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated from the equation, Kd = kd /ka. It should be noted that in our SPR analysis Kd is defined in terms of not the molarity of phospholipids but the molarity of protein-binding sites on the vesicle. Thus, if each protein-binding site on the vesicle is composed of n lipids, nKd is the dissociation constant in terms of molarity of lipid monomer (see below) (25Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty involved in accurate determination of the concentration of lipids coated on the sensor chip, however, only Kd was determined in our SPR analysis, and the relative affinity was calculated as a ratio of Kd values assuming that n values are essentially the same for wild type and mutants. Mass transport was not a limiting factor in our experiments, as change in flow rate did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation. Lipid-coated Bead Binding Measurements—The binding of cPLA2 and mutants to DHPC was measured by a sedimentation assay using DHPC-coated hydrophobic styrene-divinylbenzene beads as described previously (25Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding mixtures contained a fixed concentration of DHPC-coated beads (1 μm)in20mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl, 1 μm BSA, and varying concentrations of cPLA2 (10–200 nm). After the mixtures were incubated for 15 min, beads were pelleted (12,000 × g for 2 min), and the free protein amount was determined by activity assay using SAPC as substrate. Parameters n and Kd were determined by non-linear least squares analysis of the bound ([P] b) versus total protein concentration ([P]0) plot using a standard binding equation, Equation 3 (25Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), [P]b[P]0+Kd+[PL]0/n-([P]0+Kd+[PL]0/n)2-4[P]0[PL]0/n2(Eq. 3) where [PL]0 represents total phospholipid concentration. This equation assumes that each enzyme binds independently to a site on the interface composed of n phospholipids with dissociation constant of Kd . Cell Culture, Transfection, and Protein Production—The vectors for amino-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion cPLA2 and mutants were generated as described previously (20Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all cell studies. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells between the 5th and 20th passage were passaged into 8 wells of a Lab-Tech™ chambered coverglass. For transfection, these cells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented DMEM containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) for 7–8 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed, and the cells washed once with FBS-supplemented DMEM and overlaid with FBS-supplemented DMEM containing Zeocin™ and 140 μg/ml Ponasterone A to induce protein production. Confocal Microscopy—Protein translocation and the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i) were simultaneously monitored using a four-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. All experiments were carried out at the same laser power, which was found to induce minimal photobleaching over 30 scans, and at the same gain and offset settings on the photomultiplier tube. Also, a ×63, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used for all experiments. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser and a linepass 505-nm filter was used to monitor EGFP emission. Fura-Red and mag-indo-1 were used to determine [Ca2+] i in the submicromolar and micromolar ranges, respectively. Fura-Red was excited using the 488-nm line of argon/krypton laser, and the emitted light was collected using a 585-nm linepass filter. Mag-indo-1 was excited using the 340-nm line of the UV laser, and the emitted light was collected using bandpass filters (395–425 and 450–490 nm). Membrane Translocation of cPLA2—Thirty minutes before imaging, cells were treated with 2 μl of Fura-Red or Mag-indo-1 (10 μm final concentration). Immediately before imaging, the induction media were removed, and the cells were washed with 150 μlof2mm EGTA and then overlaid with 150 μl of HEK buffer (1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.67 mm d-glucose, 6.4 mm sucrose). After initially imaging cells, 150 μl of HEK buffer containing 2–10 μm ionomycin and 1 mm CaCl2 was added to cells for a sustained increase in [Ca2+] i , and cPLA2 translocation was monitored by time scanning at 15-s intervals. For a transient increase in [Ca2+] i , 150 μl of HEK buffer containing 5 μm ionomycin and 0.5 mm Ca2+ (final concentration) was added to the cells, and cPLA2 translocation was monitored over time. Once cPLA2 and mutants have been translocated to the nuclear envelope (typically ∼10 min), 100 μl of HEK buffer containing 5 mm EGTA (final concentration) was added, and cells were imaged. Images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. By using these tools, regions of interest in the cytosol were defined, and the average intensity in a square (1 × 1 mm) obtained with time. Membrane intensities were determined for each frame in individual cells by extending a line from the cytosol to the outside of the cell and reading off the intensity with distance along the line. By cross-checking markers on the diagram with a table of intensity data, four intensity values corresponding to the place on the line indicating the edge of the cell were averaged. Lines were drawn in at least three places in each cell, and membrane intensity values were determined and averaged. The resultant intensity values were converted to a ratio of intensity at membrane to the sum of intensities at membrane and at cytosol for each time frame. These values were plotted for the entire time course (see Fig. 4). [Ca2 + ]i Determination—For calcium imaging with Fura-Red, the regions of interest in the cytoplasm were defined, and the fluorescence intensity at a given time was measured for at least five different points and averaged (F). The fluorescence intensity at saturating calcium concentration (F max) was determined by adding 10 μm ionomycin. Similarly by adding 50 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester to the cells, the fluorescence intensity at zero free calcium (F min) was determined. [Ca2+] i was then calculated using the formula: [Ca2+] i = Kca (F – F min)/(F max – F) (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where Kca (140 nm) is the calcium dissociation constant of Fura-Red (28Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, OR1996: 503-520Google Scholar). With mag-indo-1, [Ca2+] i in the cytoplasm was ratiometrically determined at 4–15-s intervals using the equation [Ca2+] i = Kca × Q × (R – R min)/(R max – R) (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where R represents the fluorescence intensity ratio F 410/F 470 that was determined from the average background-corrected pixel values of mag-indo-1 fluorescence from the cytoplasmic area of individual cells at 410 and 470 nm, respectively; R min and R max correspond to minimum and maximum fluorescent intensity ratio at no Ca2+ and saturating calcium levels (i.e. 1mm free Ca2+), respectively. Q is the ratio of the minimum fluorescence intensity at zero free calcium (F min) to the maximum fluorescence intensity at 1 mm saturating calcium (F max) at 470 nm, and Kca is the calcium dissociation constant for mag-indo-1. R min, R max, Q, and Kca values were determined by in vitro calcium calibration using 1 μm mag-indo-1 and a set of standard calcium buffers (Molecular Probes) containing 0 to 1 mm free Ca2+. The calculated Kca (34 ± 1 μm) was the same as the reported value of 35 μm (28Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, OR1996: 503-520Google Scholar). Arachidonate Release from HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with cPLA2 and its phosphorylation mutants were radiolabeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA, although the protein expression was induced. After 20 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with the HEK buffer and then stimulated with 2–10 μm ionomycin and 1.0 mm Ca2+ in 0.5 ml of the same buffer solution containing 1% BSA. Because ionomycin was added as a dimethyl sulfoxide solution, the control experiment was done by stimulation with dimethyl sulfoxide. After cell activation, the supernatant was collected and briefly centrifuged to remove the cell pellet, and a 250-μl aliquot was subjected to scintillation counting. Also the cells were removed from the plate by applying 200 μl of trypsin-EDTA. Cells were collected by brief centrifugation, resuspended in 150 μl of HEK buffer solution, and subjected to scintillation counting to determine total radioactivity of labeled cells. The AA release into the medium was then expressed in terms of the percentage of total counts of the cell. Immunoblotting—Aliquots of HEK293 cells (2 × 106 cells/sample) were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 s, and cell pellets were lysed by the addition of the ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid). After 20 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min) to remove nuclear and cellular debris. Supernatants were mixed with the gel loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of supernatants were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE. The volume of each supernatant was adjusted so that cPLA2 bands in the gel showed comparable densities. Electrotransfer of protein from the gel to the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was achieved using a semidry system (400 mA, 60 min). The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA for 60 min and then incubated with either the anti-cPLA2 antibody for total cPLA2 determination or the anti-Ser505-phospho-cPLA antibody to detect the Ser505-phospho-cPLA2. Immunocomplexes were assayed by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Phosphorylated cPLA2 by Mass Spectrometry—The recombinant cPLA2 (or mutant) band was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and digested with 12.5 ng/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) followed by further digestion of the tryptic peptides with 20 ng/μl Asp-N endopeptidase (Roche Applied Science). Digested samples were pooled, concentrated in a SpeedVac (Savant), and pressure-loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary C18 column (Magic beads, Michrom BioResources) packed in-house (75 μm inner diameter, 10 cm long). An Agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) was used to deliver a gradient across a flow splitter to the column. Eluting peptides from the column were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed by an LCQ-Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer (Ther"

Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and post-translationally imported into the organelle. The vast majority of these proteins possess the so-called peroxisomal targeting sequence 1 (PTS1), 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting sequence; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting sequence; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; GST, glutathione S-transferase. a C-terminal tripeptide complying to the consensus sequence S/A/C-K/R/H-L/M (1Gould S.G.

According to current models of peroxisomal biogenesis, the Pex5p-mediated process of protein import can be divided into four steps. In the first step, newly synthesized PTS1-containing proteins interact with Pex5p in the cytosol. This protein-protein interaction involves the PTS1 signal on one side and the tetratricopeptide repeats domain of Pex5p on the other. The Pex5p-cargo protein complex is then recognized by the so-called docking machinery present in the peroxisomal membrane. Somewhere after this event, the PTS1-containing protein is released into the peroxisomal matrix. Finally, Pex5p is recycled back to the cytosol to catalyze additional rounds of transportation (reviewed in Refs. 10Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

One obvious property of such cyclic mechanism is that it needs some form of energy input to function, and indeed, basically all the studies addressing this issue are unanimous in this respect: protein import into the peroxisomal matrix requires hydrolysis of ATP (13Imanaka T.

Cell Res. 2001; 263: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the precise step(s) of this import pathway where energy input is necessary has not been firmly established. For instance, it is generally accepted that the step of protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane requires ATP hydrolysis. Such conclusion derives from the fact that ATP depletion or the inclusion of non-hydrolysable ATP analogues in the several experimental systems used result in an inhibition of the peroxisomal import process. However, the possibility that recycling of Pex5p back to the cytosol is an ATP-dependent event and the rate-limiting step in all this process was never considered. In this scenario, inhibition of peroxisomal protein import by lack of ATP would result from the non-availability of peroxisomal docking/translocation sites for the Pex5p-cargo protein complex and not from the inhibition of some ATP-dependent protein catalyzing the translocation of the cargo proteins across the organelle membrane. Furthermore, many newly synthesized proteins are bound by chaperones while still in the cytosol (or in a cell-free in vitro translation system). It is known that disruption of this kind of protein interaction requires ATP hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 22Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed ATP dependence of peroxisomal import may also be related, not to the translocation step per se (as assumed) but rather to the disruption of these chaperone-protein complexes with the concomitant production of import-competent cargo proteins. In fact, several data addressing the role of chaperones in peroxisomal protein import are already available and strongly suggest that this phenomenon does occur (23Walton P.A. Wendland M.

In this work, we have addressed the energetics of peroxisomal protein import by analyzing the effect of ATP on the insertion of Pex5p into the peroxisomal membrane. We provide data suggesting that insertion of Pex5p into the organelle membrane does not require ATP hydrolysis. This observation together with the fact that export of Pex5p from the organelle membrane is inhibited by ATPγS (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

It is proposed that protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane is driven by protein-protein interactions involving the peroxisomal targeting domain of Pex5p, on one side, and the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery on the other. Preparation of Rat Liver Subcellular Fractions for in Vitro Import Experiments—Rat liver post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) for in vitro import experiments were prepared as described before (26Gouveia A.M.

Purified organelles were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA-NaOH (pH 7.4) (protein concentration, 20–40 mg/ml), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –70 °C. It is likely that this treatment results in some leakage of the peroxisomal matrix proteins, a factor that complicates the experiments in which the cargo dependence of Pex5p import is analyzed (see Fig. 2A). However, considering that: 1) the Kd for the Pex5p-PTS1 protein complex is 190 nm (29Gatto Jr., G.J. Maynard E.L. Guerrerio A.L. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M.

In Vitro Import Experiments—Import reactions were performed at 26 °C for 30 min (unless indicated otherwise) in 100 μl of import buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-KOH, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (w/v) lipid-free bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm methionine) using 0.5 μl of a reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Pex5p and 80 μg (protein) of purified peroxisomes or 150 μg of rat liver PNS. In some experiments, import buffer lacking MgCl2 was used (import buffer B). Proteinase K treatment of import reactions, SDS-PAGE, and analysis by autoradiography were performed exactly as described before (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C.

Treatment of purified peroxisomes with EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.4 (final concentration, 12 mm), was made on ice for 10 min in import buffer B. Some samples were further incubated on ice for 5 min with 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (added from a 100-fold stock solution in ethanol). All the other samples received the same volume of ethanol. Reticulocyte lysates were treated in the same way after diluting the samples 1:10 with import buffer B. ATP depletion of purified peroxisomes and reticulocyte lysates was performed according to a published protocol (32Glick B.S.

The antibody directed to rat PMP70 was purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. The anti-catalase antibody is from Research Diagnostics, Inc. Immunoglobulins were purified from rabbit sera using Protein-A-Sepharose beads, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit antibodies were detected on Western blots using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using the UN-SCAN-IT automated digitizing system. Import of Pex5p Is Influenced by the Levels of Endogenous Peroxisomal Pex5p—Recently, we described a peroxisomal in vitro import system particularly suited to study Pex5p association with and release from the peroxisomal compartment (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The system consists in incubating a PNS from rat liver with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled Pex5p. Import of Pex5p is monitored by protease treatment of import reactions; non-imported Pex5p is completely degraded, whereas the imported protein acquires resistance to proteinase K. By using this assay, two different populations of peroxisomal Pex5p were identified and characterized: the so-called stage 2 Pex5p, a population of the receptor exposing ∼2 kDa of its N terminus into the cytosol; and stage 3 Pex5p, a membrane-associated molecule completely resistant to proteinase K. Data suggesting that stage 2 is the precursor of stage 3 Pex5p and that this population leaves the peroxisomal compartment in an ATP-dependent process were also provided (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have also shown that insertion of 35S-labeled Pex5p into the peroxisomal membrane is strongly inhibited in the presence of ATPγS (a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue) or by enzymatic ATP depletion of the import reactions (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This observation could suggest that the peroxisomal import of Pex5p requires ATP. However, as emphasized previously (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the possibility that the majority of the docking/translocation sites of the peroxisomal membrane were already occupied by endogenous rat liver Pex5p could not be excluded. The fact that peroxisomal Pex5p is exported from the organelle in an ATP-dependent process (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) precluded any conclusion on the role of ATP (if any) on the Pex5p import step. As an attempt to determine whether the rate of import of 35S-labeled Pex5p is influenced by peroxisomal export of endogenous Pex5p, we tried to separate in time the two processes. For this purpose, a PNS fraction was incubated in the presence of 1 mm ATP at 26 °C for 15 min, conditions that promote peroxisomal export of endogenous Pex5p (see below; Ref. 26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The import reaction was then supplemented with 10 mm ATPγS, and 2 min later, 35S-labeled Pex5p was added. Two control import reactions were performed in parallel. In one reaction, a PNS fraction was first incubated with 1 mm ATPγS for 15 min (endogenous Pex5p is not exported from the peroxisome under these conditions), and only then a mixture of ATP and ATPγS was added. The final concentrations of ATP and ATPγS in this reaction were 1 and 10 mm, respectively, as above. Import was initiated 2 min later by adding 35S-labeled Pex5p. In the second control reaction, ATP alone was used both in the pre-incubation step (1 mm) and in the import reaction (final concentration, 11 mm). The rates of peroxisomal import of 35S-labeled Pex5p observed under these three conditions were then compared by analyzing protease-treated aliquots of the import reactions removed 5 and 15 min after adding the 35S-labeled protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, when ATP is the only exogenous nucleotide present, import of 35S-labeled Pex5p can be easily detected 5 min after starting the import reaction (upper panel, lane 7). Under these conditions, stage 2 Pex5p is the most prominent peroxisomal population detected, as described before (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the sample where the PNS fraction was preincubated with ATPγS and afterward subjected to an import reaction in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 10 mm ATPγS, no import of Pex5p could be detected during the complete time of the incubation (lanes 6 and 9). In sharp contrast, under the same concentrations of ATP and ATPγS, a robust amount of protease-protected Pex5p (corresponding to stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p) is observed in the sample preincubated with ATP (lanes 5 and 8). The behavior of the endogenous peroxisomal pool of Pex5p was also monitored in this experiment. The amounts of protease-protected Pex5p as well as the ratios of stage 2 to stage 3 Pex5p obtained under different incubation conditions (Fig. 1A, middle panel, lanes 2–10) were compared with those present in a PNS fraction that was subjected to no incubation (lane 1). Treatment of a PNS fraction with 1 mm ATPγS for 15 min followed by a 17-min incubation in the presence of 1 mm ATP plus 10 mm ATPγS does not change significantly the total amount of peroxisomal protease-protected Pex5p (compare lanes 3, 6, and 9 with lane 1 in Fig. 1A, middle panel; see also Fig. 1B). In sharp contrast, treatment of PNS fractions with 1 mm ATP for 15 min decreases the levels of protease-protected Pex5p to ∼35% (compare lanes 2 and 4 with lane 1; see also Fig. 1B), indicating that the majority of peroxisomal Pex5p was exported from the organelles, as expected. Further incubation of this PNS fraction in the presence of 11 mm ATP does not change significantly the amount of protease-protected endogenous Pex5p (lanes 7 and 10; see also Fig. 1B), suggesting that steady-state levels of peroxisomal Pex5p were reached within the first 15 min of incubation. In contrast, incubation of an ATP-treated PNS fraction with ATPγS leads not only to an increase in the total amount of protease-resistant endogenous Pex5p but also to an increase in the ratio of stage 3 to stage 2 Pex5p (compare lane 8 with lane 2; see also Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that after pretreatment with ATP, peroxisomes import a small amount of endogenous soluble Pex5p; only when export of Pex5p is blocked (by including ATPγS in the reaction medium) can this import be detected. The ratio of endogenous stage 3 to stage 2 Pex5p in this sample (Fig. 1A, middle panel, lane 8) is quite high when compared with the stage 3:stage 2 ratio observed for the in vitro synthesized Pex5p (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 8). Two different reasons contribute to this apparent discrepancy. First, in the case of the endogenous peroxin, this result represents a situation in which peroxisomes already containing a considerable amount of stage 2 Pex5p (the precursor of stage 3 Pex5p) were subjected to a 17-min incubation in the presence of ATPγS, conditions that result in the accumulation of stage 3 Pex5p. In the case of the 35S-labeled Pex5p, this sample contains peroxisomes that have imported the in vitro synthesized peroxin for only 15 min (i.e. there was no radiolabeled stage 2 Pex5p when ATPγS was added to the reaction mixture). Thus, 35S-labeled Pex5p has first to be imported into peroxisomes originating in stage 2 Pex5p, and only then can stage 3 Pex5p be formed. Considering that this stage 2 to stage 3 transition requires some minutes to occur (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a low stage 3:stage 2 Pex5p ratio would be expected in this case. Second, in contrast to the results obtained with 35S-labeled Pex5p, there is a small amount of protease-resistant endogenous Pex5p resembling stage 3 Pex5p that remains detectable in PNS fractions incubated with ATP (Fig. 1A, middle panel, lanes 4, 7, and 10). We think that this population represents inactive Pex5p (i.e. Pex5p present in docking/translocation sites that are no longer active in the export of the peroxin) and/or inaccessible Pex5p (i.e. Pex5p entrapped into membrane vesicles of non-peroxisomal origin). When monitoring the behavior of in vitro synthesized Pex5p, neither insertion into inactive, already occupied, docking/translocation sites nor entrapment into membrane vesicles should occur, explaining why the results obtained with 35S-labeled Pex5p are always much more clear than the ones obtained with the endogenous peroxin. Although the existence of this ATP-unresponsive Pex5p population inflates the stage 3:stage 2 Pex5p ratios calculated for the endogenous peroxin, it does not change the conclusions of this experiment. In summary, these results show that in this in vitro system peroxisomal import of Pex5p is highly dependent on the process of export of endogenous Pex5p; efficient import of 35S-labeled Pex5p can be obtained in the presence of 1 mm ATP plus 10 mm ATPγS but only when peroxisomal docking/translocation sites were freed previously from endogenous Pex5p by preincubating PNS fractions in the presence of ATP. Thus, the observation that import of Pex5p is inhibited by ATPγS when this nucleotide is added at time zero of import cannot be taken as evidence to suggest that import of Pex5p requires ATP hydrolysis. In fact, the finding that the amount of imported 35S-labeled Pex5p obtained in an import reaction containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm ATPγS is not smaller than the one obtained in the presence of 11 mm ATP suggests the opposite. Import of Pex5p into Purified Peroxisomes Is Cargo Protein- and Pex14p-dependent—The best approach to determine whether a given process requires ATP or not is, of course, to quantify its efficiency both in the presence and in the absence of ATP. In the present situation, this is not an easy task because of the fact that export of endogenous peroxisomal Pex5p (an ATP-dependent process) influences the rate of import of Pex5p. It could be considered that one strategy to address this problem could consist of incubating PNS fractions in the presence of ATP (to promote export of endogenous Pex5p) and afterward to degrade this ATP enzymatically. Import of 35S-labeled Pex5p would then be quantified in the presence and absence of ATP. However, some incorrect assumptions are made in this rationale, the major one being that the initial ATP treatment would result in export of endogenous peroxisomal Pex5p with 100% efficiency. As shown above, this is clearly not the case. Thus, some stimulation of the peroxisomal import rate of Pex5p by ATP would always be obtained in this kind of experiment, regardless of the need for ATP in this process. Clearly, the energetics of Pex5p import should be addressed in a system where the behavior of endogenous pool of the PTS1 receptor is not a variable. As described recently (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), protease-protection assays using PNS fractions from rat liver revealed the existence of two peroxisomal membrane populations of Pex5p, stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p. When purified rat liver peroxisomes were subjected to a protease-protection assay and analyzed by Western blotting using a Pex5p antibody, a different result was obtained; only stage 2 Pex5p could be detected (26Gouveia A.M.

Oliveira M.E. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The absence of stage 3 Pex5p in these peroxisomal preparations led us to hypothesize that export of Pex5p from the membrane of isolated organelles is, for some reason, blocked, which prompted us to test this material in in vitro import experiments. As described below, purified peroxisomes from rat liver do import 35S-labeled Pex5p when subjected to an in vitro import reaction. However, as expected, the import efficiency of these organelles is quite low when compared with the efficiency of a PNS fraction. Indeed, we need to use in these import reactions 80 μg of purified peroxisomes to detect the amount of imported 35S-labeled Pex5p obtained with 150 μg of a PNS fraction. Considering that peroxisomal proteins correspond to 2% of total rat liver protein (27Hartl F.-U. Just W.W. Koster A. Schimassek H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this observation implies that, upon isolation, the import efficiency of rat liver peroxisomes decreases at least 26-fold. In fact, this factor is probably higher because import of the in vitro synthesized Pex5p is not competed by endogenous (cytosolic) Pex5p when purified organelles are used in these assays. Nevertheless, as shown below, this residual peroxisomal import of Pex5p presents two important properties: 1) it is cargo protein-dependent; and 2) it requires available Pex14p on the peroxisomal membrane. As shown before, insertion of Pex5p into the peroxisomal membrane requires the presence of PTS1-containing proteins in the import medium (31Gouveia A.M. Guimar"

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the SU domain in addition to other sequences in the COOH-terminal of the protein binds to dystrophin. Ca2+/calmodulin binding inhibits the syntrophindystrophin interaction (15Newbell B.J. Anderson J.T. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of the pleckstrin homology 1 domain and the NH2 terminus of the PDZ domain have been reported to bind calmodulin (16Iwata Y. Pan Y. Yoshida T. Hanada H. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in a Ca2+-independent manner (15Newbell B.J. Anderson J.T. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Oak S. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8870-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This domain has also been shown to be involved in the oligomerization of syntrophin in vitro in a Ca2+-dependent manner (17Oak S. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8870-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Calmodulin inhibits oligomerization in a Ca2+-independent manner (17Oak S. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8870-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, syntrophin has been shown to bind Grb2, an SH2/SH3 adapter protein (7Oak S.A. Russo K. Petrucci T.C. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, syntrophins likely act as adapters between the dystrophin complex of proteins and components of the cell signaling apparatus.Cell signaling often involves small G proteins. Adapter proteins such as Grb2 often recruit other proteins, which activate small G proteins. Rho family GTPases, such as Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, regulate a wide spectrum of cellular functions, ranging from cell growth and cytoskeletal organization to secretion (18Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 19Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). They are critical for skeletal muscle differentiation and regulate the expression of MyoD and myogenin.Within the DGC complex, the dystroglycans bind to muscle laminin-2 (α2β1γ1), merosin, the striated muscle isoform of laminin (20Colledge M. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5038-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Laminin also binds to integrins (11Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol.

The involvement of integrins and the DGC in muscular dystrophies suggests that both are important for muscle cell viability.We show here that laminin binds through a complex containing dystroglycans, syntrophin, and several signaling proteins. In the presence of laminin, one particular isoform of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) becomes active, whereas in the absence of laminin, a different JNK isoform is active. c-Jun becomes phosphorylated when laminin is present, and cell proliferation increases in C2C12 myoblasts. We propose that this laminin-induced signaling is a mechanism by which muscle cells are stimulated to grow.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—GDP, GTP, and GTPγS were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies against H-Ras, phosphorylated JNK (specific for phospho-JNK1 or 2), JNK1, phosphorylated (on Ser-63) c-Jun, RhoA, and Sos were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against Rac1 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibody against Cdc42 (C70820) was from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against β-dystroglycan and dystrophin were from Novocastra. Antibody against recombinant mouse α-syntrophin (amino acids 2–503) was produced in rabbit and purified by affinity chromatography on syntrophin A (amino acids 4–274)-Sepharose. Antibodies against α- and β-dystroglycan were the generous gifts of Dr. Tamara C. Petrucci (Laboratorio di Biologia Cellulare, Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Via le Regina Elena, Roma, Italy). Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Bio-Rad. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. Cyanogen bromide-pre-activated Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose were from Sigma. Mouse laminin was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available commercially.Fusion Proteins—The syntrophin fusion protein His6-Syn was prepared and purified as described previously (15Newbell B.J. Anderson J.T. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the expression of GST-Rac1 (wild type), GST-Rac1 (V12), GST-Rac1 (N17), and GST-PAK1 were kindly provided by Dr. Yi Zheng (Department of Biochemistry, University of Tennessee, Memphis). GST-Rac1, GST-Rac1 (V12), GST-Rac1 (N17), and GST-PAK1 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described elsewhere (26Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Mele S. Grazia Borrello M. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 899-907PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The major bands of the fusion proteins were of the expected size and relatively high purity (data not shown). The Bradford assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) was used to determine the protein concentrations using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Skeletal Muscle Membrane Preparation—2 g of frozen rabbit skeletal muscle (back muscle, predominantly fast twitch fibers) was homogenized in 7 volumes of pyrophosphate buffer (20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.303 m sucrose, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to minimize protein degradation (26Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 32,500 × g at 4 °C to pellet total muscle membrane. The precipitated total muscle membranes were suspended using a Dounce homogenizer with type B pestle in 600 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. 10 μl of muscle membrane preparation was saved and labeled as crude (C in the figures).Preparation of Glutathione-PAK1-Agarose—A chimeric fusion of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the p21-binding domain of p21-activated kinase (PAK1) was expressed in E. coli BL21 strain. GST-PAK1 and GST were then purified by affinity chromatography on glutathioneagarose beads as described earlier (26Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Mele S. Grazia Borrello M. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 899-907PubMed Google Scholar), the only difference being that after washing the beads thoroughly the protein was not eluted from the beads.Solid Phase Binding Assays—0.9 mg of His6-Syn (0.9 mg/ml) was coupled to 1 g of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) using procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The support was then washed with the coupling buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl) and blocked for 2 h with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl. The amount of the protein coupled (0.120 mg of syntrophin/ml if 50% Sepharose slurry) was determined by the difference in the ultraviolet absorption of the added protein and that recovered from coupling in the wash fractions. For negative controls, cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose was used to which no protein was coupled (S in the figures). Mouse laminin was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose by following a similar protocol (0.07 mg of laminin/ml of 50% Sepharose slurry).Pull-down Assay—100 μl of a 50% slurry of syntrophin-Sepharose (containing 12 μg of syntrophin) or laminin-Sepharose (7 μg) was equilibrated with buffer K (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Rabbit skeletal muscle membranes were incubated with control Sepharose, syntrophin-Sepharose, laminin-Sepharose, GST-PAK1-glutathione-agarose, or GST-glutathione-agarose in buffer K containing 1 mm GTPγS and 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing and then solubilized by addition of 2× Dig (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 2% digitonin). Incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 1 min at 1,200 rpm in a Microfuge. The resins were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer K containing 1% digitonin. The bound protein was eluted using 60 μl of twice concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature to remove the resin. The supernatants were applied to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filter (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TTBS. After washing three times with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/TTBS, the blot was incubated with affinity-purified anti-syntrophin (1:3,000 dilution), anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50 dilution), anti H-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-Cdc42 (Transduction Laboratories, 1:500 dilution), or anti-Sos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution). Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (both 1:1,000 dilution) were used for the rabbit and mouse primary antibodies, respectively. The blots were then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (7Oak S.A. Russo K. Petrucci T.C. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).For experiments in which laminin was depleted using heparin-Sepharose, the skeletal muscle membrane preparation was divided into two portions so that one portion was twice that of the other (200 and 400 μl each). The larger portion was incubated with heparin-Sepharose (200 μl of packed heparin-Sepharose), and the smaller portion was incubated with control-Sepharose (100 μl of packed Sepharose) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The samples were then centrifuged in a Microfuge at room temperature at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were saved. The supernatant from heparin-Sepharose was divided into two equal portions (200 μl each). To one part 2 μl of 1 mg/ml exogenous laminin was added. No laminin was added to the other portion. The rest of the experiment was performed as described above. Removal of laminin was confirmed by probing the supernatant from heparin-Sepharose with antibodies against merosin (Novocastra, 1:100 dilution), laminin β1 chain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution), and 2E8 anti-laminin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:500 dilution). The presence of dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and dystroglycans (α and β)inthe supernatant was confirmed by their respective antibodies.For the antibody blockade experiments, skeletal muscle membranes were divided into two equal portions. To one portion syntrophin antibody (α-Syn) was added, and to the other portion anti-maltose-binding protein antibody was added as an unrelated antibody (both antibodies were added to a final concentration of 1%) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Then the muscle membrane preparation was incubated with 100 μl of control-Sepharose or 100 μl of laminin-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing in buffer K containing 1 mm GTPγS and 1 mm CaCl2 and then for another 1 h with 1% digitonin. The rest of the experiment was performed as described above.Immunoprecipitation—Laminin was depleted from rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes using heparin-Sepharose as described above. To the laminin-depleted portion of the microsomes either nothing or 2 μl of 1 mg/ml exogenous laminin was added in buffer K containing 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Microsomes were then “precleared” with protein G-Sepharose (25 μl) by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 5 μg of anti-βDG antibody. Microsomes were then solubilized by adding 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immune complexes were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, precipitated, and washed extensively with buffer K. The bound proteins were detected by anti-Grb2 antibody (1:2,000 dilution) and visualized by ECL.Phosphorylation of JNK—Laminin was depleted from rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes using heparin-Sepharose as described above. To the laminin-depleted portion of the microsomes 3 μl of 1 mg/ml exogenous laminin, 1 μm RGDS, or 1 μm RGES peptide was added in buffer K containing 1 mm GTPγS, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Microsomes were then solubilized by adding 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Microsomes were then precleared with protein G-Sepharose (25 μl) by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 5 μg of anti-βDG antibody. The immune complexes were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, precipitated, and washed extensively with buffer K. The bound proteins were detected with a JNK1-specific antibody (1:5,000 dilution, Santa Cruz) or with anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody (1:1,000 dilution, specific for phosphorylated JNK1 or 2, Santa Cruz), and visualized by ECL.RESULTSTwo components of the DGC (β-dystroglycan and syntrophin) bind Grb2 (6Yang B.

Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and recruitment and activation of small G proteins are usually a consequence of the action of Grb2. Because the DGC binds laminin we investigated whether laminin binding to the DGC initiates signaling by activating small G proteins. Laminin-Sepharose or control-Sepharose was incubated with rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes, the membranes were detergent solubilized, and the presence of bound small GTPase proteins was investigated using specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, laminin-Sepharose binds Rac1 but not other small G proteins tested. Furthermore, most of the Rac1 found in crude microsomes binds laminin-Sepharose.Laminin is known to bind two receptors on the outside of the sarcolemma, integrins (23Mayer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14587-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and α-dystroglycan in the DGC (4Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Although integrins have no known association with syntrophin, syntrophin is a component of the DGC. Syntrophin oligomerizes (17Oak S. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8870-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and thus syntrophin-Sepharose would bind complexes containing syntrophin, such as the DGC, as well as bind those proteins that associate more directly with syntrophin. Fig. 1B shows that syntrophin-Sepharose, like laminin-Sepharose, binds Rac1 but not the other small G proteins. Thus, laminin, which presumably binds on the outside of the sarcolemma, and an intracellular DGC protein, syntrophin, show similar binding.Presumably, there is some complex of proteins containing laminin, syntrophin, and Rac1. To determine whether syntrophin was directly involved in Rac1 binding, laminin-Sepharose was again used to bind this complex, and a specific, affinity-purified syntrophin polyclonal antibody was added to determine its effect on Rac1 binding. As shown in Fig. 2, the syntrophin antibody blocks the Rac1 association with laminin, whereas another, irrelevant antibody had no effect. Thus, the order of the components must be laminin-syntrophin-Rac1.Fig. 2Rac1 is recruited to the DGC via syntrophin. Rabbit skeletal muscle membranes were incubated with antibodies against maltose-binding protein (α-MBP) or syntrophin (α-Syn) in buffer K containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm GTPγS for 1 h at 4 °C and then with control-Sepharose (S) or laminin-Sepharose (L) for 1 h at 4 °C. After solubilization with digitonin and extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples, after electrophoresis and electroblotting, were probed with antibody against Rac1. C represents crude microsomes. The arrow shows the expected size of Rac1. Molecular mass markers are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rac1 is known to oligomerize (31Zhang B. Gao Y. Moon S.Y. Zhang Y. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8958-8967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 not only shows p21 Rac1 but also shows some higher molecular mass forms that also bind the specific Rac1 antibody. These have molecular masses consistent with Rac1 dimers and tetramers and are apparent in the crude microsome sample, whereas the dimer is apparent in the third lane in Fig. 2. These are also seen in some of the other experiments. The significance of Rac1 oligomerization is not known.To determine whether syntrophin binds to Rac1 directly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay type experiment was performed in which a microtiter plate was coated with syntrophin and overlaid with GST-Rac1 (WT), GST-Rac1 (V12) or GST-Rac1 (N17). None of the forms of Rac1 such as wild type, GDP-bound, or GTP-bound forms, respectively, showed any direct association with syntrophin (data not shown), whereas a positive control, GST-Grb2, does bind in this assay (7Oak S.A. Russo K. Petrucci T.C. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of Rac1 to syntrophin-Sepharose is caused by other components in the microsome complex and not by a direct interaction with syntrophin.Syntrophin has one of the highest affinities known for Grb2 (7Oak S.A. Russo K. Petrucci T.C. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Grb2 binds Sos1, and Sos1 is known to bind to Rac1 and activate it (32Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To determine whether Sos1 is present in microsomes and whether it associates with syntrophin, the experiment in Fig. 3 was performed. Crude muscle microsomes do indeed contain Sos1, and Sos1 binds syntrophin-Sepharose. Although Sepharose alone does bind a small amount of Sos1, syntrophin clearly binds much more.Fig. 3Sos is recruited by syntrophin. Rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes (C) were incubated syntrophin-Sepharose (Syn) or control-Sepharose (S) in buffer K containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm GTPγS. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples, after electrophoresis and electroblotting, were probed with antibody against Sos. The arrow shows the expected size of Sos. Molecular mass markers are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sos1 is a GTP/GDP exchange factor that activates Rac1 (32Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Activated Rac1 (i.e. GTP-bound) in turn binds to the p21 cdc42, rac1-activated protein kinase, PAK1. The p21-binding domain of PAK1 was produced as a GST fusion protein and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The fused GST sequence was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 4, PAK1 binds Rac1 as expected but also reveals the association of Rac1 with syntrophin and β-dystroglycan, two components of the DGC. Thus, the complex under investigation contains laminin-dystroglycan-syntrophin-Sos1·Rac1·PAK1. α- and β-Dystroglycan are tightly associated in the sarcolemma, and α-dystroglycan binds laminin (33Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); thus, presumably, laminin and β-dystroglycan are associated with α-dystroglycan.Fig. 4Syntrophin recruits p21-activated kinase. Rabbit skeletal muscle membranes were incubated with GST (GST) or GST-PAK1 (PAK1) bound to glutathione-Sepharose in buffer K containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm GTPγS for 1 h at 4 °C, and then digitonin was added to the muscle membranes and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples, after electrophoresis and electroblotting, were probed with antibodies against syntrophin (Syn), β-dystroglycan (βDG), and Rac1 (Rac1). C represents crude microsomes.

https://openalex.org/W2094617289,"The TIM10 complex, composed of the homologous proteins Tim10 and Tim9, chaperones hydrophobic proteins inserted at the mitochondrial inner membrane. A salient feature of the TIM10 complex subunits is their conserved ""twin CX3C"" motif. Systematic mutational analysis of all cysteines of Tim10 showed that their underlying molecular defect is impaired folding (demonstrated by circular dichroism, aberrant homo-oligomer formation, and thiol trapping assays). As a result of defective folding, clear functional consequences were manifested in (i) complex formation with Tim9, (ii) chaperone activity, and (iii) import into tim9ts mitochondria lacking both endogenous Tim9 and Tim10. The organization of the four cysteines in intrachain disulfides was determined by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. The two distal CX3C motifs are juxtaposed in the folded structure and disulfide-bonded to each other rather than within each other, with an inner cysteine pair connecting Cys44 with Cys61 and an outer pair between Cys40 and Cys65. These cysteine pairs are not equally important for folding and assembly; mutations of the inner Cys are severely affected and form wrong, non-native disulfides, in contrast to mutations of the outer Cys that can still maintain the native inner disulfide pair and display weaker functional defects. Taken together these data reveal this specific intramolecular disulfide bonding as the crucial mechanism for Tim10 folding and show that the inner cysteine pair has a more prominent role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2087197236,"Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) block Ras farnesylation, subcellular localization and activity, and inhibit the growth of Ras-transformed cells. Although FTIs are ineffective against K-Ras4B, the Ras isoform most commonly mutated in human cancers, they can inhibit the growth of tumors containing oncogenic K-Ras4B, implicating other farnesylated proteins or suggesting distinct functions for farnesylated and for geranylgeranylated K-Ras, which is generated when farnesyltransferase is inhibited. In addition to bypassing FTI blockade through geranylgeranylation, K-Ras4B resistance to FTIs may also result from its higher affinity for farnesyltransferase. Using chimeric Ras proteins containing all combinations of Ras background, CAAX motif, and K-Ras polybasic domain, we show that either a polybasic domain or an alternatively prenylated CAAX renders Ras prenylation, Ras-induced Elk-1 activation, and anchorage-independent cell growth FTI-resistant. The polybasic domain alone increases the affinity of Ras for farnesyltransferase, implying independent roles for each K-Ras4B sequence element in FTI resistance. Using microarray analysis and colony formation assays, we confirm that K-Ras function is independent of the identity of the prenyl group and, therefore, that FTI inhibition of K-Ras transformed cells is likely to be independent of K-Ras inhibition. Our results imply that relevant FTI targets will lack both polybasic and potentially geranylgeranylated methionine-CAAX motifs. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) block Ras farnesylation, subcellular localization and activity, and inhibit the growth of Ras-transformed cells. Although FTIs are ineffective against K-Ras4B, the Ras isoform most commonly mutated in human cancers, they can inhibit the growth of tumors containing oncogenic K-Ras4B, implicating other farnesylated proteins or suggesting distinct functions for farnesylated and for geranylgeranylated K-Ras, which is generated when farnesyltransferase is inhibited. In addition to bypassing FTI blockade through geranylgeranylation, K-Ras4B resistance to FTIs may also result from its higher affinity for farnesyltransferase. Using chimeric Ras proteins containing all combinations of Ras background, CAAX motif, and K-Ras polybasic domain, we show that either a polybasic domain or an alternatively prenylated CAAX renders Ras prenylation, Ras-induced Elk-1 activation, and anchorage-independent cell growth FTI-resistant. The polybasic domain alone increases the affinity of Ras for farnesyltransferase, implying independent roles for each K-Ras4B sequence element in FTI resistance. Using microarray analysis and colony formation assays, we confirm that K-Ras function is independent of the identity of the prenyl group and, therefore, that FTI inhibition of K-Ras transformed cells is likely to be independent of K-Ras inhibition. Our results imply that relevant FTI targets will lack both polybasic and potentially geranylgeranylated methionine-CAAX motifs. The four human Ras proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B) are small GTP-binding proteins that are found at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, have intrinsic GTPase activity, and play a central role in signaling such diverse cellular responses as proliferation, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis. Ras mutations that reduce or eliminate its inherent GTPase function (typically at position 12, 13, or 61) lead to constitutive GTP binding and activation and are associated with ∼30% of human tumors (1Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, inhibition of Ras function has become the focus of numerous anti-cancer drug development efforts. One such effort has been the development of pharmacological inhibitors of farnesyltransferase (FTase), 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; GGTase I, geranylgeranyltransferase I; HA, hemagglutinin. the enzyme that catalyzes the obligate first step in a series of post-translational modifications of Ras that are collectively required for Ras to localize to the plasma membrane, where it is biologically active (2Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal four amino acids, collectively called the “CAAX” motif, are sufficient to initiate the modification of Ras by FTase. The CAAX motif includes a conserved cysteine (C), two aliphatic residues (AA) and any other amino acid (X). FTase catalyzes the covalent addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif. This isoprenylation step is followed by proteolytic removal of the -AAX sequence and carboxymethylation of the resulting carboxyl terminus. Finally, in the case of H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4A, one (N-Ras) or two (H-Ras and K-Ras4A) cysteine residues just upstream from the CAAX motif become palmitoylated. K-Ras4B is not palmitoylated and instead contains a stretch of six consecutive lysine residues (the polybasic domain, “K6”) in place of the palmitoylatable cysteines and surrounding residues. Similar post-translational modifications occur on a relatively small set of other farnesylated cellular proteins, not all of which have been identified or characterized. FTase inhibitors (FTIs) have now been studied extensively (3Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Tamanoi F. Gau C.L. Jiang C. Edamatsu H. Kato-Stankiewicz J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1636-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In preclinical studies (5Baum C. Kirschmeier P. Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2003; 5: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ohkanda J. Knowles D.B. Blaskovich M.A. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), FTIs inhibited farnesylation of H-Ras in vitro and in vivo, blocked H-Ras signaling and transformation, inhibited cell cycle progression in human tumor cell lines, and induced regression of mammary and salivary tumors in H-Ras transgenic mice and lymphoid tumors in N-Ras transgenic mice. Moreover, FTIs preferentially induce apoptosis and increase radiosensitivity in transformed cells and show additive or synergistic effects with standard cancer chemotherapies, especially taxanes. Although Ras is required for normal cell cycle progression, FTIs selectively block transformed cell growth compared with normal cells and interfere with signaling from oncogenic Ras but not from growth factors that require endogenous Ras function. This selectivity, although surprising, allayed initial fears that the clinical utility of FTIs might be limited by grossly toxic effects on nontransformed cells. Several FTIs are currently in clinical trials as cancer treatments. Although they were originally designed to be anti-Ras drugs, and although they effectively inhibit H-Ras signaling and transformation, FTIs do not block either the processing or the function of K-Ras4B (7Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D.B. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the isoform of Ras most frequently mutated in human tumors. Instead, in the presence of FTIs, K-Ras can become prenylated by the FTase-related enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) (8Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L.

Nevertheless, FTI treatment can significantly inhibit the growth of tumors containing mutated K-Ras4B (10Suzuki N. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15356-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki N. Del Villar K. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This indicates either that farnesylated proteins other than Ras must also play a role in the biological consequences of FTI treatment (13Tamanoi F. Kato-Stankiewicz J. Jiang C. Machado I. Thapar N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; : 64-70Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or that farnesylated and geranylgeranylated K-Ras function differently. Other farnesylated proteins that may be important FTI targets include the Ras-related protein RhoB (14Du W. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5492-5496PubMed Google Scholar, 15Prendergast G.C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 273-285PubMed Google Scholar), but no protein yet identified can explain all of the actions of FTIs. As it becomes increasingly clear that farnesylated proteins other than Ras are important FTI targets, it also becomes important to define clearly the mechanisms by which K-Ras FTI resistance is conferred and to identify unambiguously the K-Ras sequence elements that are involved. K-Ras resistance to FTI is the result of two distinct mechanisms. The first is alternative prenylation by GGTase which allows K-Ras to bypass the FTI block. The second results from K-Ras having a higher affinity for FTase than does H-Ras or N-Ras (20James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), making it more difficult for peptidomimetic FTIs to compete with K-Ras for FTase binding. That only K-Ras has both increased FTase affinity and a polybasic domain suggests that the polybasic domain, but not the M-CAAX common to N- and K-Ras, contributes significantly to the Ras/FTase interaction. However, James et al. (20James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) observed that neither an M-CAAX nor a polybasic domain was able by itself to increase Ras FTase affinity or the resistance of H-Ras to a benzodiazepine FTI. In order to resolve this discrepancy, further define the relative contributions of each Ras sequence element to Ras/FTase association and K-Ras FTI resistance, and develop more stringent criteria for identifying other farnesylated protein targets of FTI, we generated a comprehensive set of activated Ras mutants, consisting of all combinations of Ras background (H-, N-, and K-Ras4B), CAAX motif (-CVLS, -CVVM, and -CVIM), and polybasic domain (with or without). We then assessed their sensitivity to FTI with respect to alterations in Ras prenylation status, Ras-induced Elk-1 activation, and Ras-induced anchorage-independent cell growth. We show that the polybasic domain and the CAAX motif contribute individually to the resistance of K-Ras4B to the FTI l-744,832. We propose, in contrast to previous reports, that the polybasic domain alone confers partial FTI resistance by increasing the affinity of K-Ras4B for FTase, thereby rendering FTIs less effective as competitive inhibitors, whereas the M-CAAX motif acts primarily by promoting alternative prenylation in the presence of FTI. Finally, we also provide confirmation of the notion that FTI inhibition of the Ras-mediated transformed phenotype results in part from functional inhibition of farnesylated proteins other than Ras. These data have implications for understanding the mechanism of FTI inhibition of tumor growth. Generation of Ras Mutants—Ras constructs were generated by PCR using primers (University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Nucleic Acids Core Facility) coding for the desired mutant COOH-terminal sequence (Fig. 1). Parental oncogenic H-, N-, and K-Ras4B coding sequences (H-Ras (61L), N-Ras (12D), and K-Ras (12V)) were used as PCR templates in order to generate constitutively active Ras proteins as described (22Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson II, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Primers were also designed to generate restriction sites (SalI at the 5′-end of the coding sequence, BamHI at the 3′-end) for directional insertion into the mammalian expression vector, pDCR, in frame with the coding sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. After amplification, PCR products were purified and digested with SalI and BamHI, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated. pDCR was treated similarly. Insert was ligated into vector and transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Plasmid sequences were confirmed prior to use by automated sequencing (University of North Carolina Automated DNA Sequencing Facility). Protein expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter of pDCR and confirmed by Western analysis using anti-HA antibody MonoHA (BAbCo, Richmond, CA). Some mutants were also inserted into the mammalian expression vector pZ-IPneoSV(X)1 (22Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson II, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Ras Mutant Constructs—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in DMEM-H (Invitrogen) with 10% Colorado Calf Serum (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO) and antibiotics. Cells (plated at 5 × 105/60-mm dish on the day before transfection) were transfected with 50–100 ng of pDCR-Ras by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (23Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA was precipitated with high molecular weight carrier DNA (calf thymus DNA, Roche Applied Science) in 125 mm calcium phosphate and layered onto cells for 3–5 h. Cells were washed, shocked in 15% glycerol for 3 min, and returned to complete medium without selection for 48 h. Cells were then passaged into selective antibiotic (750 μg of active G418 per ml) and fed regularly with fresh G418. Colonies appeared after 2 weeks, and 40–70 individual colonies were pooled for use. Protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis on cell lysates using antibodies directed to the HA epitope tag (BAbCo) or to Ras (pan-Ras antibody (Ras11), catalog no. OP-40; Calbiochem). Gel Shift Assays—The sensitivity of mutant Ras proteins to FTI-induced inhibition of prenylation was evaluated by gel shift assay as described (24Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), based on the observation that prenylated Ras proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE more rapidly than their unprenylated counterparts. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were transiently transfected with H-, N-, or K-Ras4B mutant constructs as described above. Immediately after glycerol shock, cells were returned to complete medium for 48 h in the presence of a 3 or 10 μm concentration of the FTI L-744,832 (Biomol; a kind gift from Jay Gibbs and Allen Oliff (Merck)) or FTI-277 (Calbiochem; a kind gift from Saïd Sebti (University of South Florida) and Andy Hamilton (Yale)) or of vehicle (Me2SO or Me2SO plus 10 μm dithiothreitol, respectively). These two FTIs are structurally distinct CAAX peptidomimetics that are competitive with the Ras protein. Both were used throughout the study with equivalent results. We have also performed some of these studies with a variety of other CAAX-competitive FTI structures (including SCH 66336 (25Ganguly A.K. Doll R.J. Girijavallabhan V.M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1419-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) a kind gift from Robert Bishop and Paul Kirschmeier, Schering-Plough), again with similar results. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 500 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer per dish. Thirty microliters of each lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Fisher) and subjected to Western analysis using anti-HA antibodies to identify only the exogenously expressed mutant Ras proteins. Luciferase Assays—The FTI sensitivity of mutant Ras signaling through the transcription factor Elk-1 was assessed by luciferase reporter assay. NIH 3T3 cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation in duplicate with 100 ng of the appropriate Ras mutant construct, 250 ng of a Gal-Elk-1 reporter plasmid, and 2.5 μg of 5×Gal-Luciferase plasmid as described (26Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immediately after glycerol shock, cells were returned to complete medium containing various concentrations of FTI. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.2, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from the enhanced luciferase assay kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Raw data from duplicate samples were averaged and expressed as percentage of luciferase activity compared with vehicle-treated cells. All assays were performed at least three times, and data are displayed ± S.D. Soft Agar Assays—The ability of cells to grow in the absence of attachment to substrate is one of the hallmarks of a transformed phenotype and can be induced by oncogenically mutated H-, N-, or K-Ras. To determine the sensitivity of anchorage-independent growth to FTI treatment, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with constructs encoding H-, N-, or K-Ras4B mutants were removed from dishes by trypsinization and triturated to ensure a single-cell suspension. After counting, cells were plated in soft agar as described previously (23Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 3 or 10 μm FTI or vehicle. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells/35-mm dish were plated in 0.4% agar over a bottom layer of 0.6% agar. Both layers contained 1× DMEM-H, 10% serum, antibiotics, and FTI at the indicated concentrations. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for up to 2 weeks. Cell groups containing more than four cells were considered colonies. Colony formation in FTI-treated samples was expressed as percentage of colony formation in vehicle-treated samples. Ras/FTase Affinity Assays—To determine the affinity of Ras mutant proteins for FTase, in vitro prenylation assays were performed. Bacterially expressed, unprenylated Ras mutant proteins (1 μm) were incubated with [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (1 μm final concentration; specific activity of 8–10 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and recombinant FTase (50 ng) in a reaction containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm ZnCl2. Reaction volume was 50 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C and were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 4% SDS. Total protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid. After 20 min, samples were filtered through 25-mm glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schuell), which bind the protein. Reaction tubes were washed with 2 × 2 ml of 4% SDS plus 6% trichloroacetic acid, and the washes were added to the filters. Bound protein was washed with a further 4 ml of 4% SDS/6% trichloroacetic acid and then 3 × 2 ml 6% trichloroacetic acid. After drying, radioactivity bound to the filters was quantitated in a scintillation counter. Negative controls were also performed without protein substrate or using FTase that was previously inactivated by incubation for 5 min at 90 °C. Each substrate protein was reacted under standard conditions with vehicle or a range of FTI concentrations (5–625 nm) to block the farnesylation reaction. The level of farnesylation in FTI-treated samples was expressed as a percentage of maximum incorporation of [3H]farnesyl for each substrate, as determined by allowing the uninhibited reaction to go to completion. Growth Inhibition Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected as described above with 50 ng of plasmid containing wild-type H-, N-, or K-Ras4B mutated to be substrates for geranylgeranylation (H-Ras-(CVLL), N-Ras(CVVL), or K-Ras4B(CVIL) or empty vector (pZIPneo). After 48 h, cells were passaged into G418 selection until colonies appeared. Plates were washed twice in PBS, and the colonies were fixed in methanol/acetic acid and stained with 0.4% crystal violet before photography. Design and Construction of Mutant Ras Proteins—In order to evaluate the individual and combined contributions of either the methionine-containing CAAX (M-CAAX) motif characteristic of N-Ras and K-Ras4B or the polybasic domain (K6) unique to K-Ras4B, we generated a comprehensive set of chimeric Ras mutants (Fig. 1). We then evaluated the FTI sensitivity of their prenylation status, ability to induce anchorage-independent growth, and signaling through the transcription factor Elk-1. In addition, the affinity of several mutants for FTase was assessed directly. Since all mutations were near the COOH terminus, constructs were produced by PCR using mutagenic COOH-terminal primers. The COOH-terminal region of the parental Ras sequences were aligned as shown in Fig. 1, and the mutants were generated by homologous substitution between corresponding regions of each sequence. Two of the constructs (H-(K6) and H-(K6)-CVIM) were further modified to remove a palmitoylatable cysteine residue at position 184. This was done because Ras proteins normally contain, in addition to the CAAX motif, either a palmitoylated cysteine(s) or a polybasic domain but not both. Without this substitution, these two constructs would contain three potential membrane-targeting sequences, making it difficult to determine unambiguously the relative contributions of the CAAX motif and the polybasic domain to FTI resistance. The Polybasic Domain Confers FTI Resistance in the Absence of Alternative Prenylation—The observed FTI resistance of N- and K-Ras4B as compared with H-Ras has been attributed to two possible mechanisms that may function in vivo separately or together. First, higher affinity between K-Ras4B and FTase may render FTIs less effective as competitive inhibitors against this isoform (20James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Second, the now well established potential for N- and K-Ras4B to become alternatively prenylated by GGTase upon FTI-induced FTase inactivation (8Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) presumably allows these isoforms to bypass the FTI block. However, assays designed to assess Ras function in vivo (such as soft agar assays, focus formation assays, and transcriptional reporter assays) cannot by themselves distinguish between these two possibilities. Nor can the use of wild-type Ras proteins in such studies unambiguously identify the Ras sequence elements responsible for each mechanism. With the panel of Ras mutants we constructed, we were able to address these points. We first assessed the ability of FTI to block Ras prenylation by showing a shift in gel mobility characteristic of unprenylated Ras proteins compared with the prenylated forms (Fig. 2). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with each HA-tagged Ras construct and treated for 48 h with various concentrations of FTI or vehicle. To ensure that effects were not due to a particular FTI structure, we used both L-744,832 and FTI-277 throughout most of these studies with equivalent results. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis using anti-HA antibody. At steady state, ∼50% of parental H-Ras showed decreased gel mobility in response to 2.5 μm FTI, whereas 10 μm FTI produced a complete mobility shift after 48 h of treatment. These results indicate that, as expected, H-Ras became unprocessed in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of FTI. In contrast, an H-Ras construct containing a polybasic domain (H-(K6)) showed no mobility shift at either 3 μm or 10 μm FTI. This increase in FTI resistance was unlikely to result from alternative prenylation, since proteins containing a CVLS CAAX sequence have been shown to be poor substrates for GGTase (8Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and since it was resistant to the geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI-298 (data not shown). In one study (20James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), the introduction of a polybasic domain into H-Ras (H-(K6)) was shown to permit limited geranylgeranylation in vitro using purified GGTase. But even with this Ras construct, farnesylation was the preferred reaction, indicating that in the presence of both enzymes, -CVLS-containing Ras constructs are preferentially farnesylated. Similar results were obtained using N-Ras and K-Ras4B constructs. Neither parental N-Ras nor K-Ras4B undergoes an FTI-induced gel mobility shift even at 10 μm FTI, since alternative geranylgeranylation results in proteins that migrate with similar mobility as farnesylated Ras. Replacement of the native N-Ras M-CAAX (-CVVM) with the H-Ras CAAX motif (to generate N-CVLS) makes N-Ras susceptible to FTI-induced gel mobility shift (80% block at 3 μm FTI) (Fig. 2). Similarly, replacement of the native K-Ras M-CAAX (-CVIM) with -CVLS, along with replacement of the polybasic domain with a neutral stretch of glutamines (5Q), renders K-(Q5)-CVLS susceptible to FTI-induced inhibition of prenylation (40% block at 3 μm FTI). The subsequent addition of the polybasic domain into these FTI-sensitive N-Ras or K-Ras constructs reduced sensitivity to FTI-induced gel mobility shift to undetectable levels. Similarly, introduction into FTI-sensitive K-(Q5)-CVLS of a CVIM motif to generate K-(Q5) also resulted, as expected, in FTI resistance, presumably through induction of alternative prenylation. The sensitivity of K-(Q5)-CVLS to FTI and its insensitivity to GGTI (data not shown) confirmed that this construct was not normally geranylgeranylated. Together, these data demonstrate that the polybasic domain alone renders farnesylation of Ras proteins partially resistant to FTI even in the absence of alternative prenylation. Further, that parental H-, N-, and K-Ras proteins are not equally susceptible to FTI (50, 80, and 40% shifts in gel mobility, respectively) suggests that sequences outside of the CAAX motif and the polybasic domain are also involved in FTI resistance. The Polybasic Domain Confers FTI Resistance on H-Ras-induced Elk-1 Activation—Unlike more complex phenotypes such as transformation, transcriptional transactivation of a Gal-Elk-1-luciferase reporter represents a simple system for studying Ras-driven signaling. Further, this pathway is important for the transformation and anchorage-independent growth of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of the polybasic domain and M-CAAX motifs alone and in combination on FTI resistance in H-, N-, or K-Ras4B backgrounds with respect to signaling through the transcription factor Elk-1. Each of the Ras constructs was transiently transfected along with Elk-1-luciferase reporter plasmids into NIH 3T3 cells that were then treated for 48 h with various concentrations of FTI. Luciferase activity in cell lysates reflects the ability of the transfected Ras construct to activate Elk-1 and induce transcription from the Elk-1-dependent luciferase promoter. The data presented in Fig. 3 show that either the K-Ras4B polybasic domain or a methionine-containing CAAX motif (-CVVM or CVIM) alone can render Ras proteins resistant to FTIs regardless of Ras background. Oncogenic H-Ras with a wild-type COOH-terminal sequence is inhibited by FTI up to 70% in a dose-dependent manner. Replacement of"
https://openalex.org/W2001986505,"The possibility that human cells contain, in addition to the cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase complex, a mitochondrial type II malonyl-CoA-dependent system for the biosynthesis of fatty acids has been examined by cloning, expressing, and characterizing two putative components. Candidate coding sequences for a malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (malonyltransferase) and its acyl carrier protein substrate, identified by BLAST searches of the human sequence data base, were located on nuclear chromosomes 22 and 16, respectively. The encoded proteins localized exclusively in mitochondria only when the putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences were present as revealed by confocal microscopy of HeLa cells infected with appropriate green fluorescent protein fusion constructs. The mature, processed forms of the mitochondrial proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified, the acyl carrier protein was converted to the holoform in vitro using purified human phosphopantetheinyltransferase, and the functional interaction of the two proteins was studied. Compared with the dual specificity malonyl/acetyltransferase component of the cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase, the type II mitochondrial counterpart exhibits a relatively narrow substrate specificity for both the acyl donor and acyl carrier protein acceptor. Thus, it forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex only when incubated with malonyl-CoA and transfers exclusively malonyl moieties to the mitochondrial holoacyl carrier protein. The type II acyl carrier protein from Bacillus subtilis, but not the acyl carrier protein derived from the human cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase, can also function as an acceptor for the mitochondrial transferase. These data provide compelling evidence that human mitochondria contain a malonyl-CoA/acyl carrier protein-dependent fatty acid synthase system, distinct from the type I cytosolic fatty acid synthase, that resembles the type II system present in prokaryotes and plastids. The final products of this system, yet to be identified, may play an important role in mitochondrial function. The possibility that human cells contain, in addition to the cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase complex, a mitochondrial type II malonyl-CoA-dependent system for the biosynthesis of fatty acids has been examined by cloning, expressing, and characterizing two putative components. Candidate coding sequences for a malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (malonyltransferase) and its acyl carrier protein substrate, identified by BLAST searches of the human sequence data base, were located on nuclear chromosomes 22 and 16, respectively. The encoded proteins localized exclusively in mitochondria only when the putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences were present as revealed by confocal microscopy of HeLa cells infected with appropriate green fluorescent protein fusion constructs. The mature, processed forms of the mitochondrial proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified, the acyl carrier protein was converted to the holoform in vitro using purified human phosphopantetheinyltransferase, and the functional interaction of the two proteins was studied. Compared with the dual specificity malonyl/acetyltransferase component of the cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase, the type II mitochondrial counterpart exhibits a relatively narrow substrate specificity for both the acyl donor and acyl carrier protein acceptor. Thus, it forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex only when incubated with malonyl-CoA and transfers exclusively malonyl moieties to the mitochondrial holoacyl carrier protein. The type II acyl carrier protein from Bacillus subtilis, but not the acyl carrier protein derived from the human cytosolic type I fatty acid synthase, can also function as an acceptor for the mitochondrial transferase. These data provide compelling evidence that human mitochondria contain a malonyl-CoA/acyl carrier protein-dependent fatty acid synthase system, distinct from the type I cytosolic fatty acid synthase, that resembles the type II system present in prokaryotes and plastids. The final products of this system, yet to be identified, may play an important role in mitochondrial function. The existence of a mitochondrial system for the biosynthesis of fatty acids in animals was first reported 40 years ago and postulated to function by a reversal of the process of fatty acid β-oxidation (1Seubert W. Greull G. Lynen F. Angew. Chem. 1959; 69: 359Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wakil S.J. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 3Whereat A.F. Hull F.E. Orishimo M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4013-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed one laboratory reported that short and medium chain-length fatty acids could be produced using the partially purified mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, β-ketoacyl thiolase, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and enoyl-CoA reductase (4Seubert W. Lamberts I. Kramer R. Ohly B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 164: 498-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and another found that inhibitory antibodies to pig heart 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase inhibited, in a parallel fashion, the fatty acid elongation system of pig heart mitochondria (5Staack H. Davidson B. Schulz H. Lipids. 1980; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The picture was complicated by reports that liver and heart mitochondria have two distinct fatty acid-synthesizing systems, one acetyl-CoA-dependent, possibly involving some of the β-oxidation enzymes, the other malonyl-CoA-dependent and apparently resembling the cytosolic FAS 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACPmit, mitochondrial acyl carrier protein; ACPfas, acyl carrier protein domain of the fatty acid synthase; MTmit, mitochondrial malonyltransferase; MATfas, malonyl/acetyltransferase of the cytosolic fatty acid synthase; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. system. Most studies were in agreement that the acetyl-CoA-dependent system was an elongation pathway in which one or more C2 units, derived from acetyl-CoA, were added to preexisting saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of a broad range of chain length (C6–C20). In this pathway, at least one of the β-oxidation enzymes appears to be substituted by a specific biosynthetic enzyme: the FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenase being replaced by a more thermodynamically favorable enzyme, enoyl-CoA reductase (6Seubert W. Podack E.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The possible presence of a malonyl-CoA-dependent system capable of synthesizing saturated fatty acids C14–C18 de novo in mitochondria was hotly debated with some investigators suggesting that contamination with cytosolic FAS and/or components of a microsomal malonyl-CoA-dependent elongation system was very likely responsible for the widely varying activity of this pathway reported by different laboratories (7Christ E.J.V.J.

Perhaps because of these early conflicting reports and inherent difficulties in working with this system, the animal mitochondrial FAS has received little attention over the last 25 years, and almost all of the recent advances in our knowledge have come from studies with fungi and plants. The first notable advance was the discovery that mitochondria of both Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain a small molecular mass phosphopantetheinylated protein that resembles closely the acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) characteristically associated with the type II 2The enzymes of the type II FASs exist as separate discrete proteins, whereas those of type I FASs are covalently linked in multifunctional polypeptides. FAS systems of prokaryotes and plants (11Brody S. Mikolajczyk S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly this mitochondrial ACP was found to be associated with the NADH:ubiquinone reductase (proton-pumping respiratory complex 1) in N. crassa. This is not the case in S. cerevisiae, however, since this organism lacks complex 1 and respires using an alternative, non-proton-pumping, ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Disruption of the nuclear-encoded gene for ACPmit in both N. crassa and S. cerevisiae produced respiratory-deficient phenotypes (12Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar): in N. crassa, complex 1 was improperly assembled, and lysophospholipids accumulated in mitochondrial membranes, and in S. cerevisiae cellular lipoic acid was reduced to less than 10% of that of the wild-type strain. Studies on plants have also revealed that mitochondria are capable of synthesizing both long chain acyl-ACPs and octanoyl-ACP, the direct precursor of lipoic acid (14Gueguen V. Macherel D.

S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Meanwhile genes encoding several putative mitochondrial proteins, β-ketoacyl synthase (CEM1), β-ketoacyl reductase (OAR1), malonyl-CoA:ACP transferase (MCT1), and enoyl reductase (YBR026c), that resemble type II FAS enzymes were identified in S. cerevisiae (16Schneider R. Brors B. Massow M. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Disruption of each of these genes produced a respiratory deficient phenotype. In summary, fungal and plant mitochondria appear to contain an ACP-dependent lipogenic system that likely is responsible for the production of fatty acids that play essential roles in mitochondrial function. An ACP-like protein was found in animal mitochondria several years ago and shown to be a subunit of respiratory complex 1 (19Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Triepels R. Smeitink J. Loeffen J. Smeets R. Buskens C. Trijbels F. van den Heuvel L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the role of this ACP is not known, and no other components of a putative animal mitochondrial FAS system have been identified or characterized. In an attempt to clarify the role of this system, we have initiated a program to identify and characterize the components of a putative type II mitochondrial FAS in humans. In this communication we report the identification, cloning, and expression of a mitochondrial malonyltransferase and the characterization of its interaction with mitochondrial ACP. Prediction of Mitochondrially Imported Proteins—The software programs PSORT (PSORT.nibb.ac.jp), iPSORT (hypothesiscreator.net/iP-SORT/), and MitoProt II (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter) were used to predict mitochondrially targeted proteins (21Bannai H. Tamada Y. Maruyama O. Nakai K. Miyano S. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 22Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase—Based on the available sequence information (GenBank™ accession number GI 8574363), PCR primers were designed to amplify the putative human mitochondrial MT DNA using expressed sequence tag cDNA clone ATCC 4811508 as the template DNA. The PCR procedure used was essentially as described earlier (23Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three sets of primers were designed to facilitate expression of the full-length mitochondrial MT (MTmit1), the putative N-terminally processed form lacking the first 21 residues (MTmit22), and an N-terminally truncated form lacking the first 59 residues that is of similar length to the MT of Escherichia coli (MTmit60). Thus, the primer sets MT1.bac.T/B, MT22.bac.T/B, and MT60.bac.T/B were used to amplify constructs encoding MTmit1, MTmit22, and MTmit60, respectively (Table I).Table IPCR primers and linkers used in this study Expression of the Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase in E. coli—DNA fragments encoding MTmit22 and MTmit60 were cloned into the pET-29c(+) vector, and expression was attempted in BL21-Codon-Plus cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to A 600 of 0.5–0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. However, in both cases, induction of protein expression resulted in cessation of cell growth within 1 h. The level of protein expression was very low, and almost all of the recombinant protein was recovered in inclusion bodies. Lowering the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentration, lowering the growth temperature, or using alternative host strains did not improve expression of soluble mitochondrial MT. Expression of the Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransacylase in Insect Sf9 Cells—The amplified constructs encoding MTmit1, MTmit22, and MTmit60 were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), digested at XbaI and NheI sites that had been engineered into the amplification primers T and B, respectively, and cloned into the modified baculoviral transfer vector pFast Bac 1 (Invitrogen). To facilitate purification of the encoded proteins by metal ion affinity chromatography, an in-frame coding sequence for a C-terminal His6 tag was engineered into the cloned cDNAs. Authenticity of the cloned PCR fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing, recombinant baculoviral stocks were generated, and the encoded protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculoviral expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. A construct encoding both His6 and FLAG affinity tags at the C terminus was engineered by digesting the pMTmit22.FB plasmid DNA with the restriction enzymes NheI and NotI and ligating the ct.H6.flag.T/B linker (Table I) in-frame with the coding sequence. Subcellular Fractionation of Sf9 Cells Expressing the Full-length and Putative N-terminally Processed Forms of Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase—Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding either the MTmit1 or MTmit22 proteins carrying only the His6 affinity tag, harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended at 4 °C in 5 volumes of mitochondrial isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml antitrypsin). The cellular suspension was disrupted using a Teflon/glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The 100,000 × g supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet (microsomal fraction) was resuspended in isolation buffer to the same volume as that of the cytosolic fraction. The 10,000 × g pellet (mitochondrial fraction) was washed twice with isolation buffer and resuspended in isolation buffer in the same volume as cytosol. Purification of the Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase—Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding either MTmit22 or MTmit60. For purification of the cytosolic form, insect cells were homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) and loaded at 20 °C onto a HiTrap Chelating HP column (5-ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole in buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. For further purification of the doubly tagged MTmit22, fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and applied to a column containing 2 ml of anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma), which was equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide in buffer A. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Phosphopantetheinylation of the Human Mitochondrial ACP—The putative ACPmit sequence (20Triepels R. Smeitink J. Loeffen J. Smeets R. Buskens C. Trijbels F. van den Heuvel L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was identified and cloned from a human expressed sequence tag using the PCR. The coding sequence for the putative processed form lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence (ACPmit68) was cloned into a baculoviral vector that also encoded a C-terminal His6 tag, and the recombinant protein was expressed in insect Sf9 cells. The soluble ACPmit68 protein was purified by a combination of nickel ion affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography and phosphopantetheinylated in vitro with purified recombinant human phosphopantetheinyltransferase. The details of these procedures are described elsewhere (24Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol.

Marahiel at the Institut fur Biochemie, Fachbereich Chemie, Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany. Cells were grown at 37 °C to a density equivalent to A 600 of 0.7, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h at either 37 °C (M15) or 30 °C (BL21). Proteins were purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography and phosphopantetheinylated in vitro using human phosphopantetheine transferase (24Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A typical phosphopantetheinylation reaction contained 100 μm apo-ACP-A or apo-PCP, 0.2 mm CoA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and 1 μm phosphopantetheinyltransferase. The reaction components were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The holo-ACP-A or holo-PCP were separated from phosphopantetheinyltransferase by nickel ion affinity chromatography. Confirmation that at least 90% of the apoforms had been converted to the corresponding holoforms was obtained by incubation of a portion of the product with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA and human phosphopantetheinyltransferase and assaying the incorporation of radiolabel into the ACP (only residual apoform is radiolabeled by [1-14C]acetyl-phosphopantetheine transfer (24Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Expression and Purification of the Malonyl/Acetyltransferase and Acyl Carrier Protein Domains of Mammalian FASs—A cDNA fragment encoding the ACP domain of the human cytosolic FAS (amino acid residues 2117–2205) was cloned into the expression vector pQE80 L (Qiagen) and expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli. The recombinant ACP was purified to homogeneity by a combination of nickel ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Details are described elsewhere (24Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The malonyl/acetyltransferase domain of the rat cytosolic FAS (amino acid residues 488–809) was expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies, refolded in vitro, and purified as described earlier (27Rangan V.S. Serre L. Witkowska H.E. Bari A. Smith S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Verification That the Putative N-terminal Mitochondrial Recognition Elements Direct the Mitochondrial FAS Proteins into Mitochondria—A 1170-bp fragment encoding MTmit1 was amplified using PCR primer set MT1.gfp.T/B (Table I) and directionally cloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) to facilitate expression as the N-terminal partner of a MTmit1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. A second fusion protein construct (primer set MT22.gfp.T/B), lacking the coding sequence for the N-terminal 21 amino acids (putative targeting sequence), was similarly engineered as a control. Authenticity of the cloned fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors encoding the fusion proteins were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and the cells were cultured for 60 h. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS, treated with 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS), washed with PBS, and treated with bovine serum albumin blocking solution. The cells were then treated with the primary antibody (purified mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody), washed with PBS, and treated with the fluorescent secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA). Finally the washed cells were mounted in glycerol/PBS and examined for green and red fluorescence in a Sony confocal fluorescence microscope. The ACPmit-GFP fusion constructs were generated in a similar manner. The two ACP-specific PCR-amplified fragments (ACP1.gfp.T/B and ACP68.gfp.T/B primer set products for constructs with and without the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence, respectively; Table I) were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of pEGFP-N3 vector, and authenticity of the cloned fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection into HeLa cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 reagent as above except that ACPmit-GFP fusion constructs were cotransfected with plasmid pDsRed2-Mito (Clontech) for fluorescent labeling of mitochondria. Cells were cultured for 60 h, fixed with paraformaldehyde as above, and directly analyzed for green and red fluorescence by confocal microscopy. Formation of a Covalent Malonyl-O-malonyltransferase Intermediate—MTmit22 (250 ng) was incubated with either 36 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (51 Ci/mol) or 66 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (54 Ci/mol) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 for 5 min at 20 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or the proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed both by phosphorimaging and by Western blotting using mouse anti-PentaHis monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) as primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad) as secondary antibody. Assay of Human Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase Activity—Typical assay systems contained 83 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 20 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, 10–20 μm holo-ACP, and 50 ng of MTmit22. Incubations were carried out at 20 °C for 2 min. Proteins were precipitated with acid, washed, and assayed for radioactivity. Blank reactions were performed without enzyme. Kinetic parameters were determined using EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software); values represent the means ± S.D. for calculations using six different methods. Identification of Sequences of the Putative Mitochondrial ACP and Malonyltransferase Proteins—BLAST searches of the eukaryotic sequence data bases, using as probe sequences malonyltransferases from either prokaryotic, type II, or eukaryotic type I FAS systems, identified likely malonyltransferase sequences with N-terminal extensions in several species (see Supplemental Fig. 1A). Sequences for putative malonyltransferases from human, rat, mouse, Drosophila, and Neurospora were predicted by several computational methods (PSORT, iPSORT, and MitoProt II) to have a high probability of containing N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences (see Supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition, all of these sequences contained three positionally conserved features that are characteristic of malonyl and malonyl/acetyltransferases: a Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly serine esterase active site motif, a conserved Arg residue that interacts with the 3-carboxylate of the malonyl substrate, and a conserved His residue that is required for activation of the Ser nucleophile (27Rangan V.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11975-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the basis of this analysis, we identified expressed sequence tag cDNA clones encoding the putative human mitochondrial MT protein for further study. A similar approach identified ACP sequences in animals, fungi, and plants that have a high probability of containing putative mitochondrial targeting sequences (see Supplemental Fig. 1B). The coding sequence for the putative mitochondrial MT is located on human chromosome 22 (22q13.31), and that for the mitochondrial ACP is located on chromosomes 16 (16p12.3) in the human genome sequence data base. The coding sequences for both proteins are interrupted by three introns. Verification That the Putative N-terminal Mitochondrial Recognition Elements Direct the Mitochondrial FAS Proteins into Mitochondria—Vectors encoding mitochondrial ACP and MT sequences fused to the N terminus of GFP were engineered and expressed in HeLa cells. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that both the ACPmit-GFP and MTmit-GFP chimeras colocalized with mitochondrial markers when the putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence was present (Fig. 1, A and B, left column, ACPmit1-GFP and MTmit1-GFP, respectively). In contrast, GFP expressed throughout the cytoplasm when either the entire mitochondrial ACP or MT coding sequence or the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence was omitted from the cDNA constructs (Fig. 1, A and B, center and right columns, GFP, ACPmit68-GFP, and MTmit22-GFP, respectively). These results confirmed that the sequences identified do indeed encode bona fide mitochondrially targeted proteins. Expression of Mitochondrial Malonyltransferase in Sf9 Cells: Subcellular Localization of Recombinant Protein—Because the mitochondrial MT could not be expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), we explored the possibility of using the insect Sf9/baculoviral host/vector system. Cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding either the full-length (MTmit1) or the putative processed form (MTmit22) were homogenized, and mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-His antibodies as the probe (Fig. 2). Cells expressing the full-length form produced immunoreactive recombinant protein mainly in the mitochondrial fraction. Two distinct molecular species were observed with different electrophoretic mobilities. A smaller amount of immunoreactive protein was found associated with the microsomal fraction that had a mobility identical to that of the slower moving species present in the mitochondrial fraction. Only a trace of immunoreactive protein was found in the cytosolic fraction. Cells expressing the putative N-terminally processed form of the enzyme produced, in all three subcellular fractions, a single molecular mass immunoreactive species. The electrophoretic mobility of this species was identical to that of the faster moving species found associated with the mitochondrial fraction in cells infected with baculovirus encoding the full-length protein. These results indicated that most of the full-length MTmit1 species was taken up and partially processed by insect cell mitochondria but that a small portion became associated with the microsomal fraction and remained"

Using representational difference analysis, we identified a new set of WT1 targets, including a homologue of the Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinase regulator, sprouty. Sprouty1 was up-regulated in cell lines expressing wild-type but not mutant WT1. WT1 bound to the endogenous sprouty1 promoter in vivo and directly regulated sprouty1 through an early growth response gene-1 binding site. Expression of Sprouty1 and WT1 overlapped in the developing metanephric mesenchyme, and Sprouty1, like WT1, plays a key role in the early steps of glomerulus formation. Disruption of Sprouty1 expression in embryonic kidney explants by antisense oligonucleotides reduced condensation of the metanephric mesenchyme, leading to a decreased number of glomeruli. In addition, sprouty1 was expressed in the ureteric tree and antisense-treated ureteric trees had cystic lumens. Therefore, sprouty1 represents a physiologically relevant target gene of WT1 during kidney development. WT1 encodes a transcription factor involved in kidney development and tumorigenesis.

Dev. 2000; 92: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney malignancy, is characterized by a triphasic histopathology (blastemal, stromal, epithelial) signifying an abnormal differentiation program. In accordance with this notion, the Wilms Tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT1), inactivated in a subset of Wilms tumors, plays an essential role in normal development of the kidney and the genitourinary system (2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar, 3Little M. Holmes G. Walsh P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of WT1 in mice leads to a complete agenesis of the kidneys and gonads (5Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The specific temporal and spatial pattern of WT1 expression suggests multiple roles for WT1 during nephrogenesis. In particular, WT1 expression peaks during the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), 1The abbreviations used are: MET, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition; RDA, representational difference analysis; nt, nucleotides; m-, murine; kb, kilobase(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; ISH, in situ hybridization; EGR1, early growth response gene-1. suggesting an instructive role in the formation of the renal glomerulus. In the mature kidney, WT1 expression becomes restricted to the podocytes, perhaps being involved in maintaining a differentiated phenotype. The WT1 gene encodes a C2-H2 zinc finger transcription factor that binds to both GC-rich and TC repeat elements. Alternative splicing at two sites yields four major isoforms, each containing or lacking 17 amino acids between the transactivation domain and the zinc finger region and/or a 3-amino acid insertion (KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers. The KTS insertion disrupts the spacing between the zinc fingers, altering DNA binding (2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The A isoform lacks both these motifs and binds strongly to DNA. The C isoform contains the KTS insertion, displays a weaker DNA binding to alternative sequences, associates with splicing factors, and therefore, may be involved in RNA processing. WT1 binding sites were identified in multiple promoters that respond to WT1 in transient transfection assays (2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Enger K.T. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8896-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); however, most are not regulated by WT1 in vivo (8Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of bona fide target genes would provide insight into WT1 function in development and tumorigenesis. We previously showed that NIH3T3 cells engineered to express the WT1A isoform were growth-inhibited and displayed partial epithelial differentiation (9Hosono S. Luo X. Hyink D.P. Schnapp L.M. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Reddy J.C. Atweh G.F. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These morphological changes correlated with significant alterations in gene expression consistent with a role for WT1 in the MET. Here, we applied cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA (10Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar)) to NIH3T3 cells versus WT1-expressing NIH3T3 cells and identified sprouty1 (spry1), a mammalian homologue of Drosophila sprouty, as a gene up-regulated in response to WT1. Drosophila sprouty was first identified as an antagonist of the branching morphogenesis of the tracheal system and was genetically shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (11Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 12Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M.

The proteins they encode share a conserved, cysteine-rich C-terminal domain and a more divergent N-terminal domain. On a molecular level, these proteins were shown to down-regulate signaling by many receptor tyrosine kinases, with the notable exception of the epidermal growth factor receptor, where sprouty appears to increase the action of the protein (18Tefft D.

In NIH3T3 cells Spry1 and Spry2 antagonized signaling through multiple receptor tyrosine kinases by specific inhibition of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (23Gross I. Bassit B. Benezra M. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46460-46468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); in this system signal blockade occurred at the level of Ras activation, whereas others reported that Sprouty blocks the activation of Raf (20Sasaki A.

Precise spatial and temporal control of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, a major pathway for growth factors to mediate cell proliferation or differentiation, is required for normal development. Accordingly, the Spry proteins, which regulate this pathway, were implicated in branching morphogenesis of the lung, angiogenesis, and limb bud outgrowth (14Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L.

In this study, we demonstrated transcriptional regulation of spry1 by a organ-specific transcription factor, WT1. spry1 expression was up-regulated by WT1 in several cell lines, and WT1 directly bound and activated the spry1 promoter. In addition spry1 was dynamically expressed in the embryonic kidney in a pattern partially overlapping with wt1. Disruption of spry1 expression in kidney explants altered normal glomeruli formation and ureteric tree morphology. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spry1 is a WT1 target gene that may mediate some of the regulatory effects of WT1 during kidney organogenesis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection—NIH3T3, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum, were transiently transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) using 0.1 μg of the various mouse spry1 luciferase reporters, 0.005 μg of a thymidine kinase Renilla reporter as internal control, and 1 μg of an empty vector (Rous sarcoma virus) or WT1 expression vectors (Rous sarcoma virus-WT1A and WT1C (27English M.A. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13258-13263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Cells were harvested 48 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual reporter assay (Promega) and for protein expression by immunoblotting. Tet-Off Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (a gift of Dr. D. Haber, Massachusetts General Hospital) were transfected with a pTRE vector (Clontech) expressing wild-type WT1A, WT1A112, or WT1A129 followed by selection in 0.2 μg/ml puromycin. Retroviral infection (28Hosono S. Gross I. English M.A. Hajra K.M. Fearon E.R. Licht J.D. J. Biol.

Reddy J.C. Atweh G.F. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were described. mIMCD-3 (29Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. RDA—Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized with 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from NIH3T3 and WR16 cells, and RDA was performed (10Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To identify genes activated by WT1, three rounds of RDA subtracting the 3T3 representation from the WR16 representation were performed (WR16–3T3). To identify repressed genes, the reciprocal subtractions were done in parallel (3T3-WR16). The differential products were subcloned into pBluescript SK– (Stratagene). To confirm that the cDNA fragments were present in different amounts, each was 32P-labeled and used as a probe to hybridize blots of NIH3T3 or WR16 representations. This step eliminated false positives (30%) before sequencing. Cloning of the spry1 cDNA—The nucleotide (nt) positions for murine spry1 (mspry1) are listed under AF176903. From RDA, a cDNA corresponding to nt 1079–1693 of mspry1 was isolated and used to identify an EST (GenBank™ AA591484, clone ID 907842) containing nt 962–2489 of mspry1. The 5′ end of mspry1 was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, Clontech). Briefly, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from podocytes was reverse-transcribed using a mspry1 primer (nt 1016–1040). After 2nd strand synthesis and ligation to the anchor oligonucleotide, PCR was performed using a primer corresponding to the anchor and a mspry1 primer (nt 988–1007). The resulting products were subcloned and sequenced. One rapid amplification of cDNA ends product (nt 402–1007 of mspry1) was ligated to the above EST clone at a common StuI site. The mspry1 coding sequence (nt 481–1469) was amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA and cloned in-frame with the sequence of the FLAG tag in a modified pcDNA 3–1 (+) vector (30Relaix F. Wei X.J. Wu X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). spry1 Genomic Cloning and Reporter Plasmids—A bacterial artificial chromosome library was screened (Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO) using primers from the mspry1 cDNA (nt 1171–1191 and 1405–1422) and confirmed by Southern blot with a probe derived from the 5′ end of the mspry1 cDNA. A 9-kb EcoRI fragment encompassing the mspry1-coding exon and 5′ and 3′ sequences was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ and sequenced (MWG Biotech Inc). The start site of transcription was mapped by primer extension. A 1.1-kb SacI fragment containing the proximal promoter was ligated into pGL2basic (Promega). A series of 5′ truncations were created by PCR using forward primers located at –614 (5′-GGTACCGGAAGAACCTTGGGC-3′), –354 (5′-GGTACCGGTGGTTTGTTATTG-3′), and –137 (5′-GGTACCTGCTCCGGGTTTTTG-3′) and reverse primer located at +20 (5′-AGATCTGAGCTCTGGCTGCGG-3′) and sub-cloned with KpnI/BglII into pGL2basic. Mutations of MIN1 (CCGGGGGCG to CCTTTTTCG-87), MIN2A (GCGTGGAGGTGGAGGTG to GCTTTGAGGTGTAGGTA), and MIN2B (GCGCGACG to GCTTTTACG) binding sites within the SPRY137-luc reporter were created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes encompassing eight putative WT1 binding sites within the mspry1 promoter were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow. The oligonucleotide probes were: Min1, 5′-GACACATGATATCACCGGGGGCGGGTCCCG-3′; MutMin1, 5′-GACACATGATATCACCTTTTTCGGGTCCCG-3′; Min2, 5′-GTCCCGGCGTGGAGGTGGAGGTGGCGGCGACGCT-3′; Min3, 5′-GCTGCGGAGCCCGCGCGCGAGTGCTCAGCACGCA-3′; Min4, 5′-GCAGGGGTTTGCGGCGGCCCCGCAGCCAGAGCTC-3′; Min5, 5′-TCATTTAAAATGCATTGGTGTTTTGGACAAAA-3′; Min6, 5′-CATTTTTTTTTTCCGTTGTTGGTGGTGGTTTGTTAT-3′; Min7, 5′-CCCTGGAACGCCCGCCCCTCCCCAGTTGCGCTCGCAGG-3′. In vitro coupled transcription/translations (Promega) were performed with pSP64-WT1A, pSP64-WT1C, and pSP64 control vector. 8 μl of lysate were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature along with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ZnCl2) in a volume of 20 μl followed by the addition of radiolabeled probe (50,000 cpm) for another 15 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA at 300 V for 1.5 h. For competition experiments, 0.4 μg of WT1 antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz) or rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or a 1000× excess of cold MIN1, MutMin1, or mut NF-κB (GGCATAGGTCC) oligonucleotides were added during preincubation. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to the cell media to a concentration of 1% for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to 0.125 m for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and precleared with protein G-Sepharose in the presence of 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, 1% was saved for total input control, and the remainder was incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without 2 μg of WT1 antibody (F6, Santa Cruz). Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and washed in the following buffers: A (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl); B (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl); C (0.2 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and twice with Tris-EDTA, pH 8. Immune complexes were eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 followed by gentle centrifugation. Cross-linking was reversed with NaCl (0.2 m) at 65 °C for 4 h, and DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR with spry1-specific primers +20 and –137 was used to detect spry1 promoter sequences. In a parallel experiment protein G-Sepharose was boiled in 1× Laemmli buffer after the washes and processed for WT1 immunoblotting. RNA Analysis by RT-PCR and Northern Blot—Total RNA (TRIzol, Invitrogen) or poly(A)+ RNA (Oligotex mRNA kit, Qiagen) were fractionated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The mouse Multiple Tissues Northern blot was from Clontech. cDNA probes 32P-labeled by random priming (23Gross I. Bassit B. Benezra M. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46460-46468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) included mspry1 (nt 1345–1652), human SPRY1 (nt 308–1337, XM_036349), WT1 (9Hosono S. Luo X. Hyink D.P. Schnapp L.M. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Reddy J.C. Atweh G.F. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), rat, and human Actin. To detect mspry1 by end-point RT-PCR, RT was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNAs and a mspry1 reverse primer (nt 1993–2012). Next, 110 of the RT was amplified with Platinium Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using a mspry1 forward (nt 1350–1370) and reverse (nt 1633–1653) primer. RT-PCR for WT1 was performed similarly with a forward (nt 1446–1464, GenBank™ M55512) and reverse (nt 1807–1827) primer. For real time RT-PCR (31Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), RT was performed with a human spry1 reverse primer (5′-GATGCCCTTGACTAAGCACATG-3′). Diluted (5 μl) RT products were amplified using a PRISM® 7700 System (Applied Biosystems) in a volume of 25 μl containing 3 mm MgCl2, PCR buffer (including SYBR green and Rox reference dye), 200 μm dNTP, 5 pmol of each primer (reverse, as for RT; forward, 5′-CCGGCAGTGCCTTTGC-3′) and 0.1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblotting—A rabbit polyclonal serum was generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 81–93 of mSpry1 (NP_036026) and affinity-purified (Covance, Denver, PA). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (MAB374) was purchased from Chemicon, and the WT1 antibody (C19) used in Western blot was from Santa Cruz. Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described (23Gross I. Bassit B. Benezra M. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46460-46468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Kidney Explant in Situ Hybridization (ISH) and Immunostaining, Whole-embryo ISH—Metanephric rudiments were dissected from E11.5 embryos into minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin and grown for 1–4 days on 1-μm polycarbonate Transwell™ filters (Costar) at 5% CO2, 37 °C. After fixation (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight), all ISH were performed as described with hybridizations and washes carried out at 65 °C (32Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Probes corresponding to nt 1345–1652 of mspry1 and nt 529–799 of mspry2 (AF176905) were synthesized as described (33Holmes G.P. Negus K. Burridge L. Raman S. Algar E. Yamada T. Little M.H. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but fragmented by alkaline hydrolysis. Whole-embryo ISH was performed as described (34Sassoon D. Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 384-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Antibodies for immunofluorescence included rabbit anti-Spry1 (1/500), mouse anti-WT1 (H2, DAKO, 1/100), Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Biodipy-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Morpholino Oligonucleotide Assays—E12 fetal kidney pairs were dissected and grown as described (35Avner E.D. Sweeney Jr., W.E. Piesco N.P. Ellis D. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Morpholino oligonucleotides antisense to spry1 (ASSpry1, GGAGTGATCTCCAGTTCCAGCAGTC) and control oligonucleotides (Ct, invert of the antisense CTGACGACCTTGACCTCTAGTGAGG or random CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA) were purchased from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR) and added to the medium (20 μm) daily. Because of developmental variability within litters, right and left kidneys from the same embryo were compared with each other in the following ways: (i) medium versus medium plus Ct morpholino oligonucleotides (morpholinos); (ii) medium plus Ct morpholinos versus medium plus Spry1 morpholinos; (iii) medium versus medium plus Spry1 morpholinos. After 3–5 days, the explants were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), the glomeruli were labeled with peanut agglutinin (Vector Lab (36Mendelsohn C. Batourina E. Fung S. Gilbert T. Dodd J. Development. 1999; 126: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar)) and counted blindly. For immunofluorescence, explants were fixed (4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde) and permeabilized overnight at 4 °C (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% gelatin, 0.075% saponin). Nonspecific fluorescence was blocked by ammonium chloride (0.1 m, 2 h). The following antibodies were used: Pax2 (1:500, PRB-276P, Covance), WT1 (1:500, sc-180, Santa Cruz), synaptopodin (1:300, from Dr. P. Mundel, Albert Einstein), and Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes). Kidneys mounted on glass slides (Vectashield, Molecular Probes) were examined using a Leica TCS-SP (UV) confocal microscope. Activation of spry1 Expression by Constitutive or Induced WT1 Expression—To identify WT1 target genes, we applied RDA to mRNAs extracted from parental NIH3T3 cells and WT1A-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells (WR16 (9Hosono S. Luo X. Hyink D.P. Schnapp L.M. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Reddy J.C. Atweh G.F. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). cDNAs corresponding to 34 different genes were identified, and Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that 11 of these genes were differentially expressed 2I. Gross, B. Bassit, and J. D. Licht, manuscript in preparation. and not previously identified as WT1 targets. Notable among these genes was a murine homologue of Drosophila spry (11Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Drosophila spry, an antagonist of tracheal branching morphogenesis, was genetically shown to inhibit Ras signaling (11Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 12Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Given the importance of branching morphogenesis in kidney development (37al-Awqati Q. Goldberg M.R. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1832-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that WT1 inhibited growth of Ras-transformed cells (38Luo X.N. Reddy J.C. Yeyati P.L. Idris A.H. Hosono S. Haber D.A. Licht J.D. Atweh G.F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 743-750PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined whether spry1 was a transcriptional target of WT1. RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A) showed that spry1 expression was low in NIH3T3 cells and increased in WT1-expressing cell lines (WR16, WR35, WR14). Because constitutive expression of WT1 may have induced secondary changes in the NIH3T3 cells, we confirmed spry1 expression in systems with inducible expression of WT1. NIH3T3 cells were infected at similar efficiencies with a bicistronic virus harboring both WT1A and green fluorescent protein or a control green fluorescent protein virus. As previously shown (Fig. 1A, lane 1), basal spry1 expression was low in NIH3T3 cells and was unaffected by infection with a control retrovirus (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In contrast, infection with retrovirus encoding WT1 markedly increased spry1 expression. The up-regulation occurred in parallel with the accumulation of WT1 and was observed as early as 24 h after infection (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). Saos-2 cells with tetracycline-induced expression of WT1 undergo growth arrest and apoptosis (Ref. 8Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar and data not shown). After WT1 expression, a 2.4-kb spry1 transcript was readily induced in these cells (Fig. 1C). spry1 levels increased about 10-fold (Fig. 1D) as determined by quantitative real time PCR. Inducible expression of two tumor-associated WT1 missense mutants (F112Y and P129L) that yield proteins defective for transcriptional activation (27English M.A. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13258-13263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) failed to up-regulate spry1 (Fig. 1D). Thus, in three different systems, endogenous spry1 expression was activated by WT1. WT1 Directly Activates the spry1 Promoter—To determine whether WT1 directly activates spry1 expression, regulatory sequences for this gene were cloned and sequenced (accession number AY260058), and the start site of transcription was mapped by primer extension (data not shown). Within the proximal promoter region (1.1 kb), 8 GC-rich sites were identified (Fig. 2A), matching to varying degrees previously characterized WT1 binding sites: WRE (39Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A.

Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This 1.1-kb segment was linked to a luciferase reporter and co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells with WT1A. WT1A activated the reporter by a factor of 8 (Fig. 2B), consistent with the magnitude of induction observed in vivo (Fig. 1D). In contrast, activation-defective WT1A mutant proteins (F112Y, P129L, and F154S (27English M.A. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13258-13263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) failed to significantly activate the spry1 promoter (Fig. 2B), although these proteins bound DNA (data not shown). To map the WT1-responsive site, a series of truncated promoter constructs (Fig. 2A) was co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells with WT1. The shortest promoter fragment, SPRY137, contained four potential binding sites and was still activated by WT1 (Fig. 2C). The WT1C isoform (+KTS) was about 50% as active as the WT1A (–KTS) isoform. Duplex oligonucleotide probes (MIN 1–4) spanning the GC-rich SPRY137 minimal promoter and encompassing the 4 putative WT1 binding sites and 3 additional probes (MIN 5–7) encompassing the four upstream sites were incubated with in vitro transcribed/translated WT1A and WT1C and subjected to a gel mobility shift assay.

In the present study we have analyzed functional interactions between GABAA and glycine receptors in acutely dissociated neurons from rat sacral dorsal commissural nucleus. Although the application of GABA and glycine activates pharmacologically distinct receptors, the current induced by a simultaneous application of these two transmitters was less than the sum of currents induced by applying two transmitters separately. Sequential application of glycine and GABA revealed that the GABA-evoked current is more affected by glycine than glycineevoked responses by GABA. Activation of glycine receptors decreased the amplitude and accelerated the rate of desensitization of GABA-induced currents. This asymmetric cross-inhibition is reversible, dependent on the agonist concentration applied, but independent of both membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration or changes in the chloride equilibrium potential. During sequential applications, the asymmetric cross-inhibition was prevented by selective GABAA or glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that occupation of binding sites did not suffice to induce glycine and GABAA receptors functional interaction, and receptor channel activation is required. Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatase 2B, but not phosphatase 1 or 2A, prevented GABAA receptor inhibition by glycine receptor activation, whereas inhibition of phosphorylation pathways rendered cross-talk irreversible. Taken together, our results demonstrated that there is an asymmetric cross-inhibition between glycine and GABAA receptors and that a selective modulation of the state of phosphorylation of GABAA receptor and/or mediator proteins underlies the asymmetry in the cross-inhibition.

Although neurotransmission involves specific activation of receptor channels by distinct neurotransmitters, different classes of receptor can be colocalized at the same postsynaptic site and may be activated by the corelease of more than one type of neurotransmitter from the same presynaptic nerve terminal. Recently it has been demonstrated that simultaneous activation of different postsynaptic receptors by the coapplication of their specific neurotransmitter induces cross-modulation of their activation properties. This cross-talk phenomenon has been proposed to represent a fast adaptive process in controlling signal transmission (1Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B.

In general, the crosstalk between these receptors is characterized by a partial occlusion of transmitter-evoked currents, i.e. the sum of the amplitudes of responses evoked by each agonist is larger than the amplitude of responses evoked by coapplication of the two neurotransmitters. The molecular mechanism involved in the interaction between P2X and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is unknown. Negative cross-talk between dopamine and adenosine receptors, between GABAA and dopamine receptors, and between dopamine and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors involves direct intramembranous protein-protein interaction (1Liu F.

The ionotropic GABAA and GlyR both gate chloride-permeable channels but have distinct structures, resulting from oligomerization of specific subunits (15Legendre P. Cell. Mol.

Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and in the hippocampus (21Li Y. Xu T.L. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), i.e. the effects of GABA and glycine are less than additive when they are coapplied. The mechanisms responsible for this cross-inhibition between GABA and glycine remain poorly understood. One possibility is that it reflects the presence, at least in the olfactory bulb, of a receptor subpopulation that can bind either GABA or glycine (20Trombley P.Q. Hill B.J. Horning M.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However the identity of these postulated receptors remains unclear.In the present study, we explored the mechanisms of the functional interaction between GlyR and GABAAR by analyzing cross-inhibition between glycine- and GABA-induced Cl- currents (I Gly and I GABA) in acutely dissociated rat sacral dorsal commissural nucleus neurons, using whole cell, patch clamp recording. Our results showed that cross-inhibition is asymmetric between GABAAR and GlyR and that glycine-induced inhibition of GABA responses depends largely on protein dephosphorylation processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Preparation—Rat sacral dorsal commissural nucleus neurons were acutely dissociated according to the method of Wu et al. (11Wu L.J. Li Y. Xu T.L. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, pentobarbital-sodium-anesthetized (45–50 mg kg-1, intraperitoneally) Wistar rats (2 weeks old) were decapitated. A segment about 10–15 mm long of lumbosacral (L5-S3) spinal cord was quickly dissected out and immersed in the standard external solution at freezing temperatures. After removing attached dorsal rootlets and the pia matter on the lateral aspects of the cord, the spinal segment was fixed with cyanoacrylic glue to a 15 × 15-mm2 agar block to support the spinal cord tissue. The tissue block was then placed in the cutting chamber of a vibratome tissue slicer (LEICA VT1000S, Leica Instruments Ltd., Wetzlar, Germany). A cold standard external solution (about 4 °C) bubbled with O2 was subsequently placed in the chamber to immerse the tissue block. The spinal segment was sectioned to yield several transverse slices of thickness 400 μm. Slices were preincubated in oxygenated incubation solution for 30 min at room temperature (22–25 °C) and then treated enzymatically in oxygenated incubation solution containing Pronase (1 mg/5 ml) for 20 min at 31 °C. This treatment was followed by exposure to thermolysin (1 mg/5 ml) for 15 min. After the enzyme treatment, slices were kept in enzyme-free incubation solution for 1 h. Then a portion of dorsal horn region was micropunched out and transferred into a culture dish filled with the standard external solution. Neurons were mechanically dissociated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes under visual guidance under a phase contrast microscope (IX70, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Within 20 min, isolated neurons had attached to the bottom of the culture dish and were ready for electrical recording. The care and use of animals in these experiments followed guidelines and protocols approved by our institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Electrophysiology—Whole cell, voltage clamp recordings were made at room temperature (22–25 °C). Culture dishes (Corning 430165, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) were used as recording chambers and were perfused at 0.5–2.0 ml/min with the standard external solution. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) on a two-stage puller (PP-830, Narishige), and had a resistance of 4–6 megohms. Membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential, which had a measured value of 3–4 mV. The series resistance (R s), estimated from visual cancellation of the capacity transient, was 5–15 megohms. In most experiments, 80–90% series resistance compensation was applied. Artifacts caused by inadequate voltage clamp and space clamp were minimized by selecting for experiment neurons bearing no or short processes. Transmitter-evoked currents recorded from the cell soma normally did not exceed 5 nA. Unless otherwise noted, CsCl solution was used in the recording pipette. After taking these precautions, the largest recorded currents did not differ in time course from the smaller ones. To ensure cell dialysis, data for measurements were obtained at least 3–5 min after the whole cell configuration was established.Solutions—The composition of incubation solution was (in mm) 124 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, and 10 glucose, and it was aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. The standard external solution contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris. The osmolarity of all bath solutions was adjusted to 310–320 mosm/liter with sucrose. The ionic composition of the internal solution medium was (in mm) 120 CsCl, 30 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl22H2O, 1 MgCl26H2O, 5 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 10 HEPES with the pH adjusted to 7.2. Stocks of MgATP stored at -20 °C were dissolved in the intracellular solution shortly before use to a final concentration of 2 mm. Unless otherwise noted, the membrane potential was held at -50 mV in the voltage clamp studies.Drugs and Application System—Cyclosporin A (CSPN), staurosporine, and Li4ATPγS were obtained from Biomol. Okadaic acid (OA) and GF 109203X were from Tocris (Bristol, UK), and H89, KN93, and genistein were from Sigma. All other drugs were from Sigma. Phosphatase inhibitors and protein kinase inhibitors were added to the pipette solution. Agonists or antagonists of GlyR and GABAAR were diluted with extracellular solution to a final concentration and applied via the “Y-tube” method as described previously (22Xu T.L. Dong X.P. Wang D.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The tip of the drug tube was positioned between 50 and 100 μm away from the patched neurons. This system allows a complete exchange of external solution surrounding a neuron within 20 ms. Throughout the experiment the bath was perfused continuously with the standard external solution.Data Acquisition and Analysis—Signals were filtered at 1 kHz, data were collected with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), which was connected to a Pentium III computer equipped with Digidata 1320A, Clampex, and Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed with the pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments) and ORIGIN for Windows (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = number of cells), with statistical significance assessed by Student's t test for two groups' comparison or one-way analysis of variance test for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 or 0.01 was considered statistically significant. To evaluate the strychnine and bicuculline concentrations at half-maximal inhibition of I Gly and I GABA (IC50), the mirror image of the Michaelis-Menten equation I/Imax=1/(1+(C/IC50)n)(Eq. 1) was fitted to the data by the least squares method. Current desensitization was fitted by exponential functions, beginning shortly after the peak of response, using Clampfit 8.0 software. Curve fitting was performed using a simplex algorithm least squares exponential fitting routine with single or double exponential equations of the form I(t)=Ifexp(-t/τf)+Isexp(-t/τs)+Ip(Eq. 2) where I f and I s are the amplitudes of the fast and slow components, respectively; I p was the amplitude of the nondesensitized current; and τf and τs are respective time constants.RESULTSGABA- and Glycine-induced Responses—Cross-talk between GABAAR and GlyR was analyzed on acutely dissociated sacral dorsal commissural nucleus neurons from P14 rats. At this age, neurons express the mature form of GABAAR and GlyR (15Legendre P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 23Ma W. Saunders P.A. Somogyi R. Poulter M.O. Barker J.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 338: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whole cell recording at the holding potential (Vh) of -50 mV showed that application of GABA or glycine evoked inward chloride currents in all cells tested. The reversal potentials of GABA- and glycine-induced currents (E GABA and E Gly) were -2.5 ± 1.1 (S.E., n = 6) and -1.3 ± 0.8 mV (n = 5), respectively, and were not significantly different (p > 0.1; unpaired t test). They were close to the theoretical Cl- equilibrium potential (E Cl) calculated from the Nernst equation (-1.3 mV), based on the external and internal Cl- concentration used in the recording (see “Experimental Procedures”).The saturating concentration and EC50 for GABA or glycine were determined by analyzing concentration-response curves for responses to a 10-s application of agonists (Fig. 1). I Gly and I GABA were normalized to the peak amplitude of the currents evoked by the application of glycine and GABA at 1 mm, respectively. The normalized data were fitted using a single isotherm function of the form, I/Imax=1/(1+(EC50/[agonist])H)(Eq. 3) where I max is the maximum current amplitude, I/I max is the normalized current amplitude, EC50 is the agonist concentration producing 50% of the I max, and H is the Hill coefficient. This fit produced an EC50 of 8.1 and 34 μm for GABA and glycine, respectively. The Hill coefficients for GABA and glycine were 1.18 and 1.27, respectively.Cross-inhibition between I GABA and I Gly —The above experiments suggest that the saturating concentration for GABA or glycine for inducing neuronal responses was ≥1 mm. This suggests that responses evoked by the application of 1 mm GABA or 1 mm glycine should be additive if they are induced by the activation of independent receptors. We therefore compared peak amplitudes of currents induced by the application of either GABA or glycine (at 1 mm) and by the simultaneous application of both agonists. As shown in Fig. 2A, coapplication of GABA and glycine evoked currents with an amplitude that was significantly lower than the expected sum (I EX) of currents evoked separately by GABA and glycine (Fig. 2B), suggesting a cross-inhibition between I GABA and I Gly (Fig. 2B; n = 36; p < 0.01; t test). A quantitative analysis of this cross-inhibition and its dependence on concentrations of both agonists is shown in Fig. 2C. At 10 μm GABA and glycine, no significant cross-inhibition occurred (91.5 ± 5.3% of the I EX; n = 9; p > 0.05). Significant cross-inhibition was observed at 30 μm GABA and glycine (55.1 ± 6.4% of the I EX; n = 11; p < 0.01), and the effect appears to saturate beyond 30 μm concentrations of the two agonists.Fig. 2Cross-inhibition between I GABA and I Gly. A, whole cell currents were induced by application of either 1 mm GABA or 1 mm Gly or by the simultaneous application of 1 mm GABA and 1 mm Gly. All three current traces were obtained from one neuron. The dashed trace represents the expected summation of the I GABA and I Gly. B, mean values of 36 experiments shown in A. C, summary of current inhibition data of different concentrations of GABA plus Gly. Ordinates represent I GABA+ Gly/(I GABA + I Gly) × 100%.

(Lond.). 2001; 535: 741-755Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), resulting in an apparent cross-talk between GABAAR and GlyR (20Trombley P.Q. Hill B.J. Horning M.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore used selective antagonists to determine the specificity of GABA and glycine in their receptor activation (Fig. 3). At 30 μm bicuculline, a selective GABAAR antagonist, the I GABA induced by 1 mm GABA was totally abolished, whereas the I Gly induced by 1 mm glycine was unaffected (Fig. 3, A and B). Conversely, 1 μm strychnine, a potent GlyR antagonist, completely abolished I Gly without affecting I GABA. Doseresponse curves for bicuculline and strychnine inhibition were obtained from currents evoked by glycine or GABA at 1 mm. The bicuculline inhibited I GABA in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.68 μm (Fig. 3C). Strychnine also inhibited I GABA, but only at concentrations higher than 1 μm (Fig. 3D), with IC 50 of 2.83 μm (Fig. 3D). The inhibitory effect of bicuculline on I Gly was also evident only at concentrations higher than 30 μm (Fig. 3C), a concentration that completely suppressed I GABA. Strychnine was effective in suppressing I Gly at concentrations ≥ 0.01 μm (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the IC 50 values for the inhibition of I Gly were 0.04 and 74.2 μm for strychnine and bicuculline, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that at a concentration of 1 mm, GABA and glycine are unlikely to cross-activate GlyR or GABAAR, respectively, significantly.Fig. 3Effect of bicuculline and strychnine on I GABA and I Gly. A and B, 30 μm bicuculline (Bic) was an effective antagonist of 1 mm I GABA but had little effect on 1 mm I Gly. To the contrary, 1 μm strychnine (Str) had little effect on 1 mm I GABA but inhibited 1 mm I Gly. C and D, concentration-response relationships for inhibition of 1 mm I GABA and 1 mm I Gly by bicuculline (C) and strychnine (D), respectively. The antagonists were perfused 30 s before simultaneous application of the agonists and the antagonists. The amplitudes of I GABA and I Gly were measured at the peak and expressed as values relative to the control response induced by 1 mm GABA or 1 mm Gly alone, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 4A, GABA or glycine responses obtained in the presence of the other agonist were reduced in amplitude, with GABA-evoked responses more strongly affected by glycine than the reverse condition. The cross-inhibition was also observed during sequential application of 1 mm GABA and 1 mm glycine or vice versa. As shown in Fig. 4B, when glycine was applied before GABA, the amplitude of I GABA became 37.4 ± 2.5% (n = 12; p < 0.01) of the control values observed in the absence of glycine. Similarly, I Gly was reduced to 77.9 ± 4.0% (n = 15; p < 0.05) of the control value after a prepulse of 1 mm GABA. Thus the suppression of I GABA by GlyR activation was significantly larger than inhibition of I Gly by GABAAR activation (p < 0.01). Fig. 4C summarizes the percent reduction in the mean amplitude of I GABA and I Gly when different prepulse concentrations of glycine and GABA were used, respectively. Glycine became effective in cross-inhibition at concentrations ≥ 30 μm, whereas GABA was effective at 100 μm. This asymmetric cross-inhibition between GABAAR and GlyR did not depend on chloride fluxes or changes in E Cl during receptor activation. For E Cl close to 0 mV, cross-inhibition was observed at both Vh = -50 and +50 mV (Fig. 5A). Preactivation of GlyR decreased I GABA to 37.4 ± 2.5% of the control at Vh = -50 mV (n = 12) and to 38.5 ± 4.1% of control at Vh = +50 mV (n = 12). Similarly, preactivation of GABAAR decreased I Gly to 77.9 ± 4.0% of the control at Vh = -50 mV (n = 10) and to 79.5 ± 4.5% of the control at Vh = +50 mV (n = 10). The differences between percent changes at two Vh values were all not significant (p = 0.1, paired t test). Reversal potentials of response evoked by successive applications of glycine and GABA at 1 mm were estimated by voltage ramp application during the steady-state phase of the evoked currents (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, successive glycine- and GABA-evoked responses had similar reversal potentials. During the glycine prepulse E Cl was -4.15 ± 0.4 mV, whereas it was-3.98 ± 0.58 mV during successive GABA application (n = 8).Fig. 4Asymmetric cross-interaction between I GABA and I Gly.

However, it remained unclear whether specific receptor channel opening and thus changes in receptor conformation triggered by the prepulse application are required for asymmetric cross-inhibition. To address this issue, we have used specific competitive antagonists for GABAAR and GlyR, bicuculline and strychnine, respectively. Sequential applications of glycine-GABA at 1 mm (Fig. 6A), or GABA-glycine at 1 mm (Fig. 6B) were performed in the presence of 1 μm strychnine and 30 μm bicuculline, respectively, at a concentration that selectively inhibits GlyR or GABAAR completely (Fig. 3, C and D).

To examine the role of NFκBin lipid metabolism, we studied its effect on the regulation of apoA-I secretion from human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NFκB reduced the expression of apoA-I mRNA and protein, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of IκBα super-repressor ameliorated the reduction. This IκBα-induced apoA-I increase was blocked by preincubation with MK886, a selective inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), suggesting that NFκB inactivation induces apoA-I through activation of PPARα. To further support this idea, the expression of IκBα increased apoA-I promoter activity, and this increase was blocked by preincubation with MK886. Mutations in the putative PPARα-binding site in the apoA-I promoter or lack of the site abrogated these changes. Taking these results together, inhibition of NFκB increases apoA-I and HDL cholesterol through activation of PPARα in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest a new aspect of lipid metabolism and may lead to a new paradigm for prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic disease.

Most of the cells in the body contain only a heterodimeric complex of p50 and p65 (1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 2Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Activation of NFκB is involved in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis (3Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). It may also be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (4Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), ischemic brain injury (5Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat.

Mice lacking the p65 subunit (RelA) display embryonic death at 15–16 days of gestation, concomitant with massive degeneration of the liver by apoptosis (8Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). To the contrary, mice lacking the p50 subunit of NFκB show no developmental abnormalities and live for at least 1 year after birth but exhibit multifocal defects in immune responses involving B lymphocytes and nonspecific responses to infection (9Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Although many researchers have demonstrated abnormalities in the immune responses of NFκB p50 subunit-deficient mice, to our knowledge no one has reported any abnormality in lipid metabolism of them. In this study, we found that the plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in NFκB p50 subunit-deficient mice were significantly higher than those in wild-type littermates under a regular or high fat diet. In addition, the level of apoA-I mRNA in the liver was significantly higher in NFκB-deficient mice than in wild-type littermates (data not shown). The plasma levels of apoE and apoB did not appear to differ between these NFκB-deficient and wild-type mice. ApoA-I is mainly synthesized in the liver and small intestine (10Zannis V.I. Cole F.S. Jackson C.L. Kurnit D.M. Karathanasis S.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because the levels of plasma apoA-I are positively correlated with hepatic apoA-I mRNA (11Srivastava R.A. Tang J. Krul E.S. Pfleger B. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1988; 263: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), factors influencing the level of apoA-I may be mediated through the level of apoA-I gene expression. The distinct enhancer region in the human apoA-I gene contains the regulatory element necessary for maximal expression in a human hepatoma cell line, called peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) (14Sastry K.N. Seedorf V. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this cell line activated PPARα binds to this element, thereby enhancing the expression of apoA-I (15Martin G. Duez H. Blanquart C. Berezowski V. Poulain P. Fruchart J.C. Najib-Fruchart J.

In this report we demonstrated that inactivation of NFκB enhances the expression and secretion of apoA-I from HepG2 cells through activation of the transcription factor PPARα. Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and WY-14643 (synthetic PPARα agonist) were purchased from Sigma, and MK886 (selective inhibitor of PPARα) was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). LPS was dissolved in pure water, whereas WY-14643 and MK886 were dissolved in Me2SO. Goat polyclonal anti-apoA-I antibody was purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA), rabbit anti-apoB antibody was from BioDesign (Saco, ME), and goat anti-apoE antibody and mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Animals—Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Guide for Animal Experimentation and with the approval of the Committee of Animal Experimentation, Ehime University School of Medicine. Animals were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility under a 12-h dark/light cycle. Homozygous NFκB p50 subunit-deficient mice Nfkb1tm1Bal, NFκB – / –) were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The gene-targeting strategy used to generate this mouse line was described previously (9Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These mice were back-crossed at least six times to C57BL/6 mice (Clea Japan Inc., Osaka, Japan). Genomic DNA was extracted from the mouse tail and genotyped by PCR following the protocol of The Jackson Laboratory. Eight-week-old female mice were divided into two groups. Each group, composed of five NFκB – / – mice and five control mice, was kept on a regular diet containing 5% (wt/wt) fat or a high fat diet containing 1.25% (wt/wt) cholesterol, 17.8% (wt/wt) butter, 1.0% (wt/wt) corn oil, and 0.5% (wt/wt) sodium cholate (Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 2 weeks. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (Sankyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for phlebotomy via the femoral vein. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min, and about 200 μl of plasma was obtained per mouse. Plasma Lipid Analysis—The concentrations of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol in plasma were measured using enzymatic kits (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) following the manufacturer's protocols. Plasma lipoprotein profile was determined by polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis (18Narayan K.A. Narayan S. Kummerous F.A. Nature. 1965; 205: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HepG2 cells were purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan) and routinely propagated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Recombinant Adenovirus—Ad5IκB (donated by Dr. Iimuro, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) expresses IκBα super-repressor under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, where serine to alanine mutations at amino acids 32 and 36 prevent the phosphorylation that is necessary for it to dissociate from the NFκB complex (19DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ad5LacZ, which expresses Escherichia coli β-galactosidase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as a control for adenovirus-mediated transfection (20Tamatani M. Che Y.H.

Culture media were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Western blot analysis with the specific anti-apoA-I antibody, anti-apoB antibody, or anti-apoE antibody, as previously described (25Ohkubo N.

Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—HepG2 cells were seeded on 12-well tissue culture plates (1 × 105 cells/well). The cells were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of the reporter plasmid and pRL-TK (Promega) internal control plasmid using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were subsequently transfected with multiplicity of infection 10 recombinant adenovirus as described above. After the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, they were treated with 10 μg/ml LPS, 10 μm MK886 or vehicle (0.1% v/v Me2SO) and incubated for an additional 24 h. The activities of firefly luciferase from apoA-I promoter-luciferase plasmid and Renilla luciferase from pRL-TK plasmid in the cell extracts were evaluated with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) using a luminometer (TD-20/20, Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical Analysis—Experimental data were evaluated by twotailed Student's t test. All unspecified data were presented as the mean ± S.D. Plasma Lipids—There was no significant difference in the concentration of total cholesterol in the plasma of female NFκB-deficient (NFκB – / –) mice and wild-type (NFκB + / +) controls after6hof food removal. After the mice were fed a high fat diet for 2 weeks, both types of mice had an about 2.5-fold increase in the fasting cholesterol level, and there was no significant difference between NFκB-deficient mice and wild-type littermates. NFκB-deficient mice showed a significantly higher HDL cholesterol level than wild-type littermates under both a regular and high fat diet. NFκB-deficient mice also showed a significantly lower triglyceride level than wild-type littermates only under a regular diet (Table II). Polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis of whole plasma confirmed that the ratio of HDL to total lipoprotein was significantly higher in NFκB-deficient mice than in wild-type control, whereas there was no significant difference in the ratios of low density lipoprotein (LDL) plus intermediate density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein (Table III).Table IIFasting plasma lipids in NFκB-deficient (NFκB-/-) and wild-type (NFκB+/+) miceDietNFκBnTotal cholesterolHDL cholesterolTriglyceridemg/dl, mean ± S.E.Normal+/+562.0 ± 2.831.9 ± 1.7ap < 0.01, compared to wild-type controls.174.0 ± 23.5bp < 0.05, compared to wild-type controls.-/-564.5 ± 2.445.5 ± 1.7ap < 0.01, compared to wild-type controls.112.7 ± 5.3bp < 0.05, compared to wild-type controls.High fat+/+5152.4 ± 17.537.9 ± 4.1ap < 0.01, compared to wild-type controls.170.3 ± 17.8-/-5161.7 ± 16.251.7 ± 7.3ap < 0.01, compared to wild-type controls.164.8 ± 12.9a p < 0.01, compared to wild-type controls.b p < 0.05, compared to wild-type controls.

There were no significant differences in the levels of apoE and apoB between these mouse types irrespective of diet. mRNA of Apolipoproteins in HepG2 Cells—To activate NFκB we treated HepG2 cells with LPS, and to inactivate NFκB directly we used adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IκBα super-repressor. When intracellular NFκB was activated by LPS treatment, the level of apoA-I mRNA in HepG2 cells was significantly decreased. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IκBα super-repressor, which leads to inactivation of NFκB, ameliorated this LPS-induced decrease. There was no significant difference in the levels of apoB and apoE mRNA, although NFκB was activated by LPS and/or inhibited by IκBα super-repressor (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Expression of apolipoproteins in HepG2 cells.

PPARα Inhibitor Blocked the Effect of NFκB on ApoA-I Secretion—A control study in which HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μm WY14643, a PPARα agonist, for 24 h showed that apoA-I protein secretion from the cells was increased. This increase was blocked by treatment with 10 μm MK886, a selective PPARα inhibitor (28Kehrer J.P. Biswal S.S. La E. Thuillier P. Datta K. Fischer S.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results indicate that apoA-I secretion from HepG2 cells is regulated by activation/inactivation of PPARα (Fig. 3, A and B). Likewise, when IκBα super-repressor was overexpressed in the cells, which leads to inactivation of NFκB, the secreted apoA-I protein was increased. This increase was blocked by treatment with 10 μm MK886 (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that NFκB inactivation induces apoA-I secretion from HepG2 cells through activation of PPARα. Unlike apoA-I, there was no difference in the levels of apoB and apoE in the culture medium, although NFκB was inhibited by IκBα super-repressor or PPARα was inhibited by MK886 (Fig. 3C). Transactivation of ApoA-I Promoter by Inhibition of NFκB Was Mediated by PPARα—To confirm whether this induction of apoA-I mRNA by inhibition of NFκB really derives from activation of the apoA-I promoter and to determine whether this induction is mediated by the transcription factor PPARα, we constructed human apoA-I promoter-luciferase plasmids carrying the wild-type PPRE element (ApoAI-wt) or a mutant PPRE element (ApoAI-mut) and a shorter plasmid that does not carry the PPRE element (ApoAI-short) (Fig. 4A). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with one of these promoter-reporter plasmids, transfected with adenovirus expressing IκBα super-repressor or LacZ, and then treated with LPS, MK886, or vehicle (5% v/v pure water and/or 0.1% v/v Me2SO). The relative promoter activity in the cells where IκBα super-repressor was overexpressed was significantly higher than the activity in LacZ-overexpressing cells (2.7-fold, p < 0.01, Fig. 4B). When the cells were transfected with ApoAI-wt plasmid and IκBα super-repressor, treatment with 10 μm MK886 significantly decreased relative promoter activity (2.7–1.4-fold, p < 0.01). When the cells were transfected with ApoAI-mut plasmid or apoAI-short plasmid, overexpression of IκBα super-repressor appeared to increase relative promoter activity a little, but these increases were much less than the increase when ApoAI-wt plasmid was used and were not significant. Cholesterol circulates in plasma as two main lipoprotein particles, LDL and HDL. LDL transports cholesterol synthesized in the liver to the peripheral tissues, whereas HDL returns cholesterol from the peripheral tissues to the liver for bile acid excretion. The major structural component of the HDL particle is apoA-I, whereas that of the LDL particle is apoB (29Malmendier C.L. Delcroix C. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 43: 557-564Google Scholar, 30Breslow J.L. Circulation. 1993; 87: 16-21Google Scholar). Plasma HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels are correlated with each other (31Voyiaziakis E. Goldberg I.J. Plump A.S. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Huang L.S. J.

Nature. 1991; 353: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the NFκB pathway include a variety of agents, including antioxidants, proteasome inhibitors, decoy oligonucleotides, IκB phosphorylation and/or degradation inhibitors, and IκB super-repressor (43Epinat J-C. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Some of them act as general inhibitors, whereas others act as specific inhibitors. Among them, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IκBα super-repressor is a good tool for direct and selective inhibition of NFκB activity in vitro (44Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). In most cell types, the NFκB p50-p65 dimer is bound to one of the closely related endogenous inhibitory proteins, collectively referred to as IκB, and is held inactive in the cytoplasm. A variety of extracellular stimuli, including viral infection, LPS, cytokines, and stress factors have been reported to activate NFκB through phosphorylation of IκB at serine-32 and serine-36, dissociation of IκB from the complex, and translocation of the p50-p65 dimer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of IκB also leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IκBα super-repressor, where serine-32 and serine-36 of the IκBα are substituted by alanines, suppresses phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (19DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to selective and constitutive inactivation of NFκB. Transcriptional regulation of apoA-I by activated PPARα may be a species-specific phenomenon. In rats, Staels et al. (45Staels B. van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that treatment with a PPARα agonist, fenofibrate, markedly reduced hepatic apoA-I mRNA. In contrast, Vu-Dac et al. (46Vu-Dac N. Chopin-Delannoy S. Gervois P. Bonnelye E. Martin G. Fruchart J.C. Laudet V. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25713-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) report that fibrates increase human apoA-I production due to stimulation of apoA-I gene expression in the liver. In this report they clearly demonstrated that this species-specific regulation of apoA-I expression was because of sequence differences in two distinct enhancer regions in the rodent and human apoA-I promoter. Similarly, using transgenic mice containing 21 copies of an 11-kilobase human genomic DNA fragment, Berthou et al. (47Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) also clearly demonstrate that 7 days of treatment with fenofibrate (5% wt/wt) increased plasma human apoA-I up to 750% and HDL cholesterol up to 200% in the transgenic mice, whereas it decreased plasma mouse apoA-I to 59% in non-transgenic mice. Fibrates are widely used hypolipidemic drugs, and they activate PPARα that binds to the PPRE element on the human apoA-I promoter and positively regulate the expression of apoA-I. Fibrates also induce the expression of Rev-erbα, which binds to a RebRE site in the rat apoA-I promoter and then repress the expression of apoA-I. They showed that the transcription from human apoA-I gene was promoted via PPARα binding to a positive PPRE. Because of three single nucleotide differences, this site is not conserved in rats and mice. In contrast, rodent apoA-I transcription is repressed by Rev-erbα, whose binding site RebRE is adjacent to the TATA box in the rodent apoA-I promoter but not in the human apoA-I promoter (48Staels B. Auwerx J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: 19-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the question arises as to whether the three single nucleotide differences completely inactivated rodent PPRE or not. In our study, the levels of plasma apoA-I and HDL cholesterol were significantly higher in NFκB p50 subunit-deficient mice than wild-type littermates. To support our data, Bisgaier et al. (49Bisgaier C.L. Essenburg A.D. Barnett B.C. Auerbach B.J. Haubenwallner S. Leff T. White A.D. Creger P. Pape M.E. Rea T.J. Newton R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that 7 days of treatment of rats with a novel PPARα activator PD72935 at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg significantly increased serum apoA-I and HDL cholesterol to 148 and 185% compared with control, respectively. Formation of the p65-p50 dimer and its translocation to the nucleus are completely lost in NFκB p50 subunit-deficient mice. Therefore, unlike the fenofibrate-treatment, nuclear PPARα could not interact with the p65 subunit, and the transcriptional activity of PPARα might be selectively on a high level (50Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Similarly, unlike with fenofibrate treatment, lack of the NFκB-p50 gene did not seem to induce the expression of Rev-erbα. To further support our concept, specific inhibition of NFκB by IκBα super-repressor significantly induced apoA-I expression in murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 cells, and this induction was blocked by treatment with a PPARα inhibitor, MK886 (data not shown). In such a way our result that the lack of NFκB p50 subunit increased plasma apoA-I and HDL cholesterol in mice is mostly compatible with the results of Berthou et al. (47Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and Bisgaier et al. (49Bisgaier C.L. Essenburg A.D. Barnett B.C. Auerbach B.J. Haubenwallner S. Leff T. White A.D. Creger P. Pape M.E. Rea T.J. Newton R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess our hypothesis that inactivation of NFκB facilitates expression of apoA-I through activation of the transcription factor PPARα, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis to semi-quantify apoA-I mRNA in HepG2 cells and immunoblot analysis to quantify its secretion into the medium from HepG2 cells. Activation of NFκB by LPS treatment significantly decreased apoA-I at both the mRNA and protein levels. Specific inactivation of NFκB by overexpression of IκBα super-repressor ameliorated the decreases in both levels (Fig. 2). This IκBα super-repressor-induced apoA-I elevation was completely blocked by pretreatment of the cells with MK886, a selective PPARα inhibitor (Fig. 3, C and D). When the NFκB p65-p50 dimer translocates into the nucleus, the p65 subunit interacts with PPARα and represses PPARα transactivation of a PPRE-driven promoter (50Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In the cells where IκBα super-repressor is overexpressed, the dimer tightly binds to the super-repressor, and translocation of the dimer into the nucleus and interaction of the p65 subunit with PPARα are suppressed (50Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol.

To further support our hypothesis, activity of the human apoA-I promoter was also increased 2.7-fold by overexpression of IκBα super-repressor. The 2.7-fold increase was reduced to 1.5-fold by pretreatment with MK886, a selective PPARα inhibitor. When the apoA-I promoter, carrying mutations in the PPRE element, or the shorter promoter, which did not contain the PPRE element, was used instead of the wild-type promoter, the increase in promoter activity induced by IκBα super-repressor was blocked. These results indicate that NFκB activation/inactivation controls expression of apoA-I at the transcriptional level through PPARα. We have demonstrated here that lack of the NFκB p50 subunit in mice increased plasma apoA-I and HDL cholesterol without any difference in total cholesterol in vivo. We have also demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated inactivation of NFκB increased the expression of apoA-I at the mRNA and protein level in vitro. The reciprocal function between PPARα and NFκB to the PPRE in the apoA-I promoter was responsible for this transactivation. In summary, this report demonstrated that NFκB activity indirectly controls apoA-I expression both in vivo and in vitro. We thank Dr. Iimuro, Kyoto University, for Ad5IκB and Ad5LacZ."

We investigated whether χ-MrIA targeted the other members of the monoamine transporter family and found no effect of the peptide (100 μm) on the activity of the dopamine transporter and the serotonin transporter, indicating a high specificity of action. The binding of the NET inhibitors, [3H]nisoxetine and [3H]mazindol, to the expressed rat and human NET was inhibited by χ-MrIA with the conopeptide displaying a slight preference toward the rat isoform. For both radioligands, saturation binding studies showed that the inhibition by χ-MrIA was competitive in nature. It has previously been demonstrated that χ-MrIA does not compete with norepinephrine, unlike classically described NET inhibitors such as nisoxetine and mazindol that do. This pattern of behavior implies that the binding site for χ-MrIA on the NET overlaps the antidepressant binding site and is wholly distinct from the substrate binding site. The inhibitory effect of χ-MrIA was found to be dependent on Na+ with the conopeptide becoming a less effective blocker of [3H]norepinephrine by the NET under the conditions of reduced extracellular Na+. In this respect, χ-MrIA is similar to the antidepressant inhibitors of the NET. The structure-activity relationship of χ-MrIA was investigated by alanine scanning. Four residues in the first cysteine-bracketed loop of χ-MrIA and a His in loop 2 played a dominant role in the interaction between χ-MrIA and the NET. Hα chemical shift comparisons indicated that side-chain interactions at these key positions were structurally perturbed by the replacement of Gly-6. From these data, we present a model of the structure of χ-MrIA that shows the relative orientation of the key binding residues. This model provides a new molecular caliper for probing the structure of the NET. χ-Conopeptide MrIA (χ-MrIA) is a 13-residue peptide contained in the venom of the predatory marine snail Conus marmoreus that has been found to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter (NET).

The non-competitive mode of action of χ-MrIA distinguishes it from the majority of the classically described inhibitors of the NET that act in a competitive fashion. In this study, we explored the interaction of χ-MrIA with the monoamine transporters to gain an insight into the selectivity, Na+ dependence, site of action, and structure-activity relationship of the conopeptide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—χ-MrIA and the singly substituted analogs, [N1A]MrIA, [G2A]MrIA, [V3A]MrIA, [G6A]MrIA, [Y7A]MrIA, [K8A]MrIA, [L9A]MrIA, [H11A]MrIA, [O12A]MrIA, [Y7F]MrIA, and [K8R]MrIA, were synthesized. The chain assembly of the peptides was performed on a manual shaker system using HBTU activation protocols (11Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) to couple the Fmoc-protected amino acid to the resin. The Fmoc-protecting group was removed using 50% piperidine in dimethylformamide, and dimethylformamide was used as both the coupling solvent and for flow washes throughout the cycle. The progress of the assembly was monitored by quantitative ninhydrin monitoring (12Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by stirring at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid:H2O:triisopropylsilane:ethanedithiol (90:5:2.5:2.5) for 2-3 h. Cold diethyl ether was then added to the mixture, and the peptide precipitated out. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with further cold diethyl ether to remove scavengers. The final product was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield a fluffy white solid. The crude, reduced peptide was examined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography for purity, and the correct molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Pure, reduced peptides were oxidized, and the major peak was purified to >95% purity and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography prior to further use.Cellular Uptake of [3H]Monoamines—COS-1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in 24-well plates (Falcon, BC Biosciences) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Upon reaching ∼85% confluency, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the human NET (13Percy E. Kaye D.M. Lambert G.W. Gruskin S. Esler M.D. Du X.J. Br. J.

Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol using 800 ng of DNA/well. Assays measuring the cellular accumulation of the transporters' respective [3H]monoamine substrates were performed 24 h after transfection at room temperature in duplicate. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 500 μl of transport buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 5.55 mmd-(+)-glucose, 1.02 mm ascorbic acid, 10 μm U-0521 (to inhibit catechol-O-methyl transferase), and 100 μm pargyline (to inhibit monoamine oxidase), pH 7.4. In experiments examining the Na+ dependence of the NET inhibitors, the concentration of NaCl used in the transport buffer ranged from 25 to 125 mm with appropriate concentrations of LiCl added to retain equal osmolarity. Inhibitor drugs were preincubated with the cells for 15 min before the addition of 100 nm [3H]monoamine substrate (supplemented with unlabeled substrate as required). The final volume was 250 μl. Nonspecific uptake of [3H]norepinephrine by NET-transfected cells was defined by the accumulation occurring in the presence of 10-4m desipramine. Imipramine (10-6m) and GBR-12909 (10-6m) were used to determine the amount of nonspecific uptake of [3H]serotonin by SERT-transfected cells and [3H]dopamine uptake by DAT-transfected cells, respectively. Transfected cells were exposed to [3H]monoamine substrate for either 8 min (rat NET, human SERT) or 15 min (human NET, human DAT). The selection of these incubation times was based on the results of pilot studies that showed that the relationship between uptake and time was linear over these periods (data not shown). The solution containing unaccumulated 3H-substrate was then rapidly removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, for 60 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The level of radioactivity of the cell lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Membrane Preparation—COS-7 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom) were grown in 150-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the rat NET using the same method described for the uptake experiments. Membranes were prepared from cells 48 h after transfection for use in radioligand binding experiments. After washing the cells with warm phosphate-buffered saline, ice-cold TEM buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 1.4 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) was added and the cells were scraped from the dish. Cells were then homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris then at 15,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with TEM buffer and recentrifuged. The resulting pellet was resuspended in TEM buffer containing 10% glycerol. Rat brain homogenates were prepared as described previously (17Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A. Sharpe I.A. Luchian T. Adams D.J. Bond T. Thomas L. Jones A. Matheson J.

Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of membrane were stored at -80 °C until use.Radioligand Binding Assays—Binding reactions were set up in triplicate wells of 96-well plates. Membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with the rat or human NET (6 μg of protein/well) were incubated with either [3H]nisoxetine (4.3 nm) or [3H]mazindol (4 nm) in the absence or presence of χ-MrIA or one of its analogs (1 nm-100 μm) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, 75 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. The final assay volume was 150 μl. The amount of nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of desipramine (100 μm) in the reaction. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by rapid vacuum filtration onto GF/B filters (Wallac, Boston, MA) pretreated with 0.6% polyethylenimine. Filter mats were washed three times with ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and allowed to dry. Filter-retained radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For saturation analysis experiments, the binding reactions contained 6 μg of membrane protein from rat NET-transfected COS-7 cells, either [3H]nisoxetine (4-100 nm) or [3H]mazindol (5-86 nm) and χ-MrIA (0, 2, or 20 μm). In other experiments, rat brain homogenates (equivalent to 20 μg of protein/well) and [3H]nisoxetine (4.3 nm) were incubated together in the absence and presence of unlabeled nisoxetine, desipramine, or χ-MrIA (1 pm-100 μm) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were filtered, and the radioactivity counted as described above.1H NMR Spectroscopy—All of the spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were ∼2 mm. Each analog was examined in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, pH 3.0-3.5. The 1H NMR experiments recorded were NOESY (18Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, 19Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 65-120 ms. All of the spectra were recorded at 293 K and were run over 6024 Hz (500 MHz) with 4096 data points, 512 free induction decays, 16-80 scans, and a recycle delay of 1 s.The solvent was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (21Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using XWINMR. Free induction decays were multiplied by a polynomial function and apodised using a 90° shifted sine-bell function in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. Base-line correction using a fifth order polynomial was applied. Chemical shift values were referenced internally to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapetane-5-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm. The peptides were assigned according to the method of Wüthrich (22Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, Wiley-Interscience. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). Secondary Hα shifts were compared with the random coil shift values of Wishart et al. (23Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar).Materials—Desipramine hydrochloride, imipramine hydrochloride, mazindol, nisoxetine hydrochloride, (-)-norepinephrine bitartrate, and pargyline were obtained from Sigma. U-0521 and GBR-12909 dihydrochloride were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). l-[7-3H]Norepinephrine (specific activity, 14.9 Ci/mmol), 5-[1,2-3H(N)]hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate ([3H]serotonin) (specific activity, 24.0 Ci/mmol), 3,4-[7-3H]dihydroxyphenylethylamine ([3H]dopamine) (specific activity, 27.5 Ci/mmol), [3H]mazindol (specific activity, 21 Ci/mmol), and [3H]nisoxetine (specific activity, 80 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protected Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were from Novabiochem or Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). The following side-chain protected amino acids were used: Cys(tBu), Asn(Trt), His(Trt), Hyp(tBu), Tyr(tBu), and Lys(Boc). Dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, diisopropylethylamine, and trifluoroacetic acid, were all of peptide synthesis grade supplied by Auspep. HBTU was Fluka 12804 supplied by Sigma. High performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile and methanol was supplied by Sigma. Resin used was Fmoc-rink amide resin supplied by Polymer Laboratories. Triisopropylsilane was from Aldrich.Statistics and Data Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of results obtained from 2 to 5 separate experiments. Student's two-tailed t test or, where appropriate, ANOVA with post hoc t tests performed by the Tukey method was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Curve fitting of concentration-response curves and radioligand binding data was performed by non-linear regression using individual data points with Prism 3.0 software for Macintosh (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The equation of Cheng and Prusoff (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12185) Google Scholar) was used to convert IC50 values to K i values.RESULTSEffect of χ-MrIA on the Cellular Uptake of [3H]Monoamines—COS-1 cells transfected with either the rat or human NET readily accumulated [3H]norepinephrine, and nonspecific uptake of [3H]norepinephrine was <2.5% of the total uptake. As shown in Fig. 1, the uptake of [3H]norepinephrine via the rat and human NET was sensitive to inhibition by χ-MrIA with pIC50 values of 6.21 ± 0.02 (rat; n = 3) and 5.90 ± 0.03 (human; n = 3). χ-MrIA acted as a full inhibitor of the NET of both species. For DAT- and SERT-transfected cells, nonspecific uptake represented <6% of the total [3H]norepinephrine accumulation. In the presence of χ-MrIA (100 μm), the rate of uptake of [3H]dopamine by the human DAT and [3H]serotonin by the human SERT was not significantly altered (Fig. 1B).Effect of χ-MrIA on the Binding of Classical NET Inhibitors—χ-MrIA inhibited the binding of [3H]nisoxetine to the membranes of cells expressing the rat and human NET (Fig. 2A). The IC50 for inhibition was 500 nm (pK i = 6.6 ± 0.05) at the rat NET and 1.7 μm (pK i = 6.0 ± 0.04) at the human NET. [3H]Mazindol binding to the expressed transporters was also sensitive to χ-MrIA (Fig. 2B). χ-MrIA inhibited binding with an IC50 of 1.9 μm (pK i = 6.4 ± 0.03) at the rat NET and 4.0 μm (pK i = 5.9 ± 0.04) at the human NET. Nonspecific binding represented ∼3% of the total binding in all of the experiments, and χ-MrIA acted as a full inhibitor of [3H]nisoxetine and [3H]mazindol binding.Fig. 2Inhibition of the binding of classical inhibitors to the expressed NET by χ-MrIA. The specific binding of [3H]nisoxetine (A) and [3H]mazindol (B) to the membranes of COS-7 cells that had been transiently transfected with the rat NET (▪) or the human NET (□) was examined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of χ-MrIA. Radioligand binding determined in reactions without χ-MrIA was used to define 100% binding. Nonspecific binding was defined as that occurring in the presence of 100 μm desipramine. Symbols represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Saturation analysis was used to characterize the nature of the inhibition caused by χ-MrIA (Fig. 3). In the absence of χ-MrIA, [3H]nisoxetine bound to rat NET membranes with a K d of 4.2 ± 0.5 nm and a B max of 42 ± 1.6 pmol/mg protein. The K d was increased to 21 ± 3.6 nm in the presence of 2 μm χ-MrIA with no significant change in the value of the B max (45 ± 4.2 pmol/mg protein). For [3H]mazindol binding, the K d was 1.0 ± 0.1 nm and the B max was 40 ± 0.3 pmol/mg protein in control experiments. In the presence of χ-MrIA (20 μm), the K d (35 ± 1.5 nm) but not the B max (41 ± 0.6 pmol/mg protein) was significantly altered. χ-MrIA (10-6m) did not affect the dissociation rate of [3H]nisoxetine from the expressed rat NET (data not shown).Fig. 3Effect of χ-MrIA on the saturability of binding of classical inhibitors to the expressed rat NET. The specific binding of increasing concentrations of [3H]nisoxetine (A) and [3H]mazindol (B) to membranes from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the rat NET was measured in the absence (▪) and presence of χ-MrIA (▵, 2 μm; ○, 20 μm). Nonspecific binding was defined as that occurring in the presence of 100 μm desipramine. Symbols represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Desipramine, nisoxetine, and χ-MrIA reduced the binding of [3H]nisoxetine to rat brain homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). F tests comparing the fit of the binding data to a model of one-site competition, two-site competition, or a sigmoidal curve with a variable slope indicated that the simpler one-site competition model was preferred and more complicated models did not significantly improve the fit (p > 0.2 for each of the comparisons). The IC50 values for the inhibition were 1.1 nm (pIC50 = 8.9 ± 0.06) for desipramine, 6.2 nm (pIC50 = 8.2 ± 0.07) for nisoxetine, and 5.7 μm (pIC50 = 5.2 ± 0.22) for χ-MrIA. While desipramine and unlabeled nisoxetine inhibited the [3H]nisoxetine binding to the same extent (nonspecific binding of ∼43%), the estimated maximum extent of inhibition produced by χ-MrIA was significantly less (p < 0.001) with ∼32% of the nisoxetine- and desipramine-sensitive binding found to be insensitive to χ-MrIA.Fig. 4Inhibition of [3H]nisoxetine binding to rat brain. The effect of increasing concentrations of desipramine (▾), unlabeled nisoxetine (▪), and χ-MrIA (○) on the total binding of [3H]nisoxetine to rat brain homogenates (20 μg of protein) was examined as described. Symbols represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sodium dependence of NET inhibition—The rate of uptake of [3H]norepinephrine by cells transfected with the human NET slowed substantially as the concentration of Na+ in the transport buffer was reduced. At the lowest Na+ concentration examined (25 mm), the rate of [3H]norepinephrine accumulation was approximately half of that observed at 125 mm Na+ (data not shown). Concentrations of desipramine and χ-MrIA that inhibited transport by 50% in assays where the buffer contained 125 mm Na+ (4.05 nm and 1.26 μm, respectively) were found to inhibit a progressively smaller proportion of the uptake in buffer containing less Na+ (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Sodium dependence of the effectiveness of NET inhibitors to block uptake. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the human NET were exposed to [3H]norepinephrine (100 nm) contained in buffer in which various amounts of Na+ had been isotonically replaced with Li+. Specific uptake of [3H]norepinephrine occurring in the presence of desipramine (○, 4.05 nm) and χ-MrIA (▪, 1.26 μm) was expressed as a percentage of the uptake occurring in the absence of the inhibitors at each extracellular Na+ concentration tested. Nonspecific uptake was defined by that which was not sensitive to 100 μm desipramine. Symbols represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Residue Replacement on the Potency of χ-MrIA—Nine analogs of χ-MrIA in which the non-cysteine residues were systematically replaced with alanine were assayed for inhibition of [3H]nisoxetine binding to the expressed human NET, and their potency was compared (Fig. 6). The analogs with substitutions at N-terminal residues outside of the cysteine-bracketed loops ([N1A]MrIA, [G2A]MrIA, and [V3A]MrIA) displayed no significant change in potency compared with χ-MrIA. The replacement of any of the residues located in the first cysteine-bracketed loop, in contrast, had a severe impact on potency. No inhibition was observed with these analogs ([G6A]MrIA, [Y7A]MrIA, [K8A]MrIA, and [L9A]MrIA) at 100 μm, the highest concentration tested. Assuming that the Hill slope parameter for their inhibition remains unchanged compared with χ-MrIA, the IC50 concentrations of these peptides will be at least an order of magnitude greater still, yielding a conservative estimate of 10-3m. Alanine substitution of the first residue of the second cysteine-bracketed loop (analog [H11A]MrIA) caused a ∼60-fold reduction in potency. Replacement of the other residue in this loop (analog [O12A]MrIA) did not have a significant effect on potency. Two further analogs were assayed to investigate the effect of replacement with residues other than alanine at positions 7 and 8. The potency of [Y7F]MrIA was ∼3.8-fold lower (pIC50 = 5.2 ± 0.08) than χ-MrIA, and the potency of [K8R]MrIA was ∼6.8-fold lower (pIC50 = 4.9 ± 0.10) than χ-MrIA.Fig. 6Alanine scan of χ-MrIA. A series of analogs of χ-MrIA in which non-cysteine residues were systematically replaced with alanine was assayed for inhibition of [3H]nisoxetine binding to the expressed human NET, and their potency was compared with χ-MrIA (top bar). The potency of analogs with bars marked “<” are estimates based on the lack of any inhibition being detected at concentrations up to 100 μm. *, p < 0.05 compared with χ-MrIA.

https://openalex.org/W2031692128,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibits expression of smooth muscle (SM) genes in vascular smooth muscle cells and blocks induction by arginine vasopressin (AVP). We have previously demonstrated that suppression of SM-α-actin by PDGF-BB is mediated in part through a Ras-dependent pathway. This study examined the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)y and its downstream effector, Akt, in regulating SM gene expression. PDGF caused a rapid sustained activation of Akt, whereas AVP caused only a small transient increase. PDGF selectively caused a sustained stimulation of p85/p110α PI3K. In contrast, p85/110β PI3K activity was not altered by either PDGF or AVP, whereas both agents caused a delayed activation of Class IB p101/110γ PI3K. Expression of a gain-of-function PI3K or myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) mimicked the inhibitory effect of PDGF on SM-α-actin and SM22α expression. Pretreatment with LY 294002 reversed the inhibitory effect of PDGF. Expression of myr-Akt selectively inhibited AVP-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which we have shown are critical for induction of these genes. Nuclear extracts from PDGF-stimulated or myr-Akt expressing cells showed reduced serum response factor binding to SM-specific CArG elements. This was associated with appearance of serum response factor in the cytoplasm. These data indicate that activation of p85/p110α/Akt mediates suppression of SM gene expression by PDGF.

Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); SM, smooth muscle; AVP, arginine vasopressin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SRF, serum response factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; myr, myristoylated; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole.1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); SM, smooth muscle; AVP, arginine vasopressin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SRF, serum response factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; myr, myristoylated; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole. is critical during development and in the onset of diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Unlike myocardial and skeletal muscle cells, VSMC are highly plastic and retain the ability to modulate their phenotype from a contractile to a more proliferative synthetic state (1Chamley-Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 40: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Kocher O. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Reidy M.A. Cokay M.S. Peters H. Huttner I. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 459-470PubMed Google Scholar). Retention of this plasticity is important in that it permits processes such as vessel repair after injury, but it may also be detrimental in that it increases susceptibility to atherogenic risk factors. Understanding the molecular control of phenotypic modulation of VSMC will be dependent on the identification of signaling mechanisms that control the transcription of genes encoding proteins necessary for the differentiated function of VSMC. Several smooth muscle (SM)-specific contractile or contractile-associated proteins, including SM-α-actin, myosin heavy chain, h-caldesmon, and SM-22α, are useful markers for studying VSMC differentiation (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Of these, SM-α-actin has been the most extensively studied, because it is the most abundant VSMC protein, and the first known marker to appear during vessel development (4Fatigati V. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14383-14388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of SM-α-actin expression involves a complex interaction of multiple positive and negative cis-elements that act in a cell type-specific fashion (5Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). SM22α, another early marker, is a calponin-related protein that may be involved in contraction of VSMC because of its interactions with tropomyosin and F-actin (6Fu Y. Liu H.W. Forsythe S.M. Kogut P. McConville J.F. Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has examined the regulation of SM-specific gene expression in cultured adult VSMC. These cells have been widely studied and are likely to reflect most of the critical features of VSMC in vivo (7Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M. Olson E.N. Miano J.M. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The proximal region of the rat SM-α-actin promoter contains two CArG elements, which are critical for regulation of promoter activity by vasoconstrictor hormones and growth factors (8Van Putten V.

CArG elements are the binding sites for the MADS (MCM1 agamous deficiens SRF) box transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF) (10Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J.

The SM22α gene, like many SM genes, also contains multiple CArG boxes in the proximal region of its promoter (12Kemp P.R. Osbourn J.K. Grainger D.J. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In VSMC, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mediates a variety of biological effects through activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways including the MAP kinase cascade, phosphatidylinositol turnover, and calcium mobilization. These effects contribute to smooth muscle cell proliferation and directed migration (13Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.G. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Earlier work from our laboratory (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem.

Res. 1991; 68: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that PDGF suppressed expression of SM-α-actin in rat aortic VSMC. This effect is mediated at least in part through suppression of SM-α-actin promoter activity and involves PDGF-induced activation of the low molecular weight G protein Ras (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras engages multiple downstream effectors, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. However, suppression of SM-α-actin appeared to be mediated through a Ras-dependent/Raf-independent pathway involving effector pathways that are not well characterized. Activated PDGF receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to bind and activate Class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (16Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K.

Newly synthesized phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate recruits pleckstrin homology domain-containing signaling molecules such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, Akt/PKB, and possibly protein kinase Cζ, to the plasma membrane, where the combination of lipid binding and phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 serves to activate these enzymes (18Stokoe D.

The goal of this study was to examine the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in PDGF-induced down-regulation of SM-specific gene expression in VSMC. We investigated the contribution of this pathway to the regulation of SM-α-actin and SM22α expression and showed for the first time that PDGF-BB-induced suppression of SM-specific genes is mediated through activation of a PI3K-dependent Akt signaling pathway. We also report a novel PI3K-dependent Akt signaling pathway activated by PDGF, leading to changes in the subcellular localization of SRF. Materials—Trypsin/EDTA and Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) were from Invitrogen. Antibodies to Akt, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 and to their phosphorylated forms were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibody against SM-α-actin was obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against SM22α was a gift of Dr. Angela Chiavegato (University of Padua, Padua, Italy). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. Expression plasmid encoding myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) was a generous gift of Dr. Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Expression plasmid for myr-p110α PI3K and antibodies against p110α, p110β, and p101 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Rat aortic VSMC were isolated and cultured as previously described in detail (24Caramelo C. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cells (passages 4–12) were grown in Eagle's MEM containing 1 mm l-glutamine, 2 g/liter NaHCO3, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere. For transient transfections measuring promoter activity, vectors encoding 765 bp of the rat SM-α-actin promoter ligated into a promoterless luciferase vector (PA3-Luc) (8Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or 505 bp of the SM22α promoter ligated into a promoterless PA3-Luc vector (gift of Dr. Joseph Miano, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY) were used. VSMC (2 × 106 cells/100 μl) were transiently transfected by electroporation with a GeneZAPPER (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT) in Gene Pulser 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes (Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA) using 10 μg of the SM-α-actin promoter-luciferase construct or 2 μg of the SM22α promoter construct together with 5 μg of a plasmid encoding cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector (Clontech) for normalization of transfection efficiency. The transfections also included 5 μg of other plasmids (myr-Akt, myr-P110α, or empty vector). The cells were incubated for 18 h in Eagle's MEM with 10% fetal calf serum and then placed in Eagle's MEM with 0.2% fetal calf serum with or without agonists for 72 h. The transiently transfected VSMC were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as previously described (11Garat C. Van Putten V. Refaat Z.A. Dessev C. Han S.Y.

Stable Transfection of VSMC—A cDNA encoding Akt containing the Src myristoylation sequence at the N terminus and the hemagglutinin tag at the C terminus (25Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) was ligated between the HindIII and HpaI sites of the retroviral expression vector pLNCX. The resulting vector, LNCX-myr-Akt, was packaged into replication-defective retrovirus using 293T cells and the retrovirus-component expression plasmids SV-ψ–-A-murine leukemia virus and SV-ψ–-env–-murine leukemia virus by the procedure described previously (26Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted retrovirus was supplemented with polybrene (8 μg/ml), filtered (0.45 μm), and incubated with VSMC for 48 h. The cells expressing myristoylated Akt were selected by culturing them in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). Individual clones were screened by immunoblotting with anti-hemagglutinin, anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Akt Kinase Assay—VSMC were plated at 1.5 million cells/60-mm dish. The cells were made quiescent by incubation in Eagle's MEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then stimulated with AVP or PDGF-BB for the indicated times. The cells were harvested in Akt kinase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). Akt kinase activity was assayed with a kit from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), using GSK3 as a substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions. PI3K Assay—VSMC were treated with AVP or PDGF for the indicated times and harvested in Akt kinase lysis buffer. Extracts were microcentrifuged for 10 min, and 0.5 mg of protein from each extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 16–18 h at 4 °C with antibodies against specific isoforms of PI3K (p110α, p110β, and p101). Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) beads were added for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were rinsed three times with lysis buffer and once with wash buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Phosphatidylinositol micelles were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, as 20 mg/ml stock by sonication in a bath sonicator for 15 min at 4 °C. Washed Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitated PI3K isoforms were incubated with phosphatidylinositol micelles (20 μg/reaction) for 10 min on ice, followed by the addition of kinase reaction mix (final concentration, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Kinase reactions were run for 20 min at 25 °C and stopped by the addition of 100 μlof1 n HCl. Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol was extracted once with 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and once with 80 μl of MeOH with 100 mm HCl, 2 mm EDTA (1:1). Ten μl of the organic phase was spotted on TLC plates and separated for 2 h in chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (29.5%):water (42:38:4.7:7.3). TLC plates were dried and autoradiographed. The results were quantitated by densitometry. Immunoblotting—VSMC were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer, pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 200 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 10 min. The supernatants were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 5% milk, and then incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS solution containing primary antibodies against signaling molecules for 12–16 h at 4 °C. The membranes were washed in TTBS, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. The changes were quantitated by densitometry. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells either stimulated with PDGF for 96 h or cells stably expressing gain-of-function Akt using a variation of the procedure of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) as described previously (11Garat C. Van Putten V. Refaat Z.A. Dessev C. Han S.Y. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22537-22543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A double-stranded 94-bp DNA piece (–184 to –92), which included the near CArG and GC boxes of the SM22α promoter was made by PCR amplification. Primers used for PCR amplifications included a 3′ MluI site for the purpose of fill-in labeling with [32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase. Unincorporated [32P]dCTP was removed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Binding was performed for 30 min at 4 °C with 2 μg of nuclear binding proteins and 1 ng of labeled DNA probe in 20 μl of total volume containing 0.125 mg of poly(dI-dC), 12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of SRF antibody was added at 4 °C 30 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 24 cm, 5% acrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide; Fisher) at 25 mAmp/gel in 1× TGE (25 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, 190 mm glycine, pH 8.0) for 3 h. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Immunofluorescence—VSMC were cultured on 18-mm glass coverslips, before being stimulated either with AVP for 72 h or with PDGF for 72 or 96 h. Stimulated cells or cells stably expressing gain-of-function Akt (myr-Akt2 and myr-Akt9), along with their control cells, were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 5 min and rinsed three times with PBS. Prior to labeling with SRF antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. SRF labeling was detected using an anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Texas Red (Molecular Probes). After the secondary antibody labeling, the cells were rinsed extensively and incubated with ALEXA Fluor 488 Phalloidine (Molecular Probes) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min for detection of F-actin. The coverslips were mounted with VectaShield medium containing 4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector laboratories), and the cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted fluorescence microscope. PDGF Selectively Activates PI3K and Akt in VSMC—The ability of AVP or PDGF to stimulate Akt was determined by measuring phosphorylation of Akt as a function of time following agonist stimulation, using a phospho-specific Akt antibody, which detects phosphorylation at serine 473. PDGF rapidly increased Akt phosphorylation by 5 min. Maximal stimulation (∼6-fold) was detected at 5–30 min, and stimulation was sustained up to 4 h with no significant decrease (Fig. 1A). In contrast, exposure of VSMC to AVP resulted in a very modest increase in phospho-Akt (<2-fold), which was more transient in nature (Fig. 1A), and returned to basal levels by 15 min. Activation of Akt was confirmed by directly measuring kinase activity after immunoprecipitation with anti-Akt antibodies, using GSK3 as a substrate. PDGF gave a sustained increase in Akt activity ∼10-fold, whereas a more transient and modest increase was seen with AVP stimulation (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with LY 294002 (10 μm), a PI3K inhibitor, blocked PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by greater than 80% (Fig. 1C), indicating that activation of Akt is mediated through a PI3K-dependent pathway as shown by other workers (28Jung F. Haendeler J. Goebel C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test the role of Ras as an upstream activator of Akt, we determined Akt activation in VSMC stably expressing H-Ras (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In two independent clones, basal phospho-Akt levels were not significantly elevated compared with control cells (Fig. 1D), and PDGF but not AVP was still able to activate Akt. These data indicate that PDGF-induced stimulation of Akt is likely mediated directly through the PDGF receptor and does not require Ras. Class IA PI3K, which is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases, consists of a heterodimer of a regulatory 85-kDa and a catalytic 110-kDa subunit (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To examine specific activation of this form, extracts from control or stimulated VSMC were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity measured in the immunoprecipitates (see “Materials and Methods”). PDGF-induced formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by p110α was apparent by 5 min of stimulation and the response was still sustained after 1 h of stimulation (Fig. 2A). AVP did not stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate formation by p110α at any time points that were tested. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against p110β showed constitutive PI3K activity, with no significant changes in response to either PDGF or AVP stimulation (Fig. 2B). Class IB PI3K consists of a dimer of a 101-kDa regulatory subunit and a p110γ catalytic subunit (p101/p110γ). To assess regulation of this form, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p101. Stimulation of cells by either PDGF or AVP caused a delayed increase in activity, which was only observed after 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 2C). Thus, although multiple forms of PI3K may be active in VSMC, the selectivity of p85/p110α for PDGF and the kinetics of activation suggest that p85/p110α mediates the activation of Akt by PDGF in VSMC. Activation of p85/p110α PI3K Mediates Suppression of SM-α-Actin Expression—To establish the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway on SM-specific gene expression, we examined the ability of the PI3K inhibitor to modulate the effects of PDGF on SM-α-actin promoter activity. Consistent with our earlier studies, PDGF suppressed SM-α-actin promoter activity, and this was blocked by exposure of the cells to 10 μm LY 294002 (Fig. 3A). Changes in protein expression were determined by immunoblotting with a specific SM-α-actin antibody. PDGF decreased expression of SM-α-actin, and exposure to LY 294002 almost completely reversed this inhibition (Fig. 3B). Conversely, VSMC were transiently co-transfected with a gain-of-function, myristoylated form of p110α (myr-p110α), along with the SM-α-actin promoter. Expression of myr-p110α reduced both basal and AVP-stimulated increases in promoter activity (Fig. 3C), implicating p85/p110α PI3K in the suppressive pathway regulated by PDGF. The addition of PDGF caused a further suppression of promoter activity, suggesting the involvement of additional pathways. Akt Mediates Suppression of SM Gene Expression—To assess the role of Akt as a downstream effector of PDGF-induced PI3K activity in the regulation of SM-specific gene expression, VSMC were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding an activated form of Akt in which the c-Src myristoylation signal is fused to the N terminus of the c-Akt sequence (myr-Akt) (25Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), leading to enhanced association of the protein kinase with the plasma membrane and constitutive activation. Co-transfection of myr-Akt with the SM-α-actin promoter had minimal effects on basal promoter activities but markedly inhibited the induction by AVP (Fig. 4A). We examined the effects of Akt on another SM marker, SM22α, using a 505-bp region of the SM22α promoter (29Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). AVP increased SM22α promoter activity 4–6-fold, and this was suppressed by PDGF. Expression of myr-Akt inhibited AVP induction of SM22α promoter activity to a similar extent as with the SM-α-actin promoter (Fig. 4B). The effects of Akt on SM protein expression were confirmed by stable expression of myr-Akt using retroviral-mediated gene transfer (see “Materials and Methods”). G418-resistant clones were screened for expression of Akt. Of nine clones screened, one clone showing the highest level of expression (Clone 9) and another showing more modest expression (Clone 2) were selected for further characterization. All transfected cells had normal morphology by phase contrast (data not shown). myr-Akt9 showed constitutively high levels of phospho-Akt compared with cells stably transfected with empty vector (Neo Control 10), and this was not significantly increased by PDGF stimulation (Fig. 5A). Clone 2 also showed constitutive increases in basal phospho-Akt, but PDGF stimulation resulted in a further increase. Levels of SM-α-actin and SM22α protein were determined by immunoblotting following exposure to either AVP or PDGF. In Neo controls, AVP increased expression of both SM-α-actin and SM22α, whereas PDGF suppressed expression (Fig. 5B), similar to what has been observed in wild-type cells. In both clones expressing myr-Akt, basal expression of both proteins was decreased. AVP induction was blunted in Clone 2, which had moderate levels of overexpression. In Clone 9, which had the highest expression levels, AVP failed to increase SM22α expression and in some experiments inhibited SM-α-actin expression. PDGF inhibited expression in both clones. Consistent with the results obtained with transient co-transfections with myr-Akt, the AVP-mediated increase in SM-α-actin and SM22α promoter activity was also blocked in cells stably expressing myr-Akt (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Effects of stable expression of myr-Akt on SM promoter activity. VSMC stably expressing myr-Akt (Clones 2 and 9) or cells stably transfected with control vector (Clone 10) were transiently transfected with SM-α-actin promoter (A) or SM22α promoter (B) coupled to luciferase reporter.

https://openalex.org/W1995737222,"Mutations in the potassium channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) have been linked to the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), a cardiac disease associated with an increased preponderance of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. The COOH terminus of HERG harbors a large number of LQTS mutations and its removal prevents functional expression for reasons that remain unknown. In this study, we show that the COOH terminus of HERG is required for normal trafficking of the ion channel. We have identified a region critical for trafficking between residues 860 and 899 that includes a novel missense mutation at amino acid 861 (HERGN861I). Truncations or deletion of residues 860–899, characterized in six different expression systems including a cardiac cell line, resulted in decreased expression levels and an absence of the mature glycosylated form of the HERG protein. Deletion of this region did not interfere with the formation of tetramers but caused retention of the assembled ion channels within the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, removal of residues 860–899 resulted in the absence of the ion channels from the cell surface and a more rapid turnover rate than the wild type channels, which was evident very early in biogenesis. This study reveals a novel role of the COOH terminus in the normal biogenesis of HERG channels and suggests defective trafficking as a common mechanism for abnormal channel function resulting from mutations of critical COOH-terminal residues, including the LQTS mutant HERGN861I.

As a consequence, these molecules are prevented from journeying through the secretory pathway and are not deployed to the plasma membrane.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1291-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), surface delivery (16Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 5: 492-498Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and ER export (17Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We undertook the current study to investigate the role of the COOH terminus in the biogenesis of HERG and to explore possible mechanisms implicated in LQTS. The results demonstrate the importance of the COOH terminus in normal maturation of HERG channels and identify residues 860–899 as a critical region for trafficking. By exploiting the differential migration pattern of mature and immature HERG species on immunoblots, we demonstrate that this region is indispensable for HERG exit from the ER and hence the maturation and stability of the channel protein. The resulting defective trafficking of HERG mutants, including premature terminations and a novel point mutation, explains the absence of functional channels from the cell surface. Therefore, we propose abnormal trafficking as a common LQTS mechanism associated with a subset of mutations in the COOH terminus of HERG. Common Reagents and Methods—All constructs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based eukaryotic expression vectors and purified using the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen). PCR purification and gel extractions were done using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). To ensure the fidelity of PCR products, amplifications were performed using a proofreading enzyme (Vent DNA Polymerase, New England Biolabs). Restriction enzymes and primers were purchased form New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis based sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University). Wild Type Constructs—Myc and HA tag wild type HERG (HERGwt) were generated using vectors that allow the addition of the tag to the amino terminus of the target protein. Briefly, HERG cDNA was amplified using 5′ and 3′ primers with BamHI and EcoRI recognition sequences, respectively. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and subcloned in-frame into the Myc fusion vector pCMV-Tag 3 (Stratagene). HA-HERGwt was generated by amplifying HERG using EcoRI sites for both forward and reverse primers followed by an in-frame ligation into the pHA-CMV (Clontech). Nomenclature and Generation of Mutant Variants—Truncations are named according to the last residue truncated; e.g. in HERG814 all residues downstream of amino acid 814 were removed. Deletions were numbered according to the residues that were deleted; e.g. in HERGΔ860–899 residues between 860 and 899 were removed. To eliminate undesirable mutations associated with long PCR fragments, a cDNA cassette comprising the entire COOH terminus of HERG (HERG-C) was created by excising the BglII fragment from HAHERGwt and ligating it back into pHA-CMV. All truncation constructs were made by amplifying the HERG-C template using a single forward primer and an appropriate reverse primer containing a BglII restriction site. The amplified products were then digested with BglII and religated into BglII-digested HA-tagged HERGwt. Deletion and point mutations were engineered using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and HERG-C as the PCR template. Myc- and HA-tagged mutant constructs were interchanged either by a single XhoI digest or an XhoI and SalI double digest followed by religation into Mycor HA-tagged HERGwt. Cell Culture and Transfection—All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless indicated otherwise. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PC-12 and M2 cells were maintained in RPMI (supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum), respectively. HL-1 mouse cardiac muscle cells (a generous gift from Dr. William Claycomb, Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA) were grown on gelatin/fibronectin-coated dishes and maintained in “Claycomb medium” (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 10 μm norepinephrine (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. To avoid clonal variations, all experiments were performed in transient heterologous expression systems. Transfections were done with LipofectAMINE 2000 (HL-1 and PC-12) or LipofectAMINE (M2 and HEK293). Amounts of plasmid DNA and lipid reagent were chosen to ensure low levels of transfection (Fig. 1). HEK cells were not used beyond 30 passages. Cell Lysis and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells growing on 12-well dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS and left on ice in 175 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 75 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After 15 min, cells were harvested and disrupted by passage through a medium sized pipette tip 20 times and left on ice for another 15 min. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and the pellet fractions were resuspended in 2× sample buffer. Protein concentration was determined using a detergent compatible assay (Bio-Rad). Freshly prepared samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (unless otherwise indicated) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk and incubated with monoclonal anti-HA/Myc/CASK (Babco) or polyclonal anti-HERG/GFP (Chemicon and Clontech, respectively). After extensive washes, membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) and visualized on x-ray films by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). All immunoblots were performed with anti-HA antibody unless otherwise indicated. Surface Limited Proteolysis—The protocol for detection of surface membrane proteins based on their sensitivity to proteolysis has been previously described (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, live unpermeabilized cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and incubated in PK buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) with or without 20 μg/ml proteinase K (BioShop, McGill University) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were harvested in ice-cold PK blocking buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 25 mm EDTA, 20 mm Pefablock SC (Roche Diagnostics) and washed 4 times with PBS containing 25 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Glycosidase Treatment—The detergent-soluble fraction of transfected cells was analyzed for endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and N-glycosidase F (PNGase) (New England Biolabs) sensitivity as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Treatments were performed at 37 °C for 24–30 h and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Pulse-Chase Metabolic Labeling—Transfected cells were washed two times with PBS and starved for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine in the presence of 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then metabolically labeled in the same medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h or at the indicated pulse intervals. The medium was then removed, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine, and chased in the same medium for different time intervals. Cells were lysed, as described, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Cell lysates were subjected to high speed centrifugation (150,000 × g, 45 min) and 500 μl of the supernatant was layered on top of a 5–40% continuous sucrose density gradient. Molecular weight protein standards (alcohol dehydrogenase and thyroglobulin, 150 and 669 kDa, respectively) were layered on a separate sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 220,0000 × g (4 °C) and fractions were collected from the top of the gradient using an Auto-Densi Flow automatic device (Buchler Instruments). Fractions were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. To visualize the molecular weight protein standards SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunolocalization—HEK293 cells transfected on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips were fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum (Invitrogen) and then incubated with blocking solution containing monoclonal/polyclonal anti-HA/Myc for 1 h. The coverslips were washed extensively and incubated in PBS containing Oregon Green/Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes, respectively) for 45 min. After extensive washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Immuno-Floure Mounting Media (ICN Biomedicals). Images were analyzed by a Bio-Rad Microradiance confocal laser scanning microscopy mounted on a Zeiss 200M inverted microscope. Electrophysiological Recordings—Cells were cotransfected with the plasmids indicated in Fig. 5 and the surface antigen CD8 plasmid. Transfected cells were selected using immunomagnetic Dynabeads (Dynal) pre-coated with a monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody. To obtain an estimate of selection efficiency, sister cells transfected with HERGwt were always recorded prior to analysis of mutant variants. Selection efficiency varied between 70 and 90%. The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record membrane currents from M2 cells using an Axopatch amplifier (as described in Ref. 18Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM35) at room temperature. Patch clamp electrodes were filled with medium containing (mm): 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2). The external medium contained (mm): 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4). A two-step voltage clamp protocol was imposed from a holding potential of –80 mV to assess the presence of the HERG current. The first step, which served to activate HERG currents, consisted of a 4-s depolarizing pulse to potentials between –60 and +50 mV in increments of 10 mV. To assess HERG tail currents, at the end of the first step the membrane was repolarized back to –60 mV for 2 s before returning to the –80 mV holding potential. Cell capacitance was estimated by analog measurements using the patch clamp amplifier. Graphics and statistical analysis were carried out using Origin software (Microcal). Immunoblot Quantification and Statistical Analysis—Digital images were quantified using an Alpha Innotech imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Bands were selected as objects and the average pixel values were recorded. Quantifications are presented as arbitrary units normalized to loading (for proteinase K experiments) or loading and transfection efficiency (for wild type and mutant variants expression level). Mean ± S.E. from independent experiments were calculated and statistical significance of the observed differences was determined using the Student's t test. * indicates p < 0.05. HERGwt Glycosylation and Expression—Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with HERGwt reveals two bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼135 and 155 kDa, corresponding to the core and complex-glycosylated forms of HERG, respectively (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a both bands are sensitive to N-glycosidase F, indicating that they both contain N-linked glycan chains. Fig. 1a also shows that only the faster migrating band was sensitive to EndoH treatment indicating that this band represents the immature high-mannose core-glycosylated form. The more slowly migrating EndoH-insensitive band represents the mature glycosylated species produced in the Golgi complex. Before questions related to biogenesis could be addressed, it was first necessary to select a careful transfection method that would prevent the escape of improperly folded molecules from the ER. Fig. 1b demonstrates that the core and complex-glycosylated species are differentially partitioned in an expression-dependent fashion between detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. At low expression levels, HERGwt showed two predominant bands in the detergent-soluble fraction but only a relatively faint core-glycosylated band in the detergent-insoluble fraction. In contrast, at high expression levels, there was a substantial increase in the abundance of the detergent-insoluble core-glycosylated species. These data suggests that at high expression levels the capacity of the ER to process immature HERGwt is overwhelmed resulting in the impairment of the 26 S proteasome and formation of insoluble aggregates (19Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). To test this possibility cells expressing low levels of HERGwt were exposed to the 26 S proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. The result shown in Fig. 1b (last lane), is a substantial increase in the detergent-insoluble core-glycosylated fraction without any change in the amount of the soluble fraction (not shown). This result is consistent with the idea that high expression levels result in the impairment of the 26 S proteasome. To avoid associated artifacts, all experiments were performed using the low expression approach and HEK cells were not used beyond 30 passages. HERG COOH-terminal Removal Impairs Maturation—Using immunoblot analysis we observed that the removal of the COOH-terminal tail of HERG, which starts at residue 814 (3Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) (HERG814), results in a shift in the molecular weight of the recombinant protein and the complete abolition of the mature complex-glycosylated band (Fig. 2a). This suggests that HERG814 failed to exit the ER and transit through the Golgi complex. To corroborate this point we examined the steady-state localization of HERGwt and HERG814. Fig. 2b shows confocal images of cells co-transfected with HA- and Myctagged HERGwt or with HA- and Myc-tagged HERG814. HERGwt displays punctate staining distributed throughout the cell and, as expected for heterologous expression systems, a fraction of HERGwt is also present as perinuclear staining. With the HERG814 mutant, a fainter and exclusively circumscribed perinuclear pattern of staining was observed, consistent with the faint band seen in immunoblots (note the loading amounts in Fig. 2a). To ensure that the immunoreactive band of HERG814 is indeed the immature species produced and retained in the ER, we evaluated its sensitivity to glycosidase digest. As shown in Fig. 2c, both PNGase and EndoH produced a shift in the apparent molecular mass of this band suggesting that HERG814 has a high mannose N-linked glycan of the type acquired in the ER. Together with immunolocalization experiments, these data suggest that HERG814 was prevented from advancing beyond the ER into the secretory pathway and that the COOH terminus of HERG is an important determinant of the channel protein maturation. HERG Δ 860–899 Disrupts a Trafficking Element—To determine the region of the HERG-C that is necessary for its maturation, we analyzed the biochemical phenotypes of a series of progressively larger COOH-terminal truncations (Fig. 3a). The immunoblot analysis in Fig. 3b demonstrates that truncation mutants with more than 899 residues expressed normal amounts of the immature and mature glycosylated forms of HERG. Conversely, mutants with less than 860 residues were lacking complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 3b) and showed reduced levels of expression (Fig. 3d). This suggests that these mutants failed to exit the ER and were more rapidly degraded. To eliminate the remote possibility that downstream signals within HERG-C may restore the differential migration pattern of HERG899 and HERG860, we deleted these residues (HERGΔ860–899) in an otherwise intact HERG-C. As indicated in Fig. 3c, HERGΔ860–899 was unable to acquire complex oligosaccharides and showed a significant decrease in expression levels (Fig. 3d). Equal loading and transfection efficiency were verified by CASK and GFP immunoblotting. Because HERG is normally expressed in cardiac myocytes, maturation of the HERG mutants might be facilitated by unidentified components unique to cardiac cells. To test this possibility, we undertook studies using a mouse cardiac cell line (HL-1) that has been shown to express delayed rectifier currents, ostensibly encoded by HERG (20Claycomb W.C. Lanson N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Izzo N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). We confirmed the endogenous expression of HERG in these cells by immunoblot analysis conducted with an anti-HERG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4a (first lane) the antibody identifies an intense band at ∼155 kDa and a fainter band at ∼135 kDa (see longer exposure). We found that transfection of HA-tagged HERGwt into HL-1 cells increased the intensity of both bands (Fig. 4a, second lane), confirming that endogenous immunoreactive species are indeed HERG species. Fig. 4b shows that HERGΔ860–899 transfected into HL-1 cells failed to acquire mature oligosaccharides suggesting that this mutant cannot be rescued by an unknown cardiac component. In support of this contention, we found that coexpression of HERGΔ860–899 with HERGwt or MiRP, a putative subunit of HERG (21Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar), in HEK cells did not rescue mutant HERG (not shown). Similarly, HERGΔ860–899 failed to acquire complex glycosylation in four other cell lines tested (examples are shown for PC12 and M2 cells in Fig. 4c and insets of Fig. 5a, respectively). Taken together, these results suggest that a COOH-terminal element comprising residues 860–899 plays a fundamental role in ER exit of HERG and its journey through the intracellular compartments of the secretory pathway. HERG Δ 860–899 Tetramers Are Absent from the Cell Surface—To investigate the impact of the 860–899 deletion on the functional properties of HERG mutants the whole cell patch clamp technique was used. Membrane currents were recorded from M2 cells, a mouse melanoma cell line that is readily amenable to patch clamp experiments. Fig. 5a shows current traces recorded during a series of depolarizing voltage clamp steps from a –80 mV holding potential as well as the tail currents observed upon repolarization to –60 mV at the end of the step. The current traces in Fig. 5a and the current-voltage (IV) relationship in Fig. 5b, obtained from cells transfected with HERGwt or HERG899, reflect a prominent expression of functional HERG currents. In contrast, the time-dependent currents were completely absent in cells transfected with HERG860 or HERGΔ860–899 (Fig. 5a), and in untransfected control cells (not shown). To determine whether this was the result of a defect in tetrameric channel assembly we compared the fractional distribution of HERGwt and HERGΔ860–899 in a nondenaturing continuous sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 5c, the fractional distribution of the wild type and mutant channels were similar and the associated sedimentation profiles (Fig. 5d) show a single peak that corresponds closely to the apparent molecular masses of the tetrameric channel (∼540 kDa); the slight shift between HERGwt and HERGΔ860–899 may be because of a difference in their molecular masses. Artificial protein aggregation causing similar sedimentation profiles is unlikely because the bulk of endogenous HERG (HERGNative) appears in the same fraction as the recombinant protein (Fig. 5c). The lack of functional currents observed following transfection with HERG860 and HERGΔ860–899 is most likely because of the absence of recombinant proteins from the plasma membrane. To test this possibility live and nonpermeablized cells were treated with proteinase K, which is known to cleave extracellular exposed ectodomains (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Campomanes C.R. Carroll K.I. Manganas L.N. Hershberger M.E. Gong B. Antonucci D.E. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8298-8305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To ensure that the proteinase K cleavage is surface limited, all immunoblots were stripped and reprobed for an endogenous intracellular protein, CASK. As indicated in Fig. 6a, exposure of cells transfected with HERGwt to the proteinase K resulted in the complete disappearance of the mature immunoreactive species and the appearance of a degradation product of ∼62 kDa. In contrast, HERG860 and HERGΔ860–899 were found to be completely insensitive to proteinase K proteolysis (Fig. 6, a and b) suggesting a total absence of these mutants from the cell surface. As expected, HERG899 mutant, which displays significant time-dependent currents, was highly sensitive to proteinase K treatment, with about half of the protein present at the cell surface (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these data indicate that the lack of currents associated with HERGΔ860–899 is because of the absence of channels from the cell surface. ER Retention Phenotypes Associated with HERG Δ 860–899 and HERGN861I—The subcellular distribution of HERG mutants was investigated using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7a, a punctate staining pattern was detected"
https://openalex.org/W1998458733,"An analysis of apoplastic extensin cross-linking activity in vegetative organs of Lupinus albus indicated that leaves contained the highest specific activity. Assays of peroxidases fractionated from this material demonstrated that this activity could be largely attributed to a soluble and apoplastic 51-kDa peroxidase, denoted LEP1. Relative to other purified peroxidases, LEP1 demonstrates high extensin cross-linking activity and can be classified as an extensin peroxidase (EP). Optimal conditions for the in vitro oxidation of other phenolic substrates included 1.5–3.0 mm peroxide at pH 5.0. EP activity of LEP1 was low under these conditions but optimal and substantially higher with 100 μm peroxide and neutral pH, suggesting that physiological changes in pH and peroxide in muro could heavily influence the extensin cross-linking activity of LEP1 in vivo. Analysis of LEP1 glycans indicated 11–12 N-linked glycans, predominantly the heptasaccharide Man3XylFucGlcNAc2, but also larger structures showing substantial heterogeneity. Comparative assays with horseradish peroxidase isoform C and peanut peroxidases suggested the high level of glycosylation in LEP1 may be responsible for the high solubility of this EP in the apoplastic space. A full-length cDNA corresponding to LEP1 was cloned. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated LEP1 induction in apical portions of etiolated hypocotyls 30–60 min after exposure to white light, prior to the onset of growth inhibition. Comparative modeling of the translated sequence indicated an unusually unobstructed equatorial cleft across the substrate access channel, which might facilitate interaction with extensin and confer higher EP activity.

Extensin is a structural protein belonging to the family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRGPs, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins; EP, extensin peroxidase; SAC, substrate access channel; HRP-C, horseradish peroxidase isoform C; Px, peroxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PDB, protein data bank; PNP, peanut peroxidase; SBP, soybean seedcoat peroxidase; Hyp, hydroxyproline; LEP1, lupin extensin peroxidase 1; CTPP, C-terminal propeptide. and a major component of dicot cell walls. This extracellular protein is typically 60–90 kDa, consisting largely of repeated sequences containing Ser (Hyp)4–6 motifs flanked by short stretches rich in Lys, Tyr, and His. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the extensin polypeptide is in a polyproline (II) conformation (1Cooper J.B. Chen J.A. Van Holst G. Varner J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 24-27Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and scanning electron microscopy of extensins has demonstrated an extended rod-like shape up to 100 nm in length (1Cooper J.B. Chen J.A. Van Holst G. Varner J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 24-27Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Brownleader M. Byron O. Rowe A. Trevan M. Welham K. Dey P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that individual extensin molecules could span across cellulose microfibrils, which have been measured to be spaced 20–40 nm apart in primary cell walls (3McCann M. Wells B. Roberts K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 323-334Google Scholar). Secreted extensin is covalently cross-linked to form an extensin network that intercalates with the cellulose-pectin networks. It is further associated with the cell wall structure through ionic links with acidic pectins. A covalent link between extensin and pectin has also been reported (4Qi X. Behrens B.X. West P.R. Mort J.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

Van Holst G. Varner J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 24-27Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Class III peroxidases can oxidize a variety of physiological substrates and, in general, demonstrate little substrate specificity, making it difficult to attribute a specific function to individual peroxidases in vivo. The low substrate specificity of peroxidases with small aromatic substrates can be related to the wide open substrate access channel (SAC) and the absence of substrate-specific docking sites. Crystallographic studies of an HRP-C-ferulic acid complex demonstrated that this natural aromatic substrate binds proximal to the exposed heme C18-methyl, where it forms hydrogen bonds with the catalytic Arg-38 (19Henriksen A. Smith A. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35005-35011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although not natural substrates, bound benzhydroxamic acid (20Henriksen A. Schuller D. Meno K. Welinder K. Smith A. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and Tris (21Henriksen A. Mirza O. Indiani C. Teilum K. Smulevich G. Welinder K. Gajhede M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) can also be located at this site. The coordination of small aromatic substrates to this site within the open SAC appears to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions of the substrate with hydrophobic residues of the channel. Site-directed mutagenesis of HRP-C has demonstrated that Phe-179 is critical for efficient complex formation with small, aromatic substrates (22Veitch N. Gao Y. Smith A. White C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14751-14761Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the coordination of large macromolecules such as extensin to within the required distance from the substrate-binding site might impose additional structural restraints in areas bordering or further removed from the SAC. Several studies have demonstrated that the capacity to efficiently cross-link extensin is not a property of class III peroxidases in general but is limited to particular peroxidases, referred to as extensin peroxidases (EPs) (8Jackson P. Paulo S. Brownleader M.D. Freire P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 313-326Google Scholar, 23Everdeen D.S. Kiefer S. Willard J.J. Muldoon E.P. Dey P.M. Li X. Lamport D.T.A.

Pereira C. Fortunato A. Soares N. Amβncio S. Ricardo C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although these peroxidases may be capable of oxidizing other phenolic substrates in vitro (24Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to assume that EPs, rather than other class III peroxidases, are responsible for the catalysis of essential extensin deposition in vivo. Only a few EPs have been purified to date (8Jackson P. Paulo S. Brownleader M.D. Freire P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 313-326Google Scholar, 24Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and they remain to be characterized in depth. In previous work we described LEP1, an EP in lupin which is associated with white light inhibition of etiolated hypocotyl growth (8Jackson P. Paulo S. Brownleader M.D. Freire P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 313-326Google Scholar). This same peroxidase also appears to play a part in defensive responses to fungal infection and UV irradiation (28Jackson P. Paulo S. Ricardo C.P.P. Obinger C. Burner U. Ebermann R. Penel C. Greppin H. Plant Peroxidases, Biochemistry and Physiology. Université de Genève Press, Vienna, Austria1996: 255-258Google Scholar). In this report we present the purification and characterization of this peroxidase as well as the first primary structure of an EP. Comparative modeling was utilized to predict the three-dimensional structure of LEP1, and we discuss structural aspects that could be related with its high capacity for extensin cross-linking. Preparation of Lupin Tissue and Organ Infiltrates—Fifteen-day-old lupin plantlets were grown in the light or dark as described previously (29Jackson P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 261-269Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Roots and etiolated and light-grown hypocotyl segments were obtained from the apical 3 cm of organs after removal of the apical meristem. Leaves of 2–3 cm were utilized. Shoot apical meristems were isolated by defoliation of the meristem under a bifocal microscope and isolation of the apical 1–2 mm. The apical 1–2 mm of roots provided the source of root apical meristems. Where necessary, plant material was sectioned to smaller segments to facilitate subsequent vacuum infiltration. All material was washed in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and, unless stated otherwise, vacuum-infiltrated with the same buffer containing 1 m KCl. Infiltrates were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C through a 0.45-μm ultrafilter (Nalgene, Hereford, UK). Infiltrates were concentrated and equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) by centrifuge ultrafiltration through a 10-kDa membrane (Vivaspin 600, Gloucestershire, UK). The total protein content of infiltrates was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit as per the manufacturers' instructions. Purification of Soluble and Ionically Bound Apoplastic Peroxidases— All stages of peroxidase fractionations were performed at 4 °C. For the purification of soluble, apoplastic peroxidases, 750 g of leaves were homogenized in 2× volume/g (fresh weight) of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and concentration to 20 ml with Diaflow®, using PY10 membranes (Amicon). The soluble extract was then subject to anion exchange chromatography (DE-52, Whatman) in a 10 × 1.6-cm column (XK16, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and the peroxidase-containing fraction (non-binding) eluted in the same buffer. The fraction was then subject to concanavalin-A affinity chromatography in a 2 × 0.5-ml column equilibrated with 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) with 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. Non-glycosylated proteins were eluted with 40 ml of equilibration buffer and the peroxidase-containing fraction in 20 ml of 35 mm α-d-mannopyranoside in equilibration buffer. This fraction was then subject to cation exchange chromatography (Mono-S, Amersham Biosciences) in a 0.5 × 1.0-cm column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5). After washing with 10 ml of acetate buffer, two minor peroxidase fractions (Px 60 kDa and Px 55 kDa) were eluted with 15 mm NaCl. The major peroxidase fraction (Px 51 kDa, also referred to as LEP1 in the text) was eluted within a 15–60 mm NaCl gradient over 20 ml. For the isolation of Px9.7, leaf cell walls were purified from 100 g (fresh weight) of leaves as described previously (30Jackson P. Ricardo C.P.P. Planta. 1994; 194: 311-317Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and extracted with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) containing 1 m KCl. The extract was clarified by vacuum-assisted ultrafiltration through 0.45-μm filters (Sartorius) and equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and concentrated to 4 ml with Diaflow®, using PY10 membranes (Amicon). The concentrate was loaded onto a 5-ml SP-Sepharose column (Hi-Trap, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 15 ml of equilibration buffer, a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient was applied at 2 ml min–1 over 25 min. Px9.7 was eluted at 60–80 mm NaCl. Px5.2 was isolated as described previously (8Jackson P. Paulo S. Brownleader M.D. Freire P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 313-326Google Scholar). In all case, column eluates were monitored for protein (A 280). Peroxidase content in column eluates was detected by the standard guaiacol assay. The purity of peroxidase preparations was determined in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.2) by UV-visible spectroscopy using the RZ ratio, A 403/A 275, and quantified from the heme concentration using ϵ403 = 100 mm–1 cm–1 (31Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay of EP Activity and Kinetic Studies of LEP1—The extensin cross-linking assay was essentially performed as described previously (27Jackson P. Galinha C. Pereira C. Fortunato A. Soares N. Amβncio S. Ricardo C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Assays of EP activities in aqueous or saline infiltrates used 25 μg of extracted protein, 60 μg of grapevine extensin, and 4 h of incubation at 30 °C. Assays of fractionated or pure peroxidases utilized 5 pmol of each peroxidase, incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Kinetic studies with pure LEP1 (0.01 μg after Mono-S) utilized a UV-visible DU-70 (Beckman Instruments) spectrophotometer. The apparent Km and V max values for guaiacol, coniferyl alcohol, ferulic acid, and ascorbate were determined in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5) with 5 mm H2O2. For indole-3-acetic acid, assays were conducted according to Ref. 32Ferrer M. Pedreño M. Muñoz R. Barceló A. J. Plant Growth Regul. 1991; 10: 139-146Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar. For the calculation of Km and V max values of LEP1 for H2O2, 20 mm guaiacol was used. Extinction coefficient values (ϵ) for the different substrates are as follows: guaiacol ϵ470 = 26.6 × 103 mm–1 cm–1 (30Jackson P. Ricardo C.P.P. Planta. 1994; 194: 311-317Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar); coniferyl alcohol ϵ260 = 7.5 mm–1 cm–1 (33Takahama U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 809-817Google Scholar); ascorbate ϵ265 = 11.25 mm–1 cm–1 (33Takahama U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 809-817Google Scholar); indole-3-acetic acid ϵ250 = 18.7 mm–1 cm–1 (32Ferrer M. Pedreño M. Muñoz R. Barceló A. J. Plant Growth Regul. 1991; 10: 139-146Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient for ferulic acid was estimated in our laboratory as ϵ320 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1. Apparent Km and V max values were calculated by a hyperbolic regression analysis program (Hyper.exe Version 1.1s, 1996). Glycosylation of LEP1—The glycans were released from 8.5 nmol of LEP1 by hydrazinolysis, labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, and separated by gel filtration as described previously (34Costa J. Ashford D.A. Nimtz M. Bento I. Frazão C. Esteves C.L. Faro C. Kervinen J. Pires E. Verissimo P. Wlowader A. Carrondo M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). LEP1 glycans were quantified relative to 2 nmol of N,N′-diacetylchitobiose added as an internal standard immediately after the hydrazinolysis reaction. The number of glycans per mol of LEP1 was calculated after correcting for glycan yield by reference to HRP-C (8 glycans/mol) (35Welinder K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 96 (502): 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) which was analyzed in an identical parallel experiment. RNA Isolation and PCR Amplification of LEP1 cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from Lupinus albus leaves using the RNeasy system from Qiagen according to the supplier's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis utilized 2 μg of total RNA incubated at 42 °C for 1 h with Superscript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the oligonucleotide PoxS3 (5′-CACAGTAGCAACAAGTCGGATCCGACC(T)18(A/G/C)(A/G/C/T)-3′). Subsequent PCR utilized 2 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction in 50 μl of 1× Taq buffer (Amersham Biosciences) containing 10 pmol each of the primers PoxS4 (5′-GTCGAATTCCA(C/T)TT(C/T)CAIGA(C/T)TGITT(C/T)G-3′; where I is inosine) and PoxS2 (5′-CACAGTAGCAACAAGTCGGATCCGACCT-3′), 0.1 mm dNTPs, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). PCR conditions employed an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 31 cycles with a 1-min denaturing step at 94 °C and a 2-min elongation step at 72 °C. The annealing temperatures were 52 °C for 3 cycles, 50 °C for 3 cycles, and 56 °C for the remaining 25. A final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min was included. Selected PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. The remaining 5′ region LEP1 cDNA was obtained by 5′-RACE using the RACE kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 5′-RACE was performed by means of nested PCR using LEP1-specific PoxS8 (5′-GGTGAGATTTTGAACAGCAAAAGCAGATTTAAGTTGG-3′) and the abridged anchor and abridged universal anchor primers supplied with the kit. Following an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C were run. The final extension step at 72 °C was carried out for 10 min. The 5′-RACE product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector and sequenced. Quantitative RT-PCR—To quantify lep1 gene transcripts, an RT-PCR protocol was performed on total RNA extracts of 10-day-old etiolated plants exposed to white light for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 12, or 24 h. Segments of 1 cm length were taken from hypocotyls just below the apical meristem and RNA isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). As a control, RT-PCRs were also carried out for hemoglobin (Hb) using primers Hb-F (5′-CCTTGATCATAGAAGC-3′) and Hb-R (5′-CCAGCTG-GTTGTAGGC-3′). Following the RT reaction as described above, PCR mixtures (50 μl) were prepared containing 2 μl of cDNA, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase and buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 200 μm dNTPs, and 10 μmol of the LEP1-specific primers PoxS6 (5′-CTTGAATTCCTAGCTG-TAGTGTACCAAGTACAAACATTATCTACC-3′) and PoxS7 (5′-ACACTTCGTACAATATGTCCTAATGGTGGAGCAGG-3′). The PCR temperature program was 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles with a final 5-min extension at 72 °C. Aliquots (5 μl) were taken every five cycles for each reaction. The reaction conditions for Hb were the same with the exception that the annealing temperature was 40 °C. Following amplification, aliquots of each PCR product were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were visualized with UV light and photographed. Molecular Modeling of LEP1—The structures of the class III peroxidases PNP (PDB code 1sch (36Schuller D.J. Nenad B. van Huystee R.B. McPherson A. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar)), HRP-C (PDB code 1atj (37Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4 (38): 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar)), Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidase A2 (PDB code 1pa2 (38Østergaard L. Telium K. Mirza O. Mattsson O. Petersen M. Welinder K. Mundy J. Gajhede M. Henriksen A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), A. thaliana neutral peroxidase (PDB code 1qgj (39Mirza O. Henriksen A. Ostergaard L. Welinder K.G. Gajhede M. Acta Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), and SBP (PDB code 1fhf (21Henriksen A. Mirza O. Indiani C. Teilum K. Smulevich G. Welinder K. Gajhede M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) were used to derive the structure of LEP1 by comparative modeling techniques using the program Modeler version 4 (40Sali A. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures were superimposed (using a 4.0-Å equivalence radius) to generate a sequence alignment that reflected the equivalence of residues in the structure. The LEP1 sequence was additionally aligned with several plant peroxidases with high homology to LEP1, and the resulting profile was aligned with the structural alignment of the x-ray structures. This additional procedure helped produce a less ambiguous alignment because it made the final result less dependent on particular point mutations in LEP1. The alignment was manually corrected in selected places and used to derive structural models. The models contained the heme group, the catalytic water molecule, two calcium ions, and the complete polypeptide chain, except the C-terminal 23 residues (from Asp-304 to Tyr-327) that are not homologous with any of the available structures. The four conserved disulfide bridges were modeled explicitly. An initial alignment was used to generate models that were checked using two criteria: identification of zones displaying restraint violations using Modeler, and several stereochemical and conformational criteria using PROCHECK (41Laskowski A. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The alignment was modified several times in order to correct specific problems, with the generation of new structures each time. In the final cycle, 40 structures were generated and that with the lowest objective function value was chosen as the model of LEP1. The chosen model was further optimized by modeling the loop comprising Gly-112 to Asn-113 to Gly-114 because Asn-113 occupied a generously allowed zone of the Ramachandran plot. The final model had 93.3% of the residues in the most favored regions, 6.7% in additionally allowed regions, and no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. The Distribution of EP Activity in Vegetative Organs of Lupin—The in vitro oligomerization of extensin monomers by EP can be detected by Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography of reaction products (24Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A depicts how pure grapevine EP (27Jackson P. Galinha C. Pereira C. Fortunato A. Soares N. Amβncio S. Ricardo C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) cross-links grapevine extensin completely to higher order multimers that elute in the void volume, whereas monomeric extensin is retained. Substitution of grapevine EP with saline infiltrates from various organs and tissues of L. albus allowed us to test their relative content of apoplastic EP activity. Extracts prepared in this way contain both ionically bound and soluble apoplastic proteins and are free from contamination from intracellular compartments (29Jackson P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 261-269Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, B–G, indicates that EP activity is low or absent in apical meristems, shows minor levels in etiolated hypocotyls, but is considerably higher in roots, hypocotyls, and leaves obtained from photomorphogenic plants. The highest abundance of EP activity and the highest specific activity was observed in leaves. Similar levels of EP activity could also be recovered in aqueous infiltrates (Fig. 1H), indicating the peroxidases responsible are freely soluble constituents of the apoplastic space. Purification of LEP1 from Leaves—Aqueous extracts of leaf homogenates were chosen as an abundant and convenient source for the purification of apoplastic and soluble leaf EP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following concanavalin A-affinity chromatography, the EP-containing fraction consisted largely of two proteins of 51 and 61 kDa (Fig. 2, lane CA). Mono-S chromatography was able to resolve the two major proteins and minor quantities of a diffuse band of 55 kDa (lanes A–C). The UV-visible spectra of all three fractions displayed spectra typical of class III peroxidases, with a Soret peak at 403 nm and additional maxima at 502 and 640 nm. Their RZ values (Table I) also confirmed that these peroxidase fractions had been isolated without significant levels of contaminants. Isoelectric focusing of these peroxidases (data not shown) confirmed that they were basic (pI 8.8) and that all migrated together with the major soluble peroxidase of the apoplast previously referred to as B2 (29Jackson P. Ricardo C.P.P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 261-269Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 42Hernández-Ruiz J. Rodríguez-Lopez J. García-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Arnao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have assayed the extensin cross-linking activity of these soluble peroxidases and of two major ionically bound peroxidases of leaves, Px5.2 and Px9.7 (28Jackson P. Paulo S. Ricardo C.P.P. Obinger C. Burner U. Ebermann R. Penel C. Greppin H. Plant Peroxidases, Biochemistry and Physiology. Université de Genève Press, Vienna, Austria1996: 255-258Google Scholar) (Table I). These assays revealed that 5 pmol of the major 51-kDa peroxidase resulted in near-complete cross-linking of 60 μg of grapevine extensin. This compares well with that observed for a tomato basic EP (24Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and grapevine EP (27Jackson P. Galinha C. Pereira C. Fortunato A. Soares N. Amβncio S. Ricardo C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under these same conditions, the 55-kDa peroxidase cross-linked ∼20% of extensin. The 61-kDa peroxidase, Px 9.7 and Px"

Because most neoplastic cells are resistant to certain apoptotic cues, we reasoned that an early molecular event in carcinogenesis or leukemogenesis might be the inactivation of PKR by expression or activation of intracellular PKR inhibitors. Seeking novel PKR-modulating proteins we report here that nucleophosmin (NPM), a protein frequently overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, binds to PKR, and inhibits its activation. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding experiments showed that NPM associated with PKR. Kinase assays demonstrated that recombinant NPM inhibited PKR activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, purified recombinant NPM was phosphorylated by activated PKR. Most importantly, overexpression of NPM suppressed PKR activity, enhanced protein synthesis, and inhibited apoptosis. Lymphoblasts from patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) expressed low levels of NPM, which correlated with high ground-state activation of PKR and cellular hypersensitivity to apoptotic cues, but enforced expression of NPM in these mutant cells reduced aberrant apoptotic responses. Inhibition of PKR by NPM may be one mechanism by which neoplastic clones evolve in sporadic malignancies and in neoplastic cells arising in the context of the cancer predisposition syndrome, Fanconi anemia.

Sustained cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptotic cues are characteristic features of neoplastic cells.

The functional tumor suppressor activity of PKR derives, at least in part, from its capacity to induce apoptosis. Because of its pro-apoptotic effects, overexpression of PKR in mouse, insect, and yeast cells causes growth inhibition and cell death (2Jagus R. Joshi B. Barber G.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 8Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N.

Indeed, inappropriate activation of PKR has been associated with certain disease states characterized by high level apoptotic activity. For example, activation, in the brain, of PKR and the PKR-like kinase PERK has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (16Peel A.L. Rao R.V.

Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A. Fagerlie S. Rathbun R.K. Faulkner G.R. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taking into account the high prevalence of myeloid leukemia in Fanconi anemia, excessive activation of PKR in hematopoietic stem cells may also serve as a selective force for the emergence of adapted stem cells that have acquired the capacity to suppress PKR activation or expression, a somatic change that might account for clonal evolution and leukemia (21Lensch M.W. Rathbun R.K. Olson S.B. Jones G.R. Bagby Jr., G.C. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we sought to identify factors that bind to and inhibit PKR reasoning that enhanced expression of such factors could represent an early adaptive response of a stem cell in a highly apoptotic environment. We report here that the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM), known to be overexpressed in tumor cells, actively proliferating cells (22Feuerstein N. Chan P.K. Mond J.J. J. Biol.

We find that NPM expression is suppressed in Fanconi anemia cells, increases when these cells are complemented with the proper FA gene, modulates PKR activity in normal cells, and, in gain-of-function analyses, complements the apoptotic phenotype of FA cells. We suggest that the capacity of NPM to suppress PKR activation is one mechanism by which NPM promotes cell proliferation, suppresses apoptosis, and maintains states of transformation. Cell Culture and Treatments—Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from wild-type (PKR+/+) and PKR knockout (PKRo/o) mice (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Normal JY and mutant HSC536N lymphoblasts derived from a Fanconi anemia patient (FA-C) were maintained in RPMI media 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated FCS. HeLa cells and human normal fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and αMEM with 20% FCS, respectively. The factor-dependent myeloid cell line MO7e and chronic myelogenous leukemia line K562 were maintained in various media in accordance to the requirements. MEF were transfected with 100 μg/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences) and lysed 2 h post-transfection. For treatments of lymphoblasts, cells were stimulated with recombinant human IFNγ (10 ng/ml) and TNFα (10 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the indicated time periods followed by immunoprecipitation or flow cytometric analysis. In Vitro dsRNA Binding Assays, NPM Isolation and Microsequencing, and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared in Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1% aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. 500 μl of WCE containing 2 mg of total proteins were mixed with 50 μl of poly(I)·poly(C)-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) beads and rocked at 4 °C for 60 min. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins bound to beads were eluted from the beads by heating the samples at 94 °C for 5 min in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Ponceau S, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. To isolate the 40-kDa protein for sequence analysis, WCE from ∼109 cells were passed through poly(I)·poly(C)-agarose columns. After three washes, the bound proteins were eluted in 6× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride protein transfer and sequencing membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The 40-kDa band was visualized by Ponseau S staining, excised, and subjected to protein microsequencing analysis (Shriners Hospital Peptide Sequencing Core Facility, Portland, OR). For mass spectrometry analysis, whole cell extracts from normal lymphoblasts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal PKR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described below. The immunocomplexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain. The excised protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion. Protein identity following in-gel digestion was determined by atmospheric pressure matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass mass spectrometry (AP-MALDI). Gel digests were purified using 10 μl disposable pipette tips filled at the tip with a single layer of C18 membrane material (Empore, 3M Bioanalytical, St. Paul, MN). Following binding of peptides by drawing the 10-μl digest through the membrane material five times, the sample was washed with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and peptides directly eluted onto a MALDI plate in 1 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Spectra were then collected using an APMALDI source (Mass Technologies, Burtonsville, MD) and LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). 50 microscans were collected in MS mode and used to perform data-dependant MS/MS on the 10 most abundant ions from each sample. Proteins were then identified using Sequest software (ThermoFinnigan) to correlate experimental MS/MS spectra with theoretical MS/MS spectra calculated from peptide sequences in a non-redundant data base of human proteins (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts (1 mg of total protein), prepared in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described above, were precleared with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Where indicated, the extracts were treated with RNase A (300 μg/ml) or DNase I (100 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 °C for 1 h before the preclearing step. After separation of the protein A-Sepharose the extract was incubated with anti-mPKR (a gift from John C. Bell), or anti-NPM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Immunocomplexes were then bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, recovered by centrifugation, and washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, samples were heated in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids—Plasmids used for in vitro transcription-translation were constructed by insertion of the full-length and human PKR or human NPM, amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagen, La Jolla, CA), into the XhoI and BamHI sites of vector pCITE-2a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create pCITE-PKR and pCITE-NPM, respectively. Deleted versions were prepared by performing PCR mutagenesis on pCITE-PKR and pCITE-NPM to give the derivatives pCITE-PKRΔDRBM, pCITE-PKRΔkd, pCITE-PKRLS4, pCITE-NPMΔRBD, and pCITE-NPMΔN. pT7-luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as control. Epitope-tagged PKR or NPM constructs were made by fusing the full-length PKR or NPM in-frame to the 3′-end of a 3×FLAG peptide sequence in the p3XFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma-Aldrich) to create pFLAG-PKR or pFLAG-NPM, respectively. FANCC cDNA was subcloned into the retroviral vector pLXSN as described previously (28Pang Q. Fagerlie S. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Faulkner G. Diaz J. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4724-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged NPM retroviral construct pLXSN-FLAG-NPM was created by insertion of the FLAG-NPM fragment into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pLXSN. Plasmid pEGST-PKR/λPP, which was used to co-express GST-PKR and lambda phosphatase (λ-PPase) in Escherichia coli (29Matsui T. Tanihara K. Date T. Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was obtained from T. Date. GST-NPM was constructed by subcloning the full-length NPM into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. GST-PKR Fusion Protein Purification and in Vitro Binding Assays— Expression and purification of the GST-PKR fusion proteins were performed according to the protocol as described previously (29Matsui T. Tanihara K. Date T. Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For binding, GST-PKR fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with WCE (1 mg of total protein) prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the beads were recovered, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against human PKR and NPM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro Protein Interactions—[35S]methionine-labeled or unlabeled (cold) full-length PKR, NPM, and their truncated derivatives were synthesized in vitro using the TnT wheat-germ coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). All in vitro translated products were treated with RNase A (300 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 1 h before use in binding assays. For binding, 30 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was incubated with equal amounts of cold proteins, as indicated, at 30 °C for 15 min. The mixtures were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKR or anti-NPM antibodies as described above, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The indicated amounts of GST-PKR and GST-NPM, suspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,2mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors including 1% aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), were incubated with or without eIF2α at 30 °C for 10 min. Then 5 μg/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 10 min. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transfection and Transduction—dsRNA transfections were carried out as previously described (20Pang Q. Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A. Fagerlie S. Rathbun R.K. Faulkner G.R. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PKR nullizygous (PKRo/o) MEFs were transiently transfected with the empty vector p3XFLAG-CMV (2 μg), pFLAG-PKR (1 μg), or indicated amounts of pFLAG-NPM, along with a pEGFP plasmid (BD Biosciences CloneTech, Palo Alto, CA) that served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Mock and transfected cells were treated with dsRNA followed by detection for the exogenously expressed proteins, examination of apoptotic morphology, and analyses of the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α and the rates of protein synthesis. The Moloney (pLXSN) retroviral vectors encoding FANCC or NPM were transduced into HSC536N lymphoblasts by a previously described protocol (28Pang Q. Fagerlie S. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Faulkner G. Diaz J. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4724-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sets of isogenic lines were selected for G418 (300 μg/ml) resistance, and subjected to analyses for PKR activity and apoptosis. Analysis of Cell Viability and Apoptosis—Cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion analysis. To quantify apoptotic cells, we used a polyclonal antibody to the active form of caspase 3 in a flow cytometric assay to detect cells in the early stages of apoptosis. The flow cytometric assays were performed by the procedure described elsewhere (20Pang Q. Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A. Fagerlie S. Rathbun R.K. Faulkner G.R. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Vivo 32P and 35S Labeling of Proteins—Cells were starved for 60 min in phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and were treated with 100 μg/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) or combination of IFNγ and TNFα (10 ng/ml each) for the indicated time periods. Labeling was performed in the same medium by addition of [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After labeling for 3 h, whole cell lysates were prepared as described above and were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for mPKR or eIF-2α. [32P]phosphate-incorporated immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Immunoblot analysis was performed on these samples to determine the quantity of PKR or eIF-2α precipitated by the respective antibody. For 35S labeling, 0.5 × 106 MEF were seeded in a 60-mm dish and cultured overnight. Cells were rinsed with methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with dsRNA and IFNγ where indicated. Labeling was again performed in the same medium containing 50 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine-cysteine labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and protein concentration was determined. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Protein synthesis was measured by the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable proteins. Induced NPM Binding to dsRNA Columns in Normal Lymphoblasts—We recently showed that mutant FA-C cells were hypersensitive to IFNγ and dsRNA, that the dsRNA-binding protein kinase PKR was constitutively activated in mutant FA-C cells and that its activation in response to a combination of IFN γ and dsRNA was exaggerated in FA-C cells (20Pang Q. Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A. Fagerlie S. Rathbun R.K. Faulkner G.R. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Seeking to identify cellular factor(s) that might modulate PKR activity in normal hematopoietic cells but not cells with FANCC mutations, we applied dsRNA affinity chromatography assays to normal and FA-C (HSC536N) lymphoblast extracts and obtained one protein of ∼40 kDa that exhibited increased binding to dsRNA in normal lymphoblasts treated with IFNγ and TNFα (Fig. 1A, compare lane 5 with lane 6). While we recovered similar amounts of PKR from whole cell extracts of normal and FA-C lymphoblasts (data not shown), we found that significantly higher amounts of this 40-kDa protein co-eluted with PKR in extracts of normal lymphoblasts than those of FA-C cells (Fig. 1A, compare lane 6 with lane 8). We suspected that this 40-kDa protein might be functionally related to the IFN/TNF hypersensitivity of the mutant FA cells. The 40-kDa band was isolated from a preparative SDS-PAGE. Microsequence analysis revealed that the four peptides derived from proteolytic digestion of the 40-kDa protein were found to be identical to predicted sequences of the nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM) (30Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Franke W.W. Chromosoma. 1988; 96: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with peptide 1 identical to residues 33–42, peptide 2 to residues 213–221, peptide 3 to residues 251–257, and peptide 4 to residues 268–274 (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with these whole lymphoblast extracts using anti-PKR antibody to isolate potential PKR-interacting proteins in hematopoietic cells. As assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-PAGE of anti-PKR immunoprecipitates there were six unique bands (as compared with IgG control), which were then removed from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. NPM was one of the proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with PKR (Fig. 1C). NPM was identified by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of peptides produced from in-gel digestion (Fig. 1C, middle and bottom panels). The 3 major ions in the MS spectra of the peptide digest were selected for MS/MS analysis. The top ranking matches for the MS/MS spectra of the two most intense ions with m/z values of 1819.8 and 1835.7 were for peptide 278–291 of NPM (Xcorr values of 2.14 and 1.5, respectively). Interestingly, among these six potential PKR-interacting proteins, five are involved in protein synthesis. 2S. Vanderwerf, H. Carlson, and G. Bagby, manuscript in preparation. NPM Binds to GST-PKR—To confirm that NPM associated with PKR, we performed an in vitro binding assay with GST-PKR fusion proteins and tested the bound products by immunoblotting using an anti-NPM antibody. Because stimulation of the lymphoblasts with IFNγ and TNFα increased substantially the NPM protein recovered from the dsRNA column, we also asked whether treatment of IFNγ and TNFα might enhance interaction between PKR and NPM. We thus used whole cell lysates from the normal lymphoblasts stimulated with both IFNγ and TNFα in the binding assays. As shown in Fig. 1D, NPM did bind to GST-PKR (top, lanes 5 and 6) but not to GST alone (lanes 3 and 4). Treatments with IFNγ and TNFα only marginally increased the association of NPM with GST-PKR (compare lane 5 with lane 6). Reprobing the blot with antibody to PKR revealed similar amounts of GST-PKR in the binding reactions (Fig. 1D, bottom). Note that there is an additional lower band revealed by anti-PKR antibody in GST-PKR pulldown samples, which runs at approximately the position of endogenous PKR (Fig. 1D, bottom, lanes 5 and 6). We suspected the bacterially expressed GST-PKR could have dimerized with the endogenous PKR in the whole cell extracts of the normal lymphoblasts. We confirmed this by incubating GST-PKR (twice the amount we used in the pull-down) with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and demonstrating the absence of the lower band (lane 7). Association of Endogenous PKR and NPM in MEFs and Human Cell Lines—Given that binding of NPM to dsRNA increased after treatment of normal lymphoblasts with IFNγ and TNFα and that ground state and cytokine induced PKR activation is higher than normal in FA-C lymphoblasts, (Ref. 20Pang Q. Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A. Fagerlie S. Rathbun R.K. Faulkner G.R. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; see below), we reasoned that interaction of NPM with PKR might modulate PKR activation or activity. We first confirmed that NPM and PKR co-immunoprecipitated in lysates of MEF from wild-type (PKR+/+) but not from PKRo/o cells (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Treatment of the cells with dsRNA slightly increased the association of NPM with PKR (compare lane 5 with lane 6). Since NPM binds both RNA and DNA (31Dumbar T.S. Gentry G.A. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9495-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we sought to assure that the NPM-PKR interaction was direct and not dependent upon the presence of nucleic acids by comparing the interaction between NPM and PKR in untreated and RNase- or DNase-treated lysates. The association of these two proteins was influenced by treatment with neither enzyme (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–8). To determine whether the interaction of NPM with PKR occurred in other cell types, we performed coimmunoprecipitation using lysates from HeLa, a normal human foreskin fibroblast line NFF-6, and the myeloid leukemic cell lines MO7e and K562. Association of NPM with PKR could be detected in all these cell types with particularly strong interactions observed in the leukemic cell lines MO7e and K562 cells (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate the specificity of the anti-PKR antibody used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we used purified recombinant GST-PKR and NPM proteins in an anti-PKR immunoprecipitation experiment in which the potential capacity of the anti-PKR antibody to bind to NPM directly has been ruled out. Specifically, the anti-PKR antibody did not precipitate NPM when purified recombinant NPM was incubated with the PKR antibody (Fig. 2D, lane 6), thus excluding the possibility that the PKR antibody interacts with NPM. NPM Interacts with PKR in Vitro—We performed in vitro binding assays using 35S-labeled proteins synthesized in a wheat germ-coupled transcription/translation system. Labeled PKR was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-NPM antibody when unlabeled NPM was present (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Conversely, NPM co-precipitated with PKR using an anti-PKR antibody in the presence of unlabeled PKR (lane 6). Increased amounts of dsRNA did not influence the interaction between the two proteins (lanes 7–9). To test whether dsRNA binding was required for the interaction, RNA binding-defective mutants of both proteins were used. It is known that PKR encodes two dsRNA-binding motifs (DRBM) in its N termin"

Mutations in this gene cause the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes, but the affected pathways are unknown. In a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C-terminal part of the murine Trps1 protein as bait, we obtained three yeast clones encoding two overlapping fragments of the 194 amino acids RING finger protein 4 (Rnf4). The overlap narrows down the Trps1-binding region within Rnf4 to amino acids 6-65. This region in Rnf4 is also known to interact with several proteins including steroid receptors. By using truncated Trps1 constructs, the Rnf4-binding region in Trps1 could be assigned to amino acids 985-1184 of 1281. This 200 amino acid region of Trps1 does not contain any predicted protein-protein interacting motif. Complex formation between the human proteins TRPS1 and RNF4 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected and native mammalian cells. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed that the endogenous proteins are located in distinct structures of the nucleus. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we could demonstrate that the repressional function of TRPS1 is inhibited by RNF4. This finding suggests that RNF4 is a negative regulator of TRPS1 activity.

Using a luciferase reporter assay, we could demonstrate that the repressional function of TRPS1 is inhibited by RNF4. This finding suggests that RNF4 is a negative regulator of TRPS1 activity. Mutations in or complete deletions of the TRPS1 gene on human chromosome 8q24.1 cause the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes, which are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, sparse scalp hair, and facial dysmorphism (1Momeni P.

Genet. 2000; 24: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In accordance with the clinical findings, TRPS1 is predominantly expressed in the cartilage condensations, the developing joints, the hair follicles, and in the developing snout of the mouse (2Malik T.H.

Blok L.J. van Weerden W.M. van Alewijk D.C. Eussen B.H. van Steenbrugge G.J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Chang G.T.G.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4075-4081PubMed Google Scholar) found that transcription of TRPS1, which they called GC79, is down-regulated by androgen in an androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line. Upon castration-induced androgen withdrawal, TRPS1 is up-regulated in the rat ventral prostate and is associated with apoptotic death of these cells (4Chang G.T.G. Steenbeek M. Schippers E. Blok L.J. van Weerden W.M. van Alewijk D.C. Eussen B.H. van Steenbrugge G.J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role of TRPS1 in the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer, although there is no evidence for an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients with the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome. The human and mouse TRPS1/Trps1 proteins are highly similar and have an unusual combination of different zinc-finger motifs (Fig. 1A) including a GATA-type and IKAROS-like zinc fingers (1Momeni P. Glöckner G. Schmidt O. von Holtum D. Albrecht B. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Hennekam R. Meinecke P. Zabel B. Rosenthal A. Horsthemke B. Lüdecke H.-J. Nat.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have shown that TRPS1 is a repressor of GATA-factor mediated gene transcription. The IKAROS-like C2H2 zinc fingers of TRPS1 constitute a dimerization domain (6McCarty A.S. Kleiger G. Eisenberg D. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The latter zinc fingers (as well as the zinc fingers 4-6) are possibly also involved in the binding of the dynein light chain 8 (LC8a), which we have recently identified as a TRPS1-binding partner in a yeast-two-hybrid screen (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J. Chang G.T.G. Horsthemke B. Möröy T. Lüdecke H.-J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2003; 12: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LC8a decreases the repressional function of TRPS1 (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J. Chang G.T.G. Horsthemke B. Möröy T. Lüdecke H.-J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2003; 12: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is involved in various intracellular processes of which Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome. In addition to LC8a, other putative binding partners of TRPS1 were identified. Here we report that TRPS1 interacts with the RING finger protein RNF4, which is a co-regulator of several different gene transcription mechanisms (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M.

Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, RNF4 interacts with the androgen receptor and functions as a co-activator of androgen-mediated transcription (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that RNF4 may modulate TRPS1 transcription and the function of the gene product. β-Galactosidase Assay—DNA sequences encoding amino acids (aa) 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PATZ, POZ-AT hook-zinc finger protein; SNURF, small nuclear RING finger protein. 6-65 of Rnf4, which are responsible for the interaction with Trps1, were inserted in-frame into a galactose-inducible VP16 vector (p415GALNVP0) and co-transfected with truncated Trps1 fragments fused in-frame to the lexA DNA-binding domain. The truncated Trps1 fragments (F6, F9, and F10) were generated by PCR using the plasmid lexA-Trps1-F5 as template and inserted into the bait vector. Transfected L40 yeast cells were grown in selective medium to an A 600 of 0.4-0.5, precipitated, and resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer Z (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). From this suspension, 100-150 μl (V E) were diluted to 1 ml with buffer Z and cells were lysed by the addition of 15 μl of chloroform and 10 μl of 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The mixture was equilibrated at 30 °C for a few minutes, and the reaction was started by adding 200 μl of ONPG (4 mg/ml o-nitrophenol galactose in 0.1 m K2PO4, pH 7.0). After a defined reaction period (e.g. t R = 1-3 h), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The reaction was cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation, and the optical density was measured at 420 and 550 nm. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated in units (U) by the equation U = 1000 × A 420 - 1750 × A 550/A 600 × V E × t R (13Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Co-immunoprecipitation—For immunochemical analysis, the entire coding region of the human TRPS1 was inserted in-frame into the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). The full-length human RNF4 cDNA amplified from a fetal brain Marathon-ready cDNA library (catalog number 7402-1, Clontech) (5′-CCCAAGCTTACAATGAGTACAAGAAAGCG-3′; 5′-CGGAATCCTATATAAATGGGGTGGTAC-3′) was cloned in-frame into a FLAG expression plasmid (pFLAG-N3). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with both plasmids by electroporation. For immunoprecipitation analysis using the lysate of transfected COS-1 cells, a volume equivalent to 100 μg of protein was dissolved in 1 ml of Dignam D buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 75 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). For the studies on endogenous level, a volume equivalent to 1 mg of total protein from primary human fibroblast cell extracts was dissolved in 1 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4). The solutions were precleared with 30 μl of preequilibrated protein A-Sepharose slurry for 30-60 min. The supernatant of the transfected COS-1 cell extracts was then incubated with 0.2 mg of an anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min and 30 μl of preequilibrated 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry for another 90 min. To the fibroblast cell extracts, 20 μl of a monoclonal anti-TRPS1 antibody LK2B7F6 were added and incubated for 12-16 h. Subsequently, 70 μl of the preequilibrated protein A-Sepharose slurry were added and the mixture was incubated for another 90 min. The Sepharose beads were sedimented and washed three times with incubation buffer and resuspended in 4× SDS gel-loading buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue). All of the incubations mentioned above were carried out at 4 °C and with constant movement using a head-over-tail rotor. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody, the rabbit anti-TRPS1 antiserum SN652 (14Chang G.T.G. van den Bemd G.J.C.M. Jhamai M. Brinkmann A.O. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and a rabbit anti-RNF4 antiserum (kindly provided by J. Palvimo) (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Intracellular Localization—Primary human fibroblasts were directly seeded on glass coverslips. The cells were harvested after 24-48 h in cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and with IF buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). In the next step, the coverslips were blocked for 30 min in 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in IF buffer, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed twice with IF buffer, and again incubated with secondary antibody, and after washing with IF buffer, they were mounted on slides with AQUAMOUNT (BDH Chemicals, Product number 36086). Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride Blue. Endogenous TRPS1 and RNF4 were detected by using rabbit antisera and stained with a purified Alexa-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfection assays including a constitutively lacZ expressing plasmid were performed in COS-7 cells essentially as described previously (2Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G. Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Shoichet S.A. Malik T.H. Rothman J.H. Shivdasani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The αD3 promoter construct (provided by R. Shivdasani, Boston, MA) contains multiple repeats of the sequence AGATAA upstream of the firefly luciferase cDNA. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), 0.1-0.5 μg of the αD3 reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of the TRPS1 expression plasmid, 0.5 μg of the XGATA4 expression plasmid, and 0.25-0.5 μg of the RNF4 expression plasmid. 2 μg of total DNA was used for each transfection. The individual DNA mixtures were adjusted with respective amounts of empty plasmid. After 48 h, cells were lysed at 4 °Cin25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The luciferase activity was measured by luminometry (LUMAT LB9507) after dilution of the lysate 1:3 or 1:5 in 25 mm glycyl glycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 15 mm K2HPO4, 4 mm EGTA, 40 μm ATP, 40 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 μg/ml luciferin. Relative luciferase activity was determined by comparing averaged luciferase:β-galactosidase ratios and was expressed relative to results from control transfections with the empty vector. Trps1 and Rnf4 Interact in Yeast—Using a lexA yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated 23 yeast clones expressing putative binding partners of the C-terminal fragment (aa 635-1281, Fig. 1C) of the murine Trps1 protein (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J. Chang G.T.G. Horsthemke B. Möröy T. Lüdecke H.-J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2003; 12: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 12 of these clones contained plasmids encoding Lc8a, which we have reported previously (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J. Chang G.T.G. Horsthemke B. Möröy T. Lüdecke H.-J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2003; 12: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three other clones carried plasmids encoding two overlapping parts of the 194-aa RING finger protein Rnf4. One clone codes for aa 1-130 of Rnf4, whereas the two other clones encode aa 6-65. Thus, the Trps1-binding region in the RING finger protein could be narrowed down to 60 aa of the N-terminal part (Fig. 2). To confirm our yeast two-hybrid data and to narrow down the Rnf4 interaction region in the Trps1 protein, we performed another yeast in vivo assay. In addition to the original Trps1 bait construct (lexA-Trps1-F5), we used three other truncated fragments of Trps1 (Fig. 1C) as baits. Fragment F6 (Trps1 aa 635-1184) lacks the C-terminal IKAROS-like double zinc finger. Fragment F9 (aa 635-984) bears a larger C-terminal truncation but still includes the GATA DNA-binding zinc finger. The smallest fragment, F10 (aa 635-819), contains only the predicted zinc fingers 4-6 (Fig. 1C). Yeast L40 cells, which carry a lacZ gene under the control of a stretch of eight lexA-operators, were co-transfected with different lexA-Trps1 fusion constructs and a galactose-inducible reporter plasmid encoding aa 6-65 of the Rnf4 fused in-frame to the VP16 activation domain. The proper expression of each lexA-Trps1 construct as well as the expression of the VP16-Rnf4 construct was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-lexA or anti-VP16 antibodies (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 3A, Trps1 fragments F5 and F6 interact with the Rnf4 N terminus with a similar strength, whereas fragments F9 and F10 do not interact at all. Thus, the Rnf4-binding region of the Trps1 protein could be narrowed down to 200 amino acids (aa 985-1184, Fig. 3B). This region does not contain any of the predicted zinc finger motifs of the TRPS1 protein. TRPS1 and RNF4 Form Stable Complexes in Mammalian Cells—All of the yeast assays described above were performed using the mouse Trps1 and Rnf4. For all of the further investigations, we used the human orthologues TRPS1 and RNF4. The human RNF4 is only 190 aa in length and 90% identical to the mouse Rnf4 (12Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire coding regions of TRPS1 and RNF4 were inserted in-frame into a GFP or a FLAG expression plasmid to obtain the TRPS1-GFP and the RNF4-FLAG fusion proteins, respectively. To test whether TRPS1 and RNF4 are able to form stable complexes in mammalian cells, we co-transfected COS-1 cells with both plasmids. As controls, we used each construct co-transfected with the empty GFP or FLAG vector, respectively. The expression of the TRPS1-GFP fusion construct was examined by Western blot analysis using an anti-TRPS1 antiserum (SN652) (14Chang G.T.G. van den Bemd G.J.C.M. Jhamai M. Brinkmann A.O. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A, lane 2, illustrates the proper expression of the TRPS1-GFP fusion construct in cells co-transfected with RNF4-FLAG. No signal was found in extracts of cells co-transfected with empty GFP and RNF4-FLAG (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Similar results were obtained by using a commercial anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). To detect the RNF4-FLAG fusion protein, a commercial anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. We found a strong RNF4-FLAG fusion protein signal in RNF4-FLAG/TRPS1-GFP-co-transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 1), whereas no signal was detectable using extracts from COS-1 cells co-transfected with empty FLAG plasmid and the TRPS1-GFP construct (Fig. 4B, lane 2). To determine whether TRPS1 and RNF4 interact, we incubated cell extracts with Sepharose-coupled anti-FLAG antibodies. After several washing steps, we analyzed the eluates on Western blots with the anti-TRPS1 antiserum and were able to detect a TRPS1 signal in extracts of COS-1 cells co-transfected with TRPS1-GFP and RNF4-FLAG (Fig. 4C, lane 1) but not in extracts from cells where either RNF4-FLAG or TRPS1-GFP was absent (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). These findings indicate that TRPS1 and RNF4 do not only interact in yeast but are also able to form complexes in mammalian cells. We next used primary human fibroblasts to test whether an interaction between the endogenous TRPS1 and RNF4 proteins can take place. Expression of TRPS1 and RNF4 could be readily detected in cell extracts using the anti-TRPS1 SN652 antiserum (Fig. 4D) and an anti-RNF4 antiserum (kindly provided by J. Palvimo) (Fig. 4E, lane 1) (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To analyze the TRPS1-RNF4 interaction, a monoclonal anti-TRPS1 antibody (LK2B7F6) was successfully used to prepare immunoprecipitates from cell extracts. We were able to detect RNF4 in these precipitates with the anti-RNF4 antiserum (Fig. 4E, lane 2), demonstrating that the endogenous TRPS1 and RNF4 proteins physically interact and can be co-precipitated from human fibroblasts. TRPS1 and RNF4 Are Located in Distinct Structures of the Nucleus—As shown previously, TRPS1 is a nuclear protein, which is located in large nuclear bodies (Fig. 5A) (see Ref. 7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J. Chang G.T.G. Horsthemke B. Möröy T. Lüdecke H.-J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2003; 12: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The endogenous RNF4 protein has been found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we were able to co-immunoprecipitate TRPS1 and RNF4 from human fibroblast cell extracts, we decided to evaluate the intracellular localization of both proteins within these cells. We used the rabbit anti-TRPS1 antiserum and an anti-rabbit Alexa-labeled secondary antibody to show the intracellular localization of TRPS1 (Fig. 5A). The number of TRPS1 containing nuclear bodies varied between 1 and 4 per cell. The intracellular distribution of RNF4 was investigated by using the rabbit anti-RNF4 antiserum and the Alexa-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, RNF4 is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm but also located in numerous small bodies in the nucleus. The RNF4-containing nuclear bodies are clearly distinct from those in which TRPS1 is found. Co-localization experiments could not be performed because both available antisera were generated in rabbit, which does not allow a specific staining of both proteins with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody. RNF4 Inhibits the Repressional Function of TRPS1 on GATA-mediated Transcription—Using a luciferase reporter assay, Malik et al. (2Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G. Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that TRPS1 represses GATA-dependent gene activation (2Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G. Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used this reporter assay to analyze whether RNF4 has any influence on the function of TRPS1. For this purpose, we transfected COS-7 cells with the reporter plasmid αD3, which contains the luciferase cDNA under the control of multiple AGATAA elements (15Shoichet S.A. Malik T.H. Rothman J.H. Shivdasani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of αD3-transfected cells was arbitrarily set as 1.0 (Fig. 6, column 1). Co-transfection with the transcriptional activator XGATA4 resulted in a 5.7-fold increased activity of the reporter (Fig. 6, column 2). This activation was reduced by adding a TRPS1 expression plasmid, demonstrating the function of TRPS1 as a transcriptional repressor (Fig. 6, column 3). The TRPS1-mediated repression could be completely relieved by adding an equal amount of the RNF4 expression plasmid (Fig. 6, column 5). The addition of a higher amount of RNF4 expression plasmid resulted in an even higher luciferase activity (Fig. 6, column 7), suggesting that RNF4 acts as a co-activator on XGATA4 in this system. This was proved by the increased luciferase activity (7.2- and 7.5-fold) upon co-expression of XGATA4 with increasing amounts of RNF4 but without TRPS1 (Fig. 6, columns 4 and 6). RNF4 does not activate expression of the reporter in the absence of XGATA4 (Fig. 6, column 8). In summary, these results suggest that the interaction with RNF4 modulates the activity of TRPS1. In a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we have identified the RING finger protein Rnf4 as a binding partner of Trps1. Rnf4 is highly conserved in human, mouse, and rat. The rat protein was originally termed SNURF (small nuclear RING finger protein) (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The human protein is 91% identical and is four amino acids shorter than its rodent orthologues. Mouse and rat Rnf4/SNURF share a 96% identity (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol.

Genomics. 1998; 47: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction of the human TRPS1 and RNF4 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins in cell extracts from transfected COS-1 cells and from primary human fibroblasts. Transiently expressed TRPS1 and RNF4 are found exclusively in the nuclei of NIH-3T3 and COS-1 cells where they are homogeneously distributed (2Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G.

In contrast, endogenous RNF4 occurs in the cytoplasm as well as in numerous small structures within the nuclei of human fibroblasts (Fig. 5B), which was also observed by Moilanen et al. (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in CV-1 cells. The endogenous TRPS1 protein also shows a non-homogeneous distribution within the nuclei of human fibroblasts, but the TRPS1-containing structures are less numerous and much bigger than the RNF4-containing structures (Fig. 5, A and B). This finding makes it probable that the bulk of the two proteins are involved in separate intracellular processes. Because of the lack of appropriate antibodies, we could not investigate whether the different structures overlap partially. However, our co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the two proteins do interact in human fibroblasts. RNF4 is the second protein known to interact with TRPS1 and binds within a 200 amino acid region (aa 985-1184) of the transcription factor. It does overlap with only two base pairs with the recently identified region B of TRPS1-LC8a interaction (region A: aa 635-723; region B: aa 1182-1281) (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K. Van den Bemd G.-J.

During the last years a variety of proteins, which associate with RNF4 have been identified. RNF4 contains two distinct regions, which are known to be protein-protein-interacting domains (Fig. 2). The RING finger at the C terminus is necessary for the interaction to the TATA-binding protein (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol.

This region binds transcriptional repressors such as Gscl (12Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev.

In the above mentioned interactions, RNF4 undertakes several diverse functions. It can either act as a transcriptional co-repressor (10Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Macello B. Battista S. Lembo F.

In the presence of androgen, for example, RNF4 strongly activates androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRPS1 expression is repressed in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-FGC) by physiological androgen concentrations and repression is mediated by the AR (4Chang G.T.G.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4075-4081PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, after androgen withdrawal, the Trps1 expression in the rat ventral prostate increases significantly and is associated with the regression of the prostate and the occurrence of apoptosis. RNF4 is expressed in adult mouse, rat, and human prostate (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not known whether it is expressed in the LNCaP-FGC cells. If RNF4 is involved in TRPS1 repression, we assume that this repression does not affect the TRPS1 gene directly but is mediated via other AR-RNF4-regulated proteins because RNF4 normally activates AR-dependent transcription. Analyses by Fedele et al. (10Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Macello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) revealed two novel functions of RNF4. They found that RNF4 enhances basal transcription from a minimal c-myc promoter in a concentration-dependent manner. The activation was reversed to a strong co-repression when the transcriptional repressor PATZ was added (10Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Macello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because TRPS1 is a repressor of transcription, we had expected a co-repressional effect of the RNF4 binding. However, in the reporter gene assay we found a complete suppression of the repressional activity of TRPS1 upon the addition of RNF4 (Fig. 6, columns 5 and 7). Our studies revealed a so far unknown function for RNF4. Obviously, it acts as a co-activator on GATA factor-mediated gene transcription. RNF4 enhanced transcription by 26-32% (Fig. 6, columns 4 and 6), but this effect is too small to account for the reversal of TRPS1-induced transcriptional repression. Therefore, we assume that the latter is caused by an interaction between RNF4 and TRPS1. In contrast to the findings of Fedele et al. (10Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Macello B. Battista S. Lembo F.

(8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) showed that full-length RNF4-SNURF fused to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain does not activate a minimal promoter controlled by Gal4-binding sites in yeast or mammalian cells. They consequently suggested that SNURF does not have intrinsic transcription activation function (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In agreement with this suggestion, we found that RNF4 is not capable of activating gene transcription from an artificial GATA promoter in the absence of XGATA4 (Fig. 6, column 8). Based on current knowledge, it seems clear that RNF4 functions as a more general co-regulator, possibly as a bridging factor participating in the coordination of the activities of multiple transcription signals of upstream factors. One of these factors may be TRPS1. However, it remains elusive whether RNF4 is involved in the pathogenesis of the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes because it is not known whether RNF4 is expressed, for example, in chondrocytes or hair follicles. The TRPSs are caused by haploinsufficiency (TRPS I and TRPS II) or by a dominant negative effect of a mutant TRPS1 protein (TRPS III) (see Ref. 17Lüdecke H.-J. Schaper J. Meinecke P.

RNF4 and TRPS1 are also expressed in many tissues, which are not obviously affected in the TRPSs. Possibly, these tissues are not as susceptible to concentration imbalances as those affected in the TRPSs. RNF4 is similar to the previously identified multifunctional LC8a (7Kaiser F.J. Tavassoli K.

Analyses of the other potential TRPS1-interacting proteins will show whether there are even more suppressors of TRPS1, which interact in a developmental stage or tissue-specific manner with TRPS1 to modulate its function. We thank R. Shivdasani for providing the XGATA4 and the luciferase reporter (αD3) constructs, Jorma J.

https://openalex.org/W2073841786,"Voltage-gated potassium channels are transmembrane proteins made up of four subunits, each comprising six transmembrane (S1-S6) segments. S1-S4 form the voltage-sensing domain and S5-S6 the pore domain with its central pore. The sensor domain detects membrane depolarization and transmits the signal to the activation gates situated in the pore domain, thereby leading to channel opening. An understanding of the mechanism by which the sensor communicates the signal to the pore requires knowledge of the structure of the interface between the voltage-sensing and pore domains. Toward this end, we have introduced single cysteine mutations into the extracellular end of S4 (positions 356 and 357) in conjunction with a cysteine in S5 (position 418) of the Shaker channel and expressed the mutants in Xenopus oocytes. We then examined the propensity of each pair of engineered cysteines to form a metal bridge or a disulfide bridge, respectively, by examining the effect of Cd2+ ions and copper phenanthroline on the K+ conductance of a whole oocyte. Both reagents reduced currents through the S357C,E418C double mutant channel, presumably by restricting the movements necessary for coupling the voltage-sensing function to pore opening. This inhibitory effect was seen in the closed state of the channel and with heteromers composed of S357C and E418C single mutant subunits; no effect was seen with homomers of any of the single mutant channels. These data indicate that the extracellular end of S4 lies in close proximity to the extracellular end of the S5 of the neighboring subunit in closed channels."

Using deletion analysis we have mapped the location of two distinct activation domains in p/CIP (AD1 and AD2) capable of activating transcription in mammalian cells when fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain. In addition to AD1 being coincident with the interaction domain for CBP, we demonstrate a novel in vivo interaction between the AD1 and GCN5. Overexpression of a Gal4-AD1 fusion protein in yeast leads to growth arrest that is relieved by mutation of genes encoding components of the SAGA complex including GCN5, ADA3, and SPT7. In addition, the AD1 of p/CIP and the ADA3 gene are shown to be essential for retinoic acid receptor α-dependent transcription in yeast. Transient transfection assays in mammalian cells indicate that GCN5 cooperates with p/CIP as a coactivator of RARα-dependent transcription. Down-regulation of GCN5 using small interfering RNA in mammalian cells indicates that the AD1 domain and the RARβ promoter activity are dependent, in part, on GCN5. Mutational analysis of AD1 has identified two helical motifs that are required for interactions with GCN5 and CBP.

More recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that p/CIP/SRC-3 can be rapidly recruited to RAR-regulated target genes in response to RA (14Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the p160 proteins has been the subject of intense investigation. The amino terminus of p/CIP contains a conserved basic helix-loop-helix PAS (bHLH-PAS) domain also found in a family of transcription factors that includes the dioxin receptor, hypoxia inducible factor 1α, and several circadian oscillatory proteins (15Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The PAS domain is a functionally diverse domain that confers dimerization specificity to many bHLH-PAS proteins (16Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.Z.

It has been established that the LXXLL motifs mediate direct interaction with the AF-2 domain of RARs, as well as other NRs, upon hormone binding. Furthermore, amino acids directly adjacent to each motif appear to specify the affinity for particular NR homo- or heterodimers (20McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A.

Transcriptional activation is mediated by 2 major activation domains (ADs) found within the COOH-terminal half of all the p160 proteins.

Furthermore, mutations that abolish interaction with CBP/p300 impair the ability of p160 proteins to enhance transcription by NRs in vitro (26Kim M.Y. Hsiao S.J. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Activation domain 2 (AD2) is located in the extreme carboxyl terminus of the p160 proteins. It has been reported that the AD2 domain possesses protein acetyltransferase activity (3Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Transient transfection and in vitro transcription assays using chromatinized templates have shown that CARM-1 can cooperate with CBP/p300 to enhance the transcriptional effects of RARs as well as other NRs (11Xu W.

Although the p/CIP CBP/p300 complex may mediate many of the transcriptional effects of NRs, it is conceivable that other factors are also targeted by p/CIP through direct interactions with the AD1 domain. This hypothesis is substantiated by recent evidence that has shown that the protein acetyltransferase p/CAF can function as a NR coactivator by interacting with the AD1 domain of p/CIP (31Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L.

Furthermore, ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by the TR in yeast is dependent on both the presence of GRIP1 and the yGCN5 complex (33Anafi M. Yang Y.F. Barlev N.A. Govindan M.V. Berger S.L. Butt T.R. Walfish P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that, in addition to CBP, GCN5 is recruited to p/CIP via direct interaction with the AD1 domain. Using yeast as a model system we demonstrate that the minimal AD1 domain of p/CIP is a potent inhibitor of yeast growth when expressed as a fusion protein with the Gal4p DNA binding domain (DBD). Importantly, the growth inhibition and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by RARα in yeast requires the AD1 domain of p/CIP, yGCN5 as well as other components of the SAGA complex. In mammalian cells, loss of function experiments using siRNA against GCN5 indicates that both the AD1 transcriptional activity and RA-mediated transcriptional activation of the RARβ promoter are, in part, dependent on GCN5. Mutagenesis analysis of amino acids found within the minimal AD1 domain indicates that the interaction surface between p/CIP and CBP or GCN5 is highly overlapping. Importantly, we have identified mutations that severely compromise interactions with GCN5 while leaving the interaction with CBP intact. Collectively these results provide support for a model in which p/CIP functions as an essential bridging protein, which may be capable of assembling complexes containing distinct proteins at nuclear receptor target genes. Yeast Strains—The yeast strain EGY 48 (Matα ura3, his3, trp1) was used in all phases of yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis. For the growth suppression assays, the parental strains FY86 (Matα ura3–52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1), FY 630 (Matα ura3, trp1, leu2, his4, lys2), and the respective knockout strains FY 1370 (gcn5::HIS3) and FY 1093 (spt7::LEU2) were obtained from Fred Winston. The parental strain KY 320 (Matα ura3, his3, trp1, leu2, ade2, lys5) was obtained from Kevin Struhl and the corresponding knockout strain CY 756 (ngg1::TRP1) was obtained from Chris Brandl. All yeast transformations were performed using a modification of the lithium acetate procedure (34Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Mutagenesis—PCR reactions were performed using PCR Supermix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mutations in p/CIP were introduced using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR amplified products from both wild-type and mutant pCMX-p/CIP constructs were subcloned into the PJG4–5 yeast expression vector in-frame with the B42 activation domain, or the pMGal vector, in-frame with the Gal4 DBD. The fragments of p/CIP corresponding to AD1 (aa 985–1085) and AD2 (aa 1300–1398) were also subcloned into the yeast expression vector pAS1U in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The human GCN5-short form (aa 292–390) and mouse CBP (aa 2058–2170) were PCR amplified and the products were subcloned into the PEG 202 yeast expression vector in-frame with the LexA-DBD. Yeast Interaction Assays—Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were performed as described (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The EGY48 yeast strain containing the LexA β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pSH18–34) was grown overnight at 30 °C in selection media containing 2% glucose. Cells were cotransformed the following day with PEG202 and PJG4–5 plasmids containing the various in-frame coding sequences of interest as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were plated onto 2% glucose selection media and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Isolated colonies were grown in the same liquid selection media containing 2% galactose, and grown at 30 °C to an A 600 nm of ∼0.5–0.8 to induce expression from the PJG4–5 plasmids. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were normalized to cell density. For ligand-dependent interactions, two separate cultures were induced and treated with either vehicle or 10–6m RA. Values reported are the average -fold of activation over PJG4–5 alone, which was arbitrarily set to 1. To examine the effect of p/CIP on yeast growth, parental and knockout yeast strains were transformed with the plasmid pAS1U containing the ADH1 promoter directing the expression of Gal4-DBD alone, the Gal4 DBD fused in-frame with AD1 (aa 985–1085) or AD2 (aa 1300–1398). Cells were plated onto synthetic selection media minus uracil containing 2% glucose and allowed to grow for 3 days at 30 °C before growth was recorded photographically with an ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Biosciences). Transactivation Assays in Yeast—The parental strain KY 320 (Matα ura3, his3, trp1, leu2, ade2, lys5) and the corresponding ada3 knockout strain CY756 (ngg1::TRP1) were cotransformed with the LexA β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pSH18–34), the PEG202 vector containing the ADH1 promoter driving the expression of the LBD of hRARα (aa 142–462) fused in-frame with the LexA-DBD, and PJG4–5ΔB42 vector containing the GAL1 promoter driving the expression of the NRID of p/CIP (aa 591–940) or the NRID plus the AD1 region of p/CIP (aa 591–1085). PJG4–5ΔB42 was generated by digestion of PJG4–5 with EcoRV-HPAI that removes the B42 activation domain. Cells were plated onto the appropriate selection media containing 2% glucose and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Subsequent liquid β-galactosidase assays normalized to total protein were performed as described. Transactivation Assays in Mammalian Cells—HeLa S3 cells and C127 cells (transformed mouse mammary gland) cells were routinely maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in T-75 flasks in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 unit/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. To assess transcriptional activity of Gal4-DBDp/CIP fusion proteins, transient cotransfections were performed according to a modified version of the calcium phosphate procedure. HeLa S3 cells were seeded at ∼500,000 per 60-mm plate and cotransfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing 6 binding sites for Gal4 upstream of a minimal promoter, 1.5 μg of a CMV driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency, and 1 μg of the pMGal vector (CMV) directing the expression of Gal4-DBD or p/CIP deletion mutants fused in-frame with Gal4 DBD. Total DNA was adjusted to 10 μg per 60-mm plate with empty plasmid and transfected cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared in 300 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). 50-μl aliquots of the extract were used for subsequent determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized to the output of the internal β-galactosidase control plasmid and the folds of activation are relative to that of pMGal alone, which was arbitrarily set to 1. For the NR signaling assays, HeLa S3 cells were seeded at 840,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate and transiently cotransfected according to the LipofectAMINE Plus protocol with 150 ng of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two consensus (DR5) RAR response elements upstream of a minimal promoter, 150 ng of a CMV-driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, 50 ng each of CMV vectors directing the expression of hRARα and hRXRα, and increasing amounts of a CMV vector driving the expression of mGCN5 and/or p/CIP. Total DNA was adjusted to 1 μg/well of a 6-well plate with empty CMV vector. The following day, cells were treated with either vehicle alone or 10–6m RA and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested and extracts were prepared in 200 μl of lysis buffer. 50-μl aliquots of the extract were used for subsequent determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For the loss-of-function experiments, C127 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 as described. Synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA), obtained from Dharmacon using the SMART protocol, were cotransfected into the cells. Luciferase values are normalized to the output of the internal β-galactosidase control plasmid and all values are relative to that of the basal condition (RAR/RXR alone) in the absence of ligand that was arbitrarily set to 1. The relative expression of endogenous GCN5 was monitored by Western blotting of cell extracts isolated from control or siRNA-treated cells, using a polyclonal antibody against GCN5 (Santa Cruz). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For the GST pull-down assays p/CIP (985–1085) was subcloned into the pGEX bacterial expression vector in-frame with the GST moiety, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL-21. Single colonies were grown overnight in 3 ml of LB and the following day, cultures were diluted 1:100 in 300 ml of LB and grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A 600 nm of ∼0.5, at which time protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final) for 5 h at room temperature. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). The cells were then sonicated (4× 15 s bursts at 50%) prior to centrifugation of the samples at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 500 μl of GST-Sepharose beads prewashed in resuspension buffer were added to the clarified supernatant and the samples were incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 2 min at 1000 rpm and subsequently washed 5 times with 12 ml of resuspension buffer. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of resuspension buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and incubated for 5 min with rocking. Proteins were dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and stored at –80 °C. FLAG-tagged CBP, FLAG-tagged GCN5, FLAG-tagged p/CIP, and HA-tagged p/CIP (574–1398) cDNAs were subcloned into the pFastbac vector (Invitrogen) and recombinant proteins were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac expression system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, Sf9 cells were maintained by suspension in serum-free media prior to infection with the recombinant baculoviruses (multiplicity of infection ∼ 5). After a 48-h incubation the infected cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer A and Dounce homogenized. Extracts were centrifuged 37,000 × g for 30 min and proteins were then purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the appropriate immunoaffinity resin. Proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml of the appropriate peptide competitor. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or analyzed by Western blotting. GST Interaction Assays—1 μg of either GST alone or GST-AD1 were incubated with GST-Sepharose and recombinant CBP or GCN5 at 4 °C for 1 h in 200 μl of buffer A containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The protein complexes were then centrifuged, washed four times with lysis buffer A, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal αFLAG antibody (Sigma). For the coimmunoprecipitation assays, Sf9 cells were coinfected with the appropriate viruses as indicated in the figure legends. After 48 h cells were lysed in buffer A, centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of αHA-Sepharose immunoaffinity resin for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer A and proteins were eluted with buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml HA peptide. Measurement of Histone Acetyltransferase Activity—The HAT activity was measured using a previously described protocol (36Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Typically, ∼100 ng of purified proteins were suspended in 30 μl of IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm butyrate) containing 1 μl of [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.85 millibecquerel, 10 mCi/mmol, Amersham) and 1.5 μg of free histones and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The immunocomplexes were then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

To confirm the location of these domains in p/CIP, cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter, and an expression vector directing the synthesis of various deletion mutants of p/CIP fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1A). Two independent domains capable of activating the reporter plasmid were identified (Fig. 1B). The fragment of p/CIP corresponding to amino acids 985–1085 (P6) exhibited the strongest activity (∼1389-fold above Gal4 alone) and is d"

In this system, the fatty acid moiety of acyl-CoA is transferred enzymatically to carnitine, and the resultant product, acylcarnitine, is imported into the mitochondrial matrix through a transporter named carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). Here we report a novel mammalian protein homologous to CACT. The protein, designated as CACL (CACT-like), is localized to the mitochondria and has palmitoylcarnitine transporting activity. The tissue distribution of CACL is similar to that of CACT; both are expressed at a higher level in tissues using fatty acids as fuels, except in the brain, where only CACL is expressed. In addition, CACL is induced by partial hepatectomy or fasting. Thus, CACL may play an important role cooperatively with its homologue CACT in a stress-induced change of lipid metabolism, and may be specialized for the metabolism of a distinct class of fatty acids involved in brain function.

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, are important nutritional components, serving as structural elements in mammalian cells. They confer fluidity, flexibility, and selective permeability to cellular membranes, and affect cellular and physiological processes (1Wallis J.G. Watts J.L. Browse J. Trends Biochem. Biosci. 2002; 27: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, long-chain fatty acids are used as an energy source through the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway, especially in tissues such as muscle, during periods of fasting and other metabolic stress (2Hale D.E. Bennett M.J. J. Pediatr. 1992; 121: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The carnitine shuttle system in eukaryotic cells provides for the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, where β-oxidation takes place (3Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Acyl-CoA pools supply activated substrates for many key metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lipid synthesis. A wide range of activated acyl groups is transferred reversibly from acyl-CoA to carnitine through the actions of carnitine acyltransferases. The transfer from the limited pools of membrane-impermeable CoA to the abundant and mobile carnitine allows transport between compartments. Acylcarnitines are imported into mitochondria through carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) 1The abbreviations used are: CACT, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase; CACL, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase-like; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PH, partial hepatectomy; MOPS, 3-morpholinopro-panesulfonic acid.

This protein catalyzes a mole to mole exchange of carnitines and acylcarnitines, thereby permitting the fatty acid moieties to be translocated into the mitochondrial matrix. Several cases of CACT deficiency have been reported (7Stanley C.A. Hale D.E. Berry G.T. Deleeuw S. Boxer J. Bonnefont J.P. N. Engl. J.

Patients with these defects generally present in early infancy with acute, potentially life-threatening episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemic coma, induced by fasting during intercurrent disease. The clinical features of these patients include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, mild hyperammonemia, variable dicarboxylic aciduria, hepatomegaly with abnormal liver functions, various cardiac symptoms, and skeletal muscle weakness. In a search for genes that are up-regulated during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rodents, we found a novel gene that encodes a protein homologous to CACT. Here we report the characterization of the gene product, CACL (for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase-like). The protein exhibits a mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase activity, and its expression is induced by stresses such as hepatectomy and fasting. Animals—Eight-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Animals were kept in a temperature-controlled animal room with a 12-h dark/light cycle and were maintained on a commercially available diet (CE-2, CLEA Japan Inc.) consisting (by energy) of 29.2% protein, 58.8% carbohydrates, and 12.0% fat. Mice were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 h, and had free access to water. A 70% partial hepatectomy was performed according to the method of Higgins and Anderson (10Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). The surgery was performed between 8 and 11 a.m. under ether anesthesia. Animals were sacrificed before partial hepatectomy and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation. Hearts, livers, brains, and kidneys were excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal care guidelines of the National Institute for Longevity Sciences (Obu, Japan). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen Corp.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. The GP2-293 retroviral packaging cell line was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and was maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Puromycin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 3 μg/ml for the selection of pMXpuro-infected cells. Construction of Plasmids—A retroviral vector derived from a murine leukemia virus, pMXpuro (11Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Prof. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Open reading frame regions of mCACT and mCACL were amplified by PCR using EST clones ME624844 and BE372112 as templates, respectively, and cloned into the BamHI-BstXI sites of pMXpuro. For epitope tagging of CACL, a myc-His6 tag of the pEF4/mycHis vector (Invitrogen Corp.) was inserted immediately before the termination codon of mCACL cDNA, and the fusion gene was cloned into the pMXpuro vector. For the functional expression of mCACL in yeast cells, the 1.2-kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of mCACL cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI-PvuII sites of pKT10 (12Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, pKT10-mCACL, expressed mCACL driven by promoter of TDH3, a gene for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of the budding yeast. The p316CRC1 plasmid was constructed by inserting the yeast gene for CACT (CRC1) into the pRS316 vector (13Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the expression of mCACL in Escherichia coli cells, the 0.9-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment of mCACL was isolated from the pMXpuro/mCACL plasmid and inserted into the BglII-SalI sites of pBAD/gIIIA (Invitrogen Corp.). The resultant plasmid pBAD/CACL-His6 encoded a CACL-His6 fusion protein with the pIII signal sequence at the amino terminus, which allowed the recombinant protein to be secreted to plasma membranes. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose to the LB medium. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA with a Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen Corp.) and used for Northern blotting. Poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) was size-fractionated on a denaturing gel (1.2% agarose, 3.4% formaldehyde, 1× MOPS), transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer, and fixed using standard techniques. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (number 7762-1) was purchased from Clontech. After prehybridization, the filters were probed with a 200-bp CACL or a 905-bp CACT cDNA fragment. An 857-bp β-actin fragment and a 400-bp β2-microglobulin fragment of mouse were used as controls. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of >0.5 cpm/μg of DNA using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—The following antibodies were purchased: anti-His6 polyclonal antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), anti-myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10, CRP Inc., Denver, PA), anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-6, EMD Biosciences, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma). Sheep polyclonal antibodies against CACT (14Fraser F. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. V. A. Zammit (Hannah Research Institute, Ayr, Scotland, United Kingdom). Anti-mouse CACL polyclonal antibodies were produced as follows. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 31 amino acids of mouse CACL was inserted into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione S-transferasemCACL fusion protein was produced in E. coli DH5α cells and was used as an antigen for immunizing rabbits. The antibodies were affinity purified against an MBP-mCACL fusion protein produced in E. coli. Western Blot Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Frozen tissues were disrupted with a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai Co., Osaka, Japan) in 10 volumes of a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and 20 mm HEPES, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the postnuclear fraction was used as the protein lysate. The protein lysates were incubated in 2× loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 12% β-mercaptoethanol) at 42 °C for 30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To verify the equal loading of proteins in each lane, the blotted membrane was stained with Ponceau-S solution (Sigma). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoblotting was performed with the primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:100 for anti-mCACL, and 1:1000 for anti-CACT and anti-His6. The incubation with rabbit anti-mCACL antibodies was performed at 4 °C overnight, whereas the incubation with the other antibodies was at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 60 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL Western blotting detection system, Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 30 min with a blocking solution of 2% normal goat serum in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h with the anti-CACL primary antibody diluted at 1:100 in PBS. After three 15-min washes in PBS, cells were incubated with secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS for 1 h. Cells were washed again with PBS and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). To stain the mitochondria, 200 nm of a mitochondrion-specific dye (Mitotracker; Molecular Probes Inc.) was incubated with the cells for 30 min before fixation. Slides were examined on a confocal microscope (BX-FLA, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped for epifluorescence. Montages of images were prepared using PhotoShop 5.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Complementation of Yeast Mutation—Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in CIT2 (for peroxisomal citrate synthase) or CRC1 (for mitochondrial CACT) were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). A Δcit2::kanMX Δcrc1::kanMX double mutant was constructed by a standard genetic cross. Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB-WO, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 0.3% glucose and the appropriate amino acids. Minimal oleate medium contained YNB-WO with amino acids and 0.12% oleate, 0.2% Tween 40 as described previously (15van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Preparations and Transport Assay—The transport of palmitoyl-[14C]carnitine into mitochondria was measured as described previously (16Murthy M.S. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9082-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence on four dishes (15 cm in diameter) were washed twice with PBS and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of a homogenization buffer containing 0.25 mm sucrose and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and were homogenized with 20 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon glass) homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min. The resultant pellet was homogenized with 2 ml of the buffer and centrifuged again. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. The pellet, which contained ∼0.2 mg of mitochondria, was resuspended in 250 μlof assay mixture containing 250 mm mannitol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 μm EDTA, 3 mm ADP, 1 mm maleic acid, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and palmitoyl-[14C]carnitine (NEC-667, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-bovine serum albumin complex (at a ratio of 1:3). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Reconstitution of Carnitine-acylcarnitine Translocase in E. coli Cells—The plasmid pBAD/CACL-His6 or the control vector pBAD/gIIIA was introduced into the E. coli strain Rosetta (F- ompT hsdS B (rB- mB-) gal dcm lacY1 pRARE(CmR); EMD Biosciences, Inc.). The transformants were grown in LB medium containing 0.2% l-arabinose for 18 h at 30 °C. The cultures were diluted with LB, and the transport reaction was initiated by the addition of palmitoyl-[14C]carnitine (NEC-667, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to the final concentration of 35 μm. After the reaction at 30 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the incorporation of 14C into the cells was quantified using an LSC-5100 liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between the control and the experimental group was determined by the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Identification of a Novel Protein Homologous to Carnitineacylcarnitine Translocase—During a microarray analysis for genes induced after 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats, we found a novel gene whose expression peaked at 6 h after the surgery (data not shown). A mouse clone homologous to the rat gene was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium, and the sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA identified an open reading frame of 918 nucleotides (Fig. 1A). The deduced protein, possessing six membrane-spanning regions (Fig. 1B), displayed homology with mitochondrial carrier family proteins. The protein showed the highest similarity (37% identity) with CACT, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that is essential for the import of long-chain fatty acid moieties into the mitochondrial matrix (6Huizing M. Iacobazzi V. Ijlst L. Savelkoul P. Ruitenbeek W. van den Heuvel L. Indiveri C. Smeitink J. Trijbels F. Wanders R. Palmieri F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, we designated the protein as CACL. A data base search using the BLAST program revealed that it is a conserved protein whose homologues are present in human, fly, and worm (Fig. 1A). The human orthologue (hCACL) has 97% identity with mCACL at the amino acid level and is mapped on chromosome 14q32. A motif within the sixth hydrophobic domain, R(AS)(VF)PANAA(TC)F, has been shown to be conserved within the carnitine carrier subfamily (17De Lucas J.R. Dominguez A.I. Valenciano S. Turner G. Laborda F. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CACL and its homologous proteins all possess the motif, suggesting that they are involved in the transport of acylcarnitine across membranes. Expression of CACL in Mouse Tissues—The expression pattern in tissues was surveyed using a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot filter. Mouse CACL mRNA, ∼1.9 kb in length, was expressed in several tissues including heart, brain, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2). This pattern of expression was similar to that of its paralogue mCACT, except CACT mRNA was rare in brain tissue (Fig. 2A). The expression pattern was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against CACL and CACT. The CACL protein was present at a comparable level in brain, liver, and kidney, whereas CACT expression was barely detectable in brain (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that CACL is involved in a biological process similar to that of CACT, but may play a specific role in certain tissues such as brain. CACL Is Localized to Mitochondria—To determine the subcellular localization of the CACL protein, we constructed NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells that stably expressed a CACL fusion protein with a myc-His6 tag in the carboxyl terminus. Using the anti-myc polyclonal antibody, CACL-myc-His6 proteins in the fibroblasts were immunostained in a reticulated pattern, which coincided with the mitochondrial staining (Fig. 3, A-C). To exclude the possibility that the tag affected the subcellular localization of the protein, we further addressed the localization of CACL using an affinity purified antibody against mCACL. Although we could not detect specific signals of the endogenous protein (data not shown), overexpressed CACL protein without the tag was co-stained with the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 3, D-F). Based on these observations, we conclude that CACL, like its homologue CACT, is localized to mitochondria. CACL Has Palmitoylcarnitine Transporting Activity—In yeast, the transport of acyl units to mitochondria is performed via two pathways, namely the glyoxylate cycle-mediated conversion of acetyl-CoA to succinate that occurs in peroxisomes and the carnitine-dependent acyl-CoA transport. The two pathways have been thought to act in parallel, because disruption of either the CIT2 gene, which encodes the peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle enzyme citrate synthase, or one of the genes for the carnitine metabolism in mitochondria, did not affect the growth of yeast on oleate, whereas a mutant with both pathways disrupted failed to grow on the plate because of an inability to oxidize the fatty acid (18van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We constructed a double mutant defective in CIT2 and CRC1, the mitochondrial CACT gene in yeast. As reported previously (15van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the Δcrc1 Δcit2 mutant could not form colonies on minimal medium containing oleate (Fig. 4A), and the defect was rescued by the introduction of the wild-type CRC1 gene (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the heterologous expression of mCACL could relieve the growth impairment of the double mutant on the oleate plate (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the CACL protein possesses an enzymatic activity similar to Crc1p. To examine more directly whether CACL possesses activity similar to that of CACT, we performed a biochemical assay for the acylcarnitine transporting activity of mitochondrial fractions using palmitoyl-[14C]carnitine (16Murthy M.S. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9082-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we constructed NIH3T3 cells in which CACL or CACT was overexpressed under the control of the retroviral LTR promoter (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4E, liberation of [14C]carnitine, which was produced enzymatically from palmitoyl-[14C]carnitine in the mitochondrial matrix, was observed in the mitochondrial fractions harvested from cells infected with a control vector, and the activity was significantly elevated in cells overexpressing either CACL or CACT. Moreover, we constructed a plasmid for the functional expression of the mCACL-His6 fusion protein in E. coli. Cells harboring the plasmid expressed the recombinant protein in an arabinose-dependent manner (Fig. 4F), and the expression of mCACL conferred palmitoylcarnitine uptake activity to E. coli cells (Fig. 4G). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CACL indeed encodes a protein with acylcarnitine transporting activity in mitochondria. Induction of CACL after Partial Hepatectomy and Fasting—As described above, CACL was found as a gene whose expression was up-regulated after PH in rats. We addressed whether CACL expression was altered in mouse livers after PH. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression level of the CACL transcript in the liver before the operation was low, and was increased at 6-12 h after PH (Fig. 5A, left). The CACL transcript level was slightly increased in sham-operated mice at 6 h (Fig. 5A, right). Consistently, the amount of the CACL protein was increased at 12 h after PH, whereas the increase was slight after the sham operation (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, a modest increase in CACT expression was observed, but its protein level was not increased significantly (Fig. 5, A-C). The hepatic surgeries did not affect the protein levels of CACL and CACT in other tissues such as heart (Fig. 5D). Fasting is a stress that is known to cause a metabolic shift to preferentially use free fatty acids. We found that the transcript corresponding to CACL was induced markedly in liver after 12 h of fasting (Fig. 6A). CACT mRNA was also increased under the same condition (Fig. 6A). We further examined the amount of CACL protein in several tissues by Western blot analysis using the anti-CACL antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, B-D, the protein levels of CACL after fasting were markedly elevated in liver, and increased modestly in heart. In contrast, up-regulation was slight in kidney. We also observed an increase in the amount of CACT in livers and hearts after fasting. These data indicate that the expression of CACL and CACT is regulated by fasting in a tissue-specific manner and suggest that the induction of these carnitine carriers may contribute to a metabolic change in specific tissues such as the liver. In the present study we identified CACL, a novel mammalian protein that is localized to mitochondria and exhibits acylcarnitine transporting activity. The CACL transcript was found in tissues such as heart and liver, where its homologue CACT was expressed at a high level. In humans, patients with a CACT deficiency exhibited various cardiac symptoms and abnormal liver functions (7Stanley C.A. Hale D.E. Berry G.T. Deleeuw S. Boxer J. Bonnefont J.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Pande S.V. Brivet M. Slama A. Demaugre F. Aufrant C. Saudubray J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Pande S.V. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 22-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CACL may not be able to compensate for CACT function in fatty acid metabolism of these tissues. In contrast, the brain is a unique organ in which CACL is expressed at higher levels than is CACT. Although peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes are expressed in brain (19Knoll A. Sargueil F. Salles J. Cassagne C. Garbay B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 74: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), there have been no reports to show that the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway is operating in the brain. The presence of the CACL transcript suggests that acylcarnitine might be used in this organ. The brain contains relatively high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, which are critical for its functions (20Uauy R. Hoffman D.R. Peirano P. Birch D.G. Birch E.E. Lipids. 2001; 36: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that a novel carnitine palmitoyltransferase was expressed specifically in brain and testis (21Price N.T. van der Leij F.R. Jackson V.N. Corstorphine C.G. Thomson R. Sorensen A. Zammit V.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and that carnitine transporters on the plasma membrane, which are involved in carnitine uptake, were expressed in brain (22Eraly S. Nigam S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Together with the carnitine-handling enzymes expressed in brain, CACL might have specialized roles in the metabolism of a distinct class of fatty acids that are involved in brain function. The liver is a unique organ with a regenerative capacity. After 70% of the mass is surgically removed, the residual hepatic lobes enlarge to restore the original mass within 7 days, and vascularization is completed within the subsequent 7 days (23Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). A variety of genes are involved in the whole process of liver regeneration, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the process remain unknown. Recently, Su et al. (24Su A.I. Guidotti L.G. Pezacki J.P. Chisari F.V. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) reported a microarray-based study of the gene expression profile during the priming phase of liver regeneration in mice. They reported up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, which are involved in maintaining glucose levels after an acute loss of liver mass. Thus, a subtle regulation that switches energy metabolism appears to occur in the regenerating liver. Carnitine has been thought to be one of the key factors in the regulation of liver regeneration, because the carnitine content in the liver increases after PH (25Lai H.S. Chen Y. Chen W.J. World J. Surg. 1998; 22 (46-47): 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and liver regeneration is accelerated by the administration of carnitine to hepatectomized rats (26Holecek M. Simek J. Zadak Z. Blaha V. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1989; 38: 503-508PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increases in the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II have been observed in regenerating livers (27Asins G. Rosa J.L. Serra D. Gil-Gomez G. Ayte J. Bartrons R. Tauler A. Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the carnitine-dependent pathway is important for energy supply when the liver, a major organ critical to maintaining metabolic and biosynthetic homeostasis, is partially removed. In agreement with this notion, we found that the level of CACL protein was elevated after PH. This acylcarnitine carrier may be involved in one of the key steps that regulate cellular metabolism during liver regeneration. A change in the energy source from glucose to free fatty acids has been widely observed as an adaptive response to fasting (28Neely J.R. Morgan H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1974; 36: 413-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In the fasting heart, intracellular droplet accumulation was observed (29Adams M.G. Barer R. Joseph S. Om'Iniabohs F. J. Pathol. 1981; 135: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the content of glycerides and glycogen was increased through the inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and the enhancement of the β-oxidation pathway (30Denton R.M. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A recent study using oligonucleotide microarrays revealed that the expression of a wide range of cardiac genes was affected by fasting, including the up-regulation of genes for fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis and the down-regulation of genes for glycolysis (31Suzuki J. Shen W.J. Nelson B.D. Selwood S.P. Murphy Jr., G.M. Kanefara H. Takahashi S. Oida K. Miyamori I. Kraemer F.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E94-E102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We found that CACL and CACT were up-regulated at the mRNA level in liver, and furthermore, fasting increased the amount of the CACL and CACT proteins in heart and liver. These two organs are prominent in the use of fatty acids upon starvation; fasted cardiac muscles directly use fatty acids as an energy source, whereas hepatic metabolism of fatty acids is mostly directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies for use as energy sources in tissues such as brain (32Mitchell G.A. Kassovska-Bratinova S. Boukaftane Y. Robert M.F. Wang S.P. Ashmarina L. Lambert M. Lapierre P. Potier E. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: 193-216PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of CACL and CACT may contribute to the adaptation of the whole body to fasting. Systemic energy metabolism has been shown to be tightly regulated by the action of hormones, and a disruption of this coordinated regulation causes disorders such as obesity and diabetes (33Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). Further studies of the coordinating mechanisms of glucose and lipid metabolism in the responsible organs will provide insights for the development of novel approaches to therapy or prevention of these disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2024786312,"Genes positioned close to telomeres in yeast are silenced by a heterochromatin-like structure containing Sir proteins. To investigate whether silencing also affects DNA repair, we studied removal of UV lesions by photolyase and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in strains containing the <i>URA3</i> gene inserted 2 kilobases from a telomere. <i>URA3</i> was transcriptionally active in <i>sir3</i>Δ mutants, partially silenced in <i>SIR3</i> cells, or completely silenced by overexpression of <i>SIR3</i> or deletion of <i>RPD3</i>. The active <i>URA3</i> showed efficient repair by both pathways. Fast repair of the promoter and 3′ end by photolyase reflected a non-nucleosomal structure. Partial silencing had no remarkable effect on photolyase but reduced repair by NER, indicating differential accessibility for the two repair reactions. Complete silencing inhibits NER and photolyase in the coding region as well as in the promoter and the 3′-end. Conventional nuclease footprinting analyses revealed subtle changes in the promoter proximal nucleosome under partially silenced conditions but a pronounced reorganization of chromatin extending over the whole gene in silenced chromatin. Thus, both repair systems are sensitive to chromatin changes associated with silencing and provide direct evidence for a compact structure of heterochromatin."

Until now, structure-function analyses of HCV gene products have been carried out using artificial cell expression systems in which E1 and E2 form two kinds of complexes in vitro (6Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): high molecular mass aggregates that contain intermolecular covalent bonds and native complexes in which E1 and E2 associate by noncovalent interactions. The contribution of either complex to the structure of the proteins on viral particles is unknown; however, the latest complexes are thought to correspond to the native association of E1 and E2. The lack of an efficient tissue culture system for propagating the virus and low levels of HCV particles in plasma samples are the main factors responsible for slow progress in this research area. In an attempt to obtain information on the exact nature of the interaction between E1 and E2, we recently produced murine monoclonal antibodies directed against E1E2 complexes expressed on native HCV particles isolated from serum of chronically infected patients. 2Petit, M.-A., Jolivet-Reynaud, C., Peronnet, E., Michal, Y., Dubuisson, J., and Trépo, C., 11th International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease Proceedings, April 6–9, 2003, Sydney, Australia.2Petit, M.-A., Jolivet-Reynaud, C., Peronnet, E., Michal, Y., Dubuisson, J., and Trépo, C., 11th International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease Proceedings, April 6–9, 2003, Sydney, Australia. In this study, the new monoclonal antibody (mAb) D32.10, which specifically recognizes serum-derived HCV particles and both HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2, was obtained. The fine epitope localization of mAb D32.10 was established using phage display peptide library technology. Intriguingly, its epitope is located in the E1E2 association site (WHY), encompassing CD81-binding region-1, as depicted on the predicted HCV E1E2 heterodimeric model proposed by Yagnik et al. (10Yagnik A.T. Lahm A. Meola A. Roccasecca R.M. Ercole B.B. Nicosia A. Tramontano A. Proteins. 2000; 40: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) on the basis of tick-borne encephalitis virus. More exciting, such E1 and E2 sequences, which are recognized by our mAb D32.10, are also reactive with specific antibodies present in human sera from HCV-infected patients. Antibody Production and Characterization—mAb D32.10 was generated as previously described. 2Petit, M.-A., Jolivet-Reynaud, C., Peronnet, E., Michal, Y., Dubuisson, J., and Trépo, C., 11th International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease Proceedings, April 6–9, 2003, Sydney, Australia. Briefly, viral material was obtained in large amounts from plasmapheresis of a chronically HCV-infected patient (HCV-L, genotype 1b). An HCV-enriched pellet was prepared by successive ultracentrifugations. The final pellet (concentrated 240-fold) contained ∼107 copies of HCV RNA/mg of protein as determined by Amplicor™ HCV Monitor™ (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). BALB/c mice were inoculated with 100 μg, i.e. 106 copies of HCV RNA (two injections), of this viral preparation and boosted with 50 μg (two injections) before fusion with X63 myeloma cells (11Buttin G. LeGuern G. Phalente L. Lin E.C. Medrano L. Cazenave P.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 81: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for the presence of HCV-specific antibodies by indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and for HCV polypeptide specificity by immunoblotting using the immunogen as an antigenic probe (12Petit M.-A. Capel F. Riottot M.M. Dauguet C. Pillot J. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The HCV antigenic reactivity recognized by mAb D32.10 was also analyzed by EIA of each fraction recovered after centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient of the HCV-enriched pellet. HCV Indirect EIA—96-Well polystyrene plates (Falcon from BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France) were coated with four different HCV preparations (1 mg/ml protein) diluted from 10–1 to 10–6 (corresponding to 100 μg/ml to 1 ng/ml). The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and then saturated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Tris/NaCl/BSA buffer). mAb D32.10 diluted in a mixture of Tris/NaCl/BSA buffer and 50% normal human serum at a concentration of 5 μg/ml was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The bound antibody was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-mouse immunoglobulins (diluted 1:5000; Immunotech) and with o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 as substrates. Absorbance was determined at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader (MRX, Dynex). The results were considered as positive when superior to the cutoff, corresponding to the mean of negative controls multiplied by 2.1. Western Immunoblot Experiments—The untreated HCV-enriched pellet (HCV-L) was used as an antigenic probe (12Petit M.-A. Capel F. Riottot M.M. Dauguet C. Pillot J. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Petit M.-A. Dubanchet S. Capel F. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) at concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mg/ml. The antigen was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions (2% SDS ± 5% β-mercaptoethanol). After protein transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotting was performed using mAb D32.10 (2–5 μg/ml; diluted in 50% normal human serum) as the primary antibody. Mouse IgGs bound were then detected by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-mouse immunoglobulins (diluted 1:10,000; Dako Corp.) as the secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+ system, Amersham Biosciences). Glycosidase digestion was performed as previously described by Sato et al. (14Sato K. Okamoto H. Aihara S. Hoshi Y. Tanaka T. Mishiro S. Virology. 1993; 196: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) on circulating HCV virions. The HCV-enriched pellet (HCV-L, 4 μg) was treated with 5, 10, or 20 milliunits/ml peptide N-glycosidase A (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for 18 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylation of purified HCV particles was also performed by overnight incubation at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing endoglycosidase H (Endo H; 5 milliunits/μl; Roche Applied Science), 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The control digestion was performed under the same conditions as described for the peptide N-glycosidase A or Endo H digestion, except the enzyme was omitted. Samples were then treated with electrophoresis sample buffer containing reducing agent and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Dodecapeptide Library Screening—The Ph.D.-12™ phage display peptide library kit was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. This is a combinatorial peptide 12-mer fused to the minor coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage. The displayed peptide 12-mers are expressed at the N terminus of pIII. The library consists of ∼1.9 × 109 electroporated sequences, amplified once to yield ∼20 copies of each sequence in 10 μl of the supplied phage. Three biopannings were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, with some modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of biotinylated mAb D32.10 were coupled to a 35-mm polystyrene Petri dish (Falcon) coated with 40 μg of streptavidin. The dish was incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed six times with 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween). In the first round of selection, 4 × 1010 phage from the initial library were allowed to react with the dish-bound IgG for 4 h at 4 °C under rocking conditions. The unbound phage were removed by repetitive washes with TBS/Tween. The bound phage were then eluted from the dish with 400 μl of elution buffer (0.1 n HCl (pH adjusted to 2.2 with glycine) and 1 mg/ml BSA). After neutralization with 75 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1), the eluted phage were then amplified by infection of 20 ml of a 1:100 dilution of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli ER2537 (recA+ strain cells) as recommended by the manufacturer. The culture was incubated for 4.5 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Supernatants were obtained and precipitated with polyethylene glycol as previously described (15Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). In the second and third rounds of selection, 20% of the amplified phage from the preceding round were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated mAb D32.10 at final concentrations of 10 and 1 nm, respectively, before being added to the 35-mm polystyrene Petri dish coated with 10 μg of streptavidin. The procedure was then identical to the first round. The phage from the third biopanning eluate were cloned and amplified for DNA sequencing and immunoanalysis. DNA Sequencing—Single-stranded DNA was prepared from the purified phage as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the gene III inserts was determined according to the modified method of Sanger et al. (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) with an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer (Model 377A) using the BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cycle sequencing was performed with primer 5′-HO-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-OH-3′ corresponding to the pIII gene sequence. The amino acid sequence of the insert was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. ELISA Using Supernatant Phage—Rows of ELISA plate wells were coated with 100 μl of either mAb D32.10 or an irrelevant mAb at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.6). The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.6) containing 5 mg/ml BSA. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed six times with TBS/Tween. 4-Fold serial dilutions of each phage clone were added to each well of the microtiter plate in a final volume of 100 μl of TBS/Tween, starting with 1012 virions in the first well of a row and ending with 2 × 105 virions in the twelfth well. The plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with agitation and then washed six times with TBS/Tween as described above. The bound phage were detected in a sandwich assay using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody at a 1:5000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences). The plates were developed using a commercial color kit (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) containing o-phenylenediamine and H2O2. After 10 min of incubation, the plates were read at 492 nm with an ELISA plate reader. For each phage clone dilution, the results are expressed as the difference between the value obtained with mAb D32.10 and the value obtained with the irrelevant monoclonal antibody. The results were then confirmed by testing optimal dilutions of the immunoreactive clones in triplicate. Sequence Analysis—The amino acid sequences of peptides were compared with the HCV E1 and E2 protein sequences using MacVector Version 4.5 software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Basically, the regions of highest similarity were detected with the LFASTA program, which tentatively searches for best local identities (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9363) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis on Nitrocellulose Using Spot Technology—The simultaneous synthesis of different peptide sequences was performed on a nitrocellulose membrane using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry (19Frank R D.R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Each peptide was generated in nanomolar quantities suitable for immunological detection. Antibody reactivity with membrane-bound peptides was analyzed by an indirect colorimetric immunoassay as described previously (20Jolivet-Reynaud C. Dalbon P. Viola F. Yvon S. Paranhos-Baccala G. Piga N. Bridon L. Trabaud M.A. Battail N. Sibai G. Jolivet M. J. Med. Virol. 1998; 56: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Spots corresponding to peptides with antibody reactivity produced a positive blue signal. Intensity of spots was estimated by visualization and expressed as relative intensity on a scale ranging from 0 to 5. ELISA with Synthetic Peptides and Human Sera—Wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of streptavidin at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% goat serum. The plates were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) before adding 100 μl of biotinylated peptide solution (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 37 °C. After another wash with PBS/Tween, 100 μl of serum diluted 1:50 in PBS/Tween containing 10% goat serum were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed again with PBS/Tween. The peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was then added at a 1:5000 dilution in PBS/Tween containing 10% goat serum. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed once more with PBS/Tween. The plates were developed using the commercial BioMérieux color kit containing o-phenylenediamine and H2O2. After 10 min of incubation, the plates were read at 492 nm with an ELISA plate reader. The values are the mean absorbance in triplicate. mAb D32.10 Recognizes Native Serum-derived HCV1a and HCV1b Particles—Four different HCV RNA-positive enriched pellet preparations (HCV1, HCV2, HCV3, and HCV4) were obtained as previously described2 from three different patients (L., F., and Fan.) and tested by EIA for their recognition by mAb D32.10. As shown in Fig. 1, mAb D32.10 detected up to 10 ng of protein/ml of each preparation. The detection was linear between 10 μg and 100 ng or 1 μg and 10 ng/ml protein. HCV1 (the immunogen, genotype 1b) and HCV2 were two preparations derived from the same patient (L.). HCV3 (F.) and HCV4 (Fan.) were obtained from two other patients with severe cutaneous vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, and chronic hepatitis C requiring plasma exchanges. The patient Fan. (HCV4) was initially found to have two distinct genotypes in serum, 1a and 2a (21Trepo C. Berthillon P. Vitvitski L. Ann. Oncol. 1998; 9: 469-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results show that mAb D32.10. is able to recognize determinants not restricted to genotype 1b of the immunogen. mAb D32.10 Reacts with Large E1E2 Complexes and E1 and E2 Glycoproteins—Using the immunogen (HCV1) as an anti-genic probe, the HCV polypeptide specificity of mAb D32.10 was tested by immunoblot analysis under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A). When two concentrations of the same sample (2.5 and 5 μg) (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were analyzed under reducing conditions (2% SDS + 5% β-mercaptoethanol), mAb D32.10 recognized major bands at 60–68 kDa and another band at 31 kDa, corresponding to E2 and E1, respectively. mAb D32.10 also recognized disulfide-linked complexes recovered in the upper part of the gel (>200 kDa) when the HCV1 preparation was treated with 2% SDS only. These high molecular mass bands (lane 1) could correspond to heterooligomeric E1E2 complexes.2 Asparagine-linked complex-type sugar chains have been shown to be present on the surface of native virions of HCV (14Sato K. Okamoto H. Aihara S. Hoshi Y. Tanaka T. Mishiro S. Virology. 1993; 196: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); thus, the ability of mAb D32.10 to recognize HCV-specific proteins after treatment of the HCV1 preparation with peptide N-glycosidase A at different concentrations (20, 10, and 5 milliunits/ml) was examined. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 1–3, respectively), mAb D32.10 reacted with all of the deglycosylation products of E1 (28, 25, 23, and 21 kDa), but especially with the 25-kDa (twice glycosylated) and 21-kDa (non-glycosylated) species, which accumulated at the highest concentration of the enzyme. Although E1-related products could be clearly detected by mAb D32.10 after deglycosylation, neoformed E2-related products were not identified after the treatment. The sensitivity of E1E2 complexes expressed on natural HCV particles to Endo H digestion was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2C, only a diffuse shift in molecular mass was observed for both E2 (from 68 to 42 kDa) and E1 (from 34 to 24 kDa) proteins, suggesting that E1 and E2 on serum-derived native HCV particles possess mainly a complex Endo H-resistant glycosylation. Epitope Mapping of mAb D32.10 Using Phage Display—To further characterize the epitope recognized by mAb D32.10, the antibody was used to screen a phage display dodecapeptide library. After three rounds of selection, 4% the phage input was found in the eluate, indicating amplification of specifically bound phage. Thus, 88 clones were randomly isolated; their DNAs were sequenced; and the amino acid sequences of inserts were deduced. Forty-eight different sequences were obtained, and some of them were found in several examples. However, when tested in an ELISA for their immunoreactivity with mAb D32.10, none of them gave a positive signal, indicating that the binding affinity was too low to be detectable. The 48 clone sequences were compared with the sequences of HCV E1 and E2. Five and three sequences presented similarities to residues of E1 located in regions 292–305 and 347–356, respectively (Table I) whereas seven, four, and two sequences shared some similarities with residues of E2 located in regions 481–501, 610–631, and 685–698, respectively (Table II). Moreover, as shown in Table III, three of these different motifs shared similarities with both E1-(292–305) and E2-(482–499) or E2-(612–626), and two of them shared similarities with both E1-(347–356) and E2-(482–499) or E2-(612–626).Table IAmino acid similarities between selected phage clones and E1 sequencesTable IIAmino acid similarities between selected phage clones and E2 sequencesTable IIAmino acid similarities between selected phage clones and E2 sequencesTable IIIAmino acid similarities between phage clones and both E1 and E2 sequencesE1-(292-305), E2-(482-499/612-626)Clone 1SP LRHYELPLIQClone 4SQRSRHW HDVPKClone 11TSQPR WHQKPATE1-(347-356), E2-(482-499/612-626)Clone 6WK M PRA TDWNL RClone 8WK M PRA TDWNL R Open table in a new tab Immunoreactivity of Selected Phage-displayed E1 and E2 Sequences with mAb D32.10 —To evaluate the significance of these different localizations on both E1 and E2 sequences, regions 291–315 and 347–356 of E1 and regions 473–498, 607–627, and 686–697 of E2 were reproduced by the Spotscan approach as overlapping synthetic pentadecapeptides offset by one and tested for their immunoreactivity with mAb D32.10. A strong positive signal was obtained with peptides corresponding to E1-(292–306) (Table IV, part A), whereas E1-(347–356) was not recognized by mAb D32.10 (data not shown). As shown in Tables V (part A) and VI (part A), peptides corresponding to E2-(482–499) and E2-(612–626), respectively, were also immunoreactive with mAb D32.10, and no signal was detected with E2-(686–697) (data not shown). The immunoreactive E1 and E2 regions were reproduced as overlapping octapeptides. Indeed, the immunoreactivity of E1-(292–306) (pentadecapeptide TFSPRRHWTTQGCNC) could by restricted to 297RHWTTQGCNC306 (Table IV, part B), and that of E2-(608–622) (pentadecapeptide LVDYPYRLWHYPCTI) to 613YRLWHYPCT621 (Table VI, part B). However, as shown in Table V (part B), overlapping octapeptides corresponding to E2-(480–494) (pentadecapeptide PDQRPYCWHYPPKPC) gave two non-overlapping zones of weaker immunoreactivity: 479GPDQRPYC486 and 487WHYPPKPC494, indicating that the recognition of each octapeptide by mAb D32.10 is partial. Indeed, it is difficult to discriminate between E2-(480–494) and E2-(613–621) because these two regions contain the same motif (WHYP) reported by Yagnik et al. (10Yagnik A.T. Lahm A. Meola A.

A residue was defined as critical to binding if its replacement with alanine induced a decrease of at least 50% in the signal of the corresponding peptide compared with the unmodified peptide. As shown in Fig. 3, for the three peptides, the only critical residues were Cys306, Cys494, and Cys620, respectively, whereas the replacement of Cys304 and Cys486 with alanine in peptides 292–306 and 480–494, respectively, had no effect. Regarding the contribution to antibody binding of the conserved residues between the phage-displayed peptides and the E1 and E2 proteins, the absence of an effect of the corresponding alanine analogs on the respective immunoreactivities of the three peptides is in agreement with the fact that the peptides displayed on phage did not give a detectable signal by themselves because they did not contain any Cys residue. Indeed, according to the manufacturer, the low frequency of Cys in the Ph.D.-12™ library (0.4% instead of 5–10% for the other amino acids) does not favor the selection of peptides with Cys. However, as this library provides an increased window of randomness, it allows the target to select sequences with multiple weak contacts instead of a few strong interactions. In conclusion, these results suggest that, in sequences 292–306, 480–494, and 608–622, Cys306, Cys494, and Cys620 are the only residues that react strongly with the antibody, whereas the other amino acids contribute equally and more weakly to the binding. Immunoreactivity of the Selected E1 and E2 Sequences with Human Sera—E1-(292–306), E2-(480–494), and E2-(608–622), corresponding to the bound peptides that gave the greatest signals with mAb D32.10 in the Spotscan approach, were reproduced as biotinylated synthetic peptides. To validate the localization of the mAb D32.10 epitope, we assessed the availability of these sequences on the viral particle surface as well as their potential immunogenicity during i"

Since it was discovered in 1978, the enzyme has been widely investigated from the mechanistic and physiological viewpoints because the substrate is a precursor of the plant hormone ethylene and the enzymatic reaction includes a cyclopropane ring-opening. We have previously reported the crystal structure of the native enzyme. Here we report the crystal structures of the two reaction intermediates created by the mutagenesis complexed with the substrate. The substrate was validated in the active site of two forms: 1) covalent-bonded external aldimine with the coenzyme in the K51T form and 2) the non-covalent interaction around the coenzyme in the Y295F form. The orientations of the substrate in both structures were quite different form each other. In concert with other site-specific mutation experiments, this experiment revealed the ingenious and unique strategies that are used to achieve the specific activity. The substrate incorporated into the active site is reactivated by a two-phenol charge relay system to lead to the formation of a Schiff base with the coenzyme.

The catalytic Lys51 residue may play a novel role to abstract the methylene proton from the substrate in cooperation with other factors, the carboxylate group of the substrate and the electron-adjusting apparatuses of the coenzyme.

Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is responsible for the initiation of fruit-ripening and for regulating many other plant developmental processes. In higher plants, the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis (Fig. 1) is initiated with the conversion of the methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (2Yu Y.B. Adams D.O. Yang S.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) by methionine adenosyltransferase followed by the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine to ACC by ACC synthase, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. ACC is oxidized by mononuclear iron dependent-ACC oxydase (3Zhang Z. Barlow J.N. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15999-16007Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to ethylene in the final step.In a soil bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP, ACC was also converted to α-ketobutyrate and ammonia by a bacterial enzyme when ACC was the sole nitrogen source for the growth of this bacterium (4Honma M.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5260-5265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This degradation is catalyzed by another PLP-dependent enzyme, ACC deaminase (ACCD, EC 4.1.99.4), which has a special ability to break the cyclopropane ring preceding deamination (Fig. 2). The possibility of symbiosis between the plants and the soil bacterium has also been mentioned (6Glick B.R. Jacobson C.B. Schwarze M.M.K. Pasternak J.J. Can. J.

The introduction of ACCD in higher plants by gene technology reduced the production level of ethylene and delayed the ripening progression of fruits (8Klee H.J. Hayford M.B. Kretzmer K.A. Barry G.F.

These include transamination, racemization, deamination, decarboxylation, and the elimination or replacement of the β- and the γ-substituent groups besides oligosaccharide or polysaccharide phosphorolysis. According to Jansonius (15Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) or Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database (16Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structures of the PLP enzyme are classified into five folding types. The structure of ACCD from yeast H. saturnus (yACCD) (17Yao M. Ose T. Sugimoto H. Horiuchi A. Nakagawa A. Wakatsuki S. Yokoi D. Murakami T. Honma M. Tanaka I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The cyclopropane ring-opening reaction of ACCD is regarded as a special case of γ-elimination (4Honma M. Shimomura T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1978; 42: 1825-1831Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Walsh C.T. Pascal J.R.A. Johonston M. Raines R. Dikshit D. Krantz A. Honma M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7509-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), but ACCD also catalyzes d-serine deamination, which involves β-elimination. This seems to be consistent with the perception that all of the members of the TRPSβ family catalyze the β-replacement/elimination of the substrate amino acid.The active sites of PLP enzymes are conservative in the catalytic lysine residue and phosphate-binding cap (24Denesyuk A.I. Denessiouk K.A. Korpela T. Johnson M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but their active sites are diverse for recognizing a variety of substrates and promoting the reactions. Most of the PLP enzymes (except in the case of the glycogen phosphorylase family (25Weber I.T. Johnson L.N. Wilson K.S. Yeates D.G. Wild D.L. Jenkins J.A. Nature. 1978; 274: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) keep the basic chemical processes of the PLP catalysis: formation of an external aldimine between C4′ of PLP and the α-amino group of the substrate, the electron-withdrawing role of the pyridine ring as an electron sink, and the nucleophilic attack on the α-substituent of an α-carbon or α-carboxylate group. In the case of ACCD, the substrate has no α-hydrogen and the carboxyl group is retained in the product, ruling out the above ordinary process. Evidence from kinetic studies and NMR spectroscopy has been accumulated to explain the specificity of the enzyme reaction and to propose hypotheses regarding the cyclopropane ring-opening process (4Honma M. Shimomura T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1978; 42: 1825-1831Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Walsh C.T. Pascal J.R.A. Johonston M. Raines R. Dikshit D. Krantz A. Honma M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7509-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).In this study, we report the crystal structures of yACCD mutants in complex with the substrate ACC. These structures of the enzyme-ACC complexes as well as the enzymatic activity from other mutant forms have provided new information regarding the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. From these findings, we present a hypothesis to explain the unique process of the cyclopropane ring-opening reaction of ACCD.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutagenesis and Enzyme Purification—All of the expression vectors of yACCD mutants were constructed using two-step PCR, and the resulting mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dRho-damine kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA introduced in phagemid pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) was used as the PCR template. The expression vectors pET11d (Stratagene) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) to overexpress the mutated proteins. The mutant proteins were purified using a protocol described previously (12Minami R. Uchiyama K. Murakami T. Kawai J. Mikami K. Yamada T. Yokoi D. Ito H. Matsui H. Honma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Among the designed, the solubilized and purified derivatives were K51T, S78A, Y269F, Y295F, and E296Q.Assay of ACC Deaminase—The activity of ACC deamination was assayed by measurement of α-ketobutyrate formed from 50 mm ACC as described previously (4Honma M. Shimomura T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1978; 42: 1825-1831Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme is the forming activity of 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 30 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) and by absorbance at 280 nm using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ACC was synthesized following the previous procedure (27Burroughs L.F. Nature. 1957; 179: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Crystallization—We crystallized three types of yACCD substituents: K51T-PLP, K51T-PLP-ACC, and Y295F-PLP-ACC. The protein was stored at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in a solution containing 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 100 μm PLP. Crystals of yACCD mutants and mutant-substrate complexes with cofactor PLP were grown by the vapor diffusion method. The K51T-ACC and Y295F-ACC complexes were prepared by mixing the enzymes with 20 mm ACC. Prior to crystallization, the enzyme concentrations were adjusted to 15–20 mg/ml. Crystals were grown in the dark at room temperature using the hanging drop geometry by mixing equal volumes (3 μl) of protein and reservoir solutions. The sample buffer contained 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mm PLP, and 5% glycerol, and the reservoir contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4–8.0) with 2.2 m ammonium sulfate. None of the conditions was substantially different from the native one.X-ray Data Collection and Refinement—The diffraction data sets of mutational and complexed crystals, which had been prereacted by soaking in 25–30% sucrose in a reservoir solution for a few minutes, were collected at the beamline BL41XU of the SPring-8 with a MARCCD detector. The wavelength chosen in all of the data set collection was 1.000 Å with flash-frozen technique at 100 K. The diffraction data sets were integrated and scaled using the MOSFLM and SCALA programs (28Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Crystals of the three types were all grown under similar conditions, varying only in the absence or presence of substrate. The cell parameters, data statistics, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. In every case, a small lack of isomorphism was detected compared with the wild type (space group C2221), but it was possible to use the wild-type model as a direct phasing model for refinement.Table IData statisticsPDB codeK51T 1J0CK51T-ACC 1J0DY295F-ACC 1J0EData collectionWavelength (Å)1.01.01.0Resolution range (Å)38-2.75 (2.90-2.75)38-2.20 (2.32-2.20)38-2.45 (2.58-2.45)Space groupC2221C2221C2221Unit-cell parameters (Å)a = 65.17, b = 268.26, c = 186.77a = 65.25, b = 267.29, c = 187.68a = 65.40, b = 269.59, c = 186.91No. of observations241,451 (35,018)356,148 (45,758)302,793 (41,102)No. of unique reflections43,138 (6,182)76,220 (10,134)60,876 (8,689)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.6)91.6 (84.1)99.4 (98.6)Multiplicity5.6 (5.7)4.7 (4.5)5.0 (4.7)Averaged I/σ(I)7.9 (2.5)11.0 (2.4)9.8 (2.2)R measaR meas = Σh[(m - 1)/m]½Σj|〈I〉h - Ih,j |/ΣhΣj Ih,j , where 〈I〉h is the mean intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections and m is redundancy.0.073 (0.353)0.068 (0.354)0.076 (0.368)RefinementProtein atoms10,41610,41610,420Water atoms374935939Other atoms608888Resolution range (Å)10-2.7510-2.210-2.0R convbR conv = Σh∥Fo | - |Fc ∥/Σh|Fo |, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively, for the reflection h.0.22430.22100.2022R freecR free is equivalent to R conv for a 8 % test set of reflections as the same indexes as the native data not used in the refinement.0.29850.27890.2631R. m. s. deviationBond lengths (Å)0.00670.00670.0067Bond angles (°)1.291.251.26a R meas = Σh[(m - 1)/m]½Σj|〈I〉h - Ih,j |/ΣhΣj Ih,j , where 〈I〉h is the mean intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections and m is redundancy.b R conv = Σh∥Fo | - |Fc ∥/Σh|Fo |, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively, for the reflection h.c R free is equivalent to R conv for a 8 % test set of reflections as the same indexes as the native data not used in the refinement.

A PLP and an ACC moiety were located from both of the σA-weighted 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps and were used in the last several rounds of refinement.

Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.RESULTSK51T-PLP-ACC Complex Structure—The Schiff base covalent-bond complex of ACC and PLP with K51T mutant enzyme could be recognized on a 1.5σ-contoured Fo – Fc omit map (Fig. 3). Compared with the free wild-type enzyme in which the pyridine of PLP ring tilts toward the phenol ring of Tyr295 by 15°, the pyridine ring rotates to be nearly parallel to the phenol ring (Fig. 3). The existence of bulky planer residues such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and histidine with a nearly parallel position to the pyridine ring has been observed in many PLP enzymes, and they block the movement of PLP so as not to overrotate. However, among the structurally analyzed enzymes of the TRPSβ family, no one has such a tyrosine residue in the active site. The conversion of the internal aldimine to the external aldimine results in a tilt of the pyridine ring by ∼10°. The angle is almost the same as in the case of TRPSβ-substrate complexes compared with a tilt of ∼27° in various PLP-dependent amino acid aminotransferases. As shown in Fig. 3, the nitrogen atom of the ACC amino group exists with a 3.4-Å distance to the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr295. The importance of Tyr295 has been proved by Y295F mutation in which the enzymatic activity was completely lost. The complexed crystal structure of Y295F mutant showed the reason. As described later, the tyrosine residue seems to activate ACC to form the external aldimine.Fig. 3Binding of ACC in two mutants.

Two water molecules (WAT1 and WAT2) were also recognized around the carboxylate of ACC. This entire substrate recognition mechanism was further supported by the fact that the substitution of alanine for Ser78 (S78A) brought the inactivation of the enzyme (data not shown). The water molecules W1 and W2 are hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ile73 and the main-chain amide proton of Gly74, respectively.Structural analysis has been done with the enzyme-ligand complexes from all fold types of the PLP-dependent enzymes. In the analyzed structures with the exception of those of the TRPSβ family members, the carboxylate groups of the substrate amino acids are recognized by the guanidyl group of the Arg residue. The structure of TRPSβ is analyzed in the presence of substrate/product (31Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, no arginine residue is found near the substrate site of yACCD and TRPSβ and groups interacting with the carboxylate of ACC in yACCD are compared with those in TRPSβ. With respect to the carboxylate recognition devices, the basic peptide skeletons that are conserved in both proteins despite the bulkiness of substrate/product are quite different between the two enzymes. Accumulated data show that the architecture used to recognize the substrate is far different between TRPSβ fold family and other PLP fold families.Fig. 4Comparison of active site from four structures in the presence of substrate (or product) amino acid.

Fujino, T. Ose, M. Yao, T. Tokiwano, M. Honma, N. Watanabe, and I. Tahaka, manuscript in preparation. Around the hydrophobic cyclopropane ring of ACC, there are several hydrophobic side chains of Thr202, Ala163, Trp102, and Val201 residues within the van der Waals distance in the K51T-ACC structure. From this structure, we propose the position of the Lys51 of the wild-type enzyme in the reaction intermediate based on the Thr51 residue in the K51T-ACC complex (Fig. 5). A nitrogen atom of the modeled lysine residues can be within the distance of 2.0 Å from the pro-R-metylene carbon of ACC, whereas the corresponding Lys54 residue of PH0054 protein is a distance of 4.7 Å from the pro-R-metylene carbon in the PH0054-ACC complex. No other functional residue of the protein reaches the cyclopropane ring. These figures are important for discussion regarding the catalytic mechanism.Fig. 5A view around active site of which is concerned with incorporated ACC. The charge relay system from two tyrosine residues and the modeling position of Lys51 are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Y295F-PLP-ACC Complex—The σA-weighted Fo – Fc map showed a distinguishable peak of the ACC molecule in the active site of the Y295F-PLP-ACC complex, and the recognition mechanism of ACC can be understood clearly as follows. The residues and waters, which interact with the carboxylate group of ACC, are in the same positions as those of K51T-PLP-ACC. However, the ACC carboxylate group in the active site cavity moves away from Asn79 and Gln80 residues, and the cyclopropane ring of the ACC faces inversely (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, most importantly, the amino group of the ACC does not form the Schiff base with C4′ of PLP.The Pendulum Movement of the PLP— Fig. 6 is the superposition of the PLP moieties in the six crystals of the yACCD wild type, the ACC complexes (of K51T, Y295F, and PH0054), K51T without ACC structure, and the PH0054 wild type. Because the PLP is located between the large and small domains in each structure and each step of the enzymatic reaction brings a slight change of relative position with respect to domains or residues, the figures were prepared based on the superposition of the large domain main chain. The side chains that are stacked on the pyridium ring of PLP in each structure are omitted for clear visibility.Fig. 6The position of PLP in six variations. The color of PLP, protein, and other ligand is conserved per each structure. There are lysine residues in upper right direction and ligands in upper left position. The native yACCD-PLP including sulfate-ion structure is shown in yellow, K51T-PLP is blue, K51T-PLP-ACC is red, Y295F-PLP including ACC is green, PH0054-PLP is dark gray, and PH0054-PLP-ACC is purple.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the structures of the wild-type yACCD (yellow) and the Y295F-ACC complex (dark gray), the PLPs are bonded with Lys51 amino groups in the upper right area in Fig. 6, whereas in the K51T-ACC (red) and PH0054-ACC (purple) complexes, they are complexed with ACC in the upper left area. The maximum rotation angle of the pyridium ring in yACCD is ∼10° between the wild type and the K51T-ACC complex, and slight translational movement is observed among all of the structures. The approximate PLP rotation axis corresponds to the line through the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and the phosphorus atom of the anchor phosphate. This pyridium nitrogen exists within the hydrogen-bonding distance to the side-chain carboxylate oxygen of Glu296. The existence of the carboxylate group in this position is widely seen in PLP-dependent enzymes with the exception of other members of the TRPSβ family or alanine racemase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (32Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe 2.0-Å structure of wild-type yACCD (17Yao M. Ose T. Sugimoto H. Horiuchi A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34557-34565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has revealed the detailed structure in the active site. According to the structure, Tyr269, Tyr295, and Glu296 as well as Lys51 (common features of PLP enzyme) are expected to be important for the enzymatic activity. A previous paper (33Murakami T. Kiuchi M. Ito H. Matsui H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

This spectral change indicates the formation of an external aldimine between PLP and ACC in the mutant enzyme. However, because the absorption band around 500 nm was not found, it was concluded that the pACCD-K51A mutant enzyme does not catalyze a cyclopropane ring-opening reaction.

Although most LIS1 mutations involve deletions, several point mutations with a single amino acid alteration were described. Patients carrying these mutations reveal variable phenotypic manifestations. We have analyzed the functional importance of these point mutations by examining protein stability, folding, intracellular localization, and protein-protein interactions. Our data suggest that the mutated proteins were affected at different levels, and no single assay could be used to predict the lissencephaly phenotype. Most interesting are those mutant proteins that retain partial folding and interactions. In the case of LIS1 mutated in F31S, the cellular phenotype may be modified by overexpression of specific interacting proteins. Overexpression of the PAF-AH α1 subunit dissolved aggregates induced by this mutant protein and increased its half-life. Overexpression of NudE or NudEL localized this mutant protein to spindle poles and kinetochores but had no effect on protein stability. Our results implicate that there are probably different biochemical and cellular mechanisms obstructed in each patient yielding the varied lissencephaly phenotypes.

The functional complexity of the vertebrate cerebral cortex is facilitated by a complicated structural organization. The developmental details of these features are therefore of critical interest. A singular feature of cortical development is the generation of neurons at sites distant from their place of terminal differentiation. Abnormalities in the migration of neurons into the embryonic cortex lead to loss of normal convolutions of the human neocortex, known as lissencephaly. One cause for such an acute brain malformation is mutation(s) in the LIS1 gene (1Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Shen Y. Whenert M. Faustinella F. Dobyns W.B. Caskey C.T. Ledbetter D.H.

Lissencephaly (smooth brain) is a severe abnormality of neuronal migration characterized by absent (agyria) or decreased (pachygyria) convolutions, producing a smooth cerebral surface with thickened cortex (5Dobyns W.B. Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Ledbetter D.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 270: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) is a related disorder in which there are bilateral bands of gray matter interposed in the white matter between the cortex and the lateral ventricles (6Barkovich A.J.

SBH is very common among females with mutations in DCX (2des Portes V. Pinard J.M. Billuart P. Vinet M.C. Koulakoff A. Carrie A. Gelot A. Dupuis E. Motte J. Berwald-Netter Y. Catala M. Kahn A.

Lissencephaly and SBH have been observed in different regions of the same brain, indicating an “agyria-pachygyria-band” spectrum. A grading system characterizes the malformations from grade 1 (most severe) to grade 6 (least severe) (7Dobyns W.B. Truwit C.L. Ross M.E. Matsumoto N. Pilz D.T. Ledbetter D.H. Gleeson J.G. Walsh C.A.

Grade 5 is mixed pachygyria and SBH, whereas grade 6 is SBH alone. Deletions involving LIS1 are far more common than other mutations (8Pilz D.T. Macha M.E. Precht K.S. Smith A.C. Dobyns W.B.

Up to now, only five missense mutations have been found in patients (9Cardoso C. Leventer R.J. Dowling J.J. Ward H.L. Chung J. Petras K.S. Roseberry J.A. Weiss A.M. Das S. Martin C.L. Pilz D.T.

This finding was supported by a study done in cells derived from lissencephaly patients, where no protein was detected from mutated alleles that were expected to result in a truncated protein (12Fogli A.

The five patients with point mutations that lead to a single amino acid substitution in LIS1 exhibit a variable phenotypic manifestation. Thus, the patients are classified from grade 3a to grade 6 (13Lo Nigro C.L. Chong C.S. Smith A.C. Dobyns W.B. Carrozzo R. Ledbetter D.H. Hum. Mol.

LIS1 is a member of the WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeat family of proteins (1Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Shen Y. Whenert M. Faustinella F. Dobyns W.B. Caskey C.T. Ledbetter D.H.

A hallmark of this family is their involvement in multiple protein-protein interactions (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), and LIS1 is not an exception (reviewed in Ref. 17Reiner O. Neuron. 2000; 28: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). LIS1 contains an N-terminal region of 94 amino acids that includes a Lis-H domain (LIS1 homology domain amino acids 8–37) (18Emes R.D. Ponting C.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 51–79) important for dimerization (19Cahana A. Escamez T. Nowakowski R.S. Hayes N.L.

The patient has grade 4a(1) lissencephaly manifested by generalized pachygyria with the additional feature of moderate hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, an unusual finding for patients with LIS1 mutations. Three mutations, H149R (13Lo Nigro C.L. Chong C.S. Smith A.C. Dobyns W.B. Carrozzo R. Ledbetter D.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), G162S (10Cardoso C.

The patient with mutation H149R has the most severe LIS grade and clinical phenotype of the five patients with missense mutations (grade 3a). The patient with mutation G162S has an unusually mild form of LIS (grade 4a(2)), with a normal IQ, infrequent seizures, and mild clumsiness as his only motor deficit. The patient with mutation S169P is the only known patient with subcortical band heterotopia secondary to a LIS1 mutation and is thus classified as grade 6a. It has been suggested that the patient exhibits somatic mosaicism (14Pilz D.T. Kuc J. Matsumoto N. Bodurtha J. Bernadi B. Tassinari C.A. Dobyns W.B. Ledbetter D.H. Hum. Mol.

LIS1-protein interactions may be grouped conceptually into two classes: evolutionarily conserved and relatively new interactions. Much can be learned from the interactions that are conserved throughout evolution (20Morris N.R. Efimov V.P. Xiang X.

Other gene products involved in the same pathway are subunits of the microtubule-based motor protein cytoplasmic dynein, or its regulatory complex dynactin (28Beckwith S.M. Roghi C.H. Liu B.

Furthermore, LIS1 colocalize with NudC, NudEL, mNudE, and γ-tubulin at the centrosome and could control the microtubule nucleation (25Sasaki S. Shionoya A. Ishida M. Gambello M. Yingling J.

All these results indicate a conserved mechanism from nuclear movement in the fungus and flies to neuronal migration in the brain. An additional LIS1-interacting protein that is functioning in the dynein/dynactin pathway is CLIP-170 (37Coquelle F.M. Caspi M. Cordelieres F.P. Dompierre J.P. Dujardin D.L. Koifman C. Martin P.

We also detected an interaction between LIS1 and doublecortin (DCX) that mutations in this gene product also result in lissencephaly (38Caspi M. Atlas R. Kantor A. Sapir T. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2205-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another well documented interaction is between LIS1 and the two catalytic subunits (α1 and α2) of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) Ib (39Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai N.

Based on the Drosophila homologs, this interaction is relatively new in evolution, as Drosophila α-subunit lacks both catalytic activity and the ability to interact with Drosophila LIS1 (41Sheffield P.

Taking into consideration our current knowledge regarding LIS1 function, we believe it is important to analyze how these five missense mutations affect protein half-life, cellular localization, and protein-protein interaction. That will promote our understanding as to how the disease is manifested in lissencephaly patients.

The cells were washed and collected in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Immunoprecipitations were performed using M2 beads (Sigma), run on 10% PAGE gels. The gels were fixed, and the signal was enhanced by 30-min incubation with sodium salicylate solution (16%), dried, and exposed to phosphoimager (BAS-2500, Fujifilm). The signal was quantified using phosphoimager analysis, and the results were plotted. The half-life was deduced from the plotted results. Trypsin Cleavage—LIS1 protein (wild-type and mutations) was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte TnT system (Promega, Madison, WI) with [35S]methionine. A portion of the labeled reaction (10 μl) was used for tryptic cleavage as described (11Sapir T. Eisenstein M. Burgess H.A. Horesh D. Cahana A. Aoki J. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. Reiner O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). His 6 Pull-down Assay—Recombinant His6 proteins were incubated with transfected 293 cell extract (prepared as described) or rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Pull-down assay was performed as described (38Caspi M. Atlas R. Kantor A. Sapir T. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2205-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assay—Immunoprecipitation was preformed in 293 cells using M2 beads (Sigma). Cells were co-transfected with LIS1-FLAG-DsRed (wild-type or mutated) and each of the interacting proteins. Transfected cell extracts were prepared in IP buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Each 10-cm plate was washed with PBS, put on ice, and scraped with 1 ml of cold IP buffer. The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and were vortexed for 10 s every 5 min. After centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, sample buffer was added and the beads were boiled. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the suitable combination of antibodies (α-LIS1 (monoclonal clone 210; Ref. 35Sapir T. Elbaum M. Reiner O.

Yeast Two-hybrid—Yeast transformation and detection of interactions were performed according to manual (OriGene Technologies, Inc.); briefly, three plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48; pEG-202-bait, pJG4-5-prey and pSH18-34-LacZ (from the DupLEX-A system, OriGene Technologies, Inc.). The baits were LIS1 wild type or one of the five mutations, and the preys were PAF-AH α1, PAF-AH α2, CLIP-170, and NudEL. The yeast cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, harvested at 1500 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in TE (one third of initial volume). The cells were then pelleted again, resuspended in the same volume of TE/LiOAc, and rotated slowly at 30 °C for 2 h. Afterward, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in TE, 0.1 m LiOAc (100 μl/transformation). The desired bait and prey plasmids plus the LacZ plasmid and 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added to the cells. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, 500 μl of TE, 0.1 m LiOAc, 50% PEG-3350 was added to each tube and the cells were incubated for 45 more min. Heat shock was performed at 42 °C for 5 min, and the cells were then spun down, resuspended in TE, and plated on glucose-based plates lacking His, Trp, and Ura (SD-H-T-U). The plates were incubated at 30 °C 2–3 days until colonies appeared. From each interaction 4–5 colonies were streaked on galactose-based plates (SG-H-T-U) containing 1 mg/ml X-gal and incubated overnight at 30 °C until the appearance of a blue color. WD Binding to Microtubules—Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was assembled into microtubules with addition of Taxol® (paclitaxel; final concentration 30 μm) or nocodazole (10 μg/ml) as described (44Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Caspi M. Grayer Wolf S. Elbaum M. Chelly J. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The assembled microtubules were mixed with 10 μl of [35S]methioninelabeled proteins (LIS1 and the different WD peptides) translated in the rabbit reticulocyte TnT system (Promega). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and separated into two fractions as described (44Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Caspi M. Grayer Wolf S. Elbaum M. Chelly J. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The insoluble fractions (pellets) of each experiment were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). After destaining the gels were washed with H2O for 20 min and the signal was enhanced by 30-min incubation with sodium salicylate solution (16%) at room temperature. LIS1 is an essential protein that controls multiple cellular functions through participation in different protein complexes. Deciphering the precise details of LIS1-protein interaction modes under normal and abnormal conditions may allow us to better understand processes of neuronal migration and brain development. For this analysis the existence of several disease causing amino acid substitutions was utilized. Our analysis included several assays to determine whether there were global effects of amino acid substitutions; protein folding was tested by limited trypsin cleavage, LIS1 stability was monitored by examining protein degradation, and its intracellular localization was inspected by immunostaining. To resolve whether LIS1 mutations affect specific protein interactions, we first mapped domains of interaction between LIS1 and some of its protein partners. The described protein mutants were then used to test whether they retain the ability to bind these known interacting proteins. LIS1 Folding—It has been shown that multiple WD-containing proteins (including LIS1) retain the β-propeller-like structure similar to the β-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (45Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the WD-containing region is protected when these proteins are subjected to limited proteolytic cleavage. In the following assay, LIS1 carrying the different mutations was expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocytes and labeled with [35S]methionine. When the lysate was subjected to limited trypsin treatment, three protected bands were visible in case of the wild type LIS1 protein (Fig. 1), as has been observed before (45Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

To scavenge growth-limiting iron from the host, the pathogen utilizes the periplasmic ferric ion-binding protein A (PhFbpA) as a component of an ATP-binding cassette transport pathway. We report the 1.2-Å structure of the iron-free (apo) form of PhFbpA, which is a member of the transferrin structural superfamily. The protein structure adopts a closed conformation, allowing us to reliably assign putative iron-coordinating residues. Based on our analysis, PhFbpA utilizes a unique constellation of binding site residues and anions to octahedrally coordinate an iron atom. A surprising finding in the structure is the presence of two formate anions on opposite sides of the iron-binding pocket. The formate ions tether the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein and stabilize the closed structure, also providing clues as to probable candidates for synergistic anions in the iron-loaded state.

PhFbpA represents a new class of bacterial iron-binding proteins. Pasteurella haemolytica is the causative agent of the bovine respiratory disease called shipping fever or pneumonic pasteurellosis (1Whiteley L.O. Maheswaran S.K. Weiss D.J. Ames T.R. Kannan M.S. J. Vet. Intern. Med. 1992; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis is the final stage of a complex multifactorial process typically involving stress and infectious organisms leading to pneumonia in cattle. Respiratory disease is a major cause of morbidity in the cattle industry resulting in a significant economic loss. In healthy cattle, P. haemolytica is present in low numbers in the nasal passages. However, following stress conditions such as shipment, commingling cattle from different sources, and overcrowding, respiratory disease may result in which the opportunistic pathogen P. haemolytica is the predominant bacteria isolated and responsible for acute lung injury (1Whiteley L.O. Maheswaran S.K. Weiss D.J. Ames T.R. Kannan M.S. J. Vet. Intern. Med. 1992; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Ames T.R. Markham R.J. Opuda-Asibo J. Leininger J.R. Maheswaran S.K. Can. J. Comp. Med. 1985; 49: 395-400PubMed Google Scholar). While under stress, proliferation of P. haemolytica is facilitated, leading to infection of the upper respiratory tract and eventual colonization of the lower airway (3Marchart J. Rehagen M. Dropmann G. Szostak M.P. Alldinger S. Lechleitner S. Schlapp T. Resch S. Lubitz W. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the past, vaccine trials aimed at preventing disease due to P. haemolytica have met with difficulties and limited success (4Conlon J.A. Shewen P.E. Lo R.Y.C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gilmour N.J.L. Martin W.B. Sharp J.M. Thompson D.A. Wells P.W. Donachie W. Res. Vet. Sci. 1983; 35: 80-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigators have noted that for many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, iron acquisition directly corresponds to virulence (6Crosa J.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Weinberg E.D. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 65-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Iron is an integral nutrient for the survival of nearly all organisms and is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic and enzymatic processes (7Weinberg E.D. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 65-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, researchers believe that proteins expressed under iron-limited conditions may be essential for bacterial survival and may ultimately serve as therapeutic targets. Iron is abundant in the environment and should not be a limiting factor for growth. However, under aerobic conditions and at neutral or alkaline pH, aqueous iron precipitates as an insoluble Fe3+ hydroxide. Furthermore, free iron can generate toxic derivatives within the body (9Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is vital that biological systems maintain control of the chemical environment of iron. The mammalian host utilizes the monomeric, bilobal, and iron-binding glycoproteins transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TbpA, Tf-binding protein A; TbpB, transferrin-binding protein B; Fbp, ferric ion-binding protein; PhFbpA, P. haemolytica ferric ion-binding protein; PEG, polyethylene glycol; HiFbpA, H. influenzae periplasmic FbpA; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PLBP, periplasmic ligand-binding protein. (in sera) and lactoferrin (on mucosal surfaces) to limit the amount of free iron available to pathogens and transport iron throughout the body. In response to the problem of iron scarcity, the extracellular Gram-negative pathogens of the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae families have developed high affinity iron acquisition systems to obtain this essential nutrient (10Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 471-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Three components are involved in the successful uptake of iron from the eukaryotic host Tf as follows: (i) an outer membrane Tf receptor complex; (ii) an inner membrane-associated TonB complex; and (iii) an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type ferric ion transporter system. The host-specific bacterial outer membrane Tf receptor is composed of two proteins, Tf-binding proteins A (TbpA) and B (TbpB) (11Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The TbpB receptor component is largely an extracellular hydrophilic macromolecule, which is anchored to the outer membrane through a lipidated tail (11Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). TbpA is a TonB-dependent integral membrane protein that is proposed to mediate transport of iron across the outer membrane. The transport of iron across the outer membrane requires the presence of a functional TonB protein (12Jarosik G.P. Maciver I. Hansen E.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 710-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the removal of iron from transferrin and translocation across the outer membrane, the ferric ion is complexed by a periplasmic ferric ionbinding protein (FbpA). Studies have revealed the function of FbpA in complexing and transporting iron across the periplas mic space (13Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Kirby S.D. Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Kirby S.D. Lainson F.A. Donachie W. Okabe A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as the periplasmic component of the iron ABC transport system (16Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ABC family of transporters includes a broad and diverse group of import systems found in prokaryotes. ABC transporters generally consist of separate polypeptides that form an A1B2C2 complex at the inner membrane of the cell during transport. Thus, in order for the ferric ion to reach the cytoplasm, it is donated to an inner membrane complex consisting of the inner transmembrane protein FbpB and the cytoplasmic ATPase FbpC. This high affinity bacterial iron uptake system results in iron from host transferrin being liberated at the cell surface, translocated through the periplasmic space, and deposited into the cytoplasm for use or storage without the incorporation of the transferrin protein into the bacterial cell. Because the FbpABC pathway appears to be a common route for ferric iron uptake from several different sources, it is a particularly attractive therapeutic target. Identification of the gene encoding PhFbpA was based on complementation of an entA Escherichia coli strain transformed with a P. haemolytica λZAP II library-derived plasmid (15Kirby S.D. Lainson F.A. Donachie W. Okabe A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the fbpA gene confirmed homology with the cluster I group of the periplasmic binding protein family (15Kirby S.D. Lainson F.A. Donachie W. Okabe A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its homology to FbpA molecules of other organisms, PhFbpA has a peak-visible absorbance at 419 nm, which is significantly blue-shifted relative to the peak absorbance for other FbpAs (13Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Adhikari P. Kirby S.D. Nowalk A.J. Veraldi K.L. Schryvers A.B. Mietzner T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 42: 25142-25149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PhFbpA shares approximately the same iron affinity as transferrin and other FbpA molecules based on citrate competition assays (15Kirby S.D. Lainson F.A. Donachie W. Okabe A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, current evidence indicates that PhFbpA binds and transports Fe3+ ion, utilizing a unique iron-coordinating environment when compared with transferrin or any other biochemically characterized FbpA molecules. In this study, we describe the 1.2-Å resolution structure of PhFbpA. This is the first example of a closed apoFbpA molecule. Although the structure does not contain a metal atom, the putative metal coordinating residues are clearly evident. The current structure explains how this protein may coordinate iron and the possible locations and identities of synergistic anions. Purification and Crystallization Procedures—E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS harboring the pT7–7 plasmid encoding FbpA was utilized to express the native P. haemolytica 35-kDa ferric ion-binding protein A in the periplasm under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. A selenomethionine version was also produced using the same plasmid in an E. coli strain that is a methionine auxotroph. This strain was grown overnight at 37 °C on M9 minimal media supplemented with ampicillin to 100 μg/ml and methionine to 40 μg/ml. The following day, the culture was inoculated to LeMaster's media. The medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), selenomethionine (40 μg/ml), and Isovitalex to a 1% v/v final concentration. The culture was grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C and the following day inoculated to fresh media to an A 600 of 0.05 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside once the culture reached an A 600 of 0.5. The culture was grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C, and cells were harvested the following day. Both versions of protein were then purified using a modified osmotic shock procedure (18Shouldice S.R. Dougan D.R. Skene R.J. Tari L.W. McRee D.E. Yu R.-H. Schryvers A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11513-11519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The supernatant was carefully removed without disrupting the pellet because the supernatant contains the periplasmic osmotic shock fraction. Finally, the sample was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.0, at 4 °C. Following dialysis, the protein sample was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on the Akta fast protein liquid chromatography system as a final purification step. The column was washed with 20 volumes of 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.0, to remove unbound proteins and eluted with a gradient of 0–1.6 m NaCl. The material collected from the column was concentrated to a final volume of between 1 and 3 ml using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator. At this point, the protein still in the Centricon was exhaustively exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Once completed, the samples were concentrated to a final concentration of ∼25 mg/ml. The resulting preparations were deemed pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Protein samples were stored at –80 °C until they were used for crystallography. The sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed for crystallization of the proteins. The selenomethionyl-PhFbpA crystallization experiments used 2 μl of sitting drops containing 1 μl selenomethionyl-FbpA and 1 μl of reservoir mixture equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir. Crystals of the protein grew at 20 °C in 96 h from a drop-containing protein (8.5% PEG 5000 and 0.1 m sodium-HEPES, pH 7.0) that was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 17% PEG 5000 and 0.2 m sodium-HEPES, pH 7.0. Diffraction quality crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212 (a = 69.4 Å; b = 106.2 Å; c = 89.84 Å). Crystals of native PhFbpA were grown at 4 °C from nanovolume drops using the proprietary high throughput protein crystallization platform developed at Syrrx Inc. Each vapor-diffusion experiment used 100-nl sitting drops containing 50 nl of PhFbpA and 50 nl of reservoir mixture equilibrated against a 100-μl reservoir. Colorless crystals of the native protein grew in 72 h from a drop-containing protein (10% PEG 3350 and 0.1 m magnesium formate, pH 5.9) that was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 m magnesium formate, pH 5.9. These crystals were suitable for x-ray diffraction and belonged to the orthorhombic space group C2221 (a = 97.2 Å; b = 189.3 Å; c = 45.8 Å). Crystal Harvesting and Data Collection—The crystals were harvested by scooping them with a nylon loop. The native crystal was then dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 0.2 m magnesium formate, pH 5.9, for ∼30 s before they were cooled in liquid nitrogen, whereas the selenomethionine crystal was frozen by dipping the crystals in the crystallization mother liquor supplemented with 35% PEG 400. Crystals were kept at 100 K during data collection by use of a nitrogen gas stream. Native diffraction data were collected from a crystal of the PhFbpA sample using an ADSC Quantum 4 detector at beamline 5.0.3 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) using a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The three-wavelength selenium-multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data sets were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beamline 9-2. The data for all of the experiments were reduced and scaled using the HKL2000 software (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 267: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—Crystals of the selenomethionyl protein were of highly variable quality and diffracted to poor resolution (2.8–3.5-Å resolution). In addition, the subsequent structure determination revealed that the lattice was comprised of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, one ordered molecule and one that was dynamically disordered. However, the selenomethionyl protein crystals were of sufficient quality to obtain an initial trace of the protein that was used to solve the native structure. The selenium sites were located using the program SnB (20Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar).

Restrained refinement using a maximum likelihood target function and anisotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out. During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (Fo – Fc maps) were used to place the bound ethylene glycol, formate, and water molecules. The final crystallographic R-factor is 0.171 for all of the data from 35.3–1.2-Å resolution. The free R calculated using 5% of the data is 0.195. Structure Analysis—The refined coordinates of P. haemolytica FbpA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Ramachandran plots show the satisfactory location of all of the residues into allowed regions of conformational space. The DALI server (www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali) was utilized in to find structurally similar proteins in the Fold classification based on Structure-Structure alignment of Proteins (FSSP) data base (27Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Solution—The recombinant PhFbpA mutant protein was isolated from the periplasm of E. coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Following purification, protein samples were concentrated to 25 mg/ml prior to crystallization. Crystals of a selenomethionyl-PhFbpA derivative were used to obtain an initial model. However, the crystals of the selenomethionyl protein diffracted poorly because of the fact that one of the molecules of the two in the asymmetric unit was highly disordered. This necessitated the search for a new crystal form. A superior crystal form was found for the native protein using the Syrrx high throughput nanovolume sitting-drop method, which allowed us to do an extensive search of chemical space. Numerous attempts to grow iron-loaded crystals of PhFbpA have as yet failed to yield a usable crystal form for data collection. The PhFbpA structure presented here was solved by molecular replacement using the selenomethionyl-PhFbpA structure as a model (see “Experimental Procedures”). Structural Features—Phasing and refinement statistics are reported in Table I. For almost all of the protein residues, the electron density is clear and unambiguous. The last two residues of the C terminus and residue 37 were not visible in the electron density map and were omitted. Electron density for side chains of surface exposed residues 208 and 318 was also missing and were built as alanine and glycine, respectively. The crystal structure of PhFbpA is of high quality as evidenced by the stereochemical parameters (Table I) and the Ramachandran plot, which reveals that all of the residues are in allowed regions (as defined in the program PROCHECK) (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of all of the FbpA molecules deposited to date demonstrate an almost identical topology. PhFbpA has a similar overall structure to the holo-form of wild type Haemophilus influenzae periplasmic FbpA (HiFbpA) with approximate dimensions of 60 × 30 × 40 Å. A search using the DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) server for proteins with similar three-dimensional folds to PhFbpA in the PDB reveals that PhFbpA possesses the highest structural similarity with HiFbpA (PDB code 1MRP, see Ref. 28Bruns C.M.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 301 of 309 Cα atoms of PhFbpA and HiFbpA can be overlaid with a root mean square deviation of 2.3 Å. Similar to other FbpA structures, the polypeptide chain crosses between the N- and C-terminal domains twice. PhFbpA, similar to HiFbpA and most other periplasmic binding proteins as well as transferrins, is composed of two structural domains termed the N- and C-domains. A deep ligand-binding cleft is located at the interface between the two domains. Each domain is composed of a twisted mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 1). The two domains are connected by two anti-parallel β-strands, which form the hinge between the two domains. Rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains around this hinge region involving the two β-strands at the base of the ligand-binding cleft (residues 95–109 and 225–238) converts the protein from an open to closed conformation. The PhFbpA structure observed in the selenomethionyl-PhFbpA crystal form (data not shown) adopts an open conformation, which differs from the native PhFbpA structure by a rigid body rotation of the N- and C-lobes around the β-strand hinge by ∼20°. Iron and Anion-binding Sites—Based on our structural analysis and sequence comparisons of PhFbpA with orthologs (Table II and see “Discussion”), we propose that PhFbpA coordinates a single Fe3+ ion in an octahedral fashion, utilizing four protein side chains to form the square-planar base of the octahedron with two anions disposed on either side of the base completing the coordination sphere (Figs. 2 and 3). The four residues comprising the base of the octahedron are Gln-11, Tyr-142, Tyr-198, and Tyr-199. With the exception of Gln-11, all of the putative iron-binding residues (and anions) lie within hydrogen-bonding distance of one another and through small rearrangements could satisfy the requirements for octahedral iron coordination. Although the Tyr residues located deep in the binding cleft are well described by electron density, the terminus of the Gln-11 side chain, which resides on a surface loop emanating from the pocket rim, is poorly ordered. The amide of Gln-11 points away from the binding pocket and is 9–11 Å away from the putative iron-ligating tyrosines. However, a rearrangement in the Gln-11 side chain torsion angles coupled with a slight movement of the loop it resides on toward the binding cleft place the Gln-11 amide group in range to participate in iron ligation. Gln side chains are intrinsically flexible, and the average thermal factors for the atoms in the loop are considerably larger than the average B-factors for the protein, indicating that in the absence of bound iron, the loop is also flexible. It is probable that Gln-11 and the loop containing it become more ordered upon iron binding. A structural overlay of the iron-loaded HiFbpA structure with the structure of PhFbpA highlights the different strategies utilized by the two proteins to ligate iron (Fig. 3). Although Gln-11, Tyr-198, and Tyr-199 in PhFbpA appear to have similar iron-ligating counterparts (His-9, Tyr-195, and Tyr-196) in the HiFbpA structure, the two proteins differ dramatically the way that these and the additional (putative) groups surround the ligated iron. The phosphate anion in the HiFbpA structure appears to have been functionally replaced by Try-142 in PhFbpA (Fig. 3), and Glu-57 in the HiFbpA structure is replaced by an anion in PhfbpA positioned near formate 1. An additional anion bound at the position of formate 2 would complete the octahedral coordination sphere around the iron atom in PhFbpA.Table IIAmino acid sequence comparisonsGroup 1Group 2Group 3Group 4Arg10XXXXGln11XGluHisLysArg101XXXXArg136XXXXTyr142XXXXArg179XXThr(5), X(2)XTyr198XXXXTyr199XXXX Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Comparison of observed Fe3+ coordination in HiFbpA (PDB code 1MRP) (A) and proposed Fe3+ coordination in PhFbpA (B). The top panels show detailed views of the iron-binding pockets, and the bottom panels show schematic depictions of iron coordination. The two HiFbpA and PhFbpA structures were overlaid so that the binding pockets are viewed in the same orientation with respect to the overall protein structures. The binding cleft on each protein runs along the long axis of the page. In a side-by-side comparison, the binding sites present a completely different constellation of iron-coordinating ligands to the Fe3+ ion. The only feature shared between the two proteins is the utilization of a tyrosine ligand (Try-198 and Tyr-195 in PhFbpA and HiFbpA, respectively) in iron coordination at the bottom of the pocket. In PhFbpA, Gln-11 replaces the water ligand in HiFbpA, carbonate anions replace Tyr-196 and Glu-57, Tyr-199 replaces His-9, and Tyr142 replaces the phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The anions bind in basic pockets (Fig. 2) where they utilize polar interactions to interact with side chains from pairs of arginine residues.

https://openalex.org/W2081072407,"The present study describes the distribution and properties of enzymes involved in arginine metabolism in Riftia pachyptila, a tubeworm living around deep sea hydrothermal vents and known to be engaged in a highly specific symbiotic association with a bacterium. The results obtained show that the arginine biosynthetic enzymes, carbamyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, and argininosuccinate synthetase are present in all of the tissues of the worm and in the bacteria. Thus, Riftia and its bacterial endosymbiont can assimilate nitrogen and carbon via this arginine biosynthetic pathway. The kinetic properties of ornithine transcarbamylase strongly suggest that neither Riftia nor the bacteria possess the catabolic form of this enzyme belonging to the arginine deiminase pathway, the absence of this pathway being confirmed by the lack of arginine deiminase activity. Arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase are involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as putrescine and agmatine. These activities are present in the trophosome, the symbiont-harboring tissue, and are higher in the isolated bacteria than in the trophosome, indicating that these enzymes are of bacterial origin. This finding indicates that Riftia is dependent on its bacterial endosymbiont for the biosynthesis of polyamines that are important for its metabolism and physiology. These results emphasize a particular organization of the arginine metabolism and the exchanges of metabolites between the two partners of this symbiosis.

These results emphasize a particular organization of the arginine metabolism and the exchanges of metabolites between the two partners of this symbiosis. Deep sea hydrothermal vents display a set of unique environmental characteristics, including high pressure, steep temperature gradients, and high concentrations of toxic elements such as sulfides and heavy metals. These hydrothermal vents are very dynamic, with rapidly changing physical and chemical parameters. However, in the area around these springs, dense communities of animals are found (1Gaill F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Tunnicliffe V. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Annu. Rev. 1991; 29: 319-407Google Scholar, 3Tunnicliffe V. Am. Sci. 1992; 80: 334-349Google Scholar). Some of them are marine invertebrates that survive through symbiosis with chemoautotrophic bacteria. One of the most studied species living at deep sea hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos Rift is Riftia pachyptila (4Jones M.L. Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. 1981; 93: 1295-1313Google Scholar, 5Childress J.J. Fisher C.R. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. 1992; 83: 109-173Google Scholar), a giant tubeworm whose anatomical organization is shown in Fig. 1. To support its large size and high growth rate, the nutritional needs of Riftia are satisfied by an endosymbiotic relation with a chemolitoautotrophic sulfideoxidizing bacteria located intracellularly in a specialized organ, the trophosome (6Cavanaugh C.M. Gardiner S.L. Jons M.L. Jannasch H.W. Waterbury J.B. Science. 1981; 213: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 7Felbech H. Somero G.N. Childress J.J.

The trophosome is located within the large sac (coelome) made by the body wall and terminated by the opisthosome and is bathed by the coelomic fluid (1Gaill F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It represents about 15% of the weight of the worm (9Childress J.J. Arp A.J. Fisher C.R. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 1984; 83: 109-124Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The bacterial volume represents between 15 and 35% of the total volume of the trophosome (10Powell M.A. Somero G.N. Biol. Bull. 1986; 171: 274-290Crossref Google Scholar). Since the bacterium is a sulfideoxidizing autotroph (8Felbeck H. Science. 1981; 213: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Belkin S. Nelson D.C. Jannasch H.W. Biol. Bull. 1986; 170: 110-121Crossref Google Scholar, 12Fisher C.R. Childress J.J. Minnich E. Biol. Bull. 1989; 177: 372-385Crossref Google Scholar), the worm must take up sulfide, ammonia, oxygen, and carbon dioxide from the medium and supply these products to the symbiont. They are taken up from the environmental water in the large plume (Fig. 1), a highly vascularized organ that has a large surface area and brings the hemolymph very close to the surrounding water (13Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Fisher Jr., C.R. Bull. Biol. Soc. Wash. 1985; 6: 289-300Google Scholar, 14Jones M.L. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 69-82Google Scholar). Most of the metabolite exchanges between the trophosome and the environment are mediated via the vascular system. The hemolymph and the coelomic fluid both contain abundant extracellular hemoglobins, which transport not only oxygen but also sulfide to the bacteria in the trophosome and possibly other metabolites to the different tissues of the worm (9Childress J.J. Arp A.J. Fisher C.R. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 1984; 83: 109-124Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Fisher Jr., C.R. Bull. Biol. Soc. Wash. 1985; 6: 289-300Google Scholar). The assimilation and respiration of the metabolites such as CO2,O2,H2S, NH3,NO 3- are mainly carried out in the bacteria, which, in return, provides organic compounds to the worm (15Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Science. 1981; 213: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Felbeck H. Childress J.J. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 131-138Google Scholar, 17Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B.

In these processes, the bacteria produces metabolic energy from the oxidation of H2S (18Nelson D.C. Fisher C.R. Karl D.M. The Microbiology of Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 125-167Google Scholar). Previous observations indicated that the supply of inorganic carbon and nitrogen from the environment must be a limiting factor for the growth of Riftia. In the case of carbon, the external concentration of CO2 varies around 5 mm, whereas it was emphasized that the worm metabolism implies a much higher demand for inorganic carbon (19Childress J.J. Lee R.W. Sanders N.K. Felbeck H. Oros D. Toulmond A. Desbruyeres D. Kennicutt III, M.C. Brooks J.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 147-149Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Scott K.M. Fisher C.R. Vodenichar J.S. Nix E.R. Minnich E. Physiol. Zool. 1994; 67: 617-638Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of nitrogen, the concentrations of nitrate and ammonia around the worm are 15–40 μm and 0.1–0.3 μm, respectively, concentrations that are also considered as limiting for the development of the worm (21Lee R.W. Childress J.J. Biol. Bull. 1996; 190: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently, the concentration of inorganic carbon and nitrogen must be limiting inside Riftia (19Childress J.J. Lee R.W. Sanders N.K. Felbeck H. Oros D. Toulmond A. Desbruyeres D. Kennicutt III, M.C. Brooks J.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 147-149Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Scott K.M. Fisher C.R. Vodenichar J.S. Nix E.R. Minnich E. Physiol. Zool. 1994; 67: 617-638Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a situation that suggests the presence of very efficient mechanisms for carbon and nitrogen assimilation. Analyses with radiolabeled carbon dioxide confirmed that the symbiotic bacteria is the primary up-taker of inorganic carbon (22Bright M. Keckeis H. Fisher C.R. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 2000; 136: 621-632Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the bacterial symbiont was shown to be able to reduce nitrate to nitrite (17Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Herve G.

Nature. 1993; 336: 338-340Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which the worm assimilates and metabolizes nitrogen from its inorganic sources are much less well documented. However, ammonia assimilatory enzymes such as glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase were found to be present in both the bacterial symbiont and the host (17Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B.

It was previously reported that the carbamoylphosphate synthetase specific of the pyrimidine pathway (CPSase-P) 1The abbreviations used are: CPSase-P, CPSase specific to the pyrimidine pathway; CPSase-A, CPSase specific to the arginine biosynthetic pathway; CPSase, carbamyl phosphate synthetase; ADase, arginine decarboxylase; CP, carbamyl phosphate; Orn, ornithine; ODase, ornithine decarboxylase; OTCase, ornithine transcarbamylase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CPSase-P, CPSase specific to the pyrimidine pathway; CPSase-A, CPSase specific to the arginine biosynthetic pathway; CPSase, carbamyl phosphate synthetase; ADase, arginine decarboxylase; CP, carbamyl phosphate; Orn, ornithine; ODase, ornithine decarboxylase; OTCase, ornithine transcarbamylase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. is absent in all of the worm tissues and is present only in the bacteria (17Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Herve G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23777-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, the carbamoylphosphate synthetase specific of the arginine biosynthetic pathway (CPSase-A) was found in all of the tissues of the worm (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the production of carbamoylphosphate from NH3, bicarbonate, and ATP. NH3+HCO3-+2ATP↔Carbamylphosphate+2ADPREACTION 1 Thus, this enzyme can participate in the assimilation of inorganic carbon and nitrogen. Consequently, we investigated the distribution in Riftia of enzymes involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway as well as some enzymes involved in the metabolism of this amino acid. Chemicals—Sodium [14C]bicarbonate (55 mCi/mmol), l-[1-14C]ornithine (56 mCi/mmol) and l-[1-14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Sigma. l-[U-14C]ornithine (262 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Source and Storage of Riftia Pachyptila Samples—Samples of the deep sea tube worm were collected in the East Pacific volcanic range at a depth of 2600 m. To avoid interference with the subsequent enzyme tests, the specimens were immediately bled and dissected on board, and each isolated organ was frozen in liquid nitrogen as previously described (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purification of the Bacterial Symbiont—After collecting and bleeding the animal, the bacterial symbiont was immediately purified by the method proposed by Distel and Felbeck (26Distel D.L. Felbeck H. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 247: 1-10Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) under conditions previously described (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell-free Extracts from Each Organ of R. pachyptila—Extracts from the organs were freshly prepared before the enzyme assays. Frozen tissue (∼2 g) was suspended in 6 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm l-dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 4 μm sodium cacodylate), and the following protease inhibitors were added: 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml EDTA, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The mixture was homogenized in a Potter homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was further disrupted by sonication three times for 60 s each with a Biosonik III sonicator at 20 kilocycles/s. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min and dialyzed against extraction buffer, and the resulting supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Carbamyl Phosphate Synthetase Assay—The activity of CPSase was determined by the radioactive method (27Robin J.P. Penverne B. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) under the standard conditions described previously by Simon et al. (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berl.). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Ornithine Transcarbamylase Assay—The activity was measured by the radioactive test (28Abdelal A.T.H. Kennedy E.H. Nainan O. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using l-[U-14C]ornithine. The reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm l-ornithine, 10 mm carbamyl phosphate at 37 °C for 20 min. Argininosuccinate Synthetase Assay—Enzyme activity for this reaction was determined at 37 °C using a coupled-enzymes assay, monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanied the conversion of NADH to NAD+ (29Rochovansky O. Kodowaki H. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5287-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl, 2 mm KCl, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mm l-citrulline, 0.1 mm NADH, 2 units inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 2 units of lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma), 2 units of pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 2 units of adenylate kinase (Sigma), and 50–100 μl of the extract (0.5–1.5 mg of protein). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm l-aspartate. The final volume was adjusted to 1 ml with distilled water. Control cuvettes contained 1 ml of the same reaction mixture without the addition of l-aspartate. Arginine Deiminase Assay—Arginine deiminase activity was assayed by coupling the production of ammonia with the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction (30Weickmann J.L. Fahrney D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of NADH disappearance was measured at 25 °C in 1 ml containing 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 mm TES buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma, type II), and extract of protein (0.5–1.5 mg of protein). The addition of arginine (the final substrate concentration was 0.6 mm) initiated the reaction. Initial velocities were calculated from recording at 340 nm. Ornithine Decarboxylase Assay—The ornithine decarboxylase activity was determined by an adaptation of the method of Clark (31Clark J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in a scintillation vial containing an Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of hyamine hydroxide (ICN) for the absorption of 14CO2 released from l-[1-14C]ornithine. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 2.5 mm l-dithiothreitol, 2 mm l-[1-14C]ornithine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the protein extract. A control reaction was performed in the absence of protein extract. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of 0.5 m H2SO4, and the release of 14CO2 was measured as described by Fox (32Fox R.M. Anal.

Arginine Decarboxylase Assay—The activity of arginine decarboxylase was measured as for ornithine decarboxylase by an adaptation of the method of Graham et al. (33Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J.

The standard reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 1 mm l-dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm l-[1-14C]arginine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the protein extract, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Soluble protein extract (10 mg/200 μl) was injected into a column of Superdex 200 precalibrated with the following molecular mass markers: thyroglobuline (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and cytrochrome c (12.4 kDa). Equilibration and elution were performed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 0.1 m NaCl. One-milliliter fractions were collected and assayed for OTCase activity. Anion Exchange Chromatography—A cell-free extract (10 mg/500 μl), prepared as described above, was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (1.5 × 4 cm; Sigma). Proteins were then eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, first alone and then in a 0.0–0.5 m NaCl discontinuous gradient. One-milliliter fractions were collected and assayed for OTCase activity. Fractions from each peak of OTCase activity were pooled and used for the kinetic determinations. Protein Measurements—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin dissolved in extraction buffer as the standard. It was previously reported that the arginine pathway enzymes, CPSase-A (ammonium-dependent) and OTCase, are present in the various body parts of R. pachyptila (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J.

In the present work, the presence of CPSase and OTCase was tested in the isolated bacteria and the distribution of the subsequent enzyme of the pathway, argininosuccinate synthetase, was tested in the worm and the bacteria. The results obtained are presented in Table I. It appears that these three enzymes are present in all the body parts of R. pachyptila. In extracts of the isolated bacteria, all of these enzyme activities were detected with the exception of ammonium-dependent CPSase-A. The instability of CPSases is well known, and most probably, this enzyme was inactivated during the isolation and/or storage of the bacterial preparations, as already observed in the case of CPSase-P (17Minic Z.

However, on the basis of kinetic and structural properties, it was shown in this last case that the CPSase-P present in the trophosomal extract is of bacterial origin (17Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B.

The fact that these enzyme activities are present in all of the worm body parts and in the bacteria indicates that the arginine biosynthetic pathway exists in the two symbiotic organisms.Table IActivities of the enzymes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway in different tissues of R. pachyptila and its isolated bacterial symbiont All enzyme activities were measured at 37°C.

Sci. 1992; 80: 334-349Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab There are two types of OTCases, which participate in either the anabolism or the catabolism of arginine. The anabolic OTCase belongs to the biosynthetic arginine pathway and catalyzes citrulline formation from ornithine (35Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of prokaryotes possess also a catabolic OTCase, which belongs to the arginine-deiminase catabolic pathway, which leads to the anaerobic degradation of arginine to produce NH3, CO2, and ATP (30Weickmann J.L. Fahrney D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stalon V. Ramos F. Pierard A. Wiame J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Vander Wauven C. Pierard A. Kley-Raymann M. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 928-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, OTCase catalyzes the transformation of citrulline to ornithine. In view of the above remark concerning the limiting supply of NH3 and CO2 to Riftia from the environment, this arginine catabolic pathway could constitute an interesting source of these inorganic metabolites. Consequently, the characteristics of the OTCase activities present in the bacteria-containing trophosome and, as a control, in the vestimentum extracts were examined. For the estimation of OTCase molecular weights and to test for the presence of putative different enzyme forms, the cell-free extracts of the trophosomal and vestimentum tissues were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. The results obtained are given in Fig. 2. In both the vestimentum and the trophosome tissues, a single peak of activity is observed (Fig. 2A). The calibration of the column indicates molecular masses of 170 ± 10 and 95 ± 10 kDa for the OTCases from vestimentum and trophosome, respectively (Fig. 2B). A survey of previously characterized anabolic OTCases showed that most of these enzymes have low molecular weights, ranging from 110 to 150 kDa (38Legrain C. Stalon V. Noullez J.P. Mercenier A. Simon J.P. Broman K. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Catabolic enzymes, with some rare exceptions, display much higher molecular weights. Thus, the result obtained in the case of the trophosomal OTCase suggested already that this enzyme is anabolic. In order to precisely determine the nature of this OTCase activity, the trophosome extract was analyzed by DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. The result obtained is presented in Fig. 3, which shows clearly the separation of two different forms of this enzyme. The presence of these two enzymatic activities raises several questions. They could simply correspond to the anabolic OTCases from the worm and the bacteria. Alternatively, one of these activities could correspond to a catabolic form of this enzyme. In order to test these possibilities, some kinetic parameters of these two OTCase forms were further characterized. Substrate Saturation Curves—The OTCase substrate saturation curve for carbamyl phosphate was determined in the presence of a saturating concentration of ornithine, and its substrate saturation curve for ornithine was established in the presence of a saturating concentration of carbamyl phosphate. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. Due to the fact that some OTCases can be differentiated on the basis of some apparent substrate cooperativity (25Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar.

These analyses give S0.5Orn values of 1.1 ± 0.1 mm for ornithine, in the cases of both peak I and II, whereas the Hill coefficient is 1.6 ± 0.2. Thus, on this basis, the peak I and peak II activities do not differ. These low values of Hill coefficient and the values of S0.5Orn are similar to those found in the case of anabolic OTCases from other sources (41Stalon V. Legrain C. Wiame J.M. Eur. J.

Chem. 1966; 241: 2228-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As far as the carbamyl phosphate saturation curves are concerned, S0.5CP and Hill coefficients are identical for the two peaks of activity (Table II). Literature shows that catabolic OTCases display significantly higher values of S0.5CP and Hill coefficients than anabolic OTCases (46Stalon V. Ramos F. Pierard A. Wiame J.M. Eur. J.

Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the S0.5CP of the catabolic OTCase from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are 38 and 4 mm, respectively, and their Hill coefficients are 5.7 ± 0.1 and 4.0 ± 0.2, respectively (49Stalon V.

Again, the values obtained for the trophosomal OTCase forms, S0.5CP of 2.18 ± 0.10 and 2.04 ± 0.11 mm and Hill coefficients of 1.4 ± 0.1 and 1.2 ± 0.1, suggest the anabolic nature of these enzymes.Table IIKinetic parameters of the trophosomal forms of OTCase The kinetic parameters were obtained from saturation curves presented in"

Although MuSK is essential in the formation of the NMJ, little is known regarding mechanisms regulating its gene expression. To address this question, we have isolated and characterized the MuSK promoter. We identified an E-box-like cis-element that is essential for differentiation-dependent expression. Interestingly, we found that unlike AChR genes, the promoter activity of the MuSK gene did not respond to neuregulin, a factor believed to mediate the synapse-specific transcription of AChR subunit genes (18Schaeffer L. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

Cloning of the MuSK 5′-Flanking Region—A search of the Celera genomic sequence bank using MuSK N-terminal cDNA sequences identified two bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing the entire MuSK gene: RPCI-23:334K8 and RPCI-24:155M23. They were purchased from BACPAC (bacterial artificial chromosome P1-derived artificial chromosome) Resource Center at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Oakland, CA) and used as templates for amplification of the MuSK 5′-flanking region and the intron between exons 1 and 2. Primers for the 4.8-kb 5′-flanking region were 5′-GGGT ACCGT CAAGC CATTA AAATA CCCAG TAT-3′ (sense, containing the KpnI site) and 5′-CAAG CTTAG GAAGA AAGGT TGCTT CTGGA C-3′ (antisense, containing the HindIII site). The PCR fragment was subcloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pGL2-Basic (Promega) to generate –4830 to +36 MuSK-firefly luciferase (M4830-Luc). Reporter constructs with deletions in the MuSK 5′-flanking region were generated by PCR using the same antisense primer from the 3′-end (+36) and different sense primers containing the KpnI site with RPCI-23:334K8 as a template. M4830-Luc(N) was generated by inserting a 999-nt (+133 to +1132) DNA fragment containing the putative N-box sequence between BamHI and SalI sites behind the SV40 poly(A) signal in M4830-Luc. The 999-nt DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with sense primer (5′-CCGGA TCCTG GTCTG TACAA TCTTG CCCTA CAGTG C-3′, containing the BamHI site) and antisense primer (5′-CCGTC GACCA TTAAT TATTC AAGAT AAGAT TTTTC A-3′, containing the SalI site). Site-directed mutants in putative E-boxes were generated using the QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—C2C12 cells were maintained as described previously (17Luo Z. Wang Q. Zhou J. Wang J. Liu M. He X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xiong W. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Myoblasts (50% confluency) were transiently co-transfected with a MuSK promoter luciferase reporter transgene and pRL-CMV (as a control for transfection efficiency and sample handling) in a ratio of 20:1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, co-transfection included mutant Ras or MyoD (in a ratio of 100:20:1, mutant Ras or MyoD:MuSK transgene:pRL-CMV). Twenty-four h after transfection, myoblasts were switched to the differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum) and luciferase assays were performed after myotubes were fully developed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. RNase Protection and Primer Extension Assays—The probe of RNase protection assays (RPA) was generated by PCR using the bacterial artificial chromosome clone (RPCI-24:155M23) as a template. A 438-nt fragment included 226 nt of the 5′-flanking region and 79 nt of exon 1, and 133 nt of intron 1 of the MuSK gene was amplified using the primers 5′-TGTTC CTCCA GCCCT CCACT TGCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCT CTCTC CATAC ATTCT ATCCC TAC-3′ (antisense) and subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The plasmid was linearized with NcoI. Radiolabeled antisense RNA probe was produced with SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP using MAXIscript Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled probe was mixed with 20 or 50 μg of total RNA of yeast, COS-7 cells, HEK293 cells, C2C12 myotubes (either control or treated), and mouse muscle and liver in RPA II hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) at 42 °C overnight. After digestion with ribonuclease, protected fragments were fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel next to a sequencing reaction with the primer (5′-CTTTT GGAAG TTTCT CAGTG-3′) in exon 1. Primer extension assays were performed with the reverse primer (5′-GTGGA ATGTT GACAA GCTCT CTCAT G-3′) close to the translation initiation site. The primer was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The labeled primer (0.5 pmol) was incubated with 50 μg of total RNA of skeletal muscle or C2C12 myotubes in RPA II hybridization buffer overnight at 42 °C. The annealed primer was precipitated with ethanol and extended with 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C for 2 h. Ten units of RNase A were then added to digest the remnant excess of RNA. Reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel next to a sequencing reaction with the same primer. Identification of the Transcription Initiation Sites of the MuSK Gene—The 5′-flanking region of the mouse MuSK gene is characterized by several unique restriction sites (Fig. 1A). To identify the transcription initiation sites, a 438-nt antisense RNA probe (complementary from –226 to +212 nt, Fig. 1A) was generated by PCR and incubated with total RNA from various tissues. Protection was observed in muscle cells including C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscles but not in the liver, COS-7 cells, HEK293 cells, or yeast. These results demonstrate the muscle-specific expression of the MuSK gene in agreement with previous Northern analyses (15Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. Le Beau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The protection fragments, ranging from –114 to +1 nt, varied in intensity, although all five protections were observed in both C2C12 myotubes and the skeletal muscles (Fig. 1, C and D). The transcription start site closest to the coding sequence, designated as nucleotide 1, appeared to be the thymidine 51 nt upstream from the translation start site (Fig. 1B, site A). Transcription may also start at –42 guanosine (Fig. 1B, site B), –60 cytidine (Fig. 1B, site C), –89 adenosine (Fig. 1B, site D), and –114 adenosine (Fig. 1B, site E). To further characterize the MuSK gene, we carried out primer extension analysis on RNA from skeletal muscle and C2C12 myotubes. Extended fragments were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel next to a sequencing reaction with the same primer. Results depicted in Fig. 1E confirmed the five transcription start sites and suggested several additional sites located between A and B. These results demonstrate that transcription of the MuSK gene starts at a cluster of positions located between –114 and +1 in muscle cells consistent with the lack of an apparent TATA box within the vicinity of the transcription initiation sites. Muscle-specific Activation and Regulation by Differentiation of the MuSK Promoter—To study the mechanisms regulating MuSK expression, we generated a reporter transgene containing the 4830-nt 5′-flanking region and the gene of firefly luciferase, M4830-Luc. The luciferase activity of the reporter, expressed as relative luciferase activity over cotransfected pRL-CMV, was similar to that of the empty vector pGL2-Basic in monkey kidney COS-7, HEK293 cells, or C2C12 myoblasts, suggesting that the promoter activity of MuSK was minimal in nonmuscle or undifferentiated muscle cells (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, the promoter activity increased 41-fold in transfected myotubes compared with myoblasts, revealing an up-regulation by muscle differentiation in agreement with previous reports of differentiation-dependent regulation of MuSK expression (15Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. Le Beau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To further characterize this phenomenon and as an initial step to scrutinize where the important cis-acting elements are located, we generated a battery of MuSK reporter constructs with sequential deletion in the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 2B). As with M4830-Luc, these reporters showed similar, but minimal, luciferase activity in C2C12 myoblasts. However, the promoter activity of M715-Luc and M465-Luc was higher in myotubes. The differentiation-dependent increase in promoter activity of these two reporters was similar to that of M4830-Luc, suggesting the involved cis-elements may locate within the 465-nt 5′-flanking region. Further deletion in the 5′-flanking region decreased the responsiveness to differentiation. The promoter activity of M215-Luc increased 20-fold during the formation of the myotubes, and M37-Luc was unable to respond to muscle differentiation (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the MuSK promoter is regulated by muscle differentiation and that the cis-elements essential for differentiation-dependent regulation exist between –465 and –37. Identification of an E-box Element That Is Required and Sufficient for MuSK Promoter Activity—Higher MuSK promoter activity in myotubes than in myoblasts indicates that the MuSK 5′-flanking region contains cis-elements that are regulated by transcription factors of muscle differentiation. Studies of AChR subunit genes have demonstrated that their expression is regulated by myogenic factors acting on E-box cis-elements (18Schaeffer L. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 2001; 31: 15-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Analyzing the sequence of the MuSK 5′-flanking region between –465 and –37, we identified four putative E-box elements characteristic of CANNTG (where N is any nucleotide) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether any of these E-box elements is involved in regulating the MuSK promoter activity, we generated site-specific mutants in which cytidine was mutated to thymidine and guanosine to adenosine in M715-Luc as the parental vector. Their relative luciferase activity was assayed in transfected myotubes. As shown in Fig. 3B, mutation of E-box2, -3, or -4 (as in E134, E124, or E123, respectively) did not appear to alter the promoter activity, suggesting that these elements may not be essential for regulation. In contrast, the mutation of E-box1 alone (as in E234) dramatically decreased the promoter activity in C2C12 myotubes, suggesting a requirement of E-box1 for the MuSK promoter activity. To determine whether E-box1 is sufficient to mediate differentiation-dependent regulation, we generated M715-Luc mutants that contained either one or a combination of other E-box elements. Not surprisingly, E0, in which four E-box elements were all mutated, revealed a suppressed promoter activity. Remarkably, the addition of E-box1 restored the ability of the reporter gene to respond to differentiation, suggesting that this element is sufficient (Fig. 3B). As a control, the addition of E-box4 or of both E-box3 and E-box4 failed to rescue the promoter activity. Expression of muscle-specific genes, such as the AChR, is regulated by myogenic factors (21Cheng T.C. Hanley T.A. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Prody C.A. Merlie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2367-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The finding that the MuSK promoter activity is increased by differentiation suggests the possibility that myogenic factors participate in the regulation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the report activity of M4830-Luc in muscle cells cotransfected with or without MyoD. As shown in Fig. 3C, the reporter activity was increased mildly by MyoD in COS-7 cells and in C2C12 myoblasts. The activity, although significantly higher than the control, was lower than that when the reporter gene was expressed in C2C12 myotubes, suggesting that other factors intrinsic to differentiated muscle cells may be necessary (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, MyoD co-transfection further increased the promoter activity in myotubes, which may suggest that myogenic factors may be available in limited amount. Studies of the deletion mutants indicated that the increase in the MuSK promoter activity by MyoD had a similar structure requirement to the differentiation-dependent regulation (data not shown). To identify the cis-elements for the regulation by myogenic factors, we characterized promoter activity of the E-box deletion and “add-back” mutants of M715-Luc (which were described in Fig. 3A) in myotubes cotransfected with or without MyoD. E-box1 appeared to be necessary and sufficient for MyoD-mediated increase in the MuSK promoter activity (data not shown). This notion was confirmed in studies with M4830(mE1)-Luc in which E-box1 (and only E-box1) was mutated. This mutation abolished the increase in the promoter activity by co-transfected MyoD in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the up-regulation of the MuSK promoter activity is mediated by E-box1. No Effect of Neuregulin on MuSK Expression—Synapse-specific transcription of the AChR genes is mediated by complex mechanisms. In addition to myogenic factors that regulate AChR gene expression during differentiation, electrical activity suppresses AChR gene transcription in all nuclei in the skeletal muscle (18Schaeffer L. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 2001; 31: 15-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Goldman E.W. Brenner H.R. Heinemann S.

Biol. 1995; 168: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The transcription of AChR genes in the synaptic region is believed to be mediated by neuregulin, a polypeptide synthesized in motoneurons and enriched in the synaptic basal lamina (19Fischbach G.D. Rosen K.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). By counteracting the inhibitory effect of electrical activity, neuregulin increases local AChR transcription in the synaptic region. In light of the MuSK mRNA concentration around synaptic nuclei in the skeletal muscle (15Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. Le Beau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we determined whether the MuSK promoter was regulated by neuregulin. In control experiments, we studied the neuregulin regulation of the promoter activity of ϵ416-Luc, a transgene reporter that contains the 416-nt AChR ϵ-subunit 5′-flanking region, which drives the expression of luciferase (27Si J. Miller D.S. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10367-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Neuregulin stimulation caused a 100% increase in ϵ416-Luc expression in transfected C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 4A) in agreement with previous observations (20Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Si J. Wang Q. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8489-8508Crossref Google Scholar, 29Tanowitz M. Si J.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, under the same conditions, neuregulin did not appear to increase the promoter activity of M4830-Luc in transfected C2C12 myotubes (data not shown). Neuregulin regulation is believed be mediated by N-box, a cis-element that is required for synapse-specific transcription (31Fromm L. Burden S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3074-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Duclert A. Savatier N. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 1289-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). N-box elements usually locate upstream of the transcription initiation site in the AChR δ- or ϵ-subunit genes. However, the 4830-nt 5′-flanking region of mouse MuSK did not appear to contain an N-box element. Rather, sequence analysis identified a putative N-box element (CCGGAA, nt +805 to +811) in the intron between exon 1 and exon 2. Thus we created the M4830-Luc(N) reporter transgene, which contains the 999-nt intron sequence after the luciferase (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). As shown in Fig. 4A, M4830-Luc(N) promoter activity did not increase in C2C12 myotubes challenged by neuregulin, suggesting that the transcription of the MuSK gene may not be regulated by neuregulin, confirming an earlier report that MuSK mRNA was not increased in C2C12 myotubes in response to neuregulin stimulation (34Si J. Mei L. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results are in line with recent observations that MuSK expression remains unchanged in transgenic mice expressing a general Ets dominant-negative mutant specifically in skeletal muscle (35de Kerchove D'Exaerde A. Cartaud J. Ravel-Chapuis A. Seroz T. Pasteau F. Angus L.M. Jasmin B.J. Changeux J.P. Schaeffer L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neuregulin acts by activating its receptor, the 180-kDa ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. Several intracellular kinases are implicated in mediating neuregulin regulation of AChR gene expression including mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and Cdk5 (20Si J.

Altiok S. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In particular the Ras-Raf-Erk pathway activation appeared to be required and sufficient for the neuregulin effect and for synapse-specific expression of the ϵ-transgene in vivo (20Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Si J. Mei L. Mol.

To investigate further whether neuregulin regulates MuSK expression, we studied the effect of active- or dominant-negative Ras mutant. Expression of these mutants alone has a profound effect on AChR promoter activity (20Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Tansey M.G. Chu G.C. Merlie J.P. J.

As shown in Fig. 4A, however, the promoter activity of M4830-Luc(N) was not increased in C2C12 myotubes cotransfected with active Ras, unlike ϵ416-Luc in which luciferase activity was increased. These results corroborate with those with neuregulin and support the notion that neuregulin may play a limited role in regulating MuSK expression. Increase in MuSK Expression by Wnt—Wnt signaling is known to play a role in the induction of myogenesis (38Cossu G. Borello U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the formation of the neuromuscular junction (17Luo Z. Wang Q. Zhou J. Wang J. Liu M. He X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xiong W. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 39Packard M. Mathew D. Budnik V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We asked whether Wnt signaling was involved in regulating MuSK expression. To test this hypothesis, transfected C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with Wnt1 at a concentration that increases β-catenin in the cytosol (17Luo Z. Wang Q. Zhou J. Wang J. Liu M. He X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xiong W. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and were assayed for the promoter activity of M4830-Luc. As shown in Fig. 4B, the promoter activity was increased by 75% (29, n = 6, p < 0.05), suggesting a possible involvement of Wnt signaling in MuSK expression. In the Wnt canonical pathway, Wnt binds to and activates its receptor, the Frizzled family of seven transmembrane-domain proteins (40Malbon C.C. Wang H. Moon R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 42Bhanot P. Brink M.

The net result is the up-regulation of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus (41Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 43Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 44Klingensmith J. Nusse R.

To further characterize the involvement of Wnt signaling in this event, we investigated whether the promoter activity was altered by LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with LiCl (40 mm for 24 h) increased the MuSK promoter activity further supporting the involvement of Wnt signaling. We next asked whether Wnt regulates the expression of the endogenous MuSK gene in nontransfected muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were stimulated without (control) or with Wnt1 and assayed for the MuSK mRNA by RNA protection using a 184-nt probe spanning exon1 and exon2. As shown in Fig. 4C, Wnt1 stimulation increased the MuSK mRNA by 70%. These results were in agreement with those with the MuSK transgene, supporting the notion that the MuSK gene transcription is regulated by Wnt signaling. Interestingly, the extracellular regions of MuSK and Frizzled show homology (47Xu Y.K. Nusse R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R405-R406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Masiakowski P.

Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), although it remains to be determined whether MuSK is able to interact with Wnt1 directly. However, stimulation of muscle cells with Wnt1 does not activate MuSK (17Luo Z. Wang Q. Zhou J. Wang J. Liu M. He X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xiong W. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 2Z. Luo and L. Mei, unpublished results. It is possible that the regulation of MuSK gene expression by Wnt1 is via a mechanism independent of MuSK kinase activation. In summary, we have characterized the MuSK promoter in this study. The transcription of MuSK starts at multiple sites. We have identified an E-box-like cis-element that is both required and sufficient for differentiation-dependent transcription. Interestingly, the promoter activity of the MuSK gene did not respond to neuregulin, a factor believed to mediate the synapse-specific transcription of AChR subunit genes. Rather, MuSK expression is increased in muscle cells stimulated with Wnt or under conditions where the Wnt signaling was activated. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the MuSK synapse-specific expression. We are grateful to Dr. M. Sliwkowski and Dr. Xi He for valuable reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1995623427,"Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are protein modules that bind with varying degrees of affinity and specificity membrane phosphoinositides. Previously we have shown that although the PH domains of the Ras GTPase-activating proteins GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP are 63% identical at the amino acid level they possess distinct phosphoinositide-binding profiles. The GAP1m PH domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), whereas the domain from GAP1IP4BP binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) equally well. These phosphoinositide specificities are translated into distinct subcellular localizations. GAP1m is cytosolic and undergoes a rapid PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation. In contrast, GAP1IP4BP is constitutively associated, in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner, with the plasma membrane (Cozier, G. E., Lockyer, P. J., Reynolds, J. S., Kupzig, S., Bottomley, J. R., Millard, T., Banting, G., and Cullen, P. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 28261–28268). In the present study, we have used molecular modeling to identify residues in the GAP1IP4BP PH domain predicted to be required for high affinity binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2. This has allowed the isolation of a mutant, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T), which while retaining high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has a 6-fold reduction in its affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Importantly, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) is predominantly localized to the cytosol and undergoes a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation. We have therefore engineered the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the GAP1IP4BP PH domain, thereby emphasizing that subtle changes in PH domain structure can have a pronounced effect on phosphoinositide binding and the subcellular localization of GAP1IP4BP. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are protein modules that bind with varying degrees of affinity and specificity membrane phosphoinositides. Previously we have shown that although the PH domains of the Ras GTPase-activating proteins GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP are 63% identical at the amino acid level they possess distinct phosphoinositide-binding profiles. The GAP1m PH domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), whereas the domain from GAP1IP4BP binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) equally well. These phosphoinositide specificities are translated into distinct subcellular localizations. GAP1m is cytosolic and undergoes a rapid PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation. In contrast, GAP1IP4BP is constitutively associated, in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner, with the plasma membrane (Cozier, G. E., Lockyer, P. J., Reynolds, J. S., Kupzig, S., Bottomley, J. R., Millard, T., Banting, G., and Cullen, P. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 28261–28268). In the present study, we have used molecular modeling to identify residues in the GAP1IP4BP PH domain predicted to be required for high affinity binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2. This has allowed the isolation of a mutant, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T), which while retaining high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has a 6-fold reduction in its affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Importantly, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) is predominantly localized to the cytosol and undergoes a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation. We have therefore engineered the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the GAP1IP4BP PH domain, thereby emphasizing that subtle changes in PH domain structure can have a pronounced effect on phosphoinositide binding and the subcellular localization of GAP1IP4BP.

Of those PH domains examined nearly all bind phosphoinositides present in cell membranes although with varying degrees of specificity and affinity. In the vast majority of PH domains, phosphoinositide binding is weak and quite nonspecific (1Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

However in around 10% of cases the phosphoinositide binding is strong and highly specific. For example, the PH domain of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (5Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J.

In this case, the PH domain interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 results in the targeting of PLC-δ1 to the plasma membrane (7Varnai P. Balla T. J.

The core of each domain is a β-sandwich composed of two nearly orthogonal β-sheets, β1-β4 and β5-β7, that are connected by six loop regions. Three of these, β1/β2, β3/β4, and β6/β7, have been termed the variable loops, as they display hypervariable sequences in PH domain alignments. These loops close off one corner of the β-sandwich, whereas an amphipathic carboxy-terminal α-helix closes off the opposite open corner.

These studies have shown that although PH domains share a common fold, they have evolved their sequence and structure to provide a wide range of different phosphoinositide specificities and affinities. We have described the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the PH domains from the Ras GTPase-activating proteins GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whereas the PH domain of GAP1m specifically binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the corresponding domain from GAP1IP4BP binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 equally well (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S.

These phosphoinositide specificities are translated into distinct subcellular distribution of these proteins (36Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GAP1m is a cytosolic protein that undergoes a rapid association with the plasma membrane upon the agonist-stimulated production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (37Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Venkateswarlu K. Potter B.V.L. Dempsey C.E. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, GAP1IP4BP is constitutively associated with the plasma membrane as a result of its PH domain-binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R.

Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used molecular modeling to generate predicted structures for the PtdIns(4,5)P2 and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding pockets within the PH domains of GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP (38Cozier G. Sessions R. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These models were analyzed to identify residues in the GAP1IP4BP PH domain predicted to be required for high affinity binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Three possible residues, lysine 591, arginine 604, and lysine 616, were identified each of which was individually mutated into the corresponding residue from GAP1m. Analysis of the phosphoinositide-binding profile revealed that although the affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 was retained for the lysine 616 mutant, an approximate 6-fold reduction in affinity was observed for the lysine 591 and arginine 604 mutants. Importantly, for these two mutants the drop in affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 was sufficient to result in a loss in their constitutive association with the plasma membrane. However, these cytosolically localized mutants retained a high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which was manifested in vivo through their ability to undergo a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation. By using molecular modeling coupled with single site mutagenesis we have therefore engineered the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the GAP1IP4BP PH domain and hence manipulated the subcellular localization and regulation of this protein. Molecular Modeling of the GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m PH Domains—All analysis and modeling of the PH domains was performed using the program packages Quanta/CHARMm and InsightII. The alignment of PLC-δ1 and Btk was structure-based, with the GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m PH domains being aligned by sequence, initially using Omiga and then refined by hand where necessary. The modeling was performed as described previously (38Cozier G. Sessions R. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m being modeled independently on the structure of Btk in complex with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (25Baraldi E. Carugo K.D.

Site-directed Mutagenesis of the GAP1IP4BP PH Domain—The mutations were introduced into GAP1IP4BP using the QuikChange™ (Stratagene) and pCI-neo-GAP1IP4BP as template. Primers used were as follows: Lys-591T, 5′-AGGGCCCAAGGACGGACGCGCTTTGGGATGAAG-3′; Lys-591Trc, 5′-CTTCATCCCAAAGCGCGTCCGTCCTTGGGCCCT-3′; Arg-604C, 5′-AAGAGATGGTTTTGTTTGACCAACCATGAATTC-3′; Arg-604Crc, 5′-GAATTCATGGTTGGTCAAACAAAACCATCTCTT-3′; Lys-616P, 5′-ACCTACCACAAAAGCCCCGGGGACCAGCCTCTC-3′; Lys-616Prc, 5′-GAGAGGCTGGTCCCCGGGGCTTTTGTGGTAGGT-3′. In each case the underlined codon describes the particular mutation, and rc designates reverse compliment. For prokaryotic expression of the site-directed mutants, the corresponding cDNAs were removed from the pCIneo vector by digestion with SalI and NotI. The fragments were gel-purified and ligated into the corresponding sites within pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of GAP1IP4BP and GAP1IP4BP Mutants— Both wild-type and mutagenic GST-GAP1IP4BP fusion proteins were isolated as follows. An overnight 20-ml culture was used to inoculate each of 4 × 2.5-liter conical flasks of 500 ml of LB containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The cells were cultured at 25 °C until an A 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by an overnight incubation at 15 °C prior to harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was gently resuspended in 40 ml of PBS buffer (pH 7.2) containing EDTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm), and Triton X-100 (0.1%) (v/v) and sonicated for four periods of 30 s with 30 s on ice between each sonication. Any cell debris was removed by centrifugation (36000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was removed, and 2 ml of a 1:1 suspension of glutathione-agarose beads (washed and preswollen with several volumes of PBS buffer) was added and incubated on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially with 3 × 20 ml of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The beads were added to a column and washed with a further 3 × 20 ml of PBS. The protein was cleaved from the GST tag while bound to the column using thrombin at room temperature overnight. The free protein was then washed off the column with PBS. Phosphoinositide Binding as Determined Using a Protein-Lipid Overlay Assay—To assess the phosphoinositide binding properties of each GAP1IP4BP mutant, a protein-lipid overlay assay was performed using the GST fusion proteins. Briefly, 1 μl of lipid solution containing 1–450 pmol of phospholipids dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8 by volume) was spotted on to Hybond-C extra membrane and allowed to dry at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with blocking solution (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, NaCl (150 mm), and Tween 20 (0.1% (v/v) final)) for1hat room temperature. The membrane was then incubated, with gentle rocking, overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/ml of the relevant protein in blocking solution. The membranes were washed 4 × 15 min in washing solution (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing NaCl (150 mm) and Tween 20 (0.1% (v/v) final)) and then incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution of anti-GAP1IP4BP monoclonal antibody. The membranes were washed as before prior to being incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution of anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Finally, the membranes were washed as before, and the bound protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Transient Transfection and Indirect Immunofluorescence—HeLa and PC12 cells, cultured as described, were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with vector DNA at 50–60% confluence by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 0.15 μg of DNA/μl of cationic lipid. 24 h after transfection, HeLa cells were serum-starved for 2 h prior to being fixed and stained for GAP1IP4BP expression as described previously (39Walker S.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48779-48785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection PC12 cells were either serum-starved for 2 h followed by incubation with 100 nm wortmannin for 30 min or incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min. The cells were then fixed and stained for GAP1IP4BP expression as described previously (39Walker S.A. Kupzig S. Lockyer P.J. Bilu S. Zharhary D. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48779-48785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Staining was visualized by a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser. The confocal was attached to a Leica DM RBE upright epifluorescence microscope. Molecular Modeling and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the GAP1IP4BP PH Domain—Previously we have shown that, although the PH domains from GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP are ∼63% identical at the amino acid level, they have distinct phosphoinositide-binding profiles (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whereas the GAP1m PH domain is specific for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the PH domain from GAP1IP4BP binds equally well to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To locate the residues within GAP1IP4BP that may be involved in interacting with PtdIns(4,5)P2 the sequence of the PH domain of GAP1IP4BP was aligned with the specific PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding PH domains from GAP1m, ARNO, and Btk (Fig. 1). Using the coordinates from the crystal structure of the Btk PH domain in complex with the inositol head group of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (25Baraldi E. Carugo K.D. Hyvonen M. Surdo P.L. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Saraste M. Structure. 1999; 7: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), molecular models were created for the predicted phosphoinositide-binding site within the GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m PH domains (Fig. 2). Given the importance of basic residues in the binding of phosphoinositides to PH domains (1Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these model structures allowed an examination of the distribution of the basic residues to be compared between the GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m PH domains. We specifically examined the location of basic residues that were present in the GAP1IP4BP PH domain but were absent from the GAP1m PH domain. This analysis revealed that within the GAP1IP4BP PH domain six residues, lysine 591, arginine 604, lysine 616, lysine 641, lysine 666, and lysine 681, are present that are equivalent to non-basic residues in the GAP1m PH domain (threonine 619, cysteine 632, proline 644, asparagine 669, asparagine 694, and asparagine 709, respectively) (Fig. 2). Of the basic residues present in the GAP1IP4BP PH domain, lysine 641, lysine 666, and lysine 681 are located away from the phosphoinositidebinding site on the opposite corner of the PH domain structure and so are not in a position to directly interact with the bound phosphoinositide or are unlikely to interact with the membrane surface (Fig. 2). Only residues lysine 591, arginine 604, and lysine 616 are located in, or around, the proposed phosphoinositide-binding site in the model GAP1IP4BP PH domain (Fig. 3). Lysine 591 is on the β1/β2-loop in a basic run of residues, arginine 590, lysine 591, and arginine 592. In Btk the equivalent residues are all lysines, and the first of the three, lysine 17 (equivalent to arginine 590 in GAP1IP4BP), was shown in the crystal structure of Btk in complex with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to directly interact with the 3-phosphate (25Baraldi E.

Therefore, lysine 591 of GAP1IP4BP is located in the correct area for potential interactions with the bound lipid. Arginine 604 and lysine 616 are located on the opposite side of the binding site. Lysine 616 is on the β3/β4-loop, which is important in the PH domain of PLC-δ1 for binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 (19Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Based solely on the model structure, lysine 616 appears close enough for direct interaction with the bound lipid (Fig. 3). In contrast, arginine 604, which is located on the β2/β3 loop, may not interact directly with the bound phosphoinositide as it is located too far from the binding site. However, it should not be overlooked that this residue may interact with the negatively charged plasma membrane surface.Fig. 2Schematic representation of the GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m model structures.

Effect of Mutations on the Binding Affinity of GAP1IP4BP for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3—GST fusion proteins of wild-type GAP1IP4BP and the GAP1IP4BP-(K591T), -(R604C), and -(K616P) mutants were purified and used in protein-lipid overlay assays to examine their relative affinities for PtdIns(4,5)P2 versus PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Wild-type GAP1IP4BP and the various mutant proteins bound to high concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4). However, as the concentrations of the lipids were reduced a clear difference in affinities was observed. Both wild-type GAP1IP4BP and GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) bound PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with similar affinities (6 ± 0.5 and 9 ± 1 μm, respectively (n = 3)). This indicates that lysine 616 has no significant interaction with this phosphoinositide. In contrast, although the affinity of GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) was only ∼2-fold lower compared with wild-type GAP1IP4BP (14 ± 2 μm (n = 3)), the GAP1IP4BP-(R604C) had a 6-fold reduced affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (37 ± 5 μm (n = 3)). Thus, arginine 604, and in particular lysine 591, do not appear to be critical for high affinity binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. When comparing the binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 wild-type GAP1IP4BP and GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) again have equivalent affinities (35 ± 4 and 49 ± 4 μm, respectively (n = 3)). So as for binding PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, lysine 616 does not appear to have any significant interaction with the bound PtdIns(4,5)P2. In contrast, the affinity of the GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) mutants for PtdIns(4,5)P2 were both reduced by 6-fold compared with wild-type GAP1IP4BP (189 ± 37 μm for K591T and 219 ± 41 μm for R604C (n = 3)). This indicates that each of these residues plays an important role in the high affinity binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Examining the Subcellular Localization of the GAP1IP4BP Mutants—To observe the effect of the altered phosphoinositidebinding profile on the subcellular distribution of GAP1IP4BP we initially transiently transfected HeLa cells with each mutant, examining the subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). Consistent with our previous observations (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Venkateswarlu K. Potter B.V.L. Dempsey C.E.

Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), wild-type GAP1IP4BP displayed a strong plasma membrane localization with very little cytosolic staining (Fig. 5). Similarly, GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) was predominantly associated with the plasma membrane, again with very little detectable cytosolic staining (Fig. 5). In contrast, like the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-specific binding proteins GAP1m and ARNO (36Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), both GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) were predominantly localized to the cytosol, although a minor residual plasma membrane localization was also observed (Fig. 5). These data highlight a correlation between the affinity of these GAP1IP4BP mutants for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and their resultant ability to associate with the plasma membrane in serum-starved cells. Thus, whereas the GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) retains its ability to bind with high affinity PtdIns(4,5)P2 and to associate with the plasma membrane, the GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) mutants have a significantly reduced affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and are predominantly localized to the cytosol. To examine the effect of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production on the subcellular localization of the GAP1IP4BP mutants we transiently co-transfected HeLa cells with the GAP1IP4BP mutants and an expression construct encoding for p110C AAX. This is a constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit that induces an elevation in plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Under these conditions, as has been shown previously (36Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), both GAP1m and ARNO became associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). Interestingly, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) also became associated with the plasma membrane under these conditions, an association that was dependent upon the catalytic activity of the p110C AAX as incubation with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm for 30 min) resulted in each mutant retaining their cytosolic localization (data not shown). These data show that the reduction in affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 observed with these mutants, ∼2- and 6-fold for GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C), respectively, does not affect their ability to detect the elevated plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 observed in HeLa cells transiently transfected with p110C AAX . Effect of Growth Factor Stimulation on the Subcellular Localization of the GAP1IP4BP Mutants—Using p110C AAX causes a high unphysiological elevation in the levels of plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. To test the effect of more physiological levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 we transiently transfected the GAP1IP4BP mutants into PC12 cells and examined their resultant subcellular localization prior to, and after, stimulation with epidermal growth factor. In wortmannin-treated, serum-starved PC12 cells GAP1m and ARNO were localized to the cytoplasm whereas GAP1IP4BP was constitutively associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). Consistent with the data from HeLa cells (Fig. 5), whereas GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) was associated with the plasma membrane, both GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) were predominantly localized to the cytosol although, as with the HeLa cells, some residual plasma membrane association was also observed (Fig. 6). Following a 2-min stimulation with 100 ng/ml of EGF, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) became associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). A similar EGF-induced plasma membrane association was also observed for GAP1m and ARNO (Fig. 6) (36Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The EGF-induced plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) required the ability of the growth factor to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as membrane association was inhibited by pre-incubation with 100 nm wortmannin (data not shown). These data therefore demonstrate that the affinity of the GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) mutants for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are sufficiently high to sense the changes in the plasma membrane level of this phosphoinositide following growth factor stimulation. Thus, the lowering of the affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 observed in the GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) and -(R604C) mutants results in the generation of GAP1IP4BP mutants whose dynamic subcellular localization is regulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in a similar manner to that of GAP1m. Previously we have described that the PH domains of the Ras GTPase-activating proteins GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP posses distinct phosphoinositide-binding profiles (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S.

Whereas the GAP1m PH domain is specific for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the PH domain from GAP1IP4BP binds equally well to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This difference in phosphoinositide specificity is manifested in the distinct subcellular localization of these proteins (36Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GAP1m is a cytosolic protein that undergoes a rapid plasma membrane association upon the agonist-stimulated production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (37Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J.

In contrast, GAP1IP4BP is constitutively plasma membrane-associated as a direct result of its PH domain-binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 (35Cozier G. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R.

In the current study we have used molecular modeling to identify residues within the GAP1IP4BP PH domain that are required for high affinity binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2. We have highlighted three residues, lysine 591, arginine 604, and lysine 616, as potentially providing the necessary interactions for PtdIns (4,5)P2 binding. By mutating each residues into the equivalent residue in GAP1m we have shown that whereas the GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) mutant binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with affinities comparable with wild-type, GAP1IP4BP-(R604C) has a 6-fold reduction in its affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In contrast, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) has an affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 that is reduced 6-fold, whereas the affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is reduced only 2-fold. Through the isolation of GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) we have therefore engineered a PH domain that displays a phosphoinositide-binding profile reminiscent of that observed for the corresponding domain from GAP1m. Such a conclusion is further supported by our examination of the subcellular localization of the GAP1IP4BP mutants. Whereas GAP1IP4BP-(K616P) retains the constitutive plasma membrane association observed for wild-type GAP1IP4BP, the GAP1IP4BP-(R604C) and -(K591T) mutants are no longer capable of associating with the plasma membrane. Rather, consistent with their reduced affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2, these proteins are like GAP1m in being located within the cytosol. Importantly, following growth factor stimulation GAP1IP4BP-(K591T) becomes associated in a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent manner with the plasma membrane. These data emphasize that subtle changes in the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the GAP1IP4BP PH domain can have a pronounced effect on the subcellular distribution and regulation of this protein. Apart from the study described here, the dramatic effects that subtle changes can have on phosphoinositide binding is most apparent when considering the diglycine versus triglycine forms of Grp1 (39Walker S.A.

Here, the addition of a single glycine residue to the PH domain can have a significant effect on the phosphoinositide-binding specificity; the triglycine form shows much less discrimination between PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 than the diglycine form. How the extra glycine causes the increase in affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 is difficult to comprehend. One possibility is that the third glycine opens up the binding pocket, allowing the PtdIns(4,5)P2 to enter in an orientation, possibly more akin to the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site in the PH domain of PLC-δ1 (19Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), that is sterically hindered in the diglycine form (42Klarlund J.

Biol. 2000; 10: R876-R878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is tempting to extrapolate this idea and speculate that although PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may bind to the GAP1IP4BP PH domain in a similar orientation to that observed in Btk (25Baraldi E. Carugo K.D. Hyvonen M. Surdo P.L. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Saraste M. Structure. 1999; 7: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 may be similar to that observed in PLC-δ1 whereby the PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecule is rotated 180° through the P1/P4 axis of the inositol ring (19Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). This could lead to lysine 591 having a significant role in the binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2, but because of the inositol head group orientation may not play such a significant role in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding. In summary therefore, through the use of molecular models we have successfully predicted residues that allow the PH domain from GAP1IP4BP to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high affinity. We have demonstrated that a single targeted site-directed mutant, GAP1IP4BP-(K591T), while retaining its ability to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity, has a specific reduction in its affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Furthermore, this subtle alteration in phosphoinositide binding is translated into a dynamic change in the regulation of the subcellular localization of the mutant protein following growth factor stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2157669481,"CALEB/NGC is a neural member of the epidermal growth factor protein family expressed in axon and synapse-rich areas of the nervous system and shown to be important for neurite formation. It can bind to the extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-R and tenascin-C. Here we show that CALEB/NGC interacts with the Golgi-associated protein PIST. PIST was originally described as an interaction partner of the small GTPase TC10 and was then found to be Golgi-associated by binding to syntaxin-6 and to be important for the transport of frizzled proteins and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the plasma membrane. In addition, PIST was demonstrated to be involved in autophagy and linked to processes of neurodegeneration. CALEB/NGC interacts with PIST in the yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction can be confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations and co-localization studies. The juxtamembrane cytoplasmic peptide segment of CALEB/NGC, highly conserved during evolution, mediates the binding to PIST. CALEB/NGC co-localizes with PIST in the Golgi apparatus of transfected COS7 cells and in Golgi-derived vesicles after brefeldin A or nocodazole treatment. Co-localization studies in primary hippocampal cells and analysis of Purkinje cells of colchicine-treated rats, serving as an in vivo model system to block microtubule-dependent transport processes, support the view that PIST is an interaction partner of CALEB/NGC and implicate that this interaction may play a role in the intracellular transport of CALEB/NGC."

Signal transduction induced by high external glucose finally results in a predominance of ScHxk2, whereas expression of ScHXK1 and ScGLK1 is high on non-fermentable carbon sources or galactose (15Herrero P.

Experimental evidence indicating phosphoryl transfer by any glucose kinase to be required but not sufficient for glucose signaling in S. cerevisiae (9De Winde J.H. Crauwels M. Hohmann S.

Monomeric ScHxk2 displays increased substrate affinity and is inhibited by free ATP (whereas dimeric ScHxk2 is not) in a physiological range of nucleotide concentrations (23Golbik R. Naumann M. Otto A. Müller E.-C. Behlke J. Reuter R. Hübner G. Kriegel T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated amino acid serine 14 is part of a protein kinase A consensus sequence, which is preceded by a nuclear localization motif mediating the observed transfer of the enzyme into the nucleus (10Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ScHxk2 is phosphorylated in vitro at another site (serine 157) by autocatalysis when non-phosphorylateable 5-carbon analogs of glucose are present (25Heidrich K. Otto A. Behlke J. Rush J. Wenzel K.-W. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The latter modification is accompanied by a complete, but fully reversible loss of glucose kinase activity (25Heidrich K. Otto A. Behlke J. Rush J. Wenzel K.-W. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Remarkably, mutation of serine 157 to alanine caused abrogation of glucose-induced, but not fructose-induced, repression (18Kraakman L.S. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. De Winde J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Crabtree-negative yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is receiving increasing attention as a model organism in comparative studies on functional genomics in unicellular and higher eukaryotes (26Breunig K.D.

Microbiol. 1966; 44: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), in which the glycolytic flux is primarily correlated with the external glucose concentration, regulation of glucose uptake in K. lactis is apparently coupled to oxygen supply (26Breunig K.D.

Puglisi P.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Breunig K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with glucose repressible strains being characterized by the presence of a glucose transporter gene that does not exist in strains that are insensitive to the sugar (34Weirich J. Goffrini P. Kuger P. Ferrero I. Breunig K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of glucose repression in K. lactis is largely unknown, the expression of glucose transporters and the glucose transport capacity of the cell are likely to be involved (31Milkowski C. Krampe S. Weirich J. Hasse V. Boles E. Breunig K.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5223-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Weirich J. Goffrini P. Kuger P. Ferrero I. Breunig K.D. Eur. J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The gene RAG5 of K. lactis encodes a protein that shares 70% identity with ScHxk1 and 73% identity with ScHxk2 (35Prior C. Mamessier P. Fukuhara H. Chen X.J. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The observation that rag5 mutants were unable to utilize glucose and displayed neither glucokinase nor fructokinase activity led to the conclusion that RAG5 encodes the only hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) present in K. lactis (35Prior C. Mamessier P. Fukuhara H. Chen X.J. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Remarkably, rag5 mutants were also affected in high and low affinity glucose transport and showed relief from glucose repression of several enzymes (35Prior C. Mamessier P. Fukuhara H. Chen X.J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5860-5866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, K. lactis hexokinase (KlHxk1, Rag5p) turned out to be essential for glucose-induced transcription of the low affinity glucose transporter gene RAG1 and the KlPDCA gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (35Prior C. Mamessier P. Fukuhara H. Chen X.J. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Bianchi M.M. Tizzoni L. Destruelle M. Frontali L. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and was involved in the expression of the high affinity glucose permease Hgt1 (37Billard P. Menart S. Blaisonneau J. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Fukuhara H. Wesolowski-Louvel M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5860-5866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strong evidence for a role of KlHxk1 in glucose signaling came from the in vivo complementation of a rag5 mutation by ScHXK2 and of hxk1 hxk2 mutations by RAG5. ScHXK2 and RAG5 turned out equivalent in complementing hexose phosphorylation, however, RAG5 failed to restore glucose repression in S. cerevisiae (35Prior C. Mamessier P. Fukuhara H. Chen X.J. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The obvious conclusion that the individual molecular structure of the kinase might play a discriminating role in protein-protein interactions mediating the glucose effect was confirmed by a similar study on hexokinase of Hansenula polymorpha. 2H. Karp, A. Järviste, T. M. Kriegel, and T. Alamäe, unpublished data.2H. Karp, A. Järviste, T. M. Kriegel, and T. Alamäe, unpublished data. This paper presents basic molecular and functional properties of the unique hexokinase existing in K. lactis. The experimental approach was focused on the identification of general features enabling glucose kinases to participate in glucose-dependent signal transduction. Data are discussed with special consideration of the molecular mechanisms controlling glucose kinase activity of KlHxk1 including oligomer formation and dissociation and its significance to enzyme function and glucose signaling. Overexpression of RAG5—The gene RAG5 was isolated from a genomic library of K. lactis strain CBS2359/152 (40Wésolowski M. Algeri A.A. Goffrini P. Fukuhara H. Curr. Genet. 1982; 150: 137-140Google Scholar, 41Wésolowski-Louvel M. Tanguy-Rougeau C. Fukuhara H. Yeast. 1988; 4: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by complementation of the rag5 mutation in strain JA6Δrag5 (MATα ade1–600 adeT-600 trp1–11 ura3–12 rag5:URA3) (35Prior C. Mamessier P.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). From the original isolate, two SpeI fragments covering the entire RAG5 gene were subcloned into the pKD1-based multicopy vector pTS32x (43Bui D.M. Kunze I. Horstmann C. Schmidt T. Breunig K.D. Kunze G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 45: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pTSRAG5. Overproduction of the RAG5 gene product KlHxk1 was verified by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-ScHxk2 antibodies. Purification of KlHxk1—K. lactis mutant strain JA6Δrag5/pTSRAG5 carrying RAG5 in multicopy was grown in yeast nitrogen base medium lacking uracil and supplemented with adenine and amino acids (SC medium) according to Ref. 44Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 3-20Crossref Scopus (2526) Google Scholar at 2% glucose in a Biostat ED type fermenter (B. Braun Diessel Biotech, Melsungen, Germany) at pH 5.5 and 30 °C under permanent aeration until an A 600 of 5–6. Typically, 100 g of frozen yeast (–20 °C) was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate + 1mm EDTA + 5mm 2-mercaptoethanol + 1mm PMSF, pH 7.4) to give a cell density of 30–35% (v/v). The cell suspension was vigorously shaken in a Vibrogen Cell Mill Vi4 (Buehler, Tuebingen, Germany) 2 × 2 min at 4 °C using glass beads of 0.35 mm diameter. After treatment with protamine sulfate (0.2% m/v) and pH readjustment, the supernatant was stirred into DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (70 g wet weight; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl + 1 mm EDTA + 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol + 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4). The gel was washed with buffer B followed by buffer B + 100 mm NaCl. Hexokinase was eluted by buffer B + 250 mm NaCl and precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate at 90% saturation. Buffer B was added to the precipitate until a saturation of ammonium sulfate of 50% was reached. The supernatant was desalted (PD 10; Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. Hexokinase was desorbed at pH 7.4 using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 250 mm and precipitated with ammonium sulfate as above. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer A containing ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation and loaded on a Resource ether column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted by linearly decreasing the salt concentration from 50 to 12.5% saturation, precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 90% saturation, and stored at 2–4 °C. Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentrations of purified KlHxk1 and ScHxk2 were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the absorption coefficients of 51,490 m–1 cm–1 and 43,240 m–1 cm–1 as calculated from DNA sequences (cf. Swiss-Prot accession numbers P33284 and P04807) according to Ref. 45Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar. N-terminal Sequencing, Tryptic Digestion, and Mass Spectrometry—30 μg of KlHxk1 was bound to 10 mg of Poros 20 R1 reverse-phase material (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) in a pipette tip with a plug of fine glass wool as a filter. After washing the gel with 3× 100 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the protein was eluted with 60 μl of 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One aliquot of this solution was sequenced in a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), another aliquot (50 μl) was lyophilized, dissolved in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.2, and digested using 1 μg of sequencing grade trypsin at 37 °C for 15 h. The molecular mass of KlHxk1 was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry employing a Q-TOF1 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with an accuracy of 0.01%. For mass measurements, aliquots of the desalted enzyme solution were taken to dryness in a SpeedVac centrifuge and dissolved in a mixture of methanol, water, and formic acid (50:49:1). The solution of tryptic peptides was introduced using the Micromass CapLC system comprising a low flow capillary LC pump and an autosampler. The mass spectrometer survey scan was acquired from m/z 450 to 1,000 with the switching criteria for MS to MS/MS including ion intensity and charge state. The Q-TOF1 instrument performed MS/MS on up to three co-eluting species. MS/MS spectra were processed to generate a peak list. The resulting spectra were searched against a non-redundant data base using MASCOT (46Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). 3www.matrixscience.com. Equilibrium Sedimentation—Experiments were performed in a Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge XL-A using an An50Ti rotor equipped with six-channel cells. KlHxk1 was desalted in and equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm PMSF, and 0.2 mm DTT. Sedimentation equilibrium was analyzed at 15,000 rpm and 15 °C at scanning wavelengths of 230 and 280 nm. Calculation of the apparent molecular mass, Mr(app) employed a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g (47Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Crossref Google Scholar). From the dependence of the Mr(app) values on the enzyme concentration, dissociation constants were calculated for a monomer-homodimer equilibrium according to Equations 1,2,3. M and D represent the molecular mass of monomer and homodimer, respectively (Equation 1). Mr(app)=cM·M+cD·DcM+cD(Eq. 1) The equilibrium concentration of dimer, c D, can be expressed as a function of the equilibrium concentration of monomer, c M, and the dissociation constant, K D (Equation 2). x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“39280eq2”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 2) c M is related to the total (loading) enzyme concentration, c total, in a more complex manner (Equation 3). cM=-KD4+KD42+KD·ctotal2(Eq. 3) Determination of β-Galactosidase Activity—The activity of crude extracts prepared by glass-bead cell disruption was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described in Ref. 48Zachariae W. Kuger P. Breunig K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. One milli-unit of β-galactosidase catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of o-nitrophenolate/min at 30 °C. Stopped-flow Analysis of Glucose Kinase Activity of KlHxk1—The dye indicator linked assay responding to proton liberation as catalyzed by hexose kinases has been described previously (23Golbik R. Naumann M. Otto A. Müller E.-C. Behlke J. Reuter R. Hübner G. Kriegel T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at 25 °C with an Applied Photophysics BioSequential DX.18 MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Leatherhead, UK). The slit widths of both monochromators were set to 7 mm. KlHxk1 was equilibrated on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with incomplete assay buffer (buffer I) consisting of 4.0 mm TEA/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT at pH 7.4. Kinetic studies were carried out in complete assay buffer (buffer C) prepared by supplementing buffer I with glucose, ATP, and p-nitrophenol(ate) and its subsequent mixing with equal volumes of KlHxk1 solution to give the final substrate and enzyme concentrations indicated. The buffering action of ATP was taken into account by stopped-flow titration of buffer C with HCl at different concentrations of the nucleotide substrate. The corresponding absorption coefficients of p-nitrophenol(ate) (Fig. 1, panel A) allow calculation of authentic enzyme activities. In addition, buffer I containing commercially available yeast hexokinase at the highest enzyme concentration employed in this study (1 mg/ml) was titrated with HCl. The close similarity of the corresponding two data sets (Fig. 1, panel B) indicates a negligible contribution of the protein to the buffering capacity of the assay system. Autophosphorylation-Inactivation Assay—KlHxk1 and ScHxk2 were incubated in 50 mm Hepes buffer containing 12 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 4.0 mm ATP, and 100 mm d-xylose at pH 7.5 and 30 °C as already described (25Heidrich K. Otto A. Behlke J. Rush J. Wenzel K.-W. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was 167 μg/ml, respectively. Glucose kinase activity was measured using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme to monitor the time course of inactivation. ATP and d-xylose were omitted in the controls corresponding to a residual activity of 100%. Biochemicals—Media constituents were from Difco, p-nitrophenol was a Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) product. PMSF and DTT were obtained from Sigma. ATP (special quality disodium salt), NADP+ (disodium salt), glucose 6-phosphate (disodium salt), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucose isomerase, yeast hexokinase, and SDS-PAGE standard were from Roche Diagnostics, sequencing grade trypsin was from Promega. ScHxk2 was prepared according to Ref. 23Golbik R. Naumann M. Otto A. Müller E.-C. Behlke J. Reuter R. Hübner G. Kriegel T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. All other substances used were of analytical grade. Glucose Sensitivity of KlHxk1 Donor Strain—Crude extracts of multicopy strain JA6Δrag5/pTSRAG5 prepared by French Press cell disruption following growth at 2% glucose contained 4–5-fold higher glucose kinase activity than extracts of the corresponding wild type strain JA6 expressing RAG5 in single copy. Whereas glucose repression of β-galactosidase was clearly relieved in the JA6Δrag5 deletion mutant (Table I, upper line), plasmid pTSRAG5 fully restored the glucose effect (bottom line). The activity of β-galactosidase was higher in the rag5 deletion mutant both in the presence and absence of the inductor galactose (Table I, 977 versus 6.4 and 16.8 versus 4.1 milliunits/mg). Wild type cells grown in the absence of glucose exhibited activity levels of β-galactosidase that were similar to those of the rag5 mutants (1,250 and 20 milliunits/mg for growth at 2% galactose or 3% glycerol, respectively) indicating that RAG5 was essential for mediating glucose repression.Table IInfluence of RAG5 on glucose repression in K. lactisStrainβ-Galactosidase activity(Glucose + galactose)(Glucose + glycerol)milliunits/mg proteinJA6Δrag5977 ± 81.7aSince strain JA6Δrag5 does not grow on glucose, it was pre-grown in glycerol medium, kept in glucose medium overnight, and subsequently shifted to (glucose + galactose) medium.16.8 ± 1.6JA66.4 ± 2.34.1 ± 1.0JA6Δrag5/pTSRAG52.4 ± 1.45.3bValue from single experiment.a Since strain JA6Δrag5 does not grow on glucose, it was pre-grown in glycerol medium, kept in glucose medium overnight, and subsequently shifted to (glucose + galactose) medium.b Value from single experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2162298393,"An in vitro system was created to study the process of membrane protein degradation by using photosystem I (PS1) as a model membrane protein. Purified chloroplast membranes were incubated at 30 °C in a defined buffer along with various extracts or reagents to reconstitute the disassembly and degradation of PS1, which was monitored by a variety of techniques that probe the integrity of the PS1 complex: photo-biochemical assays, semi-native gel electrophoresis, low temperature fluorescence spectroscopy, and immunoblots using antibodies against different PS1 subunits. During a typical time course, degradation of PS1 appeared to be a multievent process, with disassembly of the complex preceding proteolysis of the subunits. The first change seen was a rapid (<5 min) decrease in PS1 photochemical activity. This was followed by a diminution of far-red fluorescence emission from the core antenna of PS1 and a slower disassembly of the PS1 chlorophyll-protein core complex, as visualized by semi-native gel electrophoresis. Surprisingly, the latter was not accompanied by a similar rate of proteolysis of the PsaA core subunit. In contrast, addition of soluble proteases caused rapid loss of immuno-detectable PS1 polypeptides and cleavage of the major PS1 polypeptides in interhelical loops. The in vitro degradation process was time- and temperature-dependent but did not require ATP, GTP, or soluble chloroplast proteins. Chelation of divalent cations by EDTA inhibited the later steps of disassembly and proteolysis, and this effect could be reversed by addition of micromolar Zn2+, with Co2+ and Ca2+ providing somewhat lower activity.

The in vitro degradation process was time- and temperature-dependent but did not require ATP, GTP, or soluble chloroplast proteins. Chelation of divalent cations by EDTA inhibited the later steps of disassembly and proteolysis, and this effect could be reversed by addition of micromolar Zn2+, with Co2+ and Ca2+ providing somewhat lower activity. Biological cells are dynamic structures in which nearly all the molecular components are in a state of continuous turnover. The turnover of molecular components continues even when the cell is not undergoing active growth (1Wiley H.S. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 24: 369-412Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Steady-state protein concentration in the cell is determined by the relative rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation (proteolysis). Modulation of these processes can have dramatic effects on the abundance of individual cellular proteins, converting a stable protein into a short lived one and vice versa. Intracellular proteases play a major role in controlling protein abundance, as well as clearing damaged and misfolded proteins from the cell. Much is known about the regulated degradation of proteins in several systems. Eukaryotic proteolytic systems include lysosomal proteases and the well characterized ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (2Rivett A.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the latter, proteins are targeted for degradation by covalent linkage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to the ϵ-amino group of specific lysines in the target protein. In general, poly-ubiquitination targets these proteins for ATP-dependent degradation by a complex of enzymes known as the proteosome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Examples of proteolytic systems of prokaryotic origin include the ATP-dependent FtsH, Lon, and ClpP proteases and the ATP-independent DegP protease. Substrates of these systems are continuing to be identified; however, most of what is known about the mechanisms of protein degradation comes from examples where the substrate is a soluble protein. Less is understood about how integral membrane proteins are degraded. This has been due in part to the intrinsic difficulty of working with membrane proteins, along with a lack of probes for the integrity of the polypeptide structure within the lipid bilayer. What remains unclear is how proteolytic systems are able to degrade the hydrophobic, integral membrane portions of membrane proteins. Membrane proteins are involved in many vital biological functions, such as signal transduction, ion and metabolite transport, energy conversion, and structural support. Because of the many important functions of membrane proteins as well as the existence of several disease states associated with membrane protein function gone awry (4Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3729-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 6Vekrellis K.

A. 1996; 93: 4526-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), understanding how these proteins are degraded has become a topic of considerable interest in recent years. Membrane proteins often exist as multisubunit complexes, and it is well known that the inefficient assembly of complexes or defects in a single subunit of the complex can lead to the degradation of all the subunits of the complexes. The four major membrane protein complexes located in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane of green plants, photosystem II (PS2), 1The abbreviations used are: PS2, photosystem II; Chl, chlorophyll; CP1, chlorophyll-protein complex 1; CP2, chlorophyll-protein complex 2; DTT, dithiothreitol; EDTA, ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; LHC, light harvesting complex; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PS1, photosystem I; TAP, Tris-acetate-phosphate medium; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. cytochrome b 6 f, photosystem I (PS1), and ATP synthase, all exhibit this phenomenon (9Rochaix J.D.

This has led to the idea that the chloroplast possesses a “quality control” system that is responsible for assessing the integrity of these complexes and targeting the aberrant ones for degradation. Not much is known about the mechanisms used to recognize aberrant membrane proteins in the chloroplast; however, the identities of several chloroplasts proteases (ClpP, DegP, FtsH, SppA, and Lon) have been revealed recently by genomic sequencing and biochemical and molecular techniques (11Ostersetzer O.

Furthermore, several reports indicate that some of these proteases are involved in the degradation of thylakoid membrane protein complexes. The soluble stromal protease ClpP is thought to participate in the in vivo degradation of the large membrane-bound cytochrome b 6 f complex (19Majeran W. Wollman F.A. Vallon O. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar) and PS2 (20Majeran W. Olive J. Drapier D. Vallon O. Wollman F.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound ATP- and Zn2+-dependent FtsH protease has also been implicated in some aspects of PS2 degradation (21Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as well as the light-stimulated degradation of unassembled Rieske FeS protein (22Ostersetzer O. Adam Z. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, FtsH reportedly degrades several integral membrane proteins in a processive manner (23Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the light-dependent degradation of PS2 during photoinhibition has received much attention, much less is known about the degradation of PS1. However, PS1 could serve as an excellent model for the study of membrane protein degradation for several reasons. 1) A crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution is available for the cyanobacterial PS1 (24Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). 2) The vast majority of the functional parts of PS1 are in the integral membrane portions of the protein, unlike many membrane proteins, which are basically soluble proteins anchored to the membrane by one transmembrane α-helix. 3) PS1 has many cofactors (∼100 chlorophyll molecules (Chl), 8 carotenoids, 2 phylloquinones, and 3 Fe4S4 clusters), which can serve as built-in spectroscopic probes for the structure of the protein. The core of PS1 is composed of the heterodimeric proteins PsaA and PsaB; both have molecular masses around 82 kDa and possess 11 transmembrane α-helices. The first 6 transmembrane α-helices of PsaA and PsaB bind chlorophylls that serve as the “core” antenna, while the last 5 form a cage around all but 2 of the cofactors involved in photochemistry. Electron transfer through PS1 begins with the excitation of P700, which then transfers an electron to a nearby Chl generating a charge-separated state (P700+ Chl–). This state is further stabilized by the transfer of the electron to the phylloquinone and then finally to the iron-sulfur clusters. The iron-sulfur clusters are then oxidized by the soluble ferredoxin, and the system is re-set by the reduction of P700+ by the luminal protein plastocyanin. The subunits PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE form the docking site for ferredoxin on the stromal side of PS1, and PsaF (along with PsaA/B) forms the docking site for plastocyanin in the lumen. Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of PS1. Another class of thylakoid membrane proteins important in photosynthesis are the light harvesting complexes (LHC). Each LHC polypeptide contains 3 transmembrane α-helices binding 13 chlorophylls and 2 carotenoids. They are often referred to as the peripheral antenna of PS1 because they function in funneling the excitation energy from light to the core antenna of PS1 and on to P700. Algal Strain Growth and Chloroplast Membrane Purification—All experiments shown in this paper made use of the cw10 (cell wall-less) strain CC-849 (Chlamydomonas Genetics Center; Duke University). Algae were grown photoheterotrophically at 25 °C in well aerated liquid TAP medium (25Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 25-40Google Scholar) containing 50 mm sorbitol to a concentration of 2–4 × 106 cells/ml in a volume of ∼3 liters. Cells were centrifuged at 2300 × g for 10 min in a GS-3 rotor at 4 °C and resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in Breaking buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, and 5 mm MgCl2). The cells were then lysed gently by addition of concentrated saponin to 0.25% final concentration, followed by incubation for 10 min on ice. From this point on, material was kept at 0–4 °C. Chloroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 2300 × g for 1 min in an SS-34 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 24 ml of Breaking buffer at 4 °C, and two 12-ml portions were loaded on top of 12 ml of 45% Centricoll in Breaking buffer. After centrifugation for 20 min in a Beckman SW-28 swinging bucket rotor at 4600 × g, whole chloroplasts were removed from the top of the 45% Centricoll layer, diluted with 3 volumes of Breaking buffer, and collected by spinning at 1500 × g for 5 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and the chloroplasts were lysed hypotonically by resuspension with 10 times the pellet volume of Lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). Membranes and stroma were separated by centrifugation for 20 min at 265,000 × g in a Ti-70 rotor. Supernatant containing stromal material was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of Lysis buffer; glycerol (20% final concentration) was added to both stromal and membrane fractions. Separate aliquots were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Chlorophyll concentration was measured as described by Porra et al. (26Porra R. Thompson W. Kriedemann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). In Vitro Degradation Assays—Chloroplast membranes were centrifuged and resuspended in Reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT) on ice at a concentration of 0.1 mg of Chl/ml. Degradation assays were initiated by transfer to 30 °C, and samples were taken over time, as detailed below. PS1 Photochemical Assays—At each time point, 600 μl of sample (60 μg of Chl) was removed, centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in 80 μl of buffer HE (5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) + 20% glycerol, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C for subsequent O2 uptake measurements. A Clark-type oxygen electrode was used to measure O2 uptake rates essentially as described (27Redding K. Macmillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), using a red LED as actinic light source. Double-reciprocal plots were used to estimate the maximal velocity of O2 uptake. Low-Temperature Fluorescence Spectroscopy—At each time point, 7.5 μl (0.75 μg of Chl) was removed and mixed well with 242.5 μl of HE buffer containing 60% glycerol and 5 μg/ml B-phycoerythrin (Porphyridium cruentum; Sigma). The mixtures were transferred to quartz tubes (5-mm diameter) and immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C for subsequent low-temperature fluorescence measurements. These were performed at 77 K using a Dewar that holds the quartz tubes in the excitation beam path while bathed in liquid N2. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected with a FLUOROMAX-3 spectrofluorometer between 550 and 750 nm using excitation at 467 nm. Green Gels and Protein Gels—At each time point, 500 μl of sample (50 μg of Chl) was removed and centrifuged for 2 min at 21,000 × g. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was frozen with liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C for subsequent green gel analysis. Membranes were resuspended with 50 μl of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol), pH 6.8, 12% sucrose, 2% SDS) at 1 mg of Chl/ml, incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Twenty μg of chlorophyll was loaded in each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking and 10% resolving) and run at 12 V cm–1 for 3 h. Images were obtained with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) using white light and a red filter to reduce background; quantification of optical densities was performed using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. For analysis of CP1 polypeptides, the CP1 band was carefully cut out of the gel and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing on ice, the gel slice was ground in 10 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (4 m urea, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), followed by addition of 80 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer and careful mixing. After incubation at 50 °C for 15 min and centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 5 min, 30 μl of supernatant was loaded onto a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis for 5 h at 12 V cm–1 using 0.05% SDS in the running buffer, the gel was stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and photographed with the MultiImager using shortwave UV excitation and a 520-nm low-pass filter. Immunoblot Analysis—At each time point, 10 μl of sample (1 μg of Chl) was removed and placed into tubes containing 10 μl of 4× SDS-Loading buffer (8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.005% bromphenol blue), 19 μl of H2O, and 1 μl of 1 m DTT. The samples were immediately vortexed, frozen with liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C for subsequent immunoblot analysis. Samples were solubilized by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min, and 10 μl of supernatant (250 ng Chl) was loaded onto a 4–12% BisTris gel (NuPAGE). The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Millipore Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunoblots were performed as described using antibodies raised from rabbits against PsaA, PsaD, and PsaF (28Boudreaux B. MacMillan F. Teutloff C. Agalarov R. Gu F. Grimaldi S. Bittl R. Brettel K. Redding K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37299-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence was imaged and quantified with a Fluor-S MultiImager using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The initial experiments in this study involved incubation of PS1-containing membranes in reaction buffer for variable lengths of time to determine the in vitro activity endogenous to the membranes. Purified chloroplast membranes were used to minimize the possibility of artifactual proteolysis arising from proteases normally located in other cellular compartments. Several different techniques were used to follow the degradation of PS1. O2 Polarography—A Clark-type O2 electrode (29Hall D.O. Rao K.K. Photosynthesis. 5th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 10-11Google Scholar) was used to monitor PS1 photochemical activity after various lengths of incubation in vitro. Ascorbate served as an electron donor to P700, and reduction of O2 (to O2- ) was mediated by methyl viologen. The rate of PS1-dependent O2 reduction was measured at different light fluxes by subtracting the dark rates from the light rates, and double-reciprocal plots allowed calculation of the maximal rate. The rates of O2 uptake are plotted versus light intensity in Fig. 2. It is clear that there were two light-dependent O2 reduction activities, a saturable activity (PS1) and a non-saturable activity. The latter is non-enzymatic and has been described before (30Caspi V. Malkin S. Marder J.B. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As the length of incubation increased, the overall rate of O2 uptake decreased until, after 40–60 min, the saturable activity was practically gone, although the non-saturable activity persisted (Fig. 2; see Fig. 6).Fig. 6Quantitative summary of PS1 degradation time courses. Each curve contains data from several experiments like those shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 (n = 3 for photochemical activity; n > 5 for all others; the bars are 1 S.D.). Using double-reciprocal plots, the maximal velocity of O2 uptake (triangles) was determined after each incubation time. The average and standard deviation from 3 separate experiments is shown along with a fit to a biexponential decay (A 1 = 49%, τ1 = 1.7 min, A 2 = 38%, τ2 = 23 min). Normalized low temperature fluorescence emission (circles) was integrated in the 710–713-nm range. The CP1 band (diamonds) was quantified by its absorbance in the red region. The level of PsaA (squares) was measured immunologically, as in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Low-Temperature Fluorescence—Association of chlorophylls with the polypeptides of PS1 significantly shifts their fluorescence emission to the red, allowing them to serve as spectroscopic reporters for the structure of the protein at the level of the lipid bilayer. It is necessary to collect spectra at cryogenic temperatures to see PS1 fluorescence (29Hall D.O. Rao K.K. Photosynthesis. 5th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 10-11Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra of chloroplast membranes incubated for various lengths of time in the in vitro system are shown in Fig. 3. The primary features of the emission spectra are peaks at 685 and 695 nm and a shoulder centered at 711–712 nm and trailing further into the red. The first two peaks are due to the PS2 antenna chlorophylls, although the broad red band corresponds to PS1 antenna chlorophylls (31Murakami A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar). Within 10–20 min of incubation, the fluorescence emission from PS1 dropped by 25–50% (Fig. 3; see Fig. 6), along with PS2 fluorescence, and continued to decline steadily out to 90 min, leaving a broad, featureless peak centered around 682 nm. This steady loss of fluorescence from protein-associated chlorophylls was accompanied by an increase in the fluorescence from free chlorophylls at 660 nm (Fig. 3), whose intensity was somewhat variable. Green Gels—A form of semi-native gel electrophoresis, often referred to as “green gels,” was used to assess the integrity of the PS1 core complex after various lengths of incubation in vitro. Gentle solubilization of chloroplast membranes releases PS1 sub-complexes (CP1), containing the core subunits PsaA and PsaB along with most of their associated chlorophylls, as well as chlorophyll-containing LHC complexes (CP2) from the membrane (32Thornber J.P. Gregory R.P. Smith C.A. Bailey J.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE at low-temperature, complexes are easily visualized as green bands. Disappearance of both the CP1 and CP2 complexes occurred progressively over time (Fig. 4), and they had dropped by more than 70% after 90 min (see Fig. 6). Immunoblots—Immunoblots were performed to follow proteolysis of the PsaA and PsaD subunits. These serve as representative core and peripheral subunits, and the antibodies used to detect them gave strong, specific signals. An immunoblot from the initial experiment is shown in Fig. 5. Relative to the rate of disappearance of the CP1 band in Fig. 4, proteolysis of the PsaA and PsaD subunits seemed to be much slower. In particular, degradation of PsaD was minimal (5–10%) after 90 min, although PsaA experienced greater degradation (∼40%). Also, a more slowly migrating band with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa accumulated at the later time points (Fig. 5). Additional experiments indicated that PsaD was fairly stable even after 16 h of incubation (see below), although proteolysis of the small intrinsic PsaF subunit (see Fig. 1) seemed to occur with similar kinetics as that of PsaA (data not shown). Given the apparently higher rate of proteolysis of PsaA compared with PsaD, it was of interest to determine whether or not PsaD had been removed from the membrane, because degradation of PsaA might cause PsaD to be released from the membrane. In order to test this, samples were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions after incubation and separately solubilized for immunoblot analysis. Surprisingly, the PsaD subunit was found exclusively in the pellet throughout a 90-min time course, during which ∼40–50% of the PsaA subunit was degraded (data not shown) Summary of Activity—Time courses such as that shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 were run on different chloroplast preparations, and the degradation activity was quite reproducible. Results from several such time courses were quantified and averaged to produce Fig. 6. The drop in PS1 photochemical activity was the most rapid event, with maximum activity down to roughly 50% within 5 min of incubation, followed by a more gradual decrease. The next most rapid process was the drop in chlorophyll fluorescence from PS1, indicative of perturbation of pigment-protein contacts. The fact that it was not matched by a corresponding rise in fluorescence from free chlorophylls does not lend support to the idea that pigments were being removed from the proteins. The decrease in CP1 and PsaA was steady over the time courses, with the former dropping faster. Taken together, these data would indicate that the process we observe in vitro is primary disassembly, rather than degradation, of PS1. Proteolysis of the subunits is relatively slow in this in vitro system, although it was significantly faster than proteolysis of PsaA in vivo, where its half-life is 18–24 h (data not shown). PS1 Degradation in Whole and Lysed Chloroplasts—In order to address the physiological relevance of the in vitro system, degradation of PS1 was examined in both lysed chloroplast membranes and whole chloroplasts. Freshly isolated chloroplasts were divided, and half were immediately lysed hypotonically, although the other half were left intact. Both were resuspended in reaction buffer and incubated for various times. The integrity of the whole chloroplasts was inspected microscopically after each time point had been reached; even after 90 min of incubation, the whole chloroplasts remained intact (data not shown). By using all four techniques, there was little difference in the rate or extent of PS1 degradation in lysed versus whole chloroplasts. In both cases, the results resembled those of the initial experiments described in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (data not shown). Because of this and the ease of manipulation of the lysed membranes, all further experiments were performed in this system. Temperature Dependence of PS1 Degradation—In order to assess the dependence of the degradation activity upon temperature, 100-min end point assays were performed at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 °C. The results are presented in Fig. 7. There was essentially no PS1 degradation after 100 min at 0 °C, as these samples resembled the 0-min time point (data not shown). Degradation was almost undetectable at 10 °C, except for a small (∼20%) drop in far-red fluorescence. Far-red fluorescence dropped much more at 20 °C (∼55%) and 30 °C (∼80%). The chlorophyll-protein complex CP1 dropped by 30 or 80% at 20 or 30 °C, respectively. Degradation of PsaD was not detectable under 30 °C. Accumulation of the 115-kDa band was barely detectable after 100 min at 20 °C and became more pronounced at 30 °C (data not shown). Addition of Soluble Proteases—To test whether or not PsaA and PsaD were intrinsically stable to proteolysis and to model what might be expected upon the addition of stroma, membranes were incubated in the presence or absence of trypsin and chymotrypsin for various lengths of time. As expected, disappearance of immunoreactive PsaA and PsaD bands was greatly enhanced by the addition of proteases (Fig. 8A); within 10 min, the vast majority of full-length PsaA and PsaD had disappeared. In contrast, disappearance of CP1 and CP2 was accelerated only slightly by the presence of proteases, although they caused a readily discernible increase in migration rate within 10 min, probably by removal of peripheral subunits or extramembranous portions of core subunits (Fig. 8B). In addition, the slowly migrating 115-kDa band, often seen accumulating at the later time points, did not accumulate in the presence of proteases, indicating that it may be particularly protease-sensitive. Very similar results were obtained with protease K (data not shown). We hypothesized that the apparent discrepancy between the immunoblot and green gel results stemmed from the fact that these soluble proteases could only hydrolyze peptide bonds in the interhelical loops (in the case of PsaA) or parts of the polypeptide that were not tightly folded. Whereas such proteolysis would cause disappearance or shifts in the immunoreactive bands, it would not necessarily cause dissolutio"
https://openalex.org/W2001568395,"Treponema denticola cystalysin is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes the α,β-elimination of l-cysteine to pyruvate, ammonia, and H2S. Similar to other PLP enzymes, an active site Lys residue (Lys-238) forms an internal Schiff base with PLP. The mechanistic role of this residue has been studied by an analysis of the mutant enzymes in which Lys-238 has been replaced by Ala (K238A) and Arg (K238R). Both apomutants reconstituted with PLP bind noncovalently ∼50% of the normal complement of the cofactor and have a lower affinity for the coenzyme than that of wild-type. Kinetic analyses of the reactions of K238A and K238R mutants with glycine compared with that of wild-type demonstrate the decrease of the rate of Schiff base formation by 103- and 7.5 × 104-fold, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease of the rate of Schiff base hydrolysis. Thus, a role of Lys-238 is to facilitate formation of external aldimine by transimination. Kinetic data reveal that the K238A mutant is inactive in the α,β-elimination of l-cysteine and β-chloro-l-alanine, whereas K238R retains 0.3% of the wild-type activity. These data, together with those derived from a spectral analysis of the reaction of Lys-238 mutants with unproductive substrate analogues, indicate that Lys-238 is an essential catalytic residue, possibly participating as a general base abstracting the Cα-proton from the substrate and possibly as a general acid protonating the β-leaving group.

Kinetic analyses of the reactions of K238A and K238R mutants with glycine compared with that of wild-type demonstrate the decrease of the rate of Schiff base formation by 103- and 7.5 × 104-fold, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease of the rate of Schiff base hydrolysis. Thus, a role of Lys-238 is to facilitate formation of external aldimine by transimination. Kinetic data reveal that the K238A mutant is inactive in the α,β-elimination of l-cysteine and β-chloro-l-alanine, whereas K238R retains 0.3% of the wild-type activity. These data, together with those derived from a spectral analysis of the reaction of Lys-238 mutants with unproductive substrate analogues, indicate that Lys-238 is an essential catalytic residue, possibly participating as a general base abstracting the Cα-proton from the substrate and possibly as a general acid protonating the β-leaving group. Cystalysin utilizes pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate; PNP, pyridoxine 5′-phosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate; PNP, pyridoxine 5′-phosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. as its coenzyme and is categorized as a member of the α subfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes that include aspartate aminotransferase. The cDNA from Treponema denticola has been heterologously cloned in Escherichia coli, the recombinant enzyme has been crystallized, and the three-dimensional structure solved (1Krupka H.I. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The PLP cofactor in the active site forms a Schiff base with the ϵ-amino group of Lys-238 of cystalysin (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The spectrum of cystalysin exhibits absorption maxima at 418 and 320 nm, in addition to the protein band at 281 nm. The 418-nm band is due to the protonated internal aldimine, whereas the 320-nm band is due to a substituted aldamine. The apparent pK spec of this spectral transition is ∼8.4 (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cystalysin catalyzes the α,β-elimination of l-cysteine to generate pyruvate, ammonia, and H2S (3Chu L. Burgum A. Kolodrubetz D. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A catalytic mechanism has been suggested in which, after transaldimination, the released Lys-238 abstracts the Cα proton from the substrate with its deprotonated ϵ-amino group, producing a carbanionic intermediate stabilized as the characteristic quinonoid intermediate. Then, after reaching an optimal position within hydrogen bonding distance to Sγ, Lys-238 protonates the sulfur atom, and the resulting thiol is released. Finally, reverse transaldimination of the PLP aminoacrylate takes place; Lys-238 attacks the C4′ atom, converting the aminoacrylate into an iminoproprionate, which is released and hydrolyzed to pyruvate and ammonia (1Krupka H.I. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, substrate specificity studies reveal that cystalysin displays catalytic features similar to those of cyste(i)ne desulfhydrase (C-DES). Indeed, several sulfur- and non-sulfur-containing amino acids as well as disulfidic amino acids serve as substrates for cystalysin, with l-djenkolic acid and l-cystine being better substrates than l-cysteine (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for α,β-elimination indicates that a single ionizing group with a pK value of ∼ 6.6 must be unprotonated to achieve maximum velocity. This pK has been tentatively associated with the ionization of Lys-238 (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lysine residues involved in internal aldimines in PLP-dependent enzymes have been proposed to have a multitude of roles. They have been shown to increase the reactivity of the PLP 4′-aldehyde group, facilitating the formation of an external aldimine between the substrate and the PLP cofactor (3Chu L. Burgum A. Kolodrubetz D. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nishimura K. Tanizawa K. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Futaki S. Manning J.M. Soda K.

Although progress in the spectroscopic and kinetic features of T. denticola cystalysin has been made recently, the catalytic mechanism and the individual residues essential for enzyme activity remain to be elucidated. To understand the functional contribution of the active site lysine residue (Lys-238) to stages of the reaction catalyzed by cystalysin, we have changed Lys-238 of cystalysin to Ala or Arg and have studied the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of the mutants. Evidence is provided that Lys-238, in addition to increasing the PLP binding affinity and facilitating the formation of external aldimine, plays an essential catalytic role in α,β-elimination. Materials—PLP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), l-cystine, β-chloro-l-alanine, glycine, l-homoserine, l-methionine, NADH, pyruvate, rabbit muscle l-lactic dehydrogenase, methylamine, ethanolamine, ammonium chloride, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside were from Sigma. l-cysteine and l-serine were from Fluka. All other chemicals were of highest grade commercially available. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The K238A and K238R mutant forms of cystalysin were made on the wild-type construct pUC18:hly (13Cordes E.H. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The kit employs double-stranded DNA as a template, two complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation, and DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech AG (Anzinger, Germany). The K238A and K238R mutants were produced using as primers 5′-GCTCCGTCTGCAACATTTAATATAGCAGGAATGGGC-3′, 5′-GCTCCGTCTAGAACATTTAATATAGCAGGAATGGGC-3′, and their complementary oligonucleotides, respectively. The coding regions of the mutated hly genes were sequenced to confirm the mutations. E. coli strain DH5α cells were transformed and used for expression. Expression and Purification of K238A and K238R Mutants—The conditions used for expression of the K238A and K238R mutants in E. coli were as described for the wild-type enzyme (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant forms of cystalysin were purified to homogeneity with the following modifications of the procedure described previously (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After the DEAE-FF-Sepharose XK 26/60 step, the enzymatic solution was concentrated to ∼6 ml and rechromatographed on the same resin (1.6 × 13-cm column) equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. The enzyme was eluted with a 225-ml linear gradient whose final concentration of potassium phosphate was 50 mm, pH 7.6. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼3 ml by Centriplus (Amicon). The protein concentration in all cystalysin samples was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using a previously determined extinction coefficient of 12.77 × 104m–1 cm–1 at 281 nm (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PLP content of wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined by releasing the coenzyme in 0.1 m NaOH and using ϵ = 6600 m–1 cm–1 at 388 nm. Preparation and Reconstitution of Apo-K238A and Apo-K238R Mutants—Apoenzymes K238A and K238R were prepared by incubation of enzyme (∼1 mg/ml) with 0.5 m hydroxylamine in 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, for 3 h at 25 °C; this was followed by gel filtration on a desalting Hi-Prep column 26/10 equilibrated with 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9. For reconstitution, a 10-fold molar excess of PLP was added, and, after 1 h, the solution was loaded on the above column previously equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The enzyme was then concentrated in microconcentrators. The apparent equilibrium constant for dissociation of PLP from K238A, Kd , was determined by measuring the molar fraction of enzyme-bound PLP, calculated as ([PLP]total – [PLP]free)/[K238A]total in the presence of PLP at a concentration varying from 20 to 950 nm. [PLP]total and [PLP]free were experimentally determined by HPLC in combination with ultrafiltration as described previously (14Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Kd value for dissociation of PLP from K238R was determined by measuring enzyme activity of the apoenzyme (2.7 μm) in the presence of PLP ranging from 0.05 to 20 μm. Enzyme Activity Assay—α,β-eliminase activity was measured by an spectrophotometric assay coupled with lactic dehydrogenase as reported previously (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetic parameters of the catalysis, the assays were performed as indicated above using a fixed amount of enzyme, whereas l-cysteine or β-chloro-l-alanine concentration was varied from 0.15 to 10 mm. The experimental data were fit into the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Km and k cat values. Spectrophotometric Measurements—Absorption measurements were made with a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. The enzyme solution was drawn through a 0.2-μm filter to reduce light scattering from the small amount of precipitate. Fluorescence spectra were taken with a FP750 Jasco spectrofluorometer using 5-nm excitation and emission bandwidths at a protein concentration varying from 1 to 8 μm. Spectra of blanks, i.e. samples containing all components except cystalysin, were taken immediately before the measurements of samples containing protein. Blank spectra were subtracted from the spectra containing the enzyme. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco V-710 spectrophotometer with a thermostatically controlled compartment at 25 °C. For near-UV and visible wavelengths, protein concentration varied from 0.8 to 1 mg/ml in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Routinely, three spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 2 nm and averaged automatically, except where indicated. For far-UV measurements, the protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml with a 0.1-cm path length. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Analysis by UV-Vis Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Wild-type cystalysin (7 μm) was mixed with glycine in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Reactions proceeded at 25 °C, and coenzyme absorbance changes were monitored using a Biologic SFM3 mixer with a TC-100 (1-cm path length) quartz cell coupled to a BioKine PMS-60. The dead time was 3.6 ms at a flow velocity of 12 ml/s. Absorbance scans (500) from 300 to 550 nm were collected on a logarithmic time scale with a J&M Tidas 16 256 diode array detector (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) and analyzed using either SPECFIT (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC) or Biokine 4.01 (Biologic, Claix, France) to determine the observed rate constants. Curve-fitting Analysis—Binding of ligands (L) to wild-type and active site lysine mutants was monitored by pre-steady-state and steady-state analysis, respectively. The data were fitted to a single exponential process (Equation 1, shown below) to obtain k obs. The binding of ligands to cystalysin, either wild-type or mutant, was followed by measuring the change in the absorbance and/or emission fluorescence intensity with time upon the addition of ligand. The kinetic measurements were performed at several ligand concentrations using an excess of ligand over enzyme concentration. For each ligand concentration, the time course was recorded, and the absorbance and/or fluorescence readings at each ligand concentration were fitted to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, shown here in Equation 1, At=Aeq-(Aeq-A0)e-kobst(Eq. 1) where A 0 is the absorbance and/or emission fluorescence reading prior to ligand addition, At is the reading at the time t, and A eq is the reading at equilibrium For ligands where the dependence of k obs was linear, the data were fitted to Equation 2, shown here, x0026;x0026;E+L⇌koffkonELx0026;x0026;kobs=kon[L]+koff(Eq. 2) which describes a single-step binding model to determine k on and k off. k on is the apparent second-order rate constant for the formation of the Schiff base from free enzyme and ligand, and k off is the first-order rate constant for the decay of the Schiff base species to free enzyme and ligand. For ligands where k obs had a hyperbolic dependence on ligand concentration, the k obs data were fitted to Equation 3, shown here, x0026;x0026;E+L⇌KEL'EL'⇌k-2k+2ELx0026;x0026;kobs=k+2[L]KEL'+[L]+k-2(Eq. 3) which describes a two-step binding model, assuming that the first step is rapid, wherein KEL′ is the dissociation constant for the intermediate formed prior to the formation of the Schiff base species, and k +2 and k –2 are first-order rate constants for the interconversion between the intermediate (EL′) and the final Schiff base species (EL). The parameters in Equation 3 are related to those in Equation 2 as follows: k on = k +2/KEL′ and k off = k –2. Amplitude data (ΔA = A eq-A 0) were fitted to Equation 4, as shown, ΔA=Δε420nm[E][Gly](Kd+[Gly])(Eq. 4) to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for Schiff base formation between glycine and wild-type cystalysin, where [E] represents the total concentration of the enzyme. As shown in Equation 5, Y=Ymax[E]t+[PLP]t+Kd-([E]t+[PLP]t+Kd)2-4[E]t[PLP]t2[E]t(Eq. 5) the Kd value of the mutant-coenzyme complex was obtained using a tight binding hypothesis. All data analysis to determine model-derived kinetic parameters was performed by nonlinear curve fitting using KaleidaGraph 3.52 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). To define the functional role(s) of the lysine residue that forms an internal aldimine with PLP in the active site of cystalysin, we compared some spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the wild-type enzyme and mutants in which Lys-238 is replaced by alanine or arginine. The yield of K238A and K238R mutants after purification was ∼70–80% that of the wild-type protein. The purified mutant proteins were homogeneous, as indicated by a single band on SDS/PAGE. Spectroscopic Properties of K238A and K238R Mutants— Wild-type cystalysin displays characteristic absorption spectra with maxima at 418 and 320 nm, attributable to the ketoenamine form of the Schiff base and a substituted aldamine, respectively (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The spectral properties of the PLP aldehyde are known to differ significantly from the internal aldimine and to give rise to maxima at 290, 390, and/or 335 nm (15Harris C.M. Johnson R.J. Metzler D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 421: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As isolated, the K238A mutant displays an absorption maximum at 412 nm, whereas the K238R mutant exhibits two peaks, one centered at 390–400 nm and the other at 320 nm. K238A and K238R mutants bind 1 and 0.37 mol of PLP per mol of dimer, respectively. The ratio A 320/A 390–400 in the K238R mutant is ∼3. HPLC analysis of the supernatants, obtained after reduction of the mutants with NaBH4 followed by denaturation and centrifugation, indicates the presence of two peaks. On the basis of its retention time, one peak, corresponding to ∼43 and 78% of the original coenzyme content of K238A and K238R mutants, respectively, was identified as pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP). The other peak does not migrate with the same retention time as any of the controls (PLP, PMP, PNP) but elutes with a retention time similar to those of PLP adducts with amine or amino acids and most likely arises from the adduct of PLP with an uncharacterized compound. The reconstituted holoenzymes K238A and K238R (obtained by complete removal of the cofactor followed by treatment with 10-fold molar excess of PLP and removal of unbound coenzyme (described under “Experimental Procedures”)) contained 1.0 and 1.1 mol of PLP per dimer, respectively, as judged by NaOH treatment and HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas the reconstituted K238A mutant exhibits an absorption band at 400 nm, the reconstituted K238R mutant shows two absorbance maxima at 390 and 320 nm. Absorption bands at 388 and 330 nm are present in the spectra of free PLP. However, in PLP free in solution, the 388-nm chromophore is the most abundant species, whereas it is the minor component of the spectrum of K238R mutant. The ratio of A 280/A 400 is 15 for the reconstituted K238A mutant compared with an A 280/A 418 value of 10 for wild-type cystalysin; for reconstituted mutant K238R, the A 280/A 390 and A 280/A 320 ratios are ∼40 and 15, respectively. After reduction of the reconstituted mutants with sodium borohydride followed by denaturation with trichloroacetic acid, HPLC analysis of the supernatant reveals that the original PLP content was completely converted into PNP. When the wild-type enzyme was treated with NaCNBH3, which does not readily reduce a free aldehyde group but does reduce a Schiff base (16Lane C.F. Synthesis. 1975; 3: 135-146Crossref Scopus (547) Google Scholar), the absorption at 418 nm was diminished in parallel with an increase in the absorption at 330 nm. This result is consistent with reduction of the internal Schiff base formed between the aldehyde group of PLP and the ϵ-amino group of Lys-238 in the wild type enzyme. In contrast, treatment of both reconstituted mutants with NaCNBH3 did not alter the spectra. Altogether, these data indicate that reconstitution of both mutants with PLP gives rise to proteins in which PLP binds as the free aldehyde. Thus, these reconstituted forms of K238A and K238R mutants were used for the following kinetic and spectral analysis. The absorption spectra of the internal aldimine of the wild-type depend on pH; titration of the enzyme-bound absorbance over the pH range 6–9.7 has shown that the 320-nm band increases at high pH values, whereas the 418-nm band decreases (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, no changes in absorption spectra of apomutants K238A and K238R reconstituted with PLP were observed between pH 6 and 9.7. Fig. 1B shows CD spectra of wild-type and reconstituted K238A and K238R enzymes in the visible and near-UV region. PLP bound to the wild-type exhibited a positive circular dichroism band at 412 nm, as reported previously (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas the K238A mutant shows a negative Cotton effect with λmax at 407 nm and a molar ellipticity lower than that of the positive Cotton effect of the wild-type enzyme, the K238R mutant displays two modest signals, a negative band in the 400-nm region and a positive dichroic signal at 320 nm. With respect to wild-type, both mutants also display a decrease of negative dichroic bands in the aromatic region of 288–296 nm and an increase of the positive band at 275 nm. Spectra in the near-UV region of both mutants are reminiscent of that of wild-type apocystalysin, as shown in Fig. 1B. The circular dichroism spectra in the range 190–240 nm of both mutants and the wild-type enzyme appeared almost indistinguishable; they display minima at 222 and 208 nm, which are characteristic of a protein with a high content of α-helical structure (data not shown). These data suggest that, although small conformational changes may occur in the region immediately surrounding the site of the mutation, no appreciable change in the secondary or tertiary structure occurs upon the substitution of alanine or arginine for Lys-238. When excited at 281 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum of wild-type cystalysin shows two maxima at 337 nm and ∼500 nm; the ratio of F 337/F 500 is ∼86 (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The band at the shorter wavelength is a result of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, whereas the band at the longer wavelength is due to the delayed Schiff base fluorescence. Excitation at 281 nm of both reconstituted K238A and K238R mutants shows an emission spectrum with a maximum at only 337 nm whose intensity is 1.5–1.6-fold higher than that of the wild-type. Excitation of the wild-type enzyme at 418 nm results in a faint emission band at 504 nm (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Upon excitation at 400 nm, whereas reconstituted K238A mutant emitted at 499 nm with an emission intensity 2-fold higher that that of the wild-type, reconstituted K238R shows no emission at ∼500 nm. Excitation at 320 nm of reconstituted K238R mutant shows an ∼3-fold increased emission fluorescence intensity when compared with that of the wild-type with a maximum at 371 nm (red-shifted 4 nm with respect to the maximum of the wild-type) (Fig. 1C). Binding Affinity of K238A and K238R Mutants for PLP Cofactor—The data for reconstitution to K238A or K238R holoenzymes versus PLP concentration have been collected by measuring the molar fraction of enzyme-bound PLP or the recovery of enzyme activity, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Titration analyses of both apomutants with PLP fitted to Equation 5 yielded Kd values for PLP-K238A and PLP-K238R complexes equal to 70 ± 16 nm and 0.9 ± 0.1 μm, respectively (data not shown). The apparent Kd for dissociation of PLP from wild-type has been found to be 6.6 ± 1nm (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution by alanine or arginine, in addition to resulting in a significant loss of the bound coenzyme, apparently causes a ∼ 10- and 150-fold decrease in PLP-binding affinity, respectively. Kinetic Properties of K238A and K238R Mutants—Apomutant K238A, reconstituted with PLP, was essentially inactive under the standard assay conditions in which the k cat values for the wild-type toward l-cysteine or β-chloro-l-alanine were ∼11 s–1 or 60 s–1 at 25 °C, respectively (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the reconstituted K238R mutant displays a detectable eliminase activity. Steady-state kinetics data for the reaction of this mutant were collected for a range of l-cysteine or β-chloro-l-alanine concentrations by measurement of pyruvate formation. Although the Km values (0.6 ± 0.1 mm for l-cysteine, 1.9 ± 0.2 mm for β-chloro-l-alanine) are not significantly altered by mutation, the k cat values for the reaction are 1.12 ± 0.05 min–1 for l-cysteine and 6.8 ± 0.3 min–1 for β-chloro-l-alanine, ∼ 500-fold lower than that for the wild-type (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, per mole of cofactor, the k cat of this mutant is 0.3% of that of the wild-type. Formation of External Aldimine—Glycine behaves as a non-productive analogue of wild-type cystalysin. The addition of glycine to cystalysin causes the immediate appearance of an absorption band at 429 nm attributable to the formation of the external aldimine (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between cystalysin and glycine represents a useful model for the analysis of formation and hydrolysis of the external Schiff base, and the comparison between the reactions of wild-type and Lys-238 mutants with this ligand could provide insight into the role of active site lysine in a step that is on the catalytic pathway of cystalysin. The kinetics of glycine binding to wild-type cystalysin is too rapid to be measured with a conventional spectrophotometer. Thus, the reaction of wild-type with glycine was followed by multiwavelength (300–550 nm) stopped-flow spectroscopy under pre-steady-state conditions. Upon mixing cystalysin with glycine, the spectrum of the initial species is similar to that of free enzyme, except that the absorption maximum at 418 nm is red-shifted 11 nm, indicating that a fast process is complete within the dead t"
https://openalex.org/W2064632690,"The interaction of the monovalent cation with wild type (WT) yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) and with the T298S, T298C, and T298A mutants was investigated by <sup>205</sup>Tl<sup>+</sup> NMR to monitor possible structural alterations at the active site by Thr-298 mutation. TlNO<sub>3</sub> activates WT YPK with a <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> value similar to that obtained with KCl and an apparent <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> of 0.96 ± 0.07 mm in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. With the three mutants, Tl<sup>+</sup> is a better activator than is K<sup>+</sup> based on <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> values. Tl<sup>+</sup> activation and inhibition of YPK is affected by mutation of the active site Thr-298. The effect of Mn<sup>2+</sup> on the 1/<i>T</i> value of <sup>205</sup>Tl<sup>+1</sup> in the presence of the WT and mutant YPK complexes was determined at 173 MHz (300 MHz, <sup>1</sup>H) and 346 MHz (600 MHz, <sup>1</sup>H). For each complex studied, 1/p<i>T</i> <sub>2</sub> <i><sub>p</sub></i> ≫ 1/p<i>T</i> <sub>1</sub> <i><sub>p</sub></i> and 1/p<i>T</i> <sub>1</sub> <i><sub>p</sub></i> is frequency-dependent suggesting fast exchange conditions. The values of 1/p<i>T</i> <sub>1</sub> <i><sub>p</sub></i> differ for each mutant. A correlation time of 0.65 ± 0.35 ns was estimated for the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-<sup>205</sup>Tl<sup>+</sup> interaction. The Tl<sup>+</sup>-Mn<sup>2+</sup> distances at the active site of YPK were calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to 1/<i>T</i> <sub>1M</sub> of YPK-bound <sup>205</sup>Tl<sup>+</sup>. The calculated Tl<sup>+</sup>-Mn<sup>2+</sup> distance for the Thr-298 mutants is decreased by about 1 Å from 6.0 ± 0.2 Å observed with WT. The results suggest conformational alterations at the active site of YPK where phosphoryl transfer occurs upon mutation of Thr-298. These conformational changes may, in part, explain the alteration in <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> and <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> <sub>,PEP</sub> observed with the Thr-298 mutants."
