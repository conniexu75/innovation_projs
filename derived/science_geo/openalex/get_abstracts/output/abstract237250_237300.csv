https://openalex.org/W2107611011,"Activity-induced modification of neuronal connections is essential for the development of the nervous system and may also underlie learning and memory functions of mature brain. Previous studies have shown an increase in dendritic spine density and/or enlargement of spines after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Using two-photon time-lapse imaging of dendritic spines in acute hippocampal slices from neonatal rats, we found that the induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency stimulation is accompanied by a marked shrinkage of spines, which can be reversed by subsequent high-frequency stimulation that induces LTP. The spine shrinkage requires activation of NMDA receptors and calcineurin, similar to that for LTD. However, spine shrinkage is mediated by cofilin, but not by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is essential for LTD, suggesting that different downstream pathways are involved in spine shrinkage and LTD. This activity-induced spine shrinkage may contribute to activity-dependent elimination of synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W1986246328,"Dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons receive the vast majority of excitatory input and are considered electrobiochemical processing units, integrating and compartmentalizing synaptic input. Following synaptic plasticity, spines can undergo morphological plasticity, which possibly forms the structural basis for long-term changes in neuronal circuitry. Here, we demonstrate that spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons from organotypic slice cultures show bidirectional activity-dependent morphological plasticity. Using two-photon time-lapse microscopy, we observed that low-frequency stimulation induced NMDA receptor-dependent spine retractions, whereas theta burst stimulation led to the formation of new spines. Moreover, without stimulation the number of spine retractions was on the same order of magnitude as the stimulus-induced spine gain or loss. Finally, we found that the ability of neurons to eliminate spines in an activity-dependent manner decreased with developmental age. Taken together, our data show that hippocampal neurons can undergo bidirectional morphological plasticity; spines are formed and eliminated in an activity-dependent way."

Although protein phosphorylation is known to be important for many synaptic processes and in disease, little is known about global phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. Heterogeneity and low abundance make protein phosphorylation analysis difficult, particularly for mammalian tissue samples. Using a new approach, combining both protein and peptide immobilized metal affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry data acquisition strategies, we have produced the first large scale map of the mouse synapse phosphoproteome. We report over 650 phosphorylation events corresponding to 331 sites (289 have been unambiguously assigned), 92% of which are novel. These represent 79 proteins, half of which are novel phosphoproteins, and include several highly phosphorylated proteins such as MAP1B (33 sites) and Bassoon (30 sites). An additional 149 candidate phosphoproteins were identified by profiling the composition of the protein immobilized metal affinity chromatography enrichment. All major synaptic protein classes were observed, including components of important pre- and postsynaptic complexes as well as low abundance signaling proteins. Bioinformatic and in vitro phosphorylation assays of peptide arrays suggest that a small number of kinases phosphorylate many proteins and that each substrate is phosphorylated by many kinases. These data substantially increase existing knowledge of synapse protein phosphorylation and support a model where the synapse phosphoproteome is functionally organized into a highly interconnected signaling network.

The molecular architecture of the synaptic junction has been studied intensely for many years, yielding information on its composition and function based on studies of individual receptors or small groups of proteins (1Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In recent years, with the advent of proteomic technologies, a coherent map of the mammalian synapse proteome has been emerging.

Systematic analysis of functional multiprotein complexes embedded in the PSD (5Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) has also added to our knowledge of the overall organization of the postsynaptic proteome. Central to the functioning of signaling complexes and indeed the most basic signaling pathways is the process of reversible phosphorylation. The propagation of an appropriate synaptic response to receptor stimulation is highly regulated by phosphorylation cascades. This is exemplified by the process of synaptic plasticity, a process whereby glutamate receptor activation results in diverse signaling cascades, which ultimately lead to activation of transcription factors and modulation of gene expression. Phosphorylation is also employed to modulate protein function and stability and to mediate phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions (e.g. Src homology 2 binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to NR2B) (6Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), conferring a higher order level of regulation in such protein complexes. Historically, synapse phosphorylation and its importance in regulating neuronal signal transduction and brain function has been studied at the level of single molecules (7Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 8Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R. Nature. 1989; 339: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but new proteomic strategies lend themselves to the global characterization of the signaling properties of the synapse proteome. Phosphopeptides can be purified from complex protein mixtures using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (9Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and identified using MS (10Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Recent phosphoproteomic studies have utilized various peptide IMAC approaches, sometimes with methyl esterification, to enrich and improve specificity for phosphopeptides prior to MS. This approach has been successfully used to study phosphorylation in yeast (10Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis (11Nuhse T.S. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Peck S.C. Mol.

Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the application of these approaches to complex mammalian subcellular organelles such as the synapse has yet to be established. MS, although a powerful tool for analysis of protein phosphorylation, has several on-going technical challenges. In particular, these result from heterogeneity arising from dynamic site occupancy, multiple phosphorylation sites in the same low abundance peptide, and inherently poor fragmentation of phosphopeptides. Continued improvements in three critical areas, unbiased sample enrichment methods, high sensitivity MS, and data analysis methods, are required to fully harness the potential of MS. The field is in a phase of rapid development, and various strategies for protein or modification centric analyzes are being explored (13Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E.

Here, we describe the use of a combination of cellular fractionation procedures with large scale IMAC phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide enrichment protocols and complementary MS analytical strategies to characterize mouse forebrain synaptosomes. This has resulted in the unambiguous identification of 289 sites of phosphorylation in 79 synaptic proteins involved in important pre- and postsynaptic multiprotein complexes and signaling pathways. Large scale in vitro phosphorylation screening on peptide arrays for 95 sites with seven kinases identified 28 phosphorylated sites and a total of 52 phosphorylation events. The simultaneous identification of large numbers of sites of phosphorylation and identification of responsible kinases, as exemplified by this study, is a powerful approach to expand the current knowledge of cell signaling in a particular system. Isolation of Synaptosomes—Synaptosomes were prepared as described by Carlin et al. (1980) (15Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, mouse forebrains were homogenized in a cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate pH 7.4, 10% (w/w) sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin. The sample was then centrifuged for 20 min at 800 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml/g of original weight in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin, quickly homogenized, and incubated for 45 min on ice. After a further homogenization step and the addition of sucrose to 34% (w/w), the sample was overlaid with solutions containing 28.5% (w/w) sucrose in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and 10% (w/w) sucrose in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein-containing band, which formed between the 34 and 28.5% sucrose gradients, was collected and diluted with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, to 10% sucrose and then centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and homogenized gently to form the synaptosomal preparation. Protein IMAC of Urea-soluble Synaptosomal Fraction—Fast-flow chelating Sepharose with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) (Amersham Biosciences) or nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) chelating groups were charged with GaCl3 or FeCl3. Synaptosomal proteins (12.5 mg) were solubilized in 6 m urea, and the supernatant was removed and incubated with 2 ml of the metal charged resin with mixing for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound protein was washed with buffer A (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris acetate) to base line, and the phosphoproteins were specifically eluted with buffer B (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm EGTA). The fractions were collected, concentrated, and washed with buffer B in a Vivaspin 6 PES membrane spin column (Vivascience). 13.4 μg of protein was diluted with buffer C (1 m urea, 0.125 m thiourea, 5% (v/v) CH3CN, and 0.1 m NH4HCO3) to a final volume of 400 μl. Trypsin (sequence grade; Roche Applied Science) was added to the sample in a ratio of 1:20, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Life Science). The sample was reconstituted in 50 mm NH4HCO3, and one-quarter was injected for each on-line LC-MS/MS analysis. Double IMAC of Urea-soluble Synaptosomal Fraction—3 mg of protein IMAC purified sample was digested with modified porcine or gold trypsin (Promega) in a ratio of 1:20 in buffer D (1 m urea and 25 mm NH4HCO3) at 37 °C for 4 h. The resultant digest was desalted and dried, and methyl esterification was performed with 2 m methanolic HCl (10Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar) when needed. Self Pack POROS® 20 MC media (Applied Biosystems) for phosphopeptide purification was charged with GaCl3 as described above for the IDA/nitrilotriacetic acid resins. Peptide digests (with and without methyl esterification) were reconstituted in buffer E (equal volumes of acetonitrile, methanol, and water, pH 2.5-3). 1 ml of this peptide mixture was incubated with 200 μl of POROS-Ga slurry for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was then loaded into a spin column and washed with 10 volumes of buffer E. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 2 × 100 μl of 200 mm Na2HPO4. Peptide IMAC of Whole and Urea-insoluble Synaptosomal Fractions—2.5 mg of the 6 m urea insoluble pellet left after removal of the supernatant was digested with trypsin in buffer F (2 m urea and 25 mm NH4HCO3). The resultant digest was desalted, methyl-esterified, and subjected to a peptide IMAC step as described previously. Similarly, 6 mg of whole synaptosomal proteins were digested in buffer F, desalted, methyl-esterified, and subjected to a peptide IMAC step. Phosphoprotein Staining and Image Analysis—IMAC-enriched phosphoprotein samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and sequentially stained with Pro-Q diamond (phosphoprotein) and SYPRO Ruby (total protein) stains (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Peppermint Stick phosphoprotein molecular weight standards (Molecular Probes) served as a molecular weight marker and internal control. Images were captured with a Typhoon scanner (Amersham Biosciences) and overlaid using TotaLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics). On-line Nano-LC-MS/MS—A nanoflow high pressure liquid chromatography system, Ultimate™ (LC Packings) or CapLC (Waters), was coupled to a Q-ToF 1, Q-ToF Ultima (Waters/Micromass), or 4000 QTRAP (Applied Biosystems). Tryptic peptides from the phosphoprotein digest were loaded in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and desalted on PepMap C18 trapping cartridge (LC Packings). BetaMax Neutral (Thermo Hypersil-Keystone) was used to trap the IMAC-enriched phosphopeptides in 0.5% aqueous formic acid. Peptides on the trap were back-flushed to and separated on the analytical column (PepMap C18, 75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm; LC Packings). The gradients are shown in Tables I and II.Table ILC gradient for separation of phosphoprotein digest Solvent A was 95% H2O, 5% ACN, 0.1% formic acid; solvent B was 95% ACN, 5% H2O, 0.1% formic acid.

Each cycle had a 1-s MS survey (m/z 400-1500), and up to three of the highest intensity multiply charged ions (+2 and +3) were selected for MS/MS (m/z 50-2000), each for 5 s. The collision energy in MS/MS was varied according to the m/z and the charge state of the precursor ion. Due to the high complexity of the sample, there were two LC-MS/MS runs with the same LC gradient. After the first standard run (Run 1), survey data were examined, and multiply charged ions above the intensity threshold that had not been subjected to MS/MS in Run 1 were incorporated into the inclusion list for the second run (Run 2). We term this latter LC-MS/MS approach, incorporating a primary analysis followed by a repeat experiment based on an inclusion list, targeted repeat analysis (TRA). Analysis of IMAC-enriched phosphopeptides was performed on the Q-ToF using similar acquisition parameters to those for the Q-ToF Ultima. Two different precursor-scanning approaches were adopted on the 4000 QTRAP to selectively analyze phosphopeptides. In the first approach, the instrument was used in negative ion mode (-ESI) to scan for the precursors of m/z 79 (PO3−) with automatic switching to positive mode (+ESI) for MS/MS for the detected precursors. In the second approach, we applied TRA strategy. First, one-third of the sample was analyzed in negative mode for detecting precursors of m/z 79. Data were examined to generate the inclusion list for the second run in positive ion mode (+ESI) using the remaining two-thirds of the sample in information-dependent acquisition mode. Raw data were processed to give a peak list file and submitted to a local Mascot version 2.0 (Matrix Science) server for iterative searching on a custom, nonidentical, combined human and mouse IPI data base (EBI). Assignment of phosphorylation sites was verified manually with the aid of PEAK Studio (Bioinformatics Solutions) software. Peptide Array Phosphorylation Assays—Jerini Phosphosite detector™ peptide arrays (Jerini Peptide Technologies, Gmbh) were used to determine which of the MS-identified phosphorylation sites (95 selected sites) could be phosphorylated by seven kinases in an in vitro assay. 15-amino acid-long peptides that encompassed the selected sites were synthesized on cellulose membranes in a parallel manner using SPOT technology (16Wenschuh H. Volkmer-Engert R. Schmidt M. Schulz M. Schneider-Mergener J. Reineke U. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 188-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) deposited to glass slides and were covalently immobilized to the glass slide surface. Each peptide was present in triplicate on the chip, and seven full-length proteins that are capable of being phosphorylated were also included. Negative control peptides for each phosphorylation site were included, replacing serine or threonine with alanine or valine, respectively, and positive control peptide sequences for each kinase were present. Peptide arrays were sealed with Gene-Frame™ incubation chambers (Abgene house, Surrey, UK), and the chambers were filled with 330 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm, EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP). Recombinant active kinases (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (3 μg of PKA catalytic subunit (with 2 μm cAMP), 2 μg of Akt1 (Δ PH, S473D), 2 μg of Erk1, 3 μg of p38α, 3 μg of CKII, 3 μg of Cdk5/p35, and 1.5 μg of PKC (α, β, γ)) were included in the appropriate kinase assays. In the case of PKC, a modified kinase buffer was used (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 25 μg/ml diacylglycerol). After a 45-min incubation at 32 °C, the peptide microarrays were washed six times, alternating between 0.1 m phosphoric acid and distilled water. γ-32P incorporation in the immobilized peptide spots was detected on a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (50-μm resolution; Amersham Biosciences). Image analysis and signal quantification was carried out using ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences), and positive signals were defined after background subtraction. Bioinformatic Analysis—All proteins detected in this study were classified according to Swiss-Prot keywords (available on the World Wide Web at ca.expasy.org/sprot/). Known phosphoproteins in Supplementary Table I were annotated by extensive literature mining of PubMed. Scansite (available on the World Wide Web at scansite.mit.edu/) was used in high stringency mode to predict if proteins in Supplementary Table I were likely to be phosphorylated, and responsible kinases are indicated. TMHMM Server version 2.0 (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) was used to predict the occurrence of transmembrane helices. Scansite and NetPhosK (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) were both used for predicting phosphorylation sites by cognate kinases and on those peptides where the phosphorylation sites could not be unambiguously assigned by MS data (Supplemental Table III). Scansite was also used to check the presence of phosphorylation sites in Pfam protein domains and to predict whether phosphorylation sites were localized in phosphodependent interaction domains (Supplemental Table III). Graphical illustrations of the location of identified sites in relation to protein domain structure, three-dimensional structure, and information on homologs and paralogs of identified phosphorylation sites can be found on the World Wide Web at www.ppo4.org/phospho/synaptosome.html. Network Construction—Protein-protein interactions for the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex proteins were obtained from PPID (available on the World Wide Web at www.PPID.org). Each protein (node) that had interaction (edge) information was used to plot a network graph using InterViewer, a network graphing program. Kinase-substrate edges were manually superimposed onto the protein-protein interaction network. Several approaches capable of identifying large numbers of in vivo phosphorylated proteins have been used to functionally annotate the mouse synaptic proteome. A summary of this is shown in Fig. 1A. In the first approach, a mouse synaptosomal preparation was digested with trypsin and phosphopeptides captured by peptide IMAC. The enriched sample was analyzed by nano-flow LC-MS/MS. Despite the enrichment, the majority of identifications corresponded to unphosphorylated peptides. In the second approach, the synaptosomes were first divided into urea soluble and insoluble fractions, the latter containing mostly membrane-bound components. Peptide IMAC and MS was performed on the insoluble fraction in a comparable manner to the first approach. For the urea-soluble fraction, a new strategy was adopted, entailing an additional stage of enrichment by capture of the phosphoproteins. A two-pronged route was taken for subsequent analysis of the trypsin digest of this enriched fraction. The first route is based on rigorous MS using (a) LC-MS/MS peptide identification based on a TRA approach described under “Experimental Procedures” and (b) precursor ion scanning to identify phosphopeptides prior to sequencing. The second route used a further peptide IMAC followed by LC-MS/MS. Using these combined approaches and implementing a previously unreported strategy of sequential protein and peptide IMAC, we have identified 228 potential synaptic phosphoproteins (Supplementary Table I) and characterized over 350 phosphopeptides containing 331 sites of phosphorylation (Supplemental Tables II and III). Protein IMAC Protocol—Unlike peptide IMAC that is widely used for phosphoproteomic analysis, to our knowledge protein IMAC approaches have not been reported. In order to develop a protein IMAC protocol, we tested two resins: Sepharose-IDA (a tridentate ligand) and agarose-nitrilotriacetic acid (a quadradentate ligand) and two metal ions, FeCl3 and GaCl3 (Fig. 1B), to isolate phosphoproteins from urea-soluble preparations. The IDA resin with both metal ions showed marked enrichment indicated by specific phosphoprotein staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The Ga3+ resin showed more effective depletion of phosphoprotein from the unbound fraction together with stronger phosphostaining of the purified sample (Fig. 1C) and therefore was used in all subsequent protein IMAC experiments. Analysis of tryptic peptides from the protein IMAC enrichment by LC-MS/MS identified 152 proteins and 19 phosphopeptides (Supplementary Tables I and II). TRA extended this by an additional 30 protein identifications and 21 phosphopeptides. A further 28 different phosphopeptides from these samples were identified using the precursor-scanning approach, applied in the routine as well as the targeted manner as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Clearly, the TRA strategy is effective in both standard LC-MS/MS and precursor scanning modes for extending both protein and phosphorylation mapping from complex peptide mixtures. 186 proteins have been identified in the protein IMAC sample. 105 of these have been confirmed as phosphoproteins in the literature and by phosphorylation sites identified in this study (Fig. 2). This suggests that whereas a small proportion may represent contaminating proteins, the majority are probably phosphoproteins. The identified components represent a diverse range of protein classes (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Table I), and low abundance protein classes, such as kinases, phosphatases, and small G-proteins and modulators, are well represented even in the presence of very abundant cytoskeletal proteins. The protein IMAC approach presents important benefits for phosphorylation analysis. It offers the opportunity to use basic protein identification to identify many candidate phosphoproteins, which are of low abundance and would not have been in the dynamic range required for direct phosphorylation analysis. The majority of phosphopeptides characterized in MS analyses of the phosphoprotein mixture cover single phosphorylation events (Fig. 3) and thus are complementary to measurements made from the peptide IMAC approach that better represents highly phosphorylated peptides. A further important benefit is that it provides scope for two stages of sample enrichment, at the protein level and subsequently at the peptide level. Double IMAC Protocol—LC-MS/MS analysis of phosphopeptide from double IMAC yielded identification and characterization of 176 phosphopeptides (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Table II) derived from 41 phosphoproteins. The results from the double IMAC protocol significantly extended those from the protein IMAC protocol on several levels. First, of the 25 validated phosphoproteins found in the protein IMAC experiments, we found an additional 115 phosphopeptides on 16 proteins, indicating greater depth of analysis. We also identified a further 14 phosphopeptides corresponding to seven proteins detected in the protein IMAC sample. Second, 19 phosphoproteins containing 37 phosphopeptides that were not characterized in the protein IMAC were observed in the double IMAC protocol. Third, the increased depth of phosphorylation coverage through overlapping peptides reflects variability in site occupation that can occur on a protein and a level of heterogeneity associated with this type of modification. This is well illustrated in Bassoon, for which we found 15 phosphorylation sites (10 peptides) in the protein IMAC protocol and 16 new sites (16 peptides) in the double IMAC protocol (Supplemental Table III). It is evident that combination of protein and double IMAC strategies enables identification and characterization of phosphoproteins across a wider range of protein abundance and phosphorylation states. Synaptic Membrane Phosphoproteomic Analysis—Integral membrane proteins are usually difficult to analyze, since detergent-based extraction methods are not readily compatible with subsequent purification strategies and LC-MS/MS analysis. However, for a phosphoproteomic analysis, cytoplasmic domains of integral membrane proteins are sufficient, since they contain the phosphorylation sites involved in intracellular signaling. Therefore, we digested 6 m urea-insoluble fractions of synaptosomes; the supernatant was desalted and esterified as described above and was subjected to a single peptide IMAC and LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1A). This approach allowed identification and characterization of 60 phosphopeptides from 31 proteins (Supplemental Table II), of which 12 are predicted to be integral membrane proteins and many others, such as PSD-95 and Adapter-related protein complex-2 α-1, are known to be membrane-associated. 10 of the identified membrane proteins were not previously known to be phosphoproteins. Of these 31 phosphoproteins, 18 were not detected in either protein or double IMAC protocols (Fig. 3A). Complementarity of Analytical Approaches—Inspection of the summarized data (Figs. 2A and 3) shows that the combination of subcellular fractionation and IMAC protocols with MS analyses are complementary, both in terms of the protein identification and phosphorylation site characterization. Overall, we sequenced 350 phosphopeptides covering 653 phosphorylation events. These correspond to a total of 331 phosphorylation sites, of which 289 were localized unambiguously (Fig. 1A).

In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding a CaM binding transcription factor, MYB2, that regulates the expression of salt- and dehydration-responsive genes in Arabidopsis. This was achieved using a salt-inducible CaM isoform (GmCaM4) as a probe from a salt-treated Arabidopsis expression library. Using domain mapping, we identified a Ca2+-dependent CaM binding domain in MYB2. The specific binding of CaM to CaM binding domain was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, a gel mobility shift assay, split ubiquitin assay, and a competition assay using a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. Interestingly, the specific CaM isoform GmCaM4 enhances the DNA binding activity of AtMYB2, whereas this was inhibited by a closely related CaM isoform (GmCaM1). Overexpression of Gm-CaM4 in Arabidopsis up-regulates the transcription rate of AtMYB2-regulated genes, including the proline-synthesizing enzyme P5CS1 (Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase-1), which confers salt tolerance by facilitating proline accumulation. Therefore, we suggest that a specific CaM isoform mediates salt-induced Ca2+ signaling through the activation of an MYB transcriptional activator, thereby resulting in salt tolerance in plants. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein, regulates diverse cellular functions by modulating the activity of a variety of enzymes and proteins.

Therefore, we suggest that a specific CaM isoform mediates salt-induced Ca2+ signaling through the activation of an MYB transcriptional activator, thereby resulting in salt tolerance in plants. In both plants and animals, Ca2+ mediates stimulus-response coupling in the regulation of diverse cellular functions that are triggered by a variety of biotic and abiotic external stimuli (1Knight M.R.

The transient elevation of cytosolic free-calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) that occurs in response to specific stimuli differs in amplitude, frequency, and duration depending on the exact nature of the stimulus (6Dolmetsch R.E.

Complex Ca2+ signals are decoded by Ca2+ sensor(s) and are transduced downstream to regulate various cellular processes.

The molecular targets of plant CaM are under active investigation (7Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Various plant species have been shown to possess multiple CaM genes with as many as 20 CaM isoforms present in Arabidopsis (9Initiative The Arabidopsis Genome Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7211) Google Scholar). The induction of individual CaM genes is differentially regulated in response to physical (e.g. touch, heat, and light) and chemical (e.g. auxin and fungal elicitor) stimuli (10Botella J.R. Arteca R.N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Heo W.D. Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Chun H.J. Lee K.J. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Choi J.Y. Cho M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In turn, these CaM isoforms differentially regulate 20 Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes, suggesting that CaM isoforms sense different Ca2+ signals and transduce the signals to diverse sets of CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs), thereby generating physiological responses to stimuli (12Lee S.H.

In addition to regulating enzyme activity, Ca2+-loaded CaM modulates transcriptional activators. Some transcription factors are modulated indirectly through phosphorylation by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases (15Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas basic helix-loop-helix groups interact directly with Ca2+/CaM, resulting in the DNA binding activity of basic helix-loop-helix being inhibited (16Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundstrom T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). MYB proteins constitute a diverse class of DNA-binding proteins and are particularly important for transcriptional regulation in plants. This protein family is characterized by having a structurally conserved DNA binding domain, the MYB domain, and is classified into three subfamilies on the basis of the number of imperfect adjacent repeats of the MYB DNA binding domain. The two-repeat (R2R3) MYB family is the most commonly of those identified in plants and is estimated to consist of 125 members in Arabidopsis (17Stracke R. Werber M. Weisshaar B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The known functions of plant MYB proteins include the regulation of secondary metabolism, control of cellular morphogenesis, and regulation of the meristem and the cell cycle (18Kranz H.D. Denekamp M. Greco R. Jin H. Leyva A. Meissner R.C. Petroni K. Urzainqui A. Bevan M. Martin C. Smeekens S. Tonelli C. Paz-Ares J. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 1998; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although some functional similarities exist among R2R3 MYB proteins that are closely related structurally, significant functional differences also exist between very similar proteins, both in the same organism and in different species (18Kranz H.D. Denekamp M. Greco R. Jin H. Leyva A. Meissner R.C. Petroni K. Urzainqui A. Bevan M. Martin C. Smeekens S. Tonelli C. Paz-Ares J. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 1998; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we screened CaMBPs from an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated CaM as a probe and found that CaM physically interacts with AtMYB2, a transcription factor that regulates salt- and dehydration-responsive gene expression. Evidence obtained in in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that CaM isoforms differentially regulate the DNA binding activity of AtMYB2. Furthermore, GmCaM4 overexpression in Arabidopsis elevates the transcription of AtMYB2-regulated genes including that of the proline-synthesizing enzyme, which confers salt tolerance to these transgenic plants by allowing them to accumulate higher proline concentrations. These results demonstrate that Ca2+ signaling mediated by a specific CaM isoform contributes to salt stress tolerance in plants. Screening of the Arabidopsis cDNA Expression Library—An Arabidopsis cDNA expression library was constructed in a λZAPII vector (Stratagene) from Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) treated with 100 mm NaCl for 6 h. Soybean CaM (GmCaM) isoforms were conjugated to a maleimide-activated HRP using the EZ-Link maleimide-activated HRP conjugation kit (Pierce) as described in a previous report (12Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H. Kim C.Y. Lee K.J. Bahk J.D. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We screened the Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using HRP-conjugated GmCaM4 (GmCaM4::HRP) as a probe. Approximately 5 × 105 plaque-forming units were plated/15-cm LB plate using Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF (Stratagene) as the host strain. The plates were incubated at 42 °C until plaques appeared and were then overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that had previously been soaked in 10 mm IPTG. The incubation was continued at 37 °C for 6–8 h after which plates were cooled to 4 °C. The filters were removed and rinsed twice in a large volume of TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). The filters were blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) nonfat dry milk/TBS-T overnight, and the blocked filters were washed three times with TBS-T for 5 min and equilibrated in overlay buffer (50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. The membranes were blocked a second time by incubation in overlay buffer containing 9% (v/v) gelatin (Sigma), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 3.5 h. GmCaM4::HRP was added to the gelatin-containing buffer at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, and the filters were incubated for 1 h. Final washing was done in three steps with each step consisting of five repeats of a 5-min wash: first in TBS-T/50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2; second in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Tween 20, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.5 m KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2; and third in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm MgCl2. Bound CaM::HRP was visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). A total of 5 × 105 recombinants were screened, and ∼50 positive clones were isolated after three rounds of screening. cDNA inserts were recovered by in vivo excision with helper phage (ExAssist, Stratagene). To confirm the binding of positive clones to CaM, we expressed positive clones as β-galactosidase fusion proteins in E. coli and examined the clones for CaM binding using a CaM::HRP overlay assay as described above. We transformed positive clones into XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and induced the expression of β-galactosidase fusion proteins with IPTG treatment. 20 μg of IPTG-induced E. coli crude protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-MP membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore). The membrane was rinsed in TBS-T, blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) nonfat dry milk/TBS-T overnight, and processed as described above. For determination of Ca2+-independent binding of CaM, 5 mm EGTA was substituted for 1 mm CaCl2 in all of the overlay buffers. The cDNA sequences of the resulting positive clones were determined from both strands of cDNA by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI 373A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Construction of AtMYB2 cDNA Deletion Mutants and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletion constructs of AtMYB2 were generated with the following restriction endonucleases: D0, amino acids Met1-Asn273 (full length: BamHI and SmaI); D1, Met1-Val34 (BamHI and HincII); D2, Asn35-Thr118 (HincII and XhoI); D3, Arg119-Ser207 (XhoI and EcoRI); and D4, Asn208-Asn273 (EcoRI and SmaI). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to the N terminus of each deletion fragment. Fragments were subcloned into a pGEX-5X vector (Amersham Biosciences). To identify the critical residue(s) in the interaction between CaM and AtMYB2, we introduced several point mutations into the GST::AtMYB2 (D0) clone. Substitutions of single amino acids were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences used are as follows: for L69R (F, 5′-TTAAGATGGCTTAATTACCGACGTCCAGATGTTAGA-3′, and R, 5′-GTTGCCTCTTCTAACATCTGGACGTCGGTAATTAAG-3′) and for I78R (F, 5′-CCAGATGTTAGAAGAGGCAACAGGACTCTCGAAGAA-3′, and R, 5′-CATAAATTGTTCTTCGAGAGTCCTGTTGCCTCTTCT-3′). Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli and CaM Binding Assay—All of the clones were individually introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and expressed. The expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by application of 1 mm IPTG for5hat25 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixture was sonicated for 1 min using a 50% pulse and then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Recombinant proteins were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). 1 μg of purified protein was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride) after which expressed GST fusion proteins were detected using a polyclonal GST-specific antiserum. To examine the CaM binding ability of recombinant proteins, a duplicate blot was probed with a GmCaM1::HRP or GmCaM4::HRP conjugate in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or5mm EGTA. The CaM::HRP overlay assay was carried out as described above. The bound CaM was visualized using an ECL detection system. CaM Mobility Shift Assay with a Synthetic Peptide—A peptide (63RWLNYLRPDVRRGNITLE82) corresponding to a stretch of 18 amino acids in the CaMBD of AtMYB2 was synthesized commercially (EURO-GENETEC S. A.). The CaM binding ability of the synthetic peptide was measured by determining the relative mobility shift of CaM in the presence of this peptide (19Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CaM (303 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the peptide (molar ratio: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0) in a binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) plus 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) at room temperature for 1 h. One-half volume of 50% glycerol plus the tracer bromphenol blue was added, and the mixtures were electrophoresed in 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or2mm EGTA. The gels were run at a constant voltage of 100 V in an electrode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Phosphodiesterase Competition Assay—Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) assays were performed using commercially available bovine heart CaM-deficient PDE (Sigma). The initial 100-μl reaction volume contained buffer (100 mm imidazole-HCl, 2.56 mm cAMP, 5.13 mm MgSO4, 1.28 mm CaCl2) with either varying concentrations of GmCaM1 or GmCaM4 (1–200 nm) and a fixed concentration of synthetic peptide (100 nm) or varying concentrations of the synthetic peptide (0–1000 nm) and a fixed concentration of GmCaM1 or GmCaM4 (120 nm). The reaction was started with the addition of PDE (0.5 milliunits/μl). Basal enzyme activity was determined in the absence of GmCaMs, and stimulated activity was determined in the presence of GmCaM1 or GmCaM4 and CaCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by placing the reaction tubes into a boiling water bath for 5 min and then on ice for 2 min. Following a brief centrifugation, 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase (10 units) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% trichloro-acetic acid. After vortexing, the precipitates were spun down and the supernatant (400 μl) was transferred to a new tube. After adding 1 ml of phosphate reagent (20Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and assayed for Pi at OD660. The Kd of GmCaMs for the peptide was calculated from the concentration of GmCaMs (in nm) required to obtain half-maximal (50%) PDE activity either in the presence (100 nm) or absence of peptide. The following equation was used to calculate dissociation constants (19Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar): Kd = ([Pt] + K - [CaM])K/([CaM] - K), where [Pt] is the total concentration of peptide added, and [CaM] and K are the concentrations of CaM required to obtain half-maximal activation of PDE in the presence or absence of peptides, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA gel blot hybridization was performed as described by Lee et al. (20Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Yeast Split Ubiquitin Assay—The yeast split ubiquitin assay was carried out as described previously (21Laser H. Bongards C. Schuller J. Heck S. Johnsson N. Lehming N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JD53 was used for all of the experiments. GmCaM1 and Gm-CaM4 cDNAs were cloned into the vector pMet-Ste14-Cub-RUra3, replacing yeast Ste14. AtMYB2 cDNA was cloned into modified versions of the pCup-Nub-Sec62 vector, replacing yeast Sec62 (22Stagljar I. Korostensky C. te Johnsson N. Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The interaction of each pair of proteins was tested on a selective medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-FOA and on a selective medium lacking uracil. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days unless otherwise indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The core cis-acting element for AtMYB2 was synthesized as a tandem repeated hexamer (AtMBE:PyAACPyPu × 6), and a DNA probe was labeled by filling in the 5′ overhangs with [32P]dATP and a Klenow fragment. The DNA binding reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 20 min in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 15% glycerol) that contained 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of bacterially produced fusion protein that had been purified with glutathione-Sepharose or 10 μg of nuclear extracts from whole plants in the presence (0.5 mm CaCl2) or absence (1 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 80 V for 3 h. The gel was dried and mounted for autoradiography at -70 °C with intensifying screens. Transient Expression Assay—The reporter plasmid was a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of a 35S minimal promoter (23Sundaresan V. Springer P. Volpe T. Haward S. Jones J.D. Dean C. Ma H. Martienssen R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A synthetic AtMBE (PyAACPyPu × 6) was inserted in front of the CaMV 35S minimal promoter. The synthetic promoter was fused to a GUS gene to create the AtMBE-m35S-GUS reporter construct. The 1064 bp of the Arabidopsis P5CS1 promoter was cloned by PCR (24Yoshiba Y. Nanjo T. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and fused to a GUS gene to create the P5CS1-GUS reporter construct. For effector plasmids, full-length fragments of AtMYB2, GmCaM1, or GmCaM4 cDNA were inserted into a plant expression vector (pHBT95) containing the 35S C4PPDK promoter and nos terminator (25Sheen J. Science. 1996; 274: 1900-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Transient expression of these constructs was performed as described (26Raghothama K.G. Maggio A. Narasimhan M.L. Kononowicz A.K. Wang G. D'Urzo M.P. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In each transfection, 2 × 106 protoplasts were transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA carrying a reporter construct alone or with plasmid DNA carrying an effector construct or a vector DNA control. The transfected protoplasts were incubated for 16 h in the dark. A construct carrying the 35S promoter fused to the luciferase gene was used as an internal control in each transfection in which the AtMBE-m35S-GUS reporter construct was tested. In each sample, the GUS activity of the cell lysate was divided by the luciferase activity, thereby normalizing the data to control for variations in the experimental conditions. Plant Materials—Soybean suspension cell culture (SB-P) was maintained in KN-1 medium as described previously (27Horn M.E. Widholm J.M. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 72: 426-429Crossref Google Scholar). A 10-day-old subculture that had been dark-adapted for 3 days was used for stress treatments. For salt-related stress treatment, the KN-1 liquid medium was supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm abscisic acid, 100 mm KCl, or 200 mm mannitol for the indicated periods of time. For experiments with Arabidopsis, A. thaliana ecotype Columbia was used. The plants were grown on a solid medium containing basic MS salts, 3% sucrose, and 0.8% agar. Transgenic Plant Construction and Salt Tolerance Test—cDNAs of GmCaM1 or GmCaM4 were cloned into a plant binary vector, pCAM-BIA 1300, in which the GmCaM isoform cDNAs were placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter in the sense orientation. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumerfaciens GV3101, and transformed Arabidopsis plants were obtained by a vacuum-infiltrated transformation method. R2 progeny of transgenic plants expressing high levels of GmCaM1 or GmCaM4 were used for all of the experiments. For the salt tolerance test, 4-day-old seedlings on vertical agar plates were transferred to MS agar plates supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. Treatment plates were placed vertically with the seedlings in the upright position. Alternatively, the concentration of NaCl was increased stepwise by 50 mm (0, 50, and 100 mm) every 2 days for each group. Proline Measurement—Seven-day-old seedling plants were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then homogenized in 75% EtOH. Approximately2gof plant material was ground in 3% sulfosalicylic acid to extract free amino acids. Free amino acids were analyzed with an amino acid analyzer (Bichrome20, Pharmacia). Isolation of a cDNA Encoding a CaM-binding Protein Associated with Plant Salt Stress Signaling—Plants use calcium to resolve salt stress (28Kiegle E. Moore C.A. Haseloff J. Tester M.A. Knight M.R. Plant J. 2000; 23: 267-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A specific Ca2+-binding protein with a three-EF hand Ca2+ binding domain has been shown to be a key component of salt stress signal transduction for salt adaptation in plant (29Liu J. Zhu J.K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the transcription levels of specific CaM isoforms are rapidly induced by a pathogen (11Heo W.D. Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Chun H.J. Lee K.J. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Choi J.Y. Cho M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To examine whether the expression of CaM genes is altered in response to abiotic stressors that induce calcium signaling, we treated soybean cell suspensions with salt stress-related chemicals (NaCl, mannitol, and KCl), a hormone (abscisic acid), cold, or drought. Total RNA isolated from stressed cell suspensions was electrophoresed and blotted, and membranes were probed for GmCaM gene expression. The level of GmCaM4 mRNA was increased ∼10-fold within 30 min by 100 mm NaCl treatment but not by the other stressors examined (Fig. 1). In a control, GmCaM1 gene expression was not changed by any stressed examined. These results indicated that a specific CaM isoform could be involved in salt stress signaling in plants. To isolate CaMBPs associated with salt stress signaling, a cDNA library from NaCl-treated Arabidopsis was screened using HRP-conjugated GmCaM4 because this exhibited higher sensitivity than 32P-labeled CaM (12Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H. Kim C.Y. Lee K.J. Bahk J.D. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 50 positive clones were obtained from ∼5 × 105 recombinant phages. DNA sequencing of the clones and comparisons with known sequences in the GenBank™ data base revealed several known plant CaMBPs including kinesin-like proteins (30Kao Y.L. Deavours B.E. Phelps K.K.

In addition, several novel CaMBPs with high homology to known proteins and others with no significant homology to any reported proteins were identified. One of the isolated clones that bound CaM was a MYB transcription factor (AtMYB2) that has already been reported in the literature (32Urao T. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Urao S. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). AtMYB2 possesses an R2R3 MYB DNA binding domain and is known to regulate the expression of salt- and dehydration-responsive genes including P5CS1 (24Yoshiba Y. Nanjo T. Miura S.

Therefore, we examined whether interactions between specific CaM isoforms and AtMYB2 might be involved in salt stress signaling.Fig. 1Effects of salt stress on the expression of GmCaM genes. A soybean cell suspension culture (SB-P) was treated with 100 mm NaCl. Total RNA was isolated at the indicated times and analyzed for GmCaM1, GmCaM4, and GmACA1 mRNA. The level of GmACA1 (a soybean Ca2+-ATPase) mRNA was used as a positive control for induction by NaCl stress (47Chung W.S. Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Heo W.D. Kim M.C. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Lim C.O. Kim W.B.

Based on the structural characteristics of known CaMBDs, a putative CaM binding motif was predicted in the R2R3 DNA binding region of AtMYB2 between Arg64 and Glu81 (Fig. 2, A and C). Within this 18-amino acid stretch, hydrophobic amino acids were present at positions 1 (Leu69), 5 (Val73), and 10 (Ile78) and several basic residues (4 Args) were interspersed among these hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A). A helical wheel projection of the CaMBD revealed a characteristic segregation of basic and polar residues on one side with hydrophobic amino acids on the other side (Fig. 2B). To map the CaMBD of AtMYB2, we made a series of GST fusion constructs containing the full-length cDNA and four serial deletion mutants. The recombinant proteins were prod"

Therefore, whether activated caspase-3 is localized in the nuclei and how active caspase-3 has access to its nuclear targets are important and unresolved questions. Here we confirmed nuclear localizations for both caspase-3-p17 and caspase-3-p12 subunits of active caspase in apoptotic cells using subcellular fractionation analysis. We also prepared polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for active caspase-3 to define the subcellular localization of active caspase-3. Immunocytochemical observations using anti-active caspase-3 antibodies showed nuclear accumulation of active caspase-3 during apoptosis. In addition, caspase-3, but not caspase-7, translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after induction of apoptosis. Mutations at the cleavage site between the p17 and p12 subunits and the substrate recognition site for the P3 amino acid of the D<i>XX</i>D substrate cleavage motif inhibited nuclear translocation of caspase-3, indicating that nuclear transport of active caspase-3 required proteolytic activation and substrate recognition. These results suggest that active caspase-3 is translocated in association with a substrate-like protein(s) from the cytoplasm into the nucleus during progression through apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026637376,"Intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurs in many pathological conditions. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms associated with IH. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) mediates transcriptional responses to continuous hypoxia. In the present study, we investigated whether IH activates HIF-1 and, if so, which signaling pathways are involved. PC12 cells were exposed to either to 20% O2 (non-hypoxic control) or to 60 cycles consisting of 30 s at 1.5% O2, followed by 4 min at 20% O2 (IH). Western blot analysis revealed significant increases in HIF-1α protein in nuclear extracts of cells subjected to IH. Expression of a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene was increased 3-fold in cells subjected to IH. Although IH induced the activation of ERK1, ERK2, JNK, PKC-α, and PKC-γ, inhibitors of these kinases and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not block HIF-1-mediated reporter gene expression induced by IH, indicating that signaling via these kinases was not required. In contrast, addition of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitor KN93 blocked reporter gene activation in response to IH. CaM kinase activity was increased 5-fold in cells subjected to IH. KN 93 prevented IH-induced transactivation mediated by HIF-1α, and its coactivator p300, which was phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vitro. Expression of the HIF-1-regulated gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase was induced by IH and this effect was blocked by KN93. These observations suggest that IH induces HIF-1 transcriptional activity via a novel signaling pathway involving CaM kinase. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurs in many pathological conditions.

Sleep-disordered breathing with recurrent apnea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States population, affecting an estimated 18 million people (1Kiley J.P. Edelman N. Derderian S. Horan M. Littner M. National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research, Working group reports, Volume Two. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1995: 10-75Google Scholar). In this condition, transient repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) results in periodic hypoxemia (decreased arterial PO2). In severely affected patients, the frequency of apneas may exceed 60 episodes per hour and blood hemoglobin saturation of O2 can be reduced to as low as 50%. Patients with chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) 1The abbreviations used are: IH, intermittent hypoxia; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; CaM, calmodulin; CaMK, CaM kinase; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol kinase; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; EPO, erythropoietin; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; HRE, hypoxia response element; β-gal, β-galactosidase. caused by sleep apnea have a greatly increased risk for the development of systemic hypertension (2Nieto F.J.

Hypertension. 1992; 19: 555-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, rats in which the carotid bodies have been denervated show no increase in blood pressure in response to IH (5Fletcher E.C. Lesske J. Culman J. Miller C.C. Unger T. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Studies in humans and rodents suggest that the carotid body, which is the primary chemoreceptor for detecting changes in arterial PO2, mediates reflex increases in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system that result in elevated blood pressure (6Prabhakar N.R. Peng Y.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 96: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chronic IH induces long lasting sensory excitation of the carotid body (7Peng Y.J. Overhort J.L. Kline D. Kumar G.K. Prabhakar N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10073-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), which in turn may contribute to increased sympathetic tone and systemic hypertension. The transcriptional activator hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays an essential role in O2 sensing by the carotid body (8Kline D.D. Peng Y.J. Manalo D.J. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a global regulator of oxygen homeostasis that controls multiple key developmental and physiological processes (9Semenza G.L. Trends. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 10Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Over 60 HIF-1 target genes have been identified, including those encoding erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein that is composed of a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and an O2-regulated HIF-1α subunit. Analysis of Hif1a+/– mice that were heterozygous for a knock-out allele at the locus encoding HIF-1α revealed that their carotid bodies were markedly impaired in the ability to sense and/or respond to hypoxia (8Kline D.D. Peng Y.J. Manalo D.J. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Carotid body histology was normal, including the presence of glomus cells, which perform the O2-sensing function of the carotid body, and Hif1a+/– carotid bodies responded normally to cyanide, indicating a specific defect in O2 sensing (8Kline D.D. Peng Y.J. Manalo D.J. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). HIF-1 activity is induced under conditions of continuous hypoxia as a result of a decreased rate of O2-dependent proline hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of the HIF-1α subunit (11Bruick R.K.

HIF-1α transcriptional activity is also regulated via O2-dependent arginine hydroxylation that blocks coactivator recruitment (15Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the effect of IH on HIF-1 activity. Recent studies suggest that HIF-1-regulated gene expression is activated by repeated cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation. Thus, exposure of mice to an IH protocol (6% O2 for 6 min, followed by 21% O2 for 6 min, repeated for a total of 5 cycles) was shown to induce expression of erythropoietin (EPO), which mediated cardiac protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury (16Cai Z.

EPO expression immediately following IH and cardiac protection 24 h later were not induced in Hif1a+/– mice, demonstrating critical involvement of HIF-1 in these responses. Clinical studies indicate that recurrent sleep apnea is associated with increased serum levels of EPO and VEGF (17Cahan C. Decker M.J. Arnold J.L. Washington L.H. Veldhuis J.D. Goldwasser E.

PC12 cells share many properties with glomus cells of the carotid body including O2-regulated neurotransmitter release (21Kumar G.K. Overholt J.L. Bright G.R. Hui K.Y. Lu H. Gratzl M. Prabhakar N.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1592-CC600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine production (22Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Schnell P.O.

Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2003: 153-174Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that HIF-1α protein expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are induced in PC12 cells subjected to IH via signal transduction pathways that are distinct from those involved in the response to continuous hypoxia. Cell Culture—PC12 cells (original clone from Dr. L. Green) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) under 90% air and 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Prior to all experiments, the cells were placed in antibiotic-free medium and serum-starved for 16 h to avoid any confounding effects of serum on HIF-1 activity. In the experiments involving treatment with drugs, cells were preincubated for 30 min with either drug or vehicle. Exposure to Intermittent Hypoxia—Cell cultures were exposed to alternating cycles consisting of 1.5% O2 for 30 s followed by 20% O2 for 4 min at 37 °C in a 12 × 12 × 7 inch Lucite chamber. The chamber was equilibrated with gases at a flow rate of 2.4 liter/min by timer-controlled solenoid valves. O2 levels were monitored by an electrode (Lazar) placed in the tissue culture medium and by an O2 analyzer (Beckman LB2) placed in the chamber. 45 s was required for ambient O2 to reach 1.5% O2 during de-oxygenation and 50 s for return to 20% O2 during re-oxygenation. Chemicals—All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was a gift from Dr. P. Ratcliffe (University of Oxford).

Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pRSV-LacZ was from the American Type Culture Collection. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were lysed in hypotonic solution (10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.8) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (26Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 400 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.8 to lyse the nuclear membrane. The suspension was centrifuged and proteins in the supernatant were quantified by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Membrane Fractions—Membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (27Huang H.M. Weng C.H. Ou S.C. Hwang T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 668-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and incubated on ice with extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min. Cell lysates were homogenized and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to separate the plasma membrane from the cytosolic fraction. The plasma membrane fractions were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoblot Assays—Nuclear protein extracts (25 μg) were fractionated by 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylpyrrolidone difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were incubated with anti-HIF-1α mouse monoclonal antibody H1α67 (28Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:500 dilution of stock (Novus Biologicals) in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat milk. Membranes were treated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz; dilution 1:2000) in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat milk. Immune complexes on the membrane were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR films. Similar procedures were employed for immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II with appropriate antibodies (Chemicon; dilution 1:1000); phosphorylated forms of the MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000 dilution); and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (Transduction Laboratories; 1:1000 dilution). Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent as described previously (29Mishra R.R. Adhikary G. Simonson M.S. Cherniack N.S. Prabhakar N.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 59: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/plate in growth medium containing serum. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of serum-free medium. The DNA-liposome mixture was prepared using Lipofectamine (10 μg), 1 μg of the desired plasmid (unless otherwise specified) and 0.25 μg of pRSV-LacZ (internal control for determining the transfection efficiency) in 2 ml of serum-free medium. The total amount of DNA transfected per plate was held constant by addition of pUC19 carrier DNA. Cells were incubated in the DNA-liposome mixture for 4 h followed by addition of 2 ml of serum-containing medium. After 24 h, cells were washed with serum-free medium and 4 ml of serum-free growth medium was added. After 18 h, cells were exposed either to 20% O2 or IH and then harvested in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Tropix). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris. 20 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of buffer containing luciferin. Relative luminescent light units were recorded in a Berthold luminometer. For measurement of β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity, 10 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 100 μl of the reaction mixture containing β-galactam™ (Tropix) as substrate for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, 150 μl of luminescence enhancer (Tropix) was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting luminescence was measured. Protein analysis was performed using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). We verified that all reporter gene assays were in the linear range. Probe Preparation—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized complementary to nucleotides 902–959 and 1435–1489 of rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA (30Grima B. Lamaouroux A. Blanot F. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, purified using QuickSpin Sephadex G25 columns (Roche Applied Science), and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Northern Blot Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from PC-12 cells using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), and aliquots (10 μg) were fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose-ethidium gel electrophoresis. RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Gene Screen Plus, Schleicher & Schuell) and UV-cross-linked (model FB UVXL-1000, Fisher Scientific). Following prehybridization at 42 °C for 4 h, 5 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added with fresh hybridization buffer (containing a final concentration of 5 SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 25% deionized formamide, 1% SDS, and 5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and incubated with rotation at 42 °C for 16 h. The membrane was washed at room temperature twice for 15 min in 2× SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS and then washed twice in 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min. The membrane was then exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. The probe was stripped off the membrane by boiling in 0.1× SSC containing 1% SDS for 30 min with shaking. The stripped membrane was re-probed with 32P-labeled rat β-actin cDNA. The relative amounts of β-actin mRNA were determined by optical density measurements and were used to normalize the expression levels of TH mRNA. GST Fusion Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmid pGEXP300TD (generously provided by J. Caro, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia) was transformed into BL21-competent cells (Invitrogen), which were cultured in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-thiopyranoside (Promega), and purification was essentially the same as described previously (31Sang N. Stiehl D.P. Bohensky J. Leshchinsky I. Srinivas V. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14013-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mix). The cellular fraction was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with a 50% solution of glutathione agarose beads and washed three times in lysis buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm reduced glutathione at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant were collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Kinase Assay—CaM kinase II (CaMK II) activity was measured as described previously (32Premkumar D.R. Mishra R.R. Overholt J.L. Simonson M.S. Cherniack N.S. Prabhakar N.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1898-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein content was quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The standard curve for the kinase assay was constructed according to the protocols suggested by the manufacturer (CaMK II Assay kit, Upstate Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was 30 μl of solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 125 μm autocamtide (peptide substrate KKALRRQETVDAL), and 400 ng of calmodulin. Activities of other serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C were inhibited by mixture of inhibitor peptides (0.1 μm). The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of cell supernatant (equal amount of protein). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, 10-μl aliquots were spotted on p81 phosphocellulose paper. After 3 min, the paper was washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 10–15 times and then washed with acetone five times for 5 min each. The radioactivity was counted by scintillation counter. For demonstrating direct phosphorylation of p300 by CaMK II, an in vitro kinase assay was performed by a modification of the protocol described by Sang et al. (31Sang N. Stiehl D.P. Bohensky J.

Purified GST or GST-p300TD fusion protein was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with recombinant CaMK II (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in CaMK buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. After fractionation by 4–20% continuous gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma), destained, and dried before autoradiography. Data Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from 3–5 independent experiments each run in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. IH Induces HIF-1 Activity—As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we established a cell culture system in which PC12 cells were exposed to IH consisting of alternating cycles of hypoxia (1.5% O2 for 30 s) and re-oxygenation (20% O2 for 4 min). Under these conditions the expression of HIF-1α protein increased in a dose-dependent manner as the duration of IH was increased from 10 to 30 to 60 cycles (Fig. 1A). HIF-1α protein levels were unaffected by exposing cells to alternating cycles of normoxia instead of hypoxia (data not shown). To demonstrate an increase in HIF-1 transcriptional activity, PC12 cells were transfected with reporter gene p2.1, in which the expression of firefly luciferase was driven by a HIF-1-dependent hypoxia response element (HRE) upstream of an SV40 promoter (23Semenza G.L.

HRE-dependent transcriptional activity was induced by IH although, relative to the induction of HIF-1α protein expression, the response was not as dramatic and required an increased number of cycles (Fig. 1B). Transcription of a co-transfected reporter gene in which β-gal expression was driven by a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter was not induced by IH. 120 cycles of IH, which represents a total of 60 min of hypoxic exposure, induced HRE-dependent transcription, whereas 60 min of continuous hypoxia did not (Fig. 1C). MAP kinase, PKC, and PI 3-kinases Are Not Required for IH-induced HIF-1 Activation—Exposure of PC12 cells to continuous hypoxia induces membrane depolarization, increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, and increased activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p42ERK2, and p44ERK1 (33Seta K.A. Yuan Y. Spicer Z. Lu G. Millhorn D.E. Lahiri S. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Oxygen Sensing: Responses and Adaptation to Hypoxia. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2003: 123-152Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the involvement of major intracellular signal transduction pathways in the induction of HRE-dependent transcription by IH. Immunoblot analysis revealed that IH induced increased phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Fig. 2, A and B, top panel) but not p38 (data not shown). However, pretreatment of cells with increasing doses of PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), or SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, did not inhibit HRE-dependent transcription induced by IH (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panel). We then examined the effects of IH (60 cycles) on the translocation of PKC isoforms to the plasma membrane as an index of activation. Of the several PKC isoforms (α, β, γ, δ, λ, γ), IH increased PKC-α and PKC-γ levels in the membrane fraction. Similar increases in PKC-α and PKC-γ were observed after treatment with TPA (100 nm), a potent activator of PKC that served as a positive control. We examined the effects of bisindolylmaleimide 1 (Bis), which inhibits activity of the PKC α, β1, β11, γ, δ, and ϵ isoforms, on IH-induced HRE-activation. As shown in Fig. 2C, HRE activation was unaffected by 3 μm Bis, whereas increasing the concentration to 10 μm resulted in a modest but significant inhibition of IH-induced HRE activation (Fig. 2C). Because hypoxia activates PI3K in PC12 cells (33Seta K.A. Yuan Y. Spicer Z. Lu G. Millhorn D.E. Lahiri S. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Oxygen Sensing: Responses and Adaptation to Hypoxia. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2003: 123-152Google Scholar), we also tested the effects of the inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. Neither LY294002 nor wortmannin blocked IH-induced transcriptional activity (data not shown). Ca2+ Signaling Pathways Involving CaMK II Are Required for IH-induced HIF-1 Activity—Pretreatment of cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM resulted in potent inhibition of HRE-dependent transcription induced by IH (Fig. 3A). These observations indicate that Ca2+ signaling pathways are involved in IH-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity. CaMKs are downstream signaling molecules that participate in Ca2+-mediated gene regulation. Our previous studies have shown that PC12 cells express CaMK II but not CaMK IV and that continuous hypoxia transiently increases CaMK II activity (32Premkumar D.R. Mishra R.R. Overholt J.L. Simonson M.S. Cherniack N.S. Prabhakar N.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1898-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether CaMK II participates in IH-induced HIF-1-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig. 3B, IH-induced reporter gene expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with the selective CaMK inhibitor KN93 (Fig. 3B) as well as with W-7, a potent inhibitor of calmodulin (Fig. 3C). The inhibitory effect of these agents was specific for IH-induced HRE-dependent transcription since in all cases as the expression was normalized to that of the co-transfected RSV-β-gal reporter. Further analysis of PC12 cell lysates revealed an exponential increase in CaMK II activity in response to increasing duration of IH (Fig. 4A) and an associated increase in the phosphorylation of CaMK II protein (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Increased CaMK II activity in PC12 cells subjected to IH. A, cells were exposed to increasing cycles of IH. CaMK activity was assayed with autocamtide as a substrate in cell extracts using [γ-32P] ATP.

Furthermore, KN93 did not block the induction of HIF-1α protein expr"
https://openalex.org/W2014514119,"Evidence that face perception is mediated by special cognitive and neural mechanisms comes from fMRI studies of the fusiform face area (FFA) and behavioral studies of the face inversion effect. Here, we used these two methods to ask whether face perception mechanisms are stimulus specific, process specific, or both. Subjects discriminated pairs of upright or inverted faces or house stimuli that differed in either the spatial distance among parts (configuration) or the shape of the parts. The FFA showed a much higher response to faces than to houses, but no preference for the configuration task over the part task. Similarly, the behavioral inversion effect was as large in the part task as the configuration task for faces, but absent in both part and configuration tasks for houses. These findings indicate that face perception mechanisms are not process specific for parts or configuration but are domain specific for face stimuli per se."
https://openalex.org/W2069423064,"Ultraviolet radiation is a well established epidemiologic risk factor for malignant melanoma. This observation has been linked to the relative resistance of normal melanocytes to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation-induced apoptosis, which consequently leads to accumulation of UVB radiation-induced DNA lesions in melanocytes. Therefore, identification of physiologic factors regulating UVB radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage of melanocytes is of utmost biological importance. We show that the neuropeptide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) blocks UVB radiation-induced apoptosis of normal human melanocytes in vitro. The anti-apoptotic activity of α-MSH is not mediated by filtering or by induction of melanin synthesis in melanocytes. α-MSH neither leads to changes in the cell cycle distribution nor induces alterations in the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Bcl2, Bclx, Bax, p53, CD95 (Fas/APO-1), and CD95L (FasL). In contrast, α-MSH markedly reduces the formation of UVB radiation-induced DNA damage as demonstrated by reduced amounts of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, ultimately leading to reduced apoptosis. The reduction of UV radiation-induced DNA damage by α-MSH appears to be related to induction of nucleotide excision repair, because UV radiation-mediated apoptosis was not blocked by α-MSH in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts. These data, for the first time, demonstrate regulation of UVB radiation-induced apoptosis of human melanocytes by a neuropeptide that is physiologically expressed within the epidermis. Apart from its ability to induce photoprotective melanin synthesis, α-MSH appears to exert the capacity to reduce UV radiation-induced DNA damage and, thus, may act as a potent protection factor against the harmful effects of UV radiation on the genomic stability of epidermal cells.

It is considered a protective mechanism for minimizing the survival of cells with irreparable DNA damage (1Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Leffell D.J. Simon J.A. Sharma H.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L.

Oncogene. 2002; 29: 5844-5851Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These pathways are orchestrated by positive and negative factors that act within the epidermis in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion. For example, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor produced by dermal fibroblasts inhibits UVB radiation-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway (8Mildner M. Eckhart L. Lengauer B. Tschachler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-1, which is expressed by melanocytes and fibroblasts (9Tavakkol A. Elder J.T. Griffith C.E. Cooper K.D. Talwar H. Fisher G.J. Keane K.M. Foltin S.K. Voorhees J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), delays UVB radiation-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes via the same mechanism (10Decraene D. Agostinis P.

Recently, we reported that the immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 significantly reduced DNA lesions induced by UVB irradiation in vitro and in vivo. IL-12 did not reduce the number of sunburn cells in mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER), indicating that the DNA damage-reducing effect of IL-12 may be linked to NER (11Schwarz A.

In the epidermis, one of the most biologically relevant protective mechanisms against UVB radiation-induced DNA damage is provided by melanocytes. These neural, crest-derived cells deliver melanin in melanosomes via dendrites to adjacent keratinocytes. Failure to produce melanin, for example due to the loss of function of tyrosinase as in ocular cutaneous albinism type 1, leads to accumulation of UV radiation-induced DNA damage that finally results in a dramatically increased risk for squamous and basal cell carcinoma as well as malignant melanoma. Little is known about the natural paracrine or autocrine factors that regulate melanocyte apoptosis upon UVB radiation exposure. Only a limited number of peptide growth factors induce proliferation and melanogenesis in vitro. These mitogens include basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, mast cell growth factor, and endothelin-1 (12Halaban R. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Bo ̈hm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Zhao B. Wagner S. Alvarez-Franco M. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Another group of melanocyte peptide growth factors belongs to the evolutionary conserved family of melanocortins, which includes α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (14Abdel-Malek Z. Swope V.B. Suzuki I. Akcali C. Harriger M.D. Boyce S.T. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These bioactive peptides were initially characterized as pituitary gland-derived peptides that are structurally derived from a common precursor, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (15Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Endocr. Rev. 1980; 1: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Both α-MSH and ACTH bind with similar affinity to the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC-1R) expressed by human melanocytes (16Suzuki I. Cone R.D. Im S. Nordlund J. Abdel-Malek Z. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MC-1R belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains that activate adenylate cyclase (17Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). In recent years, however, it has become apparent that the skin as well as the majority of skin cell types in vitro express POMC and are capable of generating POMC peptides including α-MSH and ACTH (18Bo ̈hm M. Luger T.A. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2000; 54: 287-293PubMed Google Scholar, 19Slominski A. Wortsman J. Luger T. Paus R. Solomon S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 979-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and UV radiation exposure were identified as physiological inducers of the skin POMC system, leading to the concept of a cutaneous analogon of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (19Slominski A. Wortsman J. Luger T. Paus R. Solomon S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 979-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Moreover, MC-1R has been demonstrated as being expressed by a variety of extra-pigmentary cell types of the skin, including dermal microvascular endothelial cells (20Hartmeyer M. Scholzen T.

In this study we explored the effect of α-MSH on UVB radiation-induced cell damage of normal human melanocytes (NHMs). We have identified a new physiologic pathway that reduces UVB radiation-induced DNA damage in NHMs and thus may minimize the risk of developing malignant melanoma. Cell Culture—NHMs and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were established from newborn foreskin and purchased from CellSystems (St. Katharinen, Germany). NHM cultures were derived from three individual donors, and HDF cultures were derived from two individual donors. For experiments on NHKs, pooled cultures from several donors (CellSystems) were used and maintained in chemically defined keratinocyte basal medium-2 with all supplements according to the manufacturer's (CellSystems, St. Katharinen, Germany) instructions. NHMs were routinely grown in melanocyte growth medium M2 (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). HDFs were cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAA, Cölbe, Germany), 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (both from PAA), and 10% fetal calf serum (PAA). HDFs carrying a defective Xpa gene were provided by Dr. Mark Berneburg, University of Tübingen, Germany. Cell Treatment and UV Irradiation—For all experiments involving α-MSH we found it essential to deprive the cells of bovine pituitary extract (BPE), which is commonly used for cell cultures of NHM and NHK. Thus, NHMs were kept for 3 days in chemically defined melanocyte basal medium (PromoCell) supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. NHKs were also deprived of BPE for 3 days. HDFs were stimulated with α-MSH in the absence of fetal calf serum. Cells were preincubated with α-MSH (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) at concentrations as indicated for 6 h prior to UV irradiation. In some experiments the COOH-terminal tripeptide KPV (Bachem) was used. Cells were irradiated through PBS as reported previously (2Kulms D. Po ̈ppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). An irradiation bank consisting of six fluorescent bulbs (TL12, Philips) that emit most of their energy within the UVB range with an emission peak of 313 nm was used. Upon UV irradiation, cells were reincubated with α-MSH for indicated time periods as indicated. Detection of Cell Death—A cell death detection ELISA Plus from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany) was used. The assay determines the amount of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm that are detected by biotinylated anti-histone- and peroxidase-coupled anti-DNA antibodies. NHMs, NHKs (both 1 × 105 per ml), and HDFs (0.5 × 105 per ml) were seeded into 3.5-cm diameter tissue culture disks. Cells were collected 18 h after UV irradiation. Both adherent and floating cells were combined for sample preparation. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, and optical density was calculated as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Alternatively, apoptosis was detected by annexin V staining and flow cytometry as reported previously (29Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Po ̈ppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The rate of apoptosis was determined by comparing the mean fluorescence intensity of annexin V-stained cells between the different treatment groups. Spectrophotometry—UV light filtering by α-MSH was measured by UV spectrophotometry (Model DU 640, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). α-MSH was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a final concentration of 10-5 and 10-6m. Absorbance was measured within a wide range of the UV spectrum (250-400 nm). Determination of Melanin—Measurement of melanin content was performed on 2 × 105 cells after incubation with α-MSH for 6 h. Cells were detached by trypsinization from tissue culture plates and centrifuged, and cell pellets were dissolved in 1 n NaOH. Melanin concentration was determined by measurement of the optical density at 475 nm in relation to a standard curve generated by synthetic melanin (Sigma). MC-1R Genotyping and Sequencing—Genomic DNA extraction from NHMs, HDFs, and XPA fibroblasts was performed using a protocol from Gentra Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The MC-1R gene was amplified by PCR using established protocols (30Robinson S. Healy E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8037-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with forward (5′-ATGGCTGTGCAGGGATCC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCACCAGGAGCATGTCAGCACC-3′) primers that were specific for MC1R. The reactions (primers, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1× Optibuffer (Bioline, London, United Kingdom), and BioTaq Red (Bioline)) were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Cetus 9700 thermal cycler and included an initial denaturation phase at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min with a final extension phase of 7 min. The products (954 bp) were purified using a Qiagen PCR preps column (Qiagen), and the MC-1R coding region was sequenced on a model ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the primers 5′-GCGGTGCTGCAGCAGCTGG-3′, 5′-TGCTGCAGCACCGCAGCC-3′, 5′-ACCACGAGGCACAGCAGG-3′, and 5′-GGCGCTGTCACCCTCACC-3′. Colony Formation Assays—NHMs were seeded into 6-cm-diameter tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells per milliliter. Cells were treated with α-MSH at 10-6m as outlined above. Following irradiation with UVB doses ranging from 150 to 400 J/m2, cells were re-stimulated with α-MSH in chemically defined medium for an additional 18 h. Culture medium was subsequently switched to routine melanocyte growth medium M2. Cells were kept in culture for 2-3 weeks with renewal of medium twice weekly. Cultures were monitored daily. When colonies were easily visible, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number and size in mm2 (actually the area being covered) of the colonies were analyzed using the Image Analysis software Image J (rsbweb.nih/ij/docs/index.html). Three adjacent fields (3 × 3 cm each) per 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dish per experiment were analyzed. Data were analyzed statistically by the Student's t test. DNA Content Analysis—NHMs were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per milliliter into 6-cm-diameter tissue culture plates in chemically defined medium without BPE. Cells were preincubated with α-MSH and irradiated with 600 J/m2 as described above. After 18 h cells were harvested by trypsinization, and DNA content analysis was determined by flow cytometry (31Herzinger T. Funk J.O. Hillmer K. Eick D. Wolf D.A. Kind P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2151-2156PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was performed using the ModFit LT software (Verity, Topsham, ME). Western Immunoblotting—NHMs were collected by trypsinization and centrifugation. Pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ethyleneglycolbis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, and 0.01% NaN2 plus freshly added proteinase inhibitors (25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed for protein content using the modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer was then added, and the samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal protein amounts (10 or 20 μg/lane) were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE using 4-12% gradient gels from NuPAGE (Invitrogen). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked overnight with 10% bovine serum albumin followed by immunoprobing with an anti-Bcl2 antibody (Ancell, Bayport, MN), an anti-Bclx antibody (BD PharMingen), an anti-Bax antibody (BD PharMingen), an anti-p53 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), an anti-CD95 (Fas/APO-1) antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France), an anti-CD95L (FasL) antibody (BD PharMingen), or an anti-α-tubulin antibody (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). Membranes were reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane stripping was performed as described previously (13Bo ̈hm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Zhao B. Wagner S. Alvarez-Franco M. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar) Southwestern Dot Blot—Genomic DNA was prepared from 1 × 106 NHM immediately or 8 h after UV irradiation (150 J/m2). 2 μg of genomic DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by vacuum dot blot and fixed by baking the membrane for 15 min at 80 °C. CPD were detected by probing the membrane with a monoclonal antibody directed against thymine dimers (1:500; Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). Bound antibodies were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Studies—Visualization of CPDs in NHMs by immunofluorescence was performed using a modified protocol from Roza et al. (32Roza L. van der Wulp K.J.M. MacFarlane S.J. Lohman P.H.M. Baan R.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 8 h after UV irradiation (150 J/m2), cells were trypsinized and centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and processed for cytospin preparation (60,000-70,000 cells/slide). Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 45% ethanol for 5 min followed by 70% ethanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X for 30 min. DNA denaturation was performed by treating the cells with 0.5 n HCl and 0.05% pepsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Slides were incubated with the antibody against CPD (1:2000) in 5% fetal calf serum and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound antibodies were visualized with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody coupled to Texas Red (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamido-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) at 100 ng/ml in Tris buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). Cells were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRD/RXA, Wetzlar, Germany). Red fluorescence was excited using the TX2 filter (bandpass 560/40 nm). Emission was measured at 645 ± 75 nm for Texas Red. For DAPI staining an excitation wavelength of 360/40 nm was used. The number of CPD immunoreactive cells per 100 DAPI positive cells was determined in three individual high power viewing fields per experiment. Data were subsequently analyzed by the Student's t test. α-MSH Protects from UVB Radiation-induced Apoptosis—To determine the effect of α-MSH on UVB-induced apoptosis of NHMs, we treated cells with α-MSH (10-6m) 6 h prior to exposure to UVB radiation (600 J/m2). After irradiation, cells were incubated for additional 16 h in the presence or absence of α-MSH followed by determination of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In previous experiments and in accordance with the work of others (33Gilchrest B.A. Eller M.S. Geller A.C. Yaar M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 34Bowen A.R. Hanks A.N. Allen S.M. Alexander A. Diedrich M.J. Grossmann D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it had been noticed that NHMs are less vulnerable than NHKs to UVB radiation and require higher dosages of UVB (at least 400 J/m2in vitro) for the induction of robust apoptosis. α-MSH significantly blocked UVB radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). In contrast, α-MSH per se did not elicit any effect on DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the COOH-terminal tripeptide KPV, which retains many immunomodulatory activities of α-MSH (35Lipton J.M. Catania A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 36Luger T.A. Scholzen T. Grabbe S. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1997; 2: 87-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), did not have a significant effect on UVB radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B). Despite the fact that none of the utilized NHM cultures established from the three individual donors were homozygous for a signaling-deficient MC-1R variant (two NHM cultures with both wild type MC-1R alleles and one NHM culture with a heterozygous R151C variant), the anti-apoptotic effect of α-MSH was not due to an increment in melanin content during the incubation period with α-MSH prior to UVB radiation exposure (data not shown). Moreover, spectrophotometric analysis did not demonstrate any filtering effect of α-MSH (data not shown). In accordance with an anti-apoptotic effect independent of melanogenesis, α-MSH blocked apoptosis of NHKs exposed to UVB radiation (250 J/m2) as shown by death detection ELISA (Fig. 1C). To confirm the protective effect of α-MSH on UVB radiation-induced apoptosis in NHMs and NHKs by another readout system, we performed annexin V surface staining and flow cytometry. Again, α-MSH suppressed UVB-induced apoptosis in NHMs (mean fluorescence intensity of non-irradiated cells was 10.6 versus 26.2 for UVB-treated cells and 17.4 for cells treated with α-MSH plus UVB) (Fig. 1D) as well as in NHKs (mean fluorescence intensity of non-irradiated cells was 7.4 versus 18.3 for UVB radiation-treated cells versus 9.7 for cells treated with α-MSH plus UVB) (Fig. 1E). α-MSH Promotes Long Term Survival after UVB Irradiation—To exclude the possibility that α-MSH only delays apoptosis but indeed enhances the survival of NHMs, colony forming assays were performed. To this end, cells were preincubated with α-MSH, exposed to UVB radiation, and maintained in a routine culture medium for several weeks. To allow the survival of a sufficient number of cells suitable for colony formation, a lower UVB dose (150 J/m2) was applied than that used in the previous experiments. A single exposure to this dose drastically reduced the number of colonies detectable after 3 weeks (Fig. 2A). α-MSH (10-6m) significantly increased the number and size of the visible colonies as compared with UVB radiation-exposed NHMs (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, α-MSH alone did not have any robust effect on the number of colonies in sham-irradiated cells. These data demonstrate that α-MSH indeed promotes long term survival of NHMs exposed to a single dose of UVB radiation. α-MSH-mediated Protection of UVB-induced Apoptosis Is Not Due to Cell Cycle Changes—The protective effect of α-MSH on UVB radiation-induced apoptosis of NHMs could be caused by changes in the cell cycle, giving the cells more time to repair UVB radiation-induced DNA damage. It has been reported that in asynchronously growing NHKs and HaCaT cells, sublethal doses of UVB irradiation induce G2 cell cycle arrest (31Herzinger T. Funk J.O. Hillmer K. Eick D. Wolf D.A. Kind P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2151-2156PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, NHMs were shown to arrest in G1 after UVB irradiation in vitro (37Barker D. Dixon K. Medrano E.E. Smalara D. Babcock G. Abdel-Malek Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4041-4046PubMed Google Scholar). However, the experimental conditions as presented in this work suggested a priori a G1 arrest in untreated NHMs and NHKs, as these cells had been deprived of BPE prior to treatment with α-MSH and/or UVB radiation (see “Materials and Methods”). DNA content analysis of untreated NHM revealed 88.6 ± 1.8% of cells were arrested in G1 and 10.7 ± 1.3% were arrested in G2/M (Table I). Although α-MSH, UVB radiation, and α-MSH plus UVB radiation lead to a small but statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase as compared with non-treated cells, α-MSH failed to increase the percentage of cells in G1 or G2/M as compared with UVB radiation alone (Table I). Therefore, it can be concluded that the protective effect of α-MSH from UVB radiation-induced apoptosis is not mediated via the accumulation of NHMs in the G1 or G2 phase.Table Iα-MSH does not increase the percentage of cells arrested in G1 or G2/M as compared with UVB irradiation aloneCell cycle phaseTreatmentN/AMUVBM + UVBG188.6 ± 1.885.1 ± 0.286.0"
https://openalex.org/W2041095187,"Odor discrimination times and their dependence on stimulus similarity were evaluated to test temporal and spatial models of odor representation in mice. In a go/no-go operant conditioning paradigm, discrimination accuracy and time were determined for simple monomolecular odors and binary mixtures of odors. Mice discriminated simple odors with an accuracy exceeding 95%. Binary mixtures evoking highly overlapping spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb were discriminated equally well. However, while discriminating simple odors in less than 200 ms, mice required 70–100 ms more time to discriminate highly similar binary mixtures. We conclude that odor discrimination in mice is fast and stimulus dependent. Thus, the underlying neuronal mechanisms act on a fast timescale, requiring only a brief epoch of odor-specific spatiotemporal representations to achieve rapid discrimination of dissimilar odors. The fine discrimination of highly similar stimuli, however, requires temporal integration of activity, suggesting a tradeoff between accuracy and speed."
https://openalex.org/W2171855811,"Rho GTPases are essential regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization, but how they do so during neuronal morphogenesis in vivo is poorly understood. Here we show that the actin depolymerization factor cofilin is essential for axon growth in Drosophila neurons. Cofilin function in axon growth is inhibited by LIM kinase and activated by Slingshot phosphatase. Dephosphorylating cofilin appears to be the major function of Slingshot in regulating axon growth in vivo. Genetic data provide evidence that Rho or Rac/Cdc42, via effector kinases Rok or Pak, respectively, activate LIM kinase to inhibit axon growth. Importantly, Rac also activates a Pak-independent pathway that promotes axon growth, and different RacGEFs regulate these distinct pathways. These genetic analyses reveal convergent and divergent pathways from Rho GTPases to the cytoskeleton during axon growth in vivo and suggest that different developmental outcomes could be achieved by biases in pathway selection."
https://openalex.org/W2113908640,"A concept in Parkinson's disease postulates that motor cortex may pattern abnormal rhythmic activities in the basal ganglia, underlying the genesis of observed motor symptoms. We conducted a preclinical study of electrical interference in the primary motor cortex using a chronic MPTP primate model in which dopamine depletion was progressive and regularly documented using 18F-DOPA positron tomography. High-frequency motor cortex stimulation significantly reduced akinesia and bradykinesia. This behavioral benefit was associated with an increased metabolic activity in the supplementary motor area as assessed with 18-F-deoxyglucose PET, a normalization of mean firing rate in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and a reduction of synchronized oscillatory neuronal activities in these two structures. Motor cortex stimulation is a simple and safe procedure to modulate subthalamo-pallido-cortical loop and alleviate parkinsonian symptoms without requiring deep brain stereotactic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2040794896,"Dual patch-clamp recording and Ca2+ uncaging revealed Ca2+-dependent corelease of ACh and GABA from, and the presence of reciprocal nicotinic and GABAergic synapses between, starburst cells in the perinatal rabbit retina. With maturation, the nicotinic synapses between starburst cells dramatically diminished, whereas the GABAergic synapses remained and changed from excitatory to inhibitory, indicating a coordinated conversion of the starburst network excitability from an early hyperexcitatory to a mature nonepileptic state. We show that this transition allows the starburst cells to use their neurotransmitters for two completely different functions. During early development, the starburst network mediates recurrent excitation and spontaneous retinal waves, which are important for visual system development. After vision begins, starburst cells release GABA in a prolonged and Ca2+-dependent manner and inhibit each other laterally via direct GABAergic synapses, which may be important for visual integration, such as the detection of motion direction."
https://openalex.org/W2089476104,"The human mitochondrial metabolic network was recently reconstructed based on proteomic and biochemical data. Linear programming and uniform random sampling were applied herein to identify candidate steady states of the metabolic network that were consistent with the imposed physico-chemical constraints and available experimental data. The activity of the mitochondrion was studied under four metabolic conditions: normal physiologic, diabetic, ischemic, and dietetic. Pairwise correlations between steady-state reaction fluxes were calculated in each condition to evaluate the dependence among the reactions in the network. Applying constraints on exchange fluxes resulted in predictions for intracellular fluxes that agreed with experimental data. Analyses of the steady-state flux distributions showed that the experimentally observed reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vivo could be a result of stoichiometric constraints and therefore would not necessarily require enzymatic inhibition. The observed changes in the energy metabolism of the mitochondrion under diabetic conditions were used to evaluate the impact of previously suggested treatments. The results showed that neither normalized glucose uptake nor decreased ketone body uptake have a positive effect on the mitochondrial energy metabolism or network flexibility.

The emergence of genomic, metabolic, and proteomic data has facilitated the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks. Various network reconstructions have been carried out in recent years for microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (1Reed J.L. Vo T.D. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). Constraint-based analyses have proven to be valuable for studying genome-scale metabolic networks. The constraint-based approach is based on the fact that cellular networks are constrained to operate within boundaries set by physico-chemical constraints (mass conservation, directional flow, enzymatic capacity, etc). The imposition of constraints corresponds to a mathematical definition of a solution space within which all feasible solutions lie. For example, the steady-state flux space contains all feasible steady-state flux distributions for a biochemical network. Methods for flux analysis within the constraint-based framework include flux balance analysis (9Bonarius H.P.J. Schmid G. Tramper J. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (264) Google Scholar), network-based pathway analysis (10Schilling C.H. Edwards J.S. Letscher D. Palsson B.O. Biotechnol.

The complete description of currently available constraint-based analysis methods used to compute the properties of genome-scale network reconstructions has recently been reviewed in detail (35Price N.D. Reed J.L. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In this study, uniform random sampling was used to calculate candidate steady-state flux distributions in the human cardiac mitochondrion under different sets of constraints representing various physiological conditions. Experimental data from many literature sources were integrated as physico-chemical constraints of the mitochondrial metabolic network. Constraints based on these experimental data were applied to segment the steady-state flux space defined by mass-balance constraints. This segmentation resulted in a characterization of all feasible steadystate flux distributions, termed candidate steady-state flux distributions, that occurred under each specified condition (see Fig. 1). Candidate steady-state flux distributions were determined for the following cases: (i) normal physiological condition, (ii) diabetic condition, (iii) ischemic conditions, and (iv) two types of diets. In addition, the effect of currently used and potential therapeutic approaches on mitochondrial metabolism was studied. Taken together, the approach used herein allows us to assess the implications of many different experimental measurements within the context of an integrated metabolic network. The biochemical reactions comprising the reconstructed metabolic network were represented by a stoichiometric matrix, S (m × n), where m was the number of metabolites and n was the number of reactions. All reactions within the network were mass-balanced such that S·v = 0, where v was a flux vector (36Edwards J.S. Ramakrishna R. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Lee S.Y. Papoutsakis E.T. Metabolic Engineering. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 13-57Google Scholar, 37Kauffman K.J. Prakash P. Edwards J.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The constraints for each reaction had the form αi ≤ vi ≤ βi, where αi and βi represented the lower and upper limits of the corresponding reaction flux. The αi values for irreversible reactions were set to zero, whereas βi values were usually set either to measured uptake rates for transport reactions or to the Vmax of the corresponding enzymes. Fluxes that satisfy all of these stated constraints lie in the steady-state flux space. The metabolic network of the human cardiac mitochondrion has been recently reconstructed (8Vo T.D. Greenberg H.J. Palsson B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). This network contained 189 reactions, 230 metabolites, and 29 exchange reactions. Exchange reactions are used to describe the metabolites available for the system and do not correspond to actual biochemical reactions (see Ref. 8Vo T.D. Greenberg H.J. Palsson B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar for complete reaction list). To study the effects of diabetes and diets, both of which are generally correlated with high concentrations of ketone bodies in the blood, the previously published mitochondrial metabolic network was expanded to include ketone body degradation. We added one enzymatic reaction ((R)-3-hydroxybutanoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.30, (38Marks A. McIntyre J. Duncan T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15459-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Green D. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. McIntyre J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) and six transport reactions (supplemental data Table S2a) to the previous reconstruction. These reactions added five more metabolites to the network (supplemental data Table S2b). The reconstruction was done using the software package SimPheny® (Genomatica Inc., San Diego, CA). This updated model is available for download at systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/organisms/. In general, incomplete knowledge about a biological system results in gaps and dead-end metabolites that are only consumed or only produced by the reconstructed network. Due to the mass-balance constraints, reactions involving these metabolites must have zero net flux at steady state. These “unused” reactions were identified under the four conditions studied and removed from the S matrix prior to the sampling calculations. We identified 39 unused reactions out of the 224 reactions in the network (supplemental data Table S3). The resulting network contained 185 reactions, including 23 exchange reactions, and 235 metabolites (121 mitochondrial, 89 cystolic, and 25 extracellular). The null space of the corresponding stoichiometric matrix had 21 dimensions. Sampling the steady-state flux space was performed using a random walk algorithm (artificial centering hit-and-run, ACHR) 2The abbreviations used are: ACHR, artificial centering hit-and- run; DM ATP, demand for ATP; CPT-1, carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase I; GIK, glucose, insulin, and potassium; PDHm, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; Co-set, correlated reaction set. as described by Kaufmann and Smith (40Kaufman D.E. Smith R.L. Operations Research. 1998; 46: 84-95Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The algorithm involves three steps. The first step requires the identification of an initial point within the solution space. We found this initial point by reducing each of the maximum constraints and increasing each of the minimum constraints by a small value and then calculating a candidate solution within these new constraints using linear programming. This procedure ensured that the initial point was chosen within the solution space, thus avoiding the computational difficulties that arise when the initial point lies at the extremity of the solution space. The second step of the ACHR algorithm calculates “warm-up” points from the initial point using several iterations of a basic hit-and-run algorithm (40Kaufman D.E. Smith R.L. Operations Research. 1998; 46: 84-95Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These warm-up points were stored as columns of a matrix W, and an approximate center, s, was calculated. The third step of the ACHR calculates the sample points. The direction for the next iteration from a sample point xm was chosen by randomly taking one point y out of the matrix W and applying the direction vector of y and s (y→−s→) to xm. At each iteration, the newly calculated point, xm+1, was substituted randomly into W in the place of a previously calculated point. The approximate center was also recalculated after each iteration. This last step was repeated until a desired number of sample points was reached. In practice, this approach allowed the distribution of points to converge to a uniform distribution much faster than the standard hit-and-run algorithm does (40Kaufman D.E. Smith R.L. Operations Research. 1998; 46: 84-95Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In each sampling procedure, 500,000 randomly distributed points were computed with 100 iterations between each point. The algorithm was implemented in Matlab® (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) with Lindo® (LINDO Systems Inc., Chicago) as the linear programming solver. The same solution space was sampled five times using different randomly chosen initial points to verify that the calculated distribution of points was independent from the starting point. The resulting distributions were compared with one another to ensure that no difference was observed. In addition, we sampled the steady-state flux space of the red blood cell model (41Wiback S.J. Palsson B.O. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 808-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with the ACHR algorithm and evaluated our results with the previously published results from an elimination algorithm to confirm that both algorithms (15Price N.D. Schellenberger J. Palsson B.O. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2172-2186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) led to the same distributions. A literature search for available in vivo measurements in the human heart was performed. The aim was to segment the steady-state solution space by using measured values for exchange reactions as specific constraints for each of the four conditions studied. Following the convention described in Schilling et al. (42Schilling C.H. Letscher D. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 229-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), substrate uptake rates were assigned negative flux values, whereas efflux rates were assigned positive values during computation. In the text, however, we will distinguish between uptake and efflux rates, but we will use positive values to describe both. All fluxes used in this study were calculated in μmol/min/g of proteins in accordance with the units commonly found in the literature for flux measurements. Normal Physiological Conditions—The normal physiological condition we describe here represents the metabolism of a human resting heart. Constraints were applied on the uptake and efflux rates of metabolites according to the normal physiologic state of the mitochondrion. We applied a positive minimum constraint on the demand for ATP (DM ATP) to represent the minimal energy required for the maintenance of the cell in its normal physiological state. The required ATP level for ion homeostasis was set at ∼26% of the total ATP production (43Opie L. The Heart: Physiology and Metabolism. Second Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991Google Scholar). We used an ATP production rate of 30 μmol/min/g of proteins, which was taken from measurements in the working dog heart (44Williamson J.R. Ford C. Illingworth J. Safer B. Circ. Res. 1976; 38: I39-I51PubMed Google Scholar), because the corresponding value for humans could not be found. Therefore, the lower bound of DM ATP was set to 7.5 μmol/min/g of proteins. The hexadecanoate (n-C16:0) uptake rate was measured to be 1 μmol/min/g of proteins (45O'Donnell J.M. Alpert N.M. White L.T. Lewandowski E.D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This value was used to approximate the uptake rates of other fatty acids based on their observed distributions in mammalian cardiomyocytes: 53% for octadecanoate (n-C18:0), 16% for hexadecanoate (n-C16:0), and 7% for octadecenoate (n-C18:1) and for octadecynoate (n-C18:2) (43Opie L. The Heart: Physiology and Metabolism. Second Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991Google Scholar). The fatty acids eicosanoate (n-C20:4) and docosanoate (n-C22:6) could not be detected in these experiments (43Opie L. The Heart: Physiology and Metabolism. Second Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991Google Scholar); we assumed that each of these fatty acids made up 2% of the total fatty acid uptake. These values allowed us to calculate the upper and lower limits for each fatty acid uptake rate (Table I). The lower bound and upper bound constraints were set by taking 25% variation around these experimentally measured values. The uptake rate of lactate was constrained to the same upper bound as that defined for glucose, as both substrates are consumed at approximately equivalent rates under normal physiological conditions (46Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Koeppen B.M. Stanton B.A. Physiology. Mosby International, 2003Google Scholar). The uptake of the ketone bodies, acetoacetate and (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate, were allowed, but the secretion of ketone bodies was set to zero since the heart does not normally produce and export ketone bodies as the liver does (47Fukao T. Lopaschuk G.D. Mitchell G.A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, the maximum uptake rates for these ketone bodies were set to be very small (0.001 μmol/min/g of proteins) since the plasma concentration of circulating ketone bodies is less than 0.1 mm at normal physiological conditions (47Fukao T. Lopaschuk G.D. Mitchell G.A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).

This condition results in an unregulated and increased fatty acid uptake in mitochondria via the carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT-I) shuttle (48Taegtmeyer H. McNulty P. Young M.E. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 49Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fatty acid uptake flux through CPT-I was increased in the model to reflect its activity under diabetic conditions. No quantitative experimental values could be found on how much these uptake rates increase, but a significant increase of free cellular fatty acids in the myocardium was observed in diabetic mice (50Aasum E. Hafstad A.D. Severson D.L. Larsen T.S. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lower bound constraints of the fatty acid uptake rates were increased to 80% of the maximum allowed flux values under normal physiological conditions (Table II, supplemental data Table S4a). However, it was not possible to increase the minimum uptake rates for eicosonoate (n-C20:4) and docosonoate (n-C22:6) without elimination of all possible network steady states. The maximum glucose uptake was reduced to 75% of its normal rate (51King L.M. Sidell R.J. Wilding J.R. Radda G.K. Clarke K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1173-H1181PubMed Google Scholar) based on the decreased number of glucose transporters (GLUT4) in the cardiomyocyte membrane under insulin insufficiency or insensitivity (48Taegtmeyer H. McNulty P. Young M.E. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 49Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Another effect of diabetes is that the plasma ketone body concentration may be as high as 25 mm (52Veech R.L. Chance B. Kashiwaya Y. Lardy H.A. Cahill Jr., G.F. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); thus, the upper limits on uptake rates of ketone bodies defined under normal conditions were removed. It should be noted, however, that although the constraints on ketone body uptake were removed in the diabetic condition, the resulting maximum allowable fluxes through the ketone body transporter under diabetic conditions were only 1.4% of that under normal physiological conditions. This reduction in ketone body uptake was due to the increased fatty acid uptake rate in the diabetic condition, thus systemically limiting ketone body transport. To simulate a high influx of ketone bodies, the minimum uptake rates were set to be 10% of the maximum possible flux of each ketone body under this condition. These new constraints represented the salient features of changed substrate supply observed in the diabetic cardiomyocyte (supplemental data Table S4a).Table IISchematic representation of constraints applied under four different conditionsConditionsSubstrateUptake rateApplied constraintsDiabeticFatty acidsMinimumUpMaximumUpaThe formerly applied maximum constraint was removed, resulting in the flux being constrained only by network stoichiometry and the constraints on other fluxes.

https://openalex.org/W2005883397,"(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a potent antioxidant that is neuroprotective against ischemia-induced brain damage. However, the neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of action of EGCG after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) have not been investigated. Therefore, we used a modified ""Levine"" model of HI to determine the effects of EGCG. Wistar rats were treated with either 0.9% saline or 50 mg/kg EGCG daily for 1 day and 1 h before HI induction and for a further 2 days post-HI. At 26-days-old, both groups underwent permanent left common carotid artery occlusion and exposure to 8% oxygen/92% nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h. Histological assessment showed that EGCG significantly reduced infarct volume (38.0+/-16.4 mm(3)) in comparison to HI + saline (99.6+/-15.6 mm(3)). In addition, EGCG significantly reduced total (622.6+/-85.8 pmol L-[(3)H]citrulline/30 min/mg protein) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity (143.2+/-77.3 pmol L-[(3)H]citrulline/30 min/mg protein) in comparison to HI+saline controls (996.6+/-113.6 and 329.7+/-59.6 pmol L-[(3)H]citrulline/30 min/mg protein for total NOS and iNOS activity, respectively). Western blot analysis demonstrated that iNOS protein expression was also reduced. In contrast, EGCG significantly increased endothelial and neuronal NOS protein expression compared with HI controls. EGCG also significantly preserved mitochondrial energetics (complex I-V) and citrate synthase activity. This study demonstrates that the neuroprotective effects of EGCG are, in part, due to modulation of NOS isoforms and preservation of mitochondrial complex activity and integrity. We therefore conclude that the in vivo neuroprotective effects of EGCG are not exclusively due to its antioxidant effects but involve more complex signal transduction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2027649800,"Bacillus thuringiensis Cry protein exerts its toxic effect through a receptor-mediated process. Both aminopeptidases and cadherin proteins were identified as putative Cry1A receptors from Heliothis virescens and Manduca sexta. The importance of cadherin was implied by its correlation with a Cry1Ac resistant H. virescens strain (Gahan, L. J., Gould, F., and Heckel, D. G. (2001) Science 293, 857-860). In this study, the Cry1Ac toxin-binding region in H. virescens cadherin was mapped to a 40-amino-acid fragment, from amino acids 1422 to 1440. This site overlaps with a Cry1Ab toxin-binding site, amino acids 1363-1464 recently reported in M. sexta (Hua, G., Jurat-Fuentes, J. L., and Adang, M. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 28051-28056). Further, feeding of the anti-H. virescens cadherin antiserum or the partial cadherins, which contain the toxin-binding region, in combination with Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac reduced insect mortality by 25.5-55.6% to first instar H. virescens and M. sexta larvae, suggesting a critical function for this cadherin domain in insect toxicity. Mutations in this region, to which the Cry1Ac binds through its loop 3, resulted in the loss of toxin binding. For the first time, we show that the cadherin amino acids Leu1425 and Phe1429 are critical for Cry1Ac toxin interaction, and if substituted with charged amino acids, result in the loss of toxin binding, with a KD of < 10-5m. Mutation of Gln1430 to an alanine, however, increased the Cry1Ac affinity 10-fold primarily due to an increase on rate. The L1425R mutant can result from a single nucleotide mutation, CTG → CGG, suggesting that these mutants, which have decreased toxin binding, may lead to Cry1A resistance in insects.

Ellers-Kirk C. Higginson D. Holley D. Gahan L.J. Heckel D.G. Carriere Y. Dennehy T.J. Brown J.K. Tabashnik B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5004-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), leading to resistant insects. In both insect species, resistance to Cry1A toxins results from either mutations to premature stop codons or deletions in the cadherin gene. These resistant insects show significant fitness costs (20Carriere Y. Ellers-Kirk C. Liu Y.B. Sims M.A. Patin A.L. Dennehy T.J. Tabashnik B.E. J. Econ. Entomol. 2001; 94: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), resulting in poor larval survival on cotton plants. This high fitness costs suggest that these deletions likely affect cadherin function.In contrast, high level resistance observed with many chemical insecticides results from point mutations that do not substantially affect the target protein function, and single amino acid changes have been observed in insects resistant to dieldrin, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, pyrethroids, and organophosphates (21Ffrench-Constant R.H. Daborn P.J. Le Goff G. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 163-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a critical toxin-binding site in H. virescens cadherin and showed for the first time that point mutations at this site can lead to substantial decrease in toxin affinity. We also show that loop 3 of the Cry1Ab and 1Ac toxins bind this site. Selection and isolation of insects with mutations at these amino acids in the field would likely lead to the development of highly resistant insect populations, potentially affecting the efficacy of many transgenic crops expressing these toxins.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Escherichia coli strains were grown in LB at 37 °C with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cry1Ac parasporal inclusions were isolated from wild-type B. thuringiensis strain HD73 grown in nutrient broth sporulation medium for 72 h at 30 °C. Cry1Ab parasporal inclusions were isolated from the acrystalliferous strain 4Q7cry transformed with pHT315-cry1Ab and grown in HCO medium (22Lecadet M.M. Blondel M.O. Ribier J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 121: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar) for 96 h at 30 °C. Both H. virescens (Southland Bioproducts) and M. sexta (23Bell R.A. Joachim F.G. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1976; 69: 365-373Crossref Google Scholar) were reared on artificial diet, respectively.Purification of Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac Toxins and the Activated Protein Fragments—Spores and parasporal inclusions were harvested and washed with buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Parasporal inclusions were isolated by NaBr gradients as described previously (24Cowles E.A. Yunovitz H. Charles J.F. Gill S.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), solubilized in 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10 at 37 °C for 1 h, and the solubilized proteins were then activated with trypsin (1:5 w/w) or M. sexta midgut juice at 18 °C for 6 h. The proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (SMART, Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (25Zhuang M. Oltean D.I. Gomez I. Pullikuth A.K. Soberon M. Bravo A. Gill S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13863-13872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the purified toxins were then dialyzed against appropriate buffers.RNA Isolation and First Strand cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from H. virescens midgut tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was used as template for PCR cloning of cDNAs encoding the H. virescens cadherin protein.Cloning and Expression of Cadherin Protein—Two cadherin partial clones, Hvm-4-62 and Hvm-5-22, 2.9 and 2.1 kb, respectively, were obtained from expressed sequence tag analysis of a H. virescens midgut cDNA library, constructed in pFR vector. 2S. S. Gill, unpublished data. Using primers based on the Hvm-5-22 sequence, a partial cadherin cDNA clone (pFR-CAD-partial) of 4.75 kb was isolated from this library (see Fig. 1) by the limited growth PCR (26Ross L.S. Gill S. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This cDNA clone encoded a partial cadherin that lacked 6 amino acids from the N terminus and 142 amino acids from the C terminus.Therefore, to obtain a H. virescens cadherin full-length cDNA, the 5′- and 3′-sequences were obtained by PCR and RACE, respectively. The 5′-PCR fragment was amplified from the first stand cDNA with the following sense and antisense primers, respectively, 5′-CCGACCAGCTCCTATTGTTT-3′ and 5′-AGTAAGCTTGAGATGGCAGTCGACGTGAG-3′ (with an incorporated HindIII site indicated) primers based on known H. virescens cadherin sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF367362), whereas 3′-RACE product was obtained using sequences from the expressed sequence tag clones (Hvm-5-22 and pFR-CAD-partial) with 5′-TATCCGACCGCAACAGAG-3′ and 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG-3′, adaptor primer for RACE), following the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). These two products were cloned into pBlue-Script vector sequentially and were digested with NdeI and SphI followed by cloning of the 3.76-kb NdeI/SphI cDNA fragment from the pFR-CAD-partial encoding the middle portion of the wild-type cDNA into the NdeI/SphI sites. The resulting recombinant plasmid harbors the full-length cDNA encoding the H. virescens cadherin open reading frame (accession number AY692445).To determine the toxin-binding region in the cadherin protein, primers were designed to generate different PCR products for expression and toxin overlay assay. PCR products amplified by different primer combinations were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector and subsequently cloned into suitable pQE vectors (Qiagen) to generate clones CAD1 and CAD4-CAD6, whereas clone CAD3 was generated from CAD2 by suitable restriction enzyme digestion. These cadherin clones were transformed into E. coli M15 cells, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The expressed products were purified using nickel affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen).Site-directed mutagenesis was used to map the precise toxin-binding sites in H. virescens cadherin using QuikChange II, following the manufacturer's instructions (Strategene). Three amino acid substitutions were made at one time. Eighteen mutants were constructed and expressed in E. coli M15 cells. The expressed products were purified with nickel affinity chromatography. Subsequently, single amino acid mutations were also made using the methods described above.Development of Anti-cadherin Antibodies—The 513-bp SacI/PstI cDNA fragment from the H. virescens midgut expressed sequence tag clone (#Hvm5-22), which corresponds to the C-terminal portion of the protein (aa 1385-1556), was cloned into the SacI/PstI sites of pQE30 (Qiagen). This recombinant plasmid was then transformed into E. coli M15 cells, and the expressed protein was first purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen) and then by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein, CAD0, was then used to immunize rabbits for the generation of antibodies according to standard protocols as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar).Toxin Overlay Assays—Forty pmol of purified cadherin protein fragments were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with 10 nm Cry1A toxins. Unbound toxins were removed by washing the membrane three times with washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% bovine albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min. The membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-Cry1Ac antibody followed by a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) (1: 5000 dilution). Blots were visualized using luminol (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences). To determine the ability of peptides to compete with the Cry1A toxin, varying concentrations of the different loop peptides were incubated with biotinylated Cry1A toxins in washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature before incubating this mixture with Immobilon membranes containing SDS-PAGE-separated cadherin fragments.Biosensor (SPR) Analysis of Cadherin Affinities to Cry1A—All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using a Biacore X and NTA sensor chips (Biacore). Eluent buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 8.3) was used throughout the analyses. The ligands, cadherin partial proteins, or cadherin mutants (24 kDa, homogeneous by SDS-PAGE), at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in eluent buffer, were captured on flow cell 2 at densities of less than 100 response units. The analytes (activated Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, homogeneous by SDS-PAGE) were injected over both flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The complex was allowed to associate and dissociate for 120 and 180 s, respectively. The surface was regenerated with a 3-min injection of regeneration buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 8.3) followed by a 1-min injection of 500 μm NiCl2 at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Triplicate injections of each toxin concentration were injected in random order over both surfaces, and the response was corrected by double referencing. The data were fitted using global analysis software available within Biaevaluation 3.1 (Biacore). Various concentrations of toxin were injected over both flow cells, and the response curve on flow cell 1 was subtracted from flow cell 2.Hydropathic Pattern Determination—Hydropathic profiles were generated using the computer program Hydropathie (28Boquet D. Dery O. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Couraud J.Y. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences with opposed or similar hydropathic profile in the predicted binding regions were selected for analysis. The results obtained were quantified by linear regression of hydropathic values (Kyte and Doolittle scale) for each amino acid in the sequence.Insect Bioassay—Bioassays were performed with H. virescens or M. sexta neonates using surface-treated food as reported (29Bravo A. Hendrickx S. Jansen S. Peferoen M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1992; 60: 247-254Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, one neonate larva was placed in each well with 9 ng/cm2 Cry1Ac toxin with or without competing cadherin fragments (1000-fold molar excess) and anti-cadherin antibody, and mortality was recorded after 7 days. Twelve larvae were assayed for each test, and the assays were repeated three times.RESULTSIsolation of Partial Full-length cDNA Clones Encoding the H. virescens Cadherin Protein—Two cDNA clones, Hvm-4-62 and Hvm-5-22, encoding a partial cadherin protein, were obtained during sequencing of expressed sequence tags from a H. virescens larval midgut library. To obtain a full-length clone, we then used primers based on the Hvm-5-22 sequence and vector primers to isolate another cDNA clone from this library using a limited growth technique (26Ross L.S. Gill S. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Complete sequencing of this 4.75-kb clone (pFR-CAD-partial) showed that it encoded a partial cadherin protein, which lacked 4 amino acids from the N terminus and 142 amino acids from the C terminus based on a reported sequence (18Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncation resulted from the presence of a NotI site, which was used for cDNA synthesis.Since we could not obtain a full-length cadherin clone, as indicated above, we then used PCR and 3′-RACE to obtain the rest. Since only 4 amino acids were lacking at the N terminus, we used PCR to obtain the 5′-end of the clone using sequences from the pFR-CAD-partial and a published report (18Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), which became available while this project was underway. However, since there were substantial amino acid differences between pFR-CAD-partial and the published sequence (18Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we used RACE to obtain the 3′-end. To construct a full-length cDNA, the 1040-bp 5′-PCR product and the 3860-bp 3′-RACE product were then sequentially cloned into pBluescript vector. The middle NdeI/SphI was then replaced by the NdeI/SphI fragment from the wild-type sequenced cadherin partial clone (pFR-CAD-partial) to generate a full-length H. virescens cadherin clone. Based on sequence analysis, all the cDNA clones mentioned above that encode partial or full-length proteins are from the same H. virescens cadherin transcript.The deduced amino acid sequence, 1732 amino acids, of H. virescens cadherin protein full-length clone has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY692445). This HvCad protein is 98.4% identical to that identified previously (18Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) from the same insect species. According to the cloning strategy of obtaining the full-length cDNA encoding HvCad, 243 aa from the N terminus and 235 aa from the C terminus were derived from PCR products, whereas the middle portion of 1254 aa corresponding to the 3.76-kb NdeI/SphI fragment came from the wild-type clone pFR-CAD-partial. Only 4 of the amino acid changes in the full-length clone are from PCR-derived regions, whereas the rest of the changes (22 amino acids) are present in the H. virescens cadherin gene, showing that there is substantial amino acid variation in the gene in this insect species.As with M. sexta BtR1 (9Vadlamudi R.K.

The H. virescens cadherin has 63.9 and 65.4% identity to M. sexta and B. mori cadherins, respectively. These cadherins are distantly related to classical cadherins, albeit they all contain typical cadherin repeats that imply their involvement in cell-cell adhesion. Neither integrin recognition sequence RGD/LDV nor cadherin/cadherin-binding sequence HAV that is present in M. sexta cadherin (15Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N.B. Maaty W.S. Midboe E.G. Vadlamudi R.K.

BMC Biochem. 2001; 2: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we then determined the toxin-binding region in HvCad. As the CAD0 protein (Fig. 2A) contained a predicted toxin-binding site based on previous work with B. mori (13Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28051-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we first showed that this protein bound Cry1Ac in toxin overlay assays (Fig. 2B). Further, in bioassays with neonate H. virescens and M. sexta, the CAD0 protein and an anti-CAD0 antibody (1000-fold molar excess) both attenuated Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxicity (Table I). In contrast, feeding of Cry1A toxins with preimmune serum had no effect on mortality, showing that this cadherin domain plays a role in toxicity.Fig. 2Cry1Ac toxin-binding to partial fragments of H. virescens cadherin protein. A, partial cadherin proteins and their abilities to bind Cry1Ac. The numbers refer to amino acid residues in the full-length H. virescens cadherin. A strong binding between a protein and Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac is indicated by +, a weaker binding between a protein and Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac is indicated by +/-, whereas no binding between a protein and Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac is indicated by -. Results were obtained from Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac toxin overlay assay using 40 pmol of each purified protein. The Cry1Ac toxin-binding region in H. virescens cadherin protein is mapped to aa 1422-1440. B, expression and toxin overlay assay of partial H. virescens cadherin proteins. Seven H. virescens partial cadherin fragments were generated by PCR or by using restriction sites. cDNA fragments were subcloned and expressed with N-terminal His tag in the pQE system. Purified proteins were silver-stained following SDS-15% PAGE. Each lane contains 40 pmol of purified proteins, which were separated by SDS-PAGE. A toxin overlay assay was performed using 10 nm Cry1Ac after transfer of proteins to Immobilon membranes. Toxin binding abilities was detected with 1:3000 anti-Cry1Ac antibody following the toxin overlay. Partial proteins CAD0, CAD1, CAD2, CAD3, and CAD4 bound Cry1Ac strongly, whereas CAD5 bound to toxins weakly. Protein CAD6 did not bind Cry1Ac.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IToxicity of Cry1A crystals to 1st instar larvae can be alleviated by anti-H. virescens cadherin-like protein antiserum and partial cadherin-like proteins that are involved in toxin bindingCrystalTreatmentMortalityM. sextaH. virescens%Cry1AbToxin97.4 ± 4.497.2 ± 4.8Toxin + CAD048.7 ± 2.243.4 ± 2.9Toxin + anti-CAD70.0 ± 1.368.4 ± 1.4Toxin + pre-serum97.6 ± 4.197.8 ± 3.9Cry1AcToxin98.4 ± 2.898.3 ± 2.9Toxin + CAD047.2 ± 4.845.2 ± 4.2Toxin + anti-CAD74.2 ± 1.371.5 ± 6.3Toxin + pre-serum97.4 ± 4.497.1 ± 5.1 Open table in a new tab To further delineate the toxin-binding region, a series of clones was then generated either by PCR or by suitable restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 2A). The corresponding partial proteins were expressed in E. coli M15, purified using Ni-NTA agarose, and then analyzed with Cry1Ac toxin overlay assays. As shown in Fig. 2B, proteins CAD0, CAD1, CAD2, CAD3, and CAD4 bound Cry1Ac strongly, whereas protein CAD5 bound Cry1Ac slightly weakly. Protein CAD6 did not bind to Cry1Ac. These data show that amino acids 1422-1440 are apparently important for Cry1Ac binding, but amino acid residues beyond this region may be required for stronger binding. This region, aa 1422-1440, also falls with the Cry1Ab toxin domain, aa 1364-1464, recently mapped for the Manduca sexta BtR1 receptor (17Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28051-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Further, since the small protein CAD5, which does not include these amino acid residues, aa 1422-1440, still bound Cry1Ac, it is clear that additional regions can also bind Cry1Ac, albeit with likely lower affinity.Interaction of HvCad with Loop Regions of Cry1A Toxins—Gomez et al.

https://openalex.org/W2057929164,"The plasticity of synapses within neural circuits is regulated by activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Using the dye FM1-43 to directly image presynaptic function, we found that large numbers of presynaptic terminals in hippocampal cultures have a low release probability. While these terminals were not readily modifiable, a transient but not permanent long-term reduction of network activity or Ca2+ influx could increase their modifiability. This modulation of plasticity was mediated by Ca2+ flux through NMDA and voltage-gated calcium channels and was lost within 48 hr. A more permanent enhancement of synaptic plasticity was achieved by selectively reducing the Ca2+ flux associated with uncorrelated activity via adjustment of the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of the NMDAR. Upregulation of NR2B-containing NMDARs induced by this treatment is an important but not sole contributor to the enhancement of plasticity. Thus, quantity and quality of activity have differential effects on the intrinsic plasticity of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2082175914,"Specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) is associated with virtually every mechanosensory system studied. C. elegans touch receptor neurons have specialized ECM and attach to the surrounding epidermis. The mec-1 gene encodes an ECM protein with multiple EGF and Kunitz domains. MEC-1 is needed for the accumulation of the collagen MEC-5 and other ECM components, attachment, and, separately, for touch sensitivity. MEC-1 and MEC-5 bind to touch processes uniformly and in puncta. These puncta colocalize with and localize the mechanosensory channel complex in the touch neurons. In turn, the production of the MEC-1 and MEC-5 puncta appears to rely on interactions with the neighboring epidermal tissue. These and other observations lead us to propose that extracellular, but not cytoskeletal, tethering of the degenerin channel is needed for mechanosensory transduction. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate an important role of the ECM in organizing the placement of the channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2171894932,"The tight junction of the epithelial cell determines the characteristics of paracellular permeability across epithelium. Recent work points toward the claudin family of tight junction proteins as leading candidates for the molecular components that regulate paracellular permeability properties in epithelial tissues. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) strain I and II cells are models for the study of tight junctions and based on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) contain “tight” and “leaky” tight junctions, respectively. Overexpression studies suggest that tight junction leakiness in these two strains of MDCK cells is conferred by expression of the tight junction protein claudin-2. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation by hepatocyte growth factor treatment of MDCK strain II cells inhibited claudin-2 expression and transiently increased TER. This process was blocked by the ERK 1/2 inhibitor U0126. Transfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase into MDCK strain II cells also inhibited claudin-2 expression and increased TER. MDCK strain I cells have higher levels of active ERK 1/2 than do MDCK strain II cells. U0126 treatment of MDCK strain I cells decreased active ERK 1/2 levels, induced expression of claudin-2 protein, and decreased TER by ∼20-fold. U0126 treatment also induced claudin-2 expression and decreased TER in a high resistance mouse cortical collecting duct cell line (94D). These data show for the first time that the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway negatively controls claudin-2 expression in mammalian renal epithelial cells and provide evidence for regulation of tight junction paracellular transport by alterations in claudin composition within tight junction complexes.

Epithelial tissues serve as selective permeability barriers, separating fluid compartments with very different chemical compositions. Specific substrates may cross the epithelial cell layers by two mechanisms, the transcellular route and the paracellular route (movement between adjacent cells). Trans-cellular transport is catalyzed by carrier-mediated proteins on the apical and basolateral membrane surfaces and represents a very important focus of research in epithelial cell physiology. Much less is known about the mechanisms regulating paracellular transport. The tight junctions in renal epithelium (as well as other mammalian epithelial organs) mediate this barrier role and seal cells together in a way that impedes the paracellular leakage of small molecules. Tight junctions are located at the most apical aspect of the lateral membranes of epithelial cells and function as the primary barrier to the diffusion of small molecules through the paracellular pathway (1Gumbiner B.M.

Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Two strains of MDCK cells have been established, MDCK strain I and II cells. These two established strains of MDCK cells show functional and biochemical differences including a marked disparity in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) possibly related to their derivation from different tubular segments in the kidney (9Richardson J.C. Scalera V. Simmons N.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Fuller S.D. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). MDCK strain I cells show much higher (10- to 100-fold) TER than MDCK strain II cells (11Stevenson B.R. Anderson J.M. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). MDCK strain I cells thus represent a “tight” epithelium whereas MDCK strain II cells are thought to represent a “leaky” epithelium. The differences between TER in MDCK strain I and II cells appear to be caused by claudin-2 expression with only MDCK strain II cells expressing claudin-2. Both MDCK strain I and II cells express tight junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 as well as ZO-1 and occludin (12Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDCK strain I cells have been converted to a leaky epithelium through the introduction of exogenous claudin-2 cDNA into MDCK strain I cells (12Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Claudin-2 appears to confer increased permeability in renal epithelial cells. In the kidney, claudin-2 expression is restricted to leaky epithelium in the proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle and is absent in the remaining distal nephron which is considered to be a tight epithelium (13Enck A.H. Berger U.V. Yu A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F966-F974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kiuchi-Saishin Y. Gotoh S. Furuse M. Takasuga A. Tano Y. Tsukita S. J. Am. Soc.

Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 476-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Exogenous claudin-2 expression in MDCK-C7 cells (a twin to MDCK strain I cells) also induces cation-selective channels in the tight junctions (16Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schoneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). We previously showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) alters the polarity and abrogates contact inhibition of mitosis in MDCK cells (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3471-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Balkovetz D.F.

Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We then identified the early HGF-induced genomic responses of polarized MDCK strain II cell monolayers using a newly available canine DNA microarray, which we described and validated (20Balkovetz D.F. Gerrard Jr., E.R. Li S. Johnson D. Lee J. Tobias J.W. Rogers K.K. Snyder R.W. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F702-F710Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Of the 12,473 gene sequences on the canine microarray, the microarray identified 117 genes not previously known to be involved in the HGF pathway, at least in the context of MDCK strain II cells grown in monolayer. One of the most dramatic changes in gene expression in MDCK strain II cells following 24 h of HGF stimulation was a 23.8-fold reduction in claudin-2 gene expression (20Balkovetz D.F. Gerrard Jr., E.R. Li S. Johnson D. Lee J. Tobias J.W. Rogers K.K. Snyder R.W. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F702-F710Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also recently showed that HGF increased phospho-ERK 1/2 (active ERK 1/2) levels in MDCK strain II cells (19Li S. Gerrard E.R. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that MDCK strain I cells might have undetectable levels of claudin-2 because of relatively higher levels of active ERK 1/2. Here we demonstrate that the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway is a negative regulator of claudin-2 expression in dog and mouse renal epithelial cells with concomitant effects on tight junction permeability and renal epithelial function. Cell Culture and Transfection—Low passage MDCK strain I and II cells were used between passages 3 and 10. Cells were cultured as described previously (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J.

The plasmids encoding constitutively active MEK1 (S218E/S222E) and dominant negative MEK1 (S218A/S222A) were kindly provided by Dr. Kun-Liang Guan (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) (22Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and have in the past been successfully transfected into MDCK cells (23Liang C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21146-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For transient transfections of constitutively active MEK1 and dominant negative MEK1, MDCK strain II cells were plated at confluency on Transwell filters. 14 h after plating, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid encoding constitutively active MEK1 or dominant negative MEK1 using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 h later, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. TER was measured and cell lysates were prepared 24 after transfection. 94D mouse cortical collecting duct cell line was developed and maintained as described previously (24Yoder B.K. Tousson A. Millican L. Wu J.H. Bugg Jr., C.E. Schafer J.A. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; : F541-F552Google Scholar). All renal cell lines were plated at confluency on Transwell filter units (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with pore size of 0.4 μm. R. Schwall generously provided recombinant human HGF (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). U0126 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3471-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For tight junction protein analysis, filters were probed with primary antibodies of interest (rabbit-anti-claudin-1, 1:250; rabbit-anti-claudin-2, 1:250; rabbit-anti-claudin-3, 1:500; mouse-anti-claudin-4, 1:200, mouse-anti-ZO-1, 1:500; rabbit-anti-occludin, 1:1000) (all primary antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Filters were then probed with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (1:5000 for claudins-1–4, and 7; 1:25,000 for occludin; and 1:5000 for ZO-1). For total ERK analysis, filters were probed with goat-anti-ERK1 polyclonal IgG (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This antibody recognizes both ERK 1 and 2 in MDCK cell lysates. Filters were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-goat at 1:5000 dilution. For active ERK (mitogen activated protein kinase) analysis, filters were probed with phospho-p44/42(ERK 1/2) mitogen activated protein kinase antibody (1:10,000) (Cell Signaling Technologies). Filters were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit at 1:5000 dilution. Filters were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and visualized on Kodak X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co.). All Western blot experiments were performed at least three times. Representative data are presented under “Results.” Immunofluorescent Labeling of Cells—MDCK strain I and II cells were grown on 6.5-mm-diameter Costar transwell filters with 0.4-μm pores and labeled as described previously (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3471-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to primary antibodies (rabbit-anti-claudin-2 (1:500), rabbit-anti-claudin-3 (1:500), mouse-anti-claudin-4 (1:500), rabbit-anti-claudin-7 (1:500), mouse-anti-ZO-1 (1:100), and rabbit-anti-occludin (1:250), all from Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunofluorescent images were obtained with a Leica fluorescence microscope with a PL APO 40 × 1.25 NA objective lens equipped with a Hamamatsu C5810 digital camera. The generated photomicrographs were captured and labeled using Adobe Photoshop. All immunofluorescent experiments were performed at least three times. Representative data are presented under “Results.” Measurement of Transepithelial Electrical Resistance—For TER experiments, MDCK strain I and II and 94D cell monolayers were grown on 12-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size filters, and electrical resistance was measured with the EVOM electrical resistance system (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT). All TER experiments were performed at least three times. Representative data are present under “Results.” The TER results are expressed as the measured resistance in ohms multiplied by the area of the filter (1 cm2) ± S.D. Real-time PCR—Fifteen micrograms of total RNA collected from MDCK strain I cells grown for 4 days on Transwell filters and exposed to 1 and 3 h of U0126 (10 μm) were converted to first-strand cDNA. cDNA and the TaqMan primer/probe system, designed to specifically recognize claudin-2 cDNA, were used in conjunction with the 7700 PRISM Sequence Detection Instrument (both Applied Biosystems) as described in the Applied Biosystems technical manual. When the reaction product amplification exceeded the threshold value (denoted by the solid line in Fig. 6), the corresponding cycle number was termed CT (arrows). -Fold change between conditions was calculated through an exponential function of the observed difference in CT as described previously (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124877) Google Scholar). The values were normalized to a control mRNA, the 18 S ribosome, and all real-time PCR studies were performed in triplicate. ERK 1/2 Activation by Hepatocyte Growth Factor Inhibits Claudin-2 Expression in MDCK Strain II Cells—When polarized monolayers of MDCK strain II cells are treated with HGF for 24 h, claudin-2 gene expression decreases 23.8-fold and claudin-2 protein levels drop below the level of detection by Western blot (20Balkovetz D.F. Gerrard Jr., E.R. Li S. Johnson D. Lee J. Tobias J.W. Rogers K.K. Snyder R.W. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F702-F710Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of HGF treatment on the expression of claudin-2 and other tight junction associated proteins expressed in MDCK strain II cells. MDCK II cell monolayers were exposed to HGF (100 ng/ml) for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Following HGF treatment, cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against known tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1, and claudins 1–4, 7) in MDCK II cells (Fig. 1A). HGF treatment of MDCK cells dramatically decreased the levels of claudin-2 protein. The decrease in claudin-2 expression was detectable after 6 h of HGF treatment. There was also a slight decrease in claudin-1 levels after 24 h HGF treatment. Occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-7 protein expression were not changed by 24 h HGF treatment. Tight junction-associated proteins in control and HGF treated MDCK II monolayers were also evaluated using immunofluorescent microscopy. MDCK II monolayers were treated with fresh medium containing recombinant HGF (100 ng/ml) or fresh medium alone for 24 h and were then labeled for individual tight junction proteins (Fig. 1B). The morphology of the tight junction is altered by HGF treatment. As previously reported, HGF treatment changes cell morphology of MDCK II cells; these changes also include alterations of cell polarity and pseudostratification (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3471-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Pollack A.L. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C482-C494Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After 24 h of HGF treatment, junctional labeling of claudin-2 was qualitatively decreased. Junctional labeling of claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-7, as well as ZO-1 and occludin were still observed following HGF treatment. We previously showed that HGF treatment of MDCK strain II cells induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation by a pathway that is blocked by the ERK 1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 and that U0126 is a significantly more potent inhibitor of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in MDCK II cells than PD98059 (19Li S. Gerrard E.R. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The role of HGF-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in inhibition of claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain II cells was tested using U0126 (10 μm). At this concentration ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was shown to be effectively inhibited (19Li S. Gerrard E.R. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis demonstrated that U0126 inhibition of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation reversed the HGF-mediated down-regulation of claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain II cells (Fig. 1C). Occludin expression was not influenced by HGF and/or U0126 treatment (Fig. 1C). U0126 Inhibits the HGF-mediated Increase in TER in MDCK II Cells—Next we examined the functional effect of U0126 treatment on the HGF-mediated increase in TER. Recombinant HGF, in the absence and presence of 10 μm U0126, was added to MDCK strain II cells. In the presence of U0126, no HGF-mediated increase in TER was seen (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that HGF is able to increase TER and that U0126 inhibits this process. The HGF-induced increase in TER was transient, returning to baseline after 48 h HGF treatment with continued suppression of claudin-2 expression (data not shown and Ref. 26Pollack A.L. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C482-C494Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine further whether activation of ERK leads to inhibition of claudin-2 expression and higher TER values, constitutively active MEK was expressed in MDCK strain II cells (Fig. 3). As expected, the expression of constitutively active MEK resulted in ERK activation, inhibition of claudin-2 expression, and elevated TER values. Expression of dominant negative MEK in MDCK strain II cells did not change claudin-2 expression or TER values. Taken collectively, these data provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that ERK 1/2 activation in leaky renal epithelia inhibits claudin-2 expression in the tight junction and inhibits paracellular permeability. HGF treatment of high resistance MDCK strain I cells over a 24-h period did not alter TER (data not shown). MDCK Strain I Cells Express Relatively Higher Levels of Phospho-ERK 1/2 and Lower Levels of Claudin-2 Than MDCK Strain II Cells—We compared relative amounts of claudin-2, phospho-ERK 1/2, and ERK 1/2 in confluent monolayers of polarized MDCK strain I and II cells grown on permeant supports. MDCK strain I cells possessed much higher levels of phospho-ERK 1/2 than did strain II cells and did not express claudin-2 (Fig. 4). Because MDCK strain II cells have relatively low baseline levels of phospho-ERK 1/2, high levels of claudin-2, and inhibition of claudin-2 expression following ERK phosphorylation by HGF treatment, we had hypothesized that MDCK strain I cells might have low (undetectable) levels of claudin-2 because of relatively higher levels of phospho-ERK 1/2 under basal conditions. U0126 Treatment of MDCK Strain I Cells Inhibits ERK Phosphorylation and Induces Rapid Expression of Endogenous Claudin-2 Protein—To test if low levels of claudin-2 in MDCK strain I cells were dependent on relatively higher levels of active ERK 1/2, we examined the effect of U0126 treatment on phospho-ERK 1/2 and claudin-2 expression. U0126 at a concentration of 10 μm completely inhibited HGF-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in MDCK strain II cells (19Li S. Gerrard E.R. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of MDCK strain I cells showed no claudin-2 at baseline with a dramatic increase in claudin-2 protein expression observed as early as 15 min after treatment with U0126 (10 μm) (Fig. 5A). An equally dramatic decrease in phospho-ERK 1/2 expression was seen over the same time course following U0126 treatment (Fig. 5A). Western blot also showed that U0126 reduced claudin-3 and claudin-7 to below basal levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that newly expressed claudin-2 co-localized with the tight junction protein ZO-1 in MDCK strain I cells treated with U0126 (120 min) (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, after 15 min of U0126 treatment, the MDCK strain I cell monolayers demonstrated a dramatic decrease in TER (Fig. 5C). With U0126 treatment periods extending to 24 h, the TER dropped to the range of 200 ohms per cm2. This TER reading observed in strain I cells treated with U0126 for 24 h was nearly identical to that observed in MDCK strain II cells under basal conditions. The data are consistent with the previous report that claudin-2 is capable of making MDCK strain I cells relatively leaky (12Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Treatment of MDCK strain II cells with U0126 alone did not affect claudin-2 expression or TER in the cells (Figs. 1C and 2). Table I summarizes the baseline characteristics of MDCK strain I and II cells with respect to TER, ERK 1/2 activity, and claudin-2 expression and the change in these parameters under conditions of ERK 1/2 activation by HGF and inhibition by U0126.Table ISummary of data on claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain I and II cells Up arrows signify relative increase; down arrows signify relative decrease.CharacteristicMDCK strain IMDCK strain IIBaseline TER∼400 Ω∼100 ΩBase-line claudin-2 proteinNoneAbundantBase-line ERK 1/2 activityHighLowEffect of ERK 1/2 activation on claudin-2 proteinNo change↓↓↓Effect of ERK 1/2 activation on TERNo changeTransient increaseEffect of ERK 1/2 inhibition on claudin-2 protein↑↑↑No changeEffect of ERK 1/2 inhibition on TER↓↓↓No change Open table in a new tab De Novo Protein and RNA Synthesis Are Required for U0126-induced Claudin-2 Accumulation in MDCK Strain I Cells—To gain more information about the mechanism for U0126-induced claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain I cells, we tested the effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on this process. When added to the culture medium to block new RNA or protein synthesis, respectively, actinomycin D (2.5 μg/ml) inhibits incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA by 99%, and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) blocks incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein by 85% over the course of 6 h in MDCK cells (27Lieske J.C. Huang E. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F130-F137PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK strain I monolayers were pretreated with vehicle (control), cycloheximide (1 μg/ml), or actinomycin D (2.5 μg/ml) for 3 h prior to treatment with U0126 for 1 h. Fig. 5D illustrates that U0126 induced expression of claudin-2 and that actinomycin D completely inhibited and cycloheximide partially inhibited this process. These data suggest that both gene transcription and protein synthesis are involved in the U0126 mediated changes in claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain I cells, and rule out a purely post-translational mechanism, which we had considered given the rapidity of the increase in claudin-2 expression (i.e. within 15 min of U0126 treatment). Real-time PCR Targeting Claudin-2 in MDCK Strain I Cells—To determine whether the U0126 stimulated increase in claudin-2 protein in MDCK strain I cells was occurring at the level of gene transcription, real-time PCR analysis of RNA isolated from control MDCK strain I cells and cells treated with U0126 for 1 and 3 h was performed. These time points were chosen with the intention of demonstrating increased claudin-2 mRNA levels following U0126 treatment. The RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified using the TaqMan primer/probe fluorescence assay on a 7700 PRISM instrument (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe were designed to specifically recognize claudin-2 cDNA. Minimal or no claudin-2 mRNA could be detected in the control MDCK strain I cells. A 12-fold increase in claudin-2 mRNA expression was observed in cells treated with U0126 for 1 h compared with 3 h with U0126 (Fig. 6). These data provide evidence that U0126 treatment of MDCK strain I cells causes a rapid increase in claudin-2 gene transcription. Our previous work using a canine microarray showed that 24-h HGF treatment of MDCK strain II cells caused a 24-fold reduction in claudin-2 mRNA (20Balkovetz D.F. Gerrard Jr., E.R. Li S. Johnson D. Lee J. Tobias J.W. Rogers K.K. Snyder R.W. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F702-F710Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For a summary of the data presented to this point please see Table I, which lists the baseline characteristics of MDCK strain I and II cells with respect to TER, ERK 1/2 activity, and claudin-2 expression, and the change in these parameters under conditions of ERK 1/2 activation by HGF and inhibition by U0126. Actinomycin D's complete inhibition of U0126 induced claudin-2 expression in combination with the real-time PCR data provide evidence that gene transcription plays a central role in this process. A High Resistance Mouse Cortical Collecting Duct Cell Line Expresses Claudin-2 in Response to U0126 Treatment—To investigate if the data reported above were specific to MDCK cells or more generalized, the effect of U0126 on a high resistance mouse renal collecting duct cell line was studied. We previously generated a cortical collecting duct cell line from orpk mutant mice (24Yoder B.K. Tousson A. Millican L. Wu J.H. Bugg Jr., C.E. Schafer J.A. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; : F541-F552Google Scholar). These cells have been rescued by transfection of the defective orpk gene and are referred to as 94D cells. These cells form polarized monolayers with TER in the 4,000 ohms per cm2 range. Because of their high TER values, we predicted that the 94D cells would express little or no claudin-2 and would respond to U0126 by producing claudin-2. 94D cell monolayers were grown on permeable supports for 4 days and treated with U0126 for different time periods. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for phospho-ERK 1/2, total ERK, and claudin-1 and claudin-2 expression (Fig. 7A). 94D cell lysates expressed phospho-ERK 1/2, and the phospho-ERK 1/2 levels were inhibited by U0126. At baseline, claudin-2 protein was not detected in the 94D cell lysates; however, a dramatic increase in claudin-2 protein expression was detected within 15–30 min following U0126 treatment. Claudin-1 levels were not changed by U0126 treatment. The effects following U0126 treatment on TER in 94D cells were then examined. In the absence of U0126 treatment the 94D cells exhibited relatively high TER of approximately 4,000 ohms per cm2. Following U0126 treatment the TER rapidly dropped in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 7B). After 120 min of U0126 treatment, the 94D cells demonstrated TER values that were similar to those observed in MDCK strain II cells. These data are consistent with findings in MDCK strain I cells and provide evidence that ERK 1/2 regulation of claudin-2 in renal epithelia crosses mammalian species. MDCK strain I and II cells, which express tight and leaky tight junctions, respectively, provide an excellent model system to investigate the determinants of tight junction permeability (11Stevenson B.R. Anderson J.M. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using this model system, we demonstrated that claudin-2 expression correlates with TER in MDCK cells. Stimulation of claudin-2 expression in canine MDCK strain I and mouse 94D cells decreased the TER value to that seen in MDCK strain II cells, which abundantly express claudin-2. The data presented here show for the first time that MDCK strain I cells can produce endogenous claudin-2 following inhibition of ERK 1/2 activity. Conversely, endogenous claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain II cells is inhibited by ERK 1/2 activation. Collectively, the data presented here are congruent with the results of transfection studies demonstrating that claudin-2 overexpression confers a leaky tight junction phenotype in MDCK cells (12Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 16Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schoneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate for the first time that differential ERK 1/2 activity accounts for the differences in claudin-2 expression in renal epithelial cells. These data provide evidence that tight junctions are dynamic organelles that can rapidly be converted from tight to leaky and vice versa by biological signaling cascades. The results described here are consistent with another study showing that epidermal growth factor stimulation (which also activates ERK 1/2) inhibits claudin-2 expression (28Singh A.B. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3543-3552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The present data, however, are not congruent with those of Kinugasa et al. (29Kinugasa T.

These investigators provided evidence that ERK signal transduction pathway activation increased the expression of claudin-2 in T84 intestinal epithelial cells using the ERK inhibitor PD98059. The differences in ERK regulation of claudin-2 expression in the present study and that of the Kinugasa study may be caused by tissue-specific differences (renal versus intestinal). The induction of claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain I and 94D cells following ERK 1/2 inhibition is temporally associated with dramatic changes in TER. We cannot exclude the possibility that U0126-induced decreases in claudin-3 and claudin-7 expression also influence TER in MDCK strain I cells; however, Furuse et al. (12Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) reported a lack of claudin-3 expression in MDCK strain I cells and found that expression of claudin-3 in the same cells did not influence TER. Li et al. (30Li W.Y. Huey C.L. Yu A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1063-F1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have recently reported that claudin-7 localizes to the basolateral surface of the aldosterone sensitive regions of the distal nephron. Another study reported that claudin-7 mRNA is found exclusively in the proximal segment of the nephron (15Reyes J.L. Lamas M. del Martin D. Carmen Namorado M. Islas S. Luna J. Tauc M. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 476-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Claudin-2 appears to confer relatively increased permeability in renal epithelial cells. In the kidney, claudin-2 expression is restricted to leaky epithelium in the proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle and is absent in the remaining distal nephron which is considered to be a tight epithelium (13Enck A.H. Berger U.V. Yu A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F966-F974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kiuchi-Saishin Y. Gotoh S. Furuse M. Takasuga A. Tano Y. Tsukita S. J. Am. Soc.

A recent abstract has reported that disruption of claudin-2 gene converts the proximal tubule from a leaky to a tight epithelium (31Muto S. Hata M. Taniguchi J. Tsuruoka S. Saitou M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Fujimura A. Imai M. Kusano E. Tsukita S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 4AGoogle Scholar). It is not known if claudin-2 expression in the kidney is a static or dynamic process. The findings presented here suggest that claudin-2 expression in the kidney may be a dynamic process and paracellular permeability in the different nephron segments can be modulated by biological agents that modulate the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. Other claudin molecules also appear to be important in paracellular transport. In addition to decreasing TER, exogenous claudin-2 expression in MDCK-C7 cells (a twin to MDCK strain I cells) also induces cation-selective channels in the tight junctions (16Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schoneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Claudin-1 over-expression in MDCK cells increases TER by 4-fold and reduces the paracellular flux of dextran molecules (32Inai T. Kobayashi J. Shibata Y. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Claudin-1 deficient mice die within 1 day of birth because of transdermal water loss (33Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Human claudin-16 mutations cause familial hypercalciuric hypomagnesemia. The claudin-16 mutation causes a defect in resorption of magnesium in the thick ascending limb of the renal tubule and renal magnesium wasting (4Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E.

Another study has shown that overexpression of claudin-8 in MDCK cells strengthens the paracellular barrier to mono- and divalent cations, but not anions or neutral solutes (3Yu A.S. Enck A.H. Lencer W.I. Schneeberger E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The inhibition of claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain II cells induced only a modest increase in TER. Despite the inhibition of claudin-2 expression, the TER increase in MDCK strain II cells never approached TER values seen in claudin-2 deficient MDCK strain I cells. We suspect that this modest change in TER of MDCK strain II cells with inhibition of claudin-2 expression is related to the other complex biological effects of HGF. These effects include inhibition of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion and initiation of cell dedifferentiation and proliferation (17Balkovetz D.F. Pollack A.L. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3471-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Balkovetz D.F.

Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 910-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, more specific activation of ERK 1/2 by transient transfection of dominant negative MEK1 results in a more dramatic increase in TER as well as inhibition of claudin-2 expression. A major question resulting from this work is why are there differences in basal ERK 1/2 activities in MDCK strain I and II cells? Moreover, the present results suggest that the distal segments of the nephron (which lack claudin-2) might have increased levels of basal ERK 1/2 activity. As predicted from the present findings, a recent investigation has documented that in normal human kidney, active ERK 1/2 is largely restricted to the cytoplasm of the collecting duct (distal nephron segment) (34Masaki T. Stambe C. Hill P.A. Dowling J. Atkins R.C. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings lead to speculation that tight junctions in vivo might be regulated in part by the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. We have recently reported that cell contact in MDCK strain II cells inhibits ERK 1/2 (19Li S. Gerrard E.R. Balkovetz D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Perhaps the mechanism controlling this process is absent in MDCK strain I and 94D cells? We are currently investigating the regulation of ERK 1/2 activity in MDCK strain I cells. In summary, these data demonstrate that the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway is a negative regulator of claudin-2 expression in renal epithelial cells. MDCK strain I cells have relatively high levels of active ERK 1/2, undetectable levels of claudin-2, and high TER in contrast to MDCK strain II cells which have low levels of active ERK 1/2, high levels of claudin-2, and low TER. Inhibition of ERK 1/2 by U0126 induces claudin-2 expression in MDCK strain I cells and is associated with a dramatic decrease in TER. Activation of ERK 1/2 in MDCK II cells inhibits claudin-2 expression. Importantly, this phenomenon was not limited to MDCK cells as the effect of ERK 1/2 inhibition was also observed in a high resistance mouse cortical collecting duct cell line. These results provide evidence that tight junction permeability and paracellular transport can be rapidly changed through a cell signaling pathway that alters the composition of claudins within the tight junction complex.

To identify molecules that bind noncovalently to SUMO-1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with a SUMO-1 mutant that cannot be conjugated to target proteins as the bait. This screening resulted in the isolation of cDNAs encoding the b isoform of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDGb). A deletion mutant of TDGb (TDGb(Δ11)) that lacks a region shown to be required for noncovalent binding of SUMO-1 was also found not to be susceptible to SUMO-1 conjugation at an adjacent lysine residue, suggesting that such binding is required for covalent modification. In contrast, another mutant of TDGb (TDGb(KR)) in which the lysine residue targeted for SUMO-1 conjugation is replaced with arginine retained the ability to bind SUMO-1 non-covalently. TDGb was shown to interact with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vitro as well as to colocalize with this protein to nuclear bodies in transfected cells. TDGb(KR) also colocalized with PML, whereas TDGb(Δ11) did not, indicating that the noncovalent SUMO-1 binding activity of TDGb is required for colocalization with PML. Furthermore, SUMO-1 modification of TDGb and PML enhanced the interaction between the two proteins. These results suggest that SUMO-1 functions to tether proteins to PML-containing nuclear bodies through post-translational modification and noncovalent protein-protein interaction.

These results suggest that SUMO-1 functions to tether proteins to PML-containing nuclear bodies through post-translational modification and noncovalent protein-protein interaction. Post-translational modification of proteins plays important roles in the regulation of protein function and localization. Proteins are chemically modified by various molecules, including phosphate, lipids, and sugars. Modification by ubiquitin is distinct in that the modifier itself is a small protein. Ubiquitin is usually attached to a lysine residue of target proteins, resulting in the formation of a branched isopeptide chain. Such ubiquitylation serves to mark proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. SUMO-1 is a member of the ubiquitin-like protein superfamily and is post-translationally conjugated to various cellular proteins in a process that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitylation. SUMO-1 modification is mediated by a SUMO-1-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, SUMO-1-activating enzyme; E2, SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme; E3, SUMO-1-protein isopeptide ligase; RARα, retinoic acid receptor α; NB, nuclear body; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BER, base excision repair; RXRα, retinoid X receptor α; PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein. a SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a SUMO-1 ligase (E3) (1Jackson P.K.

SUMO-1 is attached to target proteins via an isopeptide bond between the COOH-terminal glycine residue of SUMO-1 and the ϵ-amino group of a target lysine residue. A single E1 enzyme (the Aos1-Uba2 heterodimer) and a single E2 enzyme (Ubc9) have been identified for the SUMO-1 modification pathway in yeast and higher eukaryotes (2Muller S. Hoege C.

However, several E3-like factors (PIAS family, RanBP2, PC2) for SUMO-1 modification were recently identified in yeast and mammalian cells (7Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

SUMO-1 modification has multiple roles in protein localization and stabilization, transcriptional regulation, and maintenance of genomic integrity (11Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Conjugation of RanGAP1 with SUMO-1 results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nuclear pore complex, where it associates with RanBP2. This interaction requires SUMO-1 modification of RanGAP1 (5Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In the case of IκBα, the lysine residue modified by SUMO-1 is also modified by ubiquitin, and SUMO-1 modification stabilizes IκBα by blocking its ubiquitylation (4Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Various transcription factors are modified by SUMO-1, with SUMO-1 modification correlating with attenuation of transactivation activity in most instances, as has been demonstrated for the androgen receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor, Sp3, Myb, and C/EBP. Transcription factors such as p53, HSF1, and HSF2 are activated by SUMO-1 modification (11Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The t(15;17) chromosomal translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia in humans results in fusion of the PML gene with that for retinoic acid receptor α (RARα). PML belongs to the family of RING-B box-coiled coil proteins and localizes to subnuclear structures known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs) (19Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). PML organizes and is essential for the formation of these structures (20Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of functions, including transcriptional regulation (21Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), DNA repair (especially repair of double-strand breaks) (22Carbone R. Pearson M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and interferon-induced antiviral defense (23Regad T. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7274-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) have been suggested for PML NBs. Many proteins, including transcription factors, their regulators, and DNA repair proteins have been detected in these structures (21Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PML appears to be responsible for targeting proteins such as Sp100, CBP, and Daxx to NBs (20Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PML contains three lysine residues that are modified by SUMO-1 (24Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and many NB-associated proteins also appear to be covalently modified by SUMO-1 (21Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1 modification of PML plays an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of NBs. Thus, PML modified by SUMO-1 is localized to NBs, whereas the unmodified protein is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm. Other NB-associated proteins are mislocalized in PML-deficient cells and exogenous PML restores their localization to NBs (20Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitylated proteins are recognized by effector molecules that function as receptors for ubiquitin. These effectors include S5a, Rad23, and Vps9, all of which possess ubiquitin binding domains (UBA, UEV, UIM, CUE) (25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The S5a subunit of the 19 S proteasome thus recognizes polyubiquitin chains and guides ubiquitylated proteins into the 20 S proteasome for degradation (26Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, molecules or motifs that interact physiologically with SUMO-1 in a noncovalent manner have not been identified to date. Such molecules or motifs, if found to exist, might be expected to play important roles in SUMO-1 function, however. To identify proteins that might recognize SUMO-1 but are not necessarily modified by SUMO-1, we have now performed yeast two-hybrid screening with a form of SUMO-1 that lacks the COOH-terminal glycine residue and therefore cannot be conjugated to target proteins (28Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This screening resulted in the isolation of cDNAs for thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), an enzyme that functions in base excision repair of DNA damage (30Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). TDG initiates the repair of G:U or G:T mismatched base pairs that result from spontaneous deamination of cytosine or methylated cytosine (30Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 31Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33449-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We also show that TDG not only binds noncovalently to, but is also covalently modified by, SUMO-1. TDG was found to bind to PML in vitro and colocalized with PML in NBs. Furthermore, the noncovalent SUMO-1 binding activity of TDG was required for its localization to NBs. Finally, we show that SUMO-1 modification of TDGb and PML enhances the interaction between the two proteins. We thus propose that SUMO-1 functions as a molecular glue to mediate the noncovalent interaction between TDG and PML and thereby plays an important role in the colocalization of TDG with PML in NBs. Cell Culture—HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Construction of Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis— Complementary DNA encoding SUMO(ΔGG), which lacks the two tandem glycine residues at the COOH terminus of processed SUMO-1, was generated by PCR with pGEX-SUMO-1 GG (32Saitoh H.

The cloning site was selected so as to yield either DBD-SUMO(ΔGG), in which SUMO(ΔGG) is fused to the COOH terminus of the DNA binding domain of LexA encoded by pBTM116, or SUMO(ΔGG)-DBD, in which SUMO(ΔGG) is fused to the NH2 terminus of the DNA binding domain of LexA. The cDNAs for the TDGb derivatives FL, N-1, N-2, N-3, C-1, and C-2 (see Fig. 1) were generated by PCR and cloned into pACT2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or pGEX6P (Amersham Biosciences). The TDGb(KR) plasmids pcDNA3-TDGb(KR) and pACT2-TDGb(KR) were generated by replacing the codon for Lys317 of TDGb with an Arg codon with the use of a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To generate the TDGb(Δ11) mutant, we performed PCR with pACT2 or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the full-length TDGb cDNA as the template and either with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning proximal to the SUMO-1 binding region (amino acids 305 to 315), or with a sense primer beginning distal to the SUMO-1 binding region and an antisense primer beginning at the stop codon. Both amplified products were mixed and subjected to a second PCR with a sense primer beginning at the start codon and an antisense primer beginning at the stop codon. The final PCR product was cloned into pACT2. Complementary DNAs for TDGb derivatives (FL, KR, and Δ11) tagged at their NH2 termini with the Myc epitope were generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 for transfection experiments or into pET30 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for the production of recombinant proteins.

Baculoviruses encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of Uba2 and hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Aos1 were kindly provided by H. Yasuda (Tokyo University). The cDNA for human PML isoform IVa (19Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from human liver cDNA (Clontech) with Taq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and with the primers 5′-CTTCACGCACTCCAAGAT-3′ and 5′-AAGCCAGCAAATGACACG-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), and its sequence was verified. The PML cDNA was then subcloned from pBluescript SK+ into pCGN-HA (36Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.I.

A cDNA for the hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged mutant PML(3KR) was generated by replacing the codons for Lys65, Lys160, and Lys442 with Arg codons with the use of a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The SUMO(ΔGG) cDNA subcloned into pBTM116 (encoding the DNA binding domain of LexA) was used as a bait in the MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System (Clontech). Yeast strain L40 cells (MATaLYS2:lexA-HIS3 URA:lexA-lacZ trp1 leu2 his3) (Invitrogen) were sequentially transformed with pBTM116-SUMO(ΔGG) and a cDNA library (mouse T or B cell or human brain) constructed in pACT2 (encoding the GAL4 activation domain). Approximately 5 × 106 cDNA clones were screened. Transformed L40 cells were grown on agar plates containing a synthetic “dropout” medium without leucine, tryptophan, histidine, lysine, and uracil but containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Colonies that grew on the selection medium were transferred to a filter and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with the substrate X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive clones and used together with the bait plasmid to transform yeast cells to confirm binding (37Hatakeyama S. Matsumoto M. Yada M. Nakayama K.I. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Proteins in Bacteria—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue cultured in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with the use of a French press, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the resulting supernatant, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with PBS, and GST fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys(S) (Novagen) also incubated in the presence of 1mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were purified with the use of ProBond resin (Invitrogen). The purity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). Baculovirus Expression System—Baculoviruses were generated in Sf21 cells with the use of Bacmid virus DNA and pFASTBAC (Invitrogen) containing the relevant cDNA. The recombinant proteins were purified from Sf21 cell lysates according to the protocol described below for lysis and immunoprecipitation in transfected cells. The plasmids pFASTBAC HTa or HTb containing the relevant cDNAs were subjected to recombination with the baculoviral genome in DH10BAC, and the resulting recombinant viral genomes were introduced into Sf21 cells by transfection to generate recombinant baculoviruses. Infected Sf21 cells were lysed and the recombinant proteins were purified by the protocol described for bacterially expressed His6-tagged proteins. The purified recombinant proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h, the cells were lysed with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C either with mouse monoclonal antibodies to the Myc epitope (1 μg/μl, 9E10; Covance, Berkeley, CA) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) or with mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA (0.5 μg/μl, HA.11/16B12; Babco, Richmond, CA) conjugated to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with mouse monoclonal antibodies to Myc (1 μg/ml, 9E10), FLAG epitope (1 μg/ml; M5, Sigma), SUMO-1 (2 μg/ml, anti-GMP-1; Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), or HA (1 μg/ml, HA.11/16B12). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin (Promega, Madison, WI) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation and subsequently prepared for immunostaining. In brief, the cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature first with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (1 μg/ml, 9E10) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin and then with Alexa 488-labeled goat polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:2000. The cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature first with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HA (1 μg/ml, Y11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin and then with Alexa 546-labeled goat polyclonal antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:2000. They were finally stained with Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Osaka, Japan), covered with a drop of GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and examined with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). In Vitro SUMO-1 Modification Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 1 μg of His6-Myc-STAT3, His6-Myc-TDGb, His6-Myc-TDGb(KR), His6-Myc-TDGb(Δ11), or GST-Ran-GAP1-C2 as the substrate as well as 1 μg of E1 (GST-Uba2, His6-Aos1), 2 μg of E2 (Ubc9), and 1 μg of SUMO-1 in a solution comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C (38Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heating at 88 °C for 5 min. Samples were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with mouse monoclonal antibodies to SUMO-1 (2 μg/ml, anti-GMP-1), Myc (1 μg/ml, 9E10), or GST (1 μg/ml; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin. In Vitro Binding Assay—Recombinant proteins (1 μg of His6-HA-SUMO-1; 0.1 μg each of His6-Myc-STAT3, His6-Myc-TDGb, His6-Myc-TDGb(KR), or His6-Myc-TDGb(Δ11)) were mixed at 4 °C in 100 μl of a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 0.1% Triton X-100. The binding mixtures were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA (0.5 μg/μl, HA.11/16B12), and the resulting precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Myc (1 μg/ml, 9E10) or HA (1 μg/ml, HA.11/16B12). Alternatively, recombinant proteins (1 μg each of His6-PML, His6-Myc-TDGb, or His6-Myc-TDGb-SUMO-1 (prepared by in vitro SUMO-1 modification of His6-Myc-TDGb)) were mixed at 4 °C in 100 μl of a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 0.5% Triton X-100. The binding mixtures were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal antibodies to PML (PG-M3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the resulting precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Myc (1 μg/ml, 9E10) or PML (1 μg/ml, PG-M3). Identification of Proteins That Bind SUMO-1 Noncovalently by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To identify proteins that bind SUMO-1 noncovalently, we constructed a SUMO-1 mutant, SUMO(ΔGG), that lacks the two tandem glycine residues at the COOH terminus and therefore cannot be conjugated to target proteins (28Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of LexA was fused to either the NH2 or COOH terminus of SUMO(ΔGG), yielding DBD-SUMO(ΔGG) and SUMO(ΔGG)-DBD, respectively. We then performed yeast two-hybrid screening with these constructs as baits. With DBD-SUMO(ΔGG) as the bait, TDG isoform b (TDGb) (two clones), Sp100 (one clone), and Uba2 (one clone) cDNAs were isolated from a mouse T cell library; Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 (EBI3) (one clone) and Sp100 (one clone) cDNAs were isolated from a mouse B cell library; and protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) (one clone) cDNA was isolated from a human brain library. With SUMO(ΔGG)-DBD as the bait, we obtained 14 clones encoding TDGb from a mouse T cell library. In the present study, we focused on the functional characterization of the noncovalent SUMO-1 binding activity of TDGb. Identification of the TDGb Domain Required for Noncovalent Binding of SUMO-1—TDGb possesses one SUMO-1 conjugation consensus sequence, VKEE (amino acids 316 to 319), and the TDGa isoform, which is 24 amino acids longer at the NH2 terminus than is TDGb (39Um S.

Jiricny J. Schar P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To identify the region of TDGb responsible for noncovalent binding of SUMO-1, we examined the interactions of a series of deletion mutants of TDGb fused to the COOH terminus of the GAL4 activation domain with SUMO(ΔGG)-DBD in the yeast two-hybrid system; the results are summarized in Fig. 1A. Full-length (FL) mouse TDGb (amino acids 1–397) as well as the COOH-terminal deletion mutants N-1 (residues 1–319) and N-2 (residues 1–315) interacted with SUMO(ΔGG), whereas N-3 (residues 1–304) did not. These results suggested that the SUMO-1 conjugation consensus sequence (residues 316–319) is not required for non-covalent binding to SUMO-1, and that amino acids 305–315 of TDGb contribute to the SUMO-1 binding region. Consistent with this conclusion, TDGb(KR), in which Lys317 in the conjugation sequence is replaced with Arg, retained the ability to bind SUMO(ΔGG). The NH2-terminal deletion"

These findings led us to hypothesize a general impact of this viral protein on the endosomal system. Here, we have shown that Nef specifically disturbs the morphology of the early/recycling compartment, inducing a redistribution of early endosomal markers and a shortening of the tubular recycling endosomal structures. Furthermore, Nef modulates the trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR), the prototypical recycling surface protein, indicating that it also disturbs the function of this compartment. Nef reduces the rate of recycling of TfR to the plasma membrane, causing TfR to accumulate in early endosomes and reducing its expression at the cell surface. These effects depend on the leucine-based motif of Nef, which is required for the membrane stabilization of AP-1 and AP-3 complexes. Since we show that this motif is also required for the full infectivity of HIV-1 virions, these results indicate that the positive influence of Nef on viral infectivity may be related to its general effects on early/recycling endosomal compartments. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef interacts with the clathrin-associated AP-1 and AP-3 adaptor complexes, stabilizing their association with endosomal membranes.

Trafficking of membrane proteins is governed by a regulated machinery that involves the vesicular transport of proteins throughout different intracellular compartments. One major regulatory mechanism is related to the function of the adaptor protein (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, adaptor protein; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ARF1, ADP-rybosylation factor 1; Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EEA1, early endosome antigen 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-TxR, Texas Red-conjugated EGF; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERC, endosomal recycling compartment; PE, phycoerythrin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy, cyanin; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: AP, adaptor protein; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ARF1, ADP-rybosylation factor 1; Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EEA1, early endosome antigen 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-TxR, Texas Red-conjugated EGF; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERC, endosomal recycling compartment; PE, phycoerythrin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy, cyanin; WT, wild type. complexes that assemble on donor membranes of the endocytic pathway to form transport vesicles (for review, see Ref. 1Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The sorting of transmembrane proteins into these vesicles requires the recognition by the AP complexes of specific tyrosine- or leucine-based motifs contained within the cytoplasmic domains of cargo proteins (2Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Four different types of heterotetrameric AP complexes (AP-1–AP-4) have been identified (3Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). AP-2 is specifically involved in the formation of clathrincoated vesicles at the plasma membrane, whereas AP-1 and AP-3 mediate the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the levels of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. The function of AP-4 is less well documented, but it regulates formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN. The association of the AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 complexes with TGN and endosomal membranes is regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1).The Nef protein of HIV-1 is a 27-kDa protein that associates with the cell membranes through N-terminal myristoylation and is abundantly produced shortly after virus infection (for review, see Refs. 4Janvier K.

In vitro, Nef also facilitates virus replication and enhances the infectivity of virions. Although the positive influence of Nef on viral replication and infectivity may be multifactorial, genetic evidence suggests a relationship between these virological effects and the ability of Nef to modulate the cell surface expression of multiple membrane-associated proteins.

Although the molecular basis of this general effect is not fully understood, it is now evident that it relates to the ability of Nef to interact directly with vesicle coat components involved in the vesicular transport throughout the endocytic pathway, including the clathrin-associated AP complexes.

We report that Nef expression induces severe alterations in the morphology and functions of the endosomal recycling compartment, an effect that correlates with the Nef-mediated stabilization of AP-1 and AP-3 complexes on endosomal membranes through its leucine-based motif. Because this motif is also required for the Nef-mediated enhancement of the infectivity of virions produced by CD4-negative cells, these results indicate that the functional impairment of the early/recycling compartment induced by Nef may directly relate to optimal viral infectivity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors—Vectors for expression of WT or mutated HIV-1Lai Nef fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human CD8-α chain were constructed in the pRcCMV plasmid (Invitrogen) as described (17Erdtmann L.

CD4-positive HeLa cells (clone P4.R5, provided by Dr. N. Landau, La Jolla, CA) used for viral infectivity assays were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml G418. Cells were transfected either by electroporation with 12 μg of plasmid as described before (17Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Benarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) using 0.5 μg of plasmid as recommended by the manufacturer.Viral Infections—Virions were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with proviral plasmid as described (22Craig H.M. Pandori M.W. Guatelli J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11229-11234Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the concentration of p24 antigen in viral stocks was measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Abbott Laboratories). Virions were used to infect HeLa-CD4 (clone 1022) cells, and infected cells were subjected 24 h later to Tf uptake as described below. Viral infectivity was determined using an infectious center assay (22Craig H.M. Pandori M.W. Guatelli J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11229-11234Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of viral stock were used to infect in duplicate HeLa-CD4 cells (P4R5 cells), containing the LacZ indicator under the control of the HIV-long terminal repeat (LTR). After 1 or 2 days at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained in a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) solution for 4–8 h. Infectivity was assessed by counting the blue-stained, HIV-infected foci. The ratio of blue cells/ng of p24 antigen for each viral stock was normalized to a value of 100% infectivity.Indirect Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells spread on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well) were stained for immunofluorescence as described (17Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Benarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS, quenched for 10 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma) in PBS. Cells were then incubated successively for 30 min at room temperature with the primary and secondary antibodies. For detection of the CD8-Nef chimeras, the cells were blocked for 20 min with 10% normal mouse serum in PBS and stained for 30 min with CD8-FITC mAb. Coverslips were washed and mounted on slides using Immuno-fluor mounting medium (ICN). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 or a Leica DMIRE2 instrument. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Where indicated, the intensity of fluorescence was quantified by high resolution measurements using the Leica TCS SP2 software (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, GmbH, Germany).Anti-TfR and Tf Uptake Assays—Tranfected or infected cells grown on coverslips were starved in serum-free medium (containing 0.1% BSA, 10 mm HEPES) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the same medium containing either 10 μg/ml TfAlexa-488, -546 or -594, 3 μg/ml EGF-TxR, or 20 μg/ml anti-CD71. The internalized anti-CD71 was revealed with the appropriate fluorescent secondary Ab. Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as previously. When indicated, CD8 staining was performed as described above, and Nef staining was performed using the goat anti-Nef polyclonal antibody and a Cy5-conjugated anti-IgG as secondary antibody. The cells were then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Tf uptake was quantified at the single-cell level by confocal laser scanning microscopy with the Bio-Rad MRC1000 microscope. Double fluorescence acquisition was performed using the 488-, 546- and 594-nm laser lines. In each experiment, the laser beam and the photomultipliers were adjusted to the Alexa signal of untransfected cells to avoid saturation of the signal when Tf was measured on a 250-gray values color scale. For each sample, medial optical slices of 100 different cells were recorded. NIH Image software was used to quantify the intensity of fluorescence (mean intensity of fluorescence per pixel) of Tf staining on the whole cells using a 0–250-gray color scale. All data were saved in different series, and statistical analysis was done. The confidence limits of the results were assessed by Student's t test.Cell Surface Expression of Transferrin Receptor (TfR)—The surface expression of TfR was analyzed by flow cytometry or indirect immunofluorescence. Transfected cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml anti-CD71. For flow cytometry analysis, the cell surface-associated Abs were revealed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-IgG. After washing, cells were fixed as described above, and the analysis was performed on GFP-positive cells with a Coultronics Epics Elite instrument. For immunofluorescence analysis, cell surface-associated anti-TfR was revealed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with a Cy5-conjugated anti-IgG. The cells were then analyzed by confocal microscopy. In each experiment, the laser beam and the photomultipliers were adjusted to the Cy5 signal of untransfected cells in order to avoid saturation when Tf was measured on a 250-gray values color scale. For each sample, cell surface and medial optical slices of 50 different cells were recorded. NIH Image software was used to quantify the intensity of fluorescence (mean intensity of fluorescence per pixel) of Tf staining on the whole cells using a 0–250-gray color scale. All data were saved in different series and statistical analysis was done. The confidence limits of the results were assessed by Student's t test.Flow Cytometry Analysis of Tf and TfR Internalization—24 h after transfection with CD8-Nef expression vectors, cells were serum-starved for 1 h at 37 °C, transferred on ice, washed in cold PBS, and labeled at 4 °C for 1 h either with 10 μg/ml Tf-Alexa-488 in the assay medium (RPMI containing 0.2% BSA, 10 mm HEPES) or with a FITC-conjugated anti-TfR in PBS-BSA 0.2%. Cells were then washed twice with the assay medium, and an aliquot was transferred in cold PBS. The remaining cells were transferred in the same media at 37 °C to allow internalization of Tf-Alexa-488 or FITC-anti-TfR for different periods of time. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was washed for 2 min in cold assay media adjusted to pH 4 (acid wash) to remove the surface-bound Tf-Alexa-488 or the remaining FITC-anti-TfR. The other aliquot was used to quantify the total cell-associated Tf-Alexa-488 or FITC-anti-TfR. After washing, the cells were assayed for cell surface expression of the CD8 chimera with an ECD-conjugated anti-CD8 in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell-associated fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry on CD8-positive cells. The percentage of internalized Tf was calculated as follows: [(m X - m0)/(m T - m0)] × 100. m X is the mean fluorescence obtained at each time point, m0 is the mean fluorescence obtained at time zero after acid wash, and m T is the total mean fluorescence obtained at time zero (without acid wash).Flow Cytometry Analysis of Tf Recycling—24 h after transfection with CD8-Nef expression vectors, cells were Tf-starved for 2 h and then incubated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml Tf-Alexa-488 in the assay medium (RPMI containing 0.2% BSA, 10 mm HEPES) to allow continuous internalization of Tf. Surface-bound Tf was removed by washing for 2 min with the assay medium adjusted to pH 4 (acid wash) followed by washes with cold PBS containing 1 mg/ml of unlabeled holo-Tf. An aliquot was transferred in cold PBS to quantify the cell-associated Tf-Alexa-488 at time zero. The remaining cells were transferred in the assay medium containing 1 mg/ml unlabeled holo-Tf and incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time to allow Tf-Alexa-488 to recycle back to the cell surface. After washing, the cells were then washed with the same cold medium, followed by washes in cold PBS, and assayed for cell surface expression of the CD8 chimera as indicated above. The cell-associated Tf-Alexa-488 was quantified by flow cytometry on CD8-positive cells. The percentage of Tf recycling was calculated as follows, (m X/m0) × 100. m X is the mean fluorescence obtained at each time point, and m0 is the mean fluorescence obtained at time zero.Western Blot Analysis—Expression of wild-type and mutated Nef-GFP fusions, native non-tagged Nef proteins, and CD8-Nef chimeras was analyzed by Western blotting, as described previously (17Erdtmann L.

To explore whether this Nef property underlies a widespread alteration of the trafficking of membrane proteins within the endosomal compartments, we first analyzed the distribution of Nef in relation to different endosomal markers in HeLa cells expressing a CD8-Nef chimera containing Nef as a cytoplasmic domain. This chimera retains the full activity of the native myristoylated Nef and thus represents a valuable tool for analyzing the interaction between Nef and the endocytic machinery (17Erdtmann L.

As evidenced in Fig. 1A, the distribution of early endosomal markers, such as early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and TfR, was modified dramatically by Nef expression. Both the TfR and EEA1-positive vesicles became concentrated in the perinuclear region of cells expressing CD8-Nef as compared with the more diffuse vesicular staining observed in untransfected cells.Fig. 1Nef alters the distribution of early endosomal markers. A, HeLa cells expressing CD8-Nef were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for EEA1 and TfR (red) and by direct immunofluorescence for CD8-Nef (green) 24 h after transfection. B, HeLa cells were transfected with the CD8-Nef expression vector in combination with vector expressing GFP-Rab5, GFP-Rab4, or GFP-Rab7. 24 h later, the cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for CD8-Nef (red). Staining was visualized by confocal microscopy. Insets show higher magnification of representative areas. Areas of co-localization are seen in yellow (arrows) in the merged images. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The endosomal compartment in which CD8-Nef is expressed was further characterized by co-staining for small GTPases involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking within the endosomal pathway: Rab5, Rab4, and Rab7. The function of these GTPases is restricted to the membrane compartments where they are localized; the early/sorting endosomes are enriched in Rab5 and Rab4, whereas the late endosomes instead contain Rab7 (28Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, CD8-Nef co-localized extensively with Rab5- and Rab4-positive structures. Indeed, the GFP-Rab4 staining actually surrounded most of the CD8-Nef positive vesicles. Conversely, little co-localization was detectable with GFP-Rab7. These results extend our previous data indicating that Nef is associated mainly with the early endosomal compartment (18Janvier K. Craig H. Hitchin D. Madrid R. Sol-Foulon N. Renault L. Cherfils J.

Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with a vector expressing a Nef-GFP fusion, and antibody uptake experiments were performed 24 h later. Cells were incubated with anti-TfR for 30 min at 37 °C and then fixed and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In untransfected cells, numerous punctuate endosomal structures were labeled with the anti-TfR antibody. In contrast, a weak intracellular anti-TfR staining was observed in Nef-expressing cells, indicating that Nef dramatically impairs the uptake of anti-TfR.Similarly, an alteration of TfR trafficking was also observed by using Alexa-594-conjugated Tf (Tf-Alexa-594) in an uptake experiment. 24 h after transfection, cells were depleted of endogenous Tf and then allowed to continuously internalize Tf-Alexa-594 for 30 min at 37 °C before fixation (Fig. 2B); expression of Nef-GFP (upper panels) dramatically reduced intracellular Tf staining compared with untransfected and control cells expressing GFP (lower panels). Quantitative analysis from the fluorescence images showed that cells expressing Nef-GFP, or the CD8-Nef chimera, exhibited a decrease of about 60–70% of Tf uptake compared with control cells (Fig. 2C"
https://openalex.org/W2123081876,"Phenobarbital (PB) administration is known to trigger pleiotropic responses, including liver hypertrophy, tumor promotion, and induction of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes. The induction of human CYP2B6 and the rat (CYP2B1) and mouse (Cyp2b10) homologues by PB is mediated by the nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). The study of CYP2B gene regulation and CAR activity by PB has been difficult due to the lack of a cellular model. In this study, we describe a novel differentiated human hepatoma cell line (WGA), derived from HepG2, which expresses CYP2B6 and CAR. WGA cells represent a powerful system to study the regulation of CYP2B6 gene expression by PB. There is evidence that CAR activity is regulated by phosphorylation and that regulation of some CYP genes depends on the nutritional status of cells. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as an energy sensor and is activated when cells experience energy-depleting stresses. In this report, we show that addition of 5-amino-imidazole carboxamide riboside, an AMPK activator, to WGA and human hepatocytes induces CYP2B6 gene expression. Expression of a constitutively active form of AMPK mimics the PB induction of CYP2B6 and CYP2B1 gene expression. Conversely, the expression of a dominant negative form of AMPK inhibits the induction of these genes by PB. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that AMPK activity increases in cells cultured with PB. Our data strongly support a role for AMPK in the PB induction of CYP2B gene expression and provide new insights into the regulation of gene expression by barbiturate drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1978131533,"We studied the biochemical properties of a plant receptor-like kinase to gain insights into the regulatory mechanism of this largest class of plant kinases. SYMRK (symbiosis receptor kinase) is required for early signal transduction leading to plant root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Amino acid substitutions in positions critical for activity of other related kinases cause a nonsymbiotic plant phenotype, suggesting that SYMRK kinase activity is required for symbiosis. SYMRK is capable of intermolecular autophosphorylation. Nonphosphorylated SYMRK is less active than the phosphorylated version, suggesting the phosphorylation status of SYMRK determines its activity. Three Ser/Thr residues were identified as residues required for full kinase activation through targeted mutagenesis. Using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, two of these were confirmed to be phosphorylated in vitro. These crucial phosphorylation sites are conserved among various plant receptor-like kinases as well as animal Pelle/interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase.

Karlowski W.M. Pan R. Tzeng Y.H. Mayer K.F. Li W.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1220-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The hallmarks of RLKs are a signal peptide, a more or less extensive extracellular domain with a variety of sequence motifs, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein kinase domain. Their overall structure suggests a role of the extracellular domain in the perception of an extracellular ligand and signal transduction through the intracellular kinase domain. This family includes genes regulating developmental processes, such as clavata 1, brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1), and erecta, and genes involved in plant defense, such as FLS2 and Xa21 (2Shiu S.H.

Despite the importance of RLK function in various signaling pathways involved in plant growth regulation and plant-microbe interactions, little is known about their regulatory mechanisms. Most of the characterized plant RLKs exhibit autophosphorylation activity when expressed and purified in Escherichia coli (3Tichtinsky G. Vanoosthuyse V. Cock J.M. Gaude T. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 231-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is known that autophosphorylation of animal receptor tyrosine kinases, induced by dimerization or oligomerization upon ligand binding, leads to activation of their catalytic activity followed by signal transduction. In analogy to the receptor tyrosine kinase regulation mechanism, plant RLKs are suggested to be activated by autophosphorylation induced by dimerization or oligomerization of RLKs (2Shiu S.H.

The Arabidopsis somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase autophosphorylates intermolecularly in vitro, and potential phosphorylation sites in the activation loop are important for its catalytic activity (15Shah K.

However, the activation mechanism of plant RLKs has not yet been elucidated. In this study we used SYMRK to analyze the mechanistic properties of this important class of kinases. We show that SYMRK encodes a functional kinase and that SYMRK activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status. A combination of targeted mutagenesis and phosphopeptide analysis by mass spectrometry defined critical phosphorylation sites. Plasmid Construction—cDNA encoding the entire SYMRK intracellular domain was amplified by PCR using the forward primer TGCCGCTACAGACAA and the reverse primer ATGCATTTACTATCTCGG with additional appropriate restriction endonuclease sites. The resulting PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases and cloned into vectors. The following combinations of restriction enzymes and vectors were used: SphI and SalI with pQE30 (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) for His-SYMRK; EcoRI and SalI with pET32a (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) for TRX-SYMRK; EcoRI and SalI with pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for GST-SYMRK. Point mutations were introduced by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method from Stratagene or by a PCR-based method described previously (16Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strunl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons Inc., Winston-Salem, NC1997: 8.5.7-8.5.9Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to exclude PCR errors and to confirm the designed mutation(s). Expression in E. coli and Protein Purification—Each construct for protein expression was transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta pLaqI (Novagen). Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm into the L broth and culturing at 22 °C for 5 h. His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. GST-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were de-salted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro and In-gel Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were carried out as follows unless otherwise specified. One μg of protein was incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) at 24 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 or silver staining (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal.

Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging (Fujifilm, Herts, UK). The sensitive in-gel kinase assay was performed as described by Romeis et al. (18Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar) using 1 mg/ml casein as substrate instead of myelin basic protein. Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (CIP) Treatment—Proteins were incubated in CIP buffer (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and 0.01 units/μl CIP (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE buffer and boiling for 5 min. Preparation of De-phosphorylated SYMRK—Purified GST-SYMRK protein was dephosphorylated as described above but using 0.1 units/μl of CIP. The CIP-treated GST-SYMRK protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. The glutathione-Sepharose was extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and protein was eluted with 1 bed volume of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione) 5 times. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored at –80 °C. Trypsin Digest of Recombinant Protein—Purified GST-SYMRK was used for trypsin digests with or without preincubation in a buffer allowing autophosphorylation (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) for 1 h at 37 °C.A1-μl aliquot of a 30 mm solution of iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was added to 5 μl of each protein sample. After 15 min, 5 μl of a solution containing 50 ng of porcine trypsin (Promega, Southampton, UK) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was added and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Finally, each sample was acidified using formic acid. Quadrupole Time-of-flight (Q-ToF) Mass Spectrometry and Data Base Searching—Peptides generated from tryptic digestion were loaded at a high flow rate onto a reverse-phase trapping column (0.3 mm inner diameter × 1 mm containing 5-μm C18 100-Å PepMap packing, LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and eluted through a reverse-phase capillary column (75-μm inner diameter × 150-mm column containing Symmetry C18 300-Å packing, Waters Ltd., Elstree, UK) directly into the nanoelectrospray ion source of a Q-ToF2 (Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, UK). Fragment ion spectra generated from the liquid chromatography-MS/MS were analyzed using the MASCOT search tool (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) against the weekly updated SPTrEMBL data base using appropriate parameters. The criteria for protein identification were based on the manufacturer's definitions (Matrix Science Ltd.). Candidate peptides with probability-based Mowse scores exceeding the threshold (p < 0.05), and thus indicating a significant or extensive homology, were referred to as “hits.” Protein scores were derived from peptide ion scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking proteins. The SYMRK Intracellular Domain Encodes a Functional Kinase—The SYMRK intracellular domain contains a conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase motif, but its kinase activity has not been shown previously. For this, the N-terminal His6-tagged SYMRK intracellular domain (His-SYMRK) or vector alone was expressed in E. coli and purified with nickel-agarose. The purified proteins were incubated with kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography or phosphorimaging. We detected a radioactive band in the His-SYMRK sample but not in the vector control, indicating that the SYMRK intracellular domain has autophosphorylation activity in vitro (Fig. 1A). To characterize the enzymatic properties of the SYMRK kinase, the autophosphorylation activity of His-SYMRK was analyzed in the presence of either 10 mm Mg2+, Mn2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+, or Ca2+. A similar extent of autophosphorylation activity was detected in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, or both cations, but no phosphorylation activity was observed when no metal or only Ca2+ was added, indicating His-SYMRK requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not Ca2+ for activity (Fig. 1B). Additional Ca2+ did not affect the Mg2+-dependent kinase activity (data not shown), indicating that Ca2+ does neither inhibit nor promote activity. The specificity of SYMRK was tested using known kinase substrates. His-SYMRK was incubated in kinase buffer with either 2 mg of casein, histone IIA, or myelin basic protein. Autoradiography detected bands corresponding to these substrates, but casein and myelin basic protein gave stronger signals than histone (Fig. 1C). Therefore, casein was used as an artificial substrate in subsequent experiments. Correlation between Kinase Activity and Biological Function of SYMRK—The domain structure of SYMRK supports the hypothesis that the extracellular domain perceives an unknown signal and the intracellular domain transduces the perception event to downstream targets via phosphorylation. A critical role for the kinase activity is suggested by several missense and nonsense point mutation alleles in the SYMRK kinase domain from L. japonicus and P. sativum (Refs. 5Stracke S. Kistner C.

Mutations are overrepresented in conserved kinase residues known to be critical for the catalytic activity. L. japonicus symrk-6 (G603R) and P. sativum sym19 P4 (G604E) mutations replace the second G of the GXGXXGXV ATP binding motif of domain I. symrk-9 (G604R) is in the same region, although it does not affect a conserved amino acid. The symrk-10 (D738N) and sym19 P55 (D739N) mutations destroy the conserved DFG motif of domain VII at the beginning of the activation loop, which is crucial for kinase activity (20Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Another mutation, symrk-8 (G759R), is also located in the activation loop. To determine the effects of these mutations on protein structure, a model for the SYMRK kinase domain was generated, and the mutation sites were mapped on the model. As depicted in Fig. 2, most of the mutations generating non-symbiotic SYMRK alleles are located close to the activation loop.Table ISYMRK mutant alleles from L. japonicus and P. sativum with mutations in the kinase domainAlleleLine designationAmino acid positionAmino acid changeDomainReferenceL. japonicussymrk-6EMS34603Gly to ArgI19Perry J.A.

To confirm this, we introduced a subset of the mutations corresponding to plant mutant alleles into the E. coli-expressed SYMRK intracellular domain. His-W806*, His-G793D, and TRX-D738N contain the same mutation as the plant alleles, symrk-7, symrk-11, and symrk-10, respectively (Fig. 3A). These proteins were purified and subjected to an autophosphorylation assay. Neither of the mutant proteins showed autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 3B; for TRX-D738N data are not shown). These results indicate a correlation between plant symbiotic phenotype and kinase activity, suggesting that the kinase activity is important for SYMRK function in symbiosis. Intermolecular Phosphorylation of SYMRK—To investigate whether the SYMRK autophosphorylation proceeds via an intermolecular or an intramolecular mechanism, kinase-deficient SYMRK mutant proteins were used as a potential substrate of SYMRK. The wild-type SYMRK intracellular domain was cloned in the vector pET32a (TRX-SYMRK), which adds a 27-kDa thioredoxin tag, to generate a protein with a distinct molecular weight from the His-tagged mutant proteins. The TRX-SYMRK protein was purified from E. coli and incubated in kinase buffer with or without the kinase-dead mutants His-W806* or His-G793D. Autoradiography analysis showed TRX-SYMRK has autophosphorylation activity. When His-W806* and His-G793D were incubated with TRX-SYMRK kinase, phosphorylated bands were detected with sizes corresponding to these kinase-deficient proteins (Fig. 3C). These results show that the SYMRK intracellular domain catalyzes intermolecular phosphorylation. The Phosphorylation Status of SYMRK Affects Kinase Activity—When E. coli-expressed His-SYMRK was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, we observed multiple bands of apparent molecular mass between 57 and 50 kDa, although the calculated molecular mass of the tagged protein is 44 kDa. Because these multiple bands were recognized by an anti-His antibody (data not shown), we investigated whether these low mobility bands represented phosphorylated species of His-SYMRK. After incubation with CIP, only one band with a similar size to the smallest of untreated His-SYMRK was observed (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that His-SYMRK protein is phosphorylated in E. coli. Because kinase-deficient mutant protein shows a single band that corresponds to the size of the CIP-treated sample (data not shown), His-SYMRK is likely to be autophosphorylated and not phosphorylated by E. coli-derived kinases. The differential phosphorylation status may affect the catalytic activity of SYMRK. To analyze the kinase activity of the different phosphorylated forms of SYMRK intracellular domain, we performed an in-gel kinase assay of His-SYMRK preincubated with or without CIP. Interestingly, we detected a radioactive band in the lane of non-CIP-treated His-SYMRK, but this band was barely visible in the lane containing CIP-treated protein. This result suggests that non-phosphorylated SYMRK has a much lower kinase activity than phosphorylated SYMRK. A time course experiment confirmed that the in-gel kinase activity decreased with progression of SYMRK dephosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Because the in-gel kinase assay includes procedures of protein denaturation and renaturation, the reduced activity might be due to an inability of the non-phosphorylated SYMRK to refold properly. To investigate this possibility, we purified the non-phosphorylated SYMRK intracellular domain under a native condition. GST-tagged SYMRK intracellular domain (GST-SYMRK) purified from E. coli was dephosphorylated by CIP for 1 h at 37 °C and repurified with glutathione-Sepharose. The repurified de-phosphorylated SYMRK was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. GSTSYMRK showed a strong autophosphorylation band within 5 min and reached a maximum level after 30–60 min of incubation, whereas de-phosphorylated SYMRK showed a weak signal after 10 min of incubation that gradually increased during longer incubation periods (Fig. 5A). To test if this difference in the kinase activity is due to a contamination with remaining CIP activity, GST-SYMRK and de-phosphorylated SYMRK were mixed at 1:1 ratio and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay for 10 min. GST-SYMRK activity was not inhibited by the de-phosphorylated SYMRK, suggesting that there was no remaining phosphatase activity in the de-phosphorylated SYMRK sample (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation is necessary for full kinase activity of SYMRK. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Predicted Phosphorylation Sites— To identify Ser/Thr residues decisive for the regulation of kinase activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. In the SYMRK intracellular domain 25 potential phosphorylation sites were predicted by the NetPhos2.0 program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos). Among these we selected residues conserved between legume and non-legume SYMRK homologues as mutagenesis targets (data not shown). To narrow down the number of target residues, we especially selected the Ser/Thr residues placed at the following three regions; the activation segment, the juxtamembrane region preceding the conserved kinase domain, and the C-terminal region located after the conserved kinase domain. Previous studies suggested that phosphorylation of the activation segment is required for full kinase activity in many kinases, and some kinases contain regulatory phosphorylation sites in the juxtamembrane and the C-terminal region (20Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 23Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We selected two Ser (Ser-751 and Ser-754) and 1 Thr (Thr-760) residues from the activation segment, one Ser (Ser-580) and one Thr (Thr-593) from the juxtamembrane region, and two Ser (Ser-870 and Ser-888) from the C-terminal region. These Ser/Thr residues were substituted by Ala in the GST-SYMRK construct, and the mutated proteins were analyzed by in vitro and in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 6, A and B). Mutations T760A in the activation segment and T593A in the juxtamembrane region reduced kinase activity significantly, although both proteins still showed basal in vitro kinase activity. The activity of these mutant proteins could not be detected by in-gel kinase assays. The S754A mutation slightly reduced auto phosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activity in vitro, whereas no activity was detected by in-gel kinase assay. The mutations at S570A, S870A, and S888A did not affect either in vitro or in-gel kinase activity. In brief, we found three Ser/Thr residues that affect autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activity of SYMRK. Determination of Phosphorylation Sites of SYMRK Expressed in E. coli—Although crucial Ser/Thr residues for regulation of SYMRK kinase activity were identified, it was unclear whether these sites were indeed phosphorylated. To answer this question, we determined the presence of phospho-amino acids by Q-ToF/MS in E. coli-expressed GST-SYMRK proteins with or without preincubation in an autophosphorylation buffer. Although several tryptic SYMRK peptides were not detected by Q-ToF/MS, the peptides that included each of Ser-754, Thr-760, and Thr-593 were detected. MS-Spectra identified phosphorylated Ser-754 in the GST-SYMRK sample without preincubation (Fig. 7A) and Thr-760 from the preincubated sample (Fig. 7B). Phosphorylation of Thr-593 could not be detected in either sample. Because no phosphorylated peptides were detected on GST-K622E, a kinase-dead mutant, the observed phosphorylation of GST-SYMRK is likely due to autophosphorylation and not mediated by an E. coli-derived kinase. SYMRK is a member of the large family of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases in plants. In this study we show that the SYMRK intracellular domain encodes a functional kinase that is regulated by phosphorylation. Several L. japonicus and P. sativum mutants defective in symbiosis were shown to carry mutations in the conserved kinase motifs of SYMRK, which suggest that the kinase activity of SYMRK is required for its symbiotic function. Although kinase domain sequences of various plant receptor kinases are highly conserved, phosphorylation properties are variable. The disease-resistance gene Xa21 from Rice encodes a leucine-rich repeat-type receptor kinase, and the Xa21 kinase domain autophosphorylates in an intramolecular manner (24Liu G.Z. Pi L.Y. Walker J.C. Ronald P.C. Song W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, Arabidopsis somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase is reported to autophosphorylate intermolecularly (15Shah K. Vervoort J. de Vries S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41263-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that SYMRK autophosphorylates intermolecularly as the SYMRK kinase domain phosphorylates kinase-dead mutant versions, although we cannot exclude the possibility SYMRK also autophosphorylates intramolecularly. In animal systems, intermolecular phosphorylation is particularly important for activation of some receptor-tyrosine kinases that recognize growth factors. Upon ligand binding, dimerization or oligomerization of receptor-tyrosine kinases triggers intermolecular phosphorylation of regulatory residues that are essential for activation of kinases (25Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism is also reported for the Drosophila kinase Pelle, a toll receptor-associated kinase. The Pelle kinase is activated by concentration-dependent autophosphorylation, and this activation is supposed to be triggered by dimerization or oligomerization of Toll receptor complexes (26Shen B. Manley J. Development. 2002; 129: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plant RLKs belong to a monophyletic gene family, which includes Drosophila Pelle (2Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/113/RE22)PubMed Google Scholar). Based on analogy to animal kinases, phosphorylation-dependent activation of plant RLKs was repeatedly proposed (2Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/113/RE22)PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, this has not yet been shown. Here we demonstrate that SYMRK kinase activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status and probably via autophosphorylation. Results from both in-gel and in vitro kinase assays suggest that SYMRK needs to be phosphorylated to gain full kinase activity. To identify the phosphorylation sites that affect the SYMRK activation, we mutagenized seven computer-predicted phosphorylation sites that are conserved between SYMRK orthologues from different plant species. We found three crucial residues, Thr-593, Ser-754, and Thr-760, that are required for full kinase activity. Residues Ser-754 and Thr-760 are located within the activation segment. The T760A mutation reduced kinase activity significantly but not completely. The S754A mutant protein showed only slightly less autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activity than wild-type GST-SYMRK protein, and the kinase activity was not detected by the in-gel kinase assay. In the Arabidopsis somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase protein the Thr residues Thr-462 and Thr-468 located within the activation loop are important for its catalytic activity (15Shah K. Vervoort J. de Vries S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41263-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and correspond to Ser-754 and Thr-760 in SYMRK, respectively. Although the effects of mutations in these residues were generally more pronounced in somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase than in SYMRK, the trend was the same, with Thr-468 having a stronger defect than Thr-462. Residue Thr-593 is located just before the ATP binding site in the conserved kinase domain of SYMRK. A tomato disease-resistance gene, Pto, encodes a kinase. The sequence of Pto is closely related to the kinase domain of RLKs. The autophosphorylation sites in Pto were extensively analyzed, and Thr-38 was found to be required for kinase activation and signal transduction (27Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alignment of the SYMRK intracellular domain and Pto revealed that Thr-38 in Pto is equivalent to SYMRK Thr-593 (Fig. 8). Mutation of this residue leads to a dramatic reduction in kinase activity, suggesting that this critical residue has a conserved role in SYMRK and Pto. Recently, the phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of IRAK-1, the mammalian orthologue of Pelle, was reported (28Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). IRAK-1 requires phosphorylation of two different sites, Thr-209 and Thr-387, to be activated. Kollewe et al. (28Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggested that phosphorylation of Thr-209 “kicks off” the activation of the kinase and subsequent Thr-387 phosphorylation precedes hyperphosphorylation of the ProST region followed by dissociation of IRAK-1 from the interleukin-1 receptor complex. The amino acid alignment indicates Thr-209 and Thr-387 in IRAK-1 correspond to Thr-593 and Thr-760 of SYMRK, respectively (Fig. 8). The combined results of the present study with that of Kollewe et al. (28Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggest similarities in the regulatory mechanisms of IRAK-1 and SYMRK, although SYMRK has additional transmembrane and extracellular domains that IRAK-1 lacks. Moreover, with the exception of Ser-754 in Pelle, the three crucial phosphorylation sites identified in this study are largely conserved among various plant receptor-like kinases and Pto as well as Pelle and IRAK-1, suggesting the existence of an evolutionary conserved activation mechanisms. By using Q-ToF/MS analysis of trypsin-digested SYMRK, we could prove that some of these crucial Ser and Thr are actual phosphorylation sites at least in E. coli-expressed protein. We observed peaks corresponding to phosphorylated Ser-754 and T760 residues in the sample with and without pre-autophosphorylation treatment, respectively. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-754 and Thr-760 may occur under different conditions. We could not detect phospho-Thr-593 by Q-ToF. This could either indicate that Thr-593 has a role in kinase activation independent of phosphorylation or that the phosphorylation of Thr-593 is transient and, hence, difficult to detect. Alternatively, we could not detect it for technical reasons. Recently, a phosphoproteome analysis of plasma membrane proteins from Arabidopsis cell cultures discovered in vivo phosphorylation sites of RLKs (29Nühse T.S. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Peck S.C. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These data of Nühse et al. (29Nühse T.S. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Peck S.C. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) are consistent with our in vitro results; Ser and Thr residues corresponding to SYMRK Thr-593, Ser-754, and Thr-760 were found to be phosphorylated in several Arabidopsis RLKs in vivo. Taken together, the combined results highlight the relevance of these sites not only for the regulation of SYMRK but also of other members of the RLK gene family.

Alternative splicing, heteromultimerization, regulatory proteins, and posttranslational modifications contribute to increase this molecular complexity. At the functional level, K+ channels are characterized by different gating mechanisms that condition their role in cell electrogenesis. Voltage, Ca2+, G-proteins, the ATP/ADP ratio, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate are among the key regulators of K+ channel gating (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev.

So far, 15 human K2P subunits have been identified. Some of these K2P channels have a highly restricted tissue expression, for instance TALK-1 in the pancreas, whereas others, including TREK-1, have a more widespread expression (12Fink M. Duprat F.

Furthermore, TREK-1 and TREK-2 are stimulated by intracellular acidosis, whereas TRAAK opens upon intracellular alkalosis (19Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol.

Reyes R. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2483-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Various chemical agents are also potent modulators of TREK-1 (6Patel A.J.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (AA), reversibly open the TREK and TRAAK channels (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

Additionally, extracellular lysophospholipids, including LPC, unlike extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), are also potent openers of TREK-1 (32Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10128-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although AA stimulation is apparently direct, extracellular lysophospholipids fail to modulate TREK-1 activity after patch excision (11Patel A.J. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. Curr. Opin.

Importantly TREK-1 and TREK-2, unlike TRAAK, are stimulated by volatile and gaseous anesthetics (23Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 33Gruss M. Bushell T.J. Bright D.P. Lieb W.R. Mathie A. Franks N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These channels are also opened by the neuroprotective agent riluzole (25Duprat F. Lesage F. Patel A.J. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 906-912PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, the cationic amphipaths, including chlorpromazine (CPZ), tetracaine, and bupivacaine, are inhibitors of TREK-1 (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

Analg. 2003; 96: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway inhibits TREK-1 by phosphorylation of Ser-333 in the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Moreover, stimulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptors down-modulates TREK-1 via a direct inhibition by diacylglycerol, independently of the protein kinase C pathway (35Chemin J. Girard C. Duprat F. Lesage F. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo evidence confirms a key role for TREK-1 in neuroprotection by polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as in general anesthesia (36Heurteaux C. Guy N. Laigle C. Blondeau N. Duprat F. Mazzuca L. Lang-Lazdunski L. Widmann C. Zanzouri M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). LPA is an abundant cellular lipid that exerts multiple biological effects (37Xie Y. Gibbs T.C. Meier K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Ye X. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Chun J.

Extracellular LPA evokes biological responses that are mediated through the activation of three G-protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–3). Although important progress has been made in the understanding of the extracellular effects of LPA and its role in disease states such as cancer progression and atherosclerosis, the role of intracellular LPA has only recently been recognized (42Zhang C. Baker D.L. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Balazs L. Johnson L.R. Marathe G.K. McIntyre T.M. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp.

Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The tissue concentration of LPA is remarkably high, reaching up to 100 nmol/g in the brain (38Ye X. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Chun J. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2169-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 498-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cellular LPA is produced by glycerophosphate acyltransferase and by monoacylglycerol kinase and is a critical first step in the formation of triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipids. The hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid (PA) by phospholipases A1 and A2, the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids by lysophospholipase D, and the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins lead to locally generated extracellular LPA, which is able to cross the plasma membrane and combine with the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (43McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Thus, LPA also acts as a paracrine signal and behaves as a transcellular agonist (42Zhang C. Baker D.L. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Balazs L. Johnson L.R. Marathe G.K. McIntyre T.M. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 43McIntyre T.M.

A. 2003; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that intracellular LPA is a potent regulator of the TREK/TRAAK K2P channels. This is the first demonstration of an LPA-operated ion channel family. Opening of these K2P channels by intracellular LPA directly links the lipid status to cell electrogenesis. Neuronal Cell Cultures—The primary culture of mouse striata was carried out as described previously (36Heurteaux C. Guy N. Laigle C. Blondeau N. Duprat F. Mazzuca L. Lang-Lazdunski L. Widmann C. Zanzouri M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in culture dishes coated previously with polyornithine and 50% fetal calf serum. The culture was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with glucose (1.5 g/liter) for 24 h and then B27 with uridine (2 μm) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (2 μm). Electrophysiological Recordings—Patch clamp measurements of neurons were performed 2 or 3 days after plating. In inside-out configuration, the internal solution contained (in mm): 155 KCl, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, and the external solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 3 mm 4-aminopyridine, 10 μm glibenclamide, and 5 mm glucose were added daily to the extracellular solution, and pH was adjusted with HCl. For COS cell experiments, culture, mutagenesis, transfection, and the electrophysiological procedure have been detailed elsewhere (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

The long spliced form of mTREK-1, with an extension of 15 amino acids in the amino-terminal domain, was used in the present study (45Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In some experiments, an amino-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged mTREK-1 channel was used, and no functional difference with the untagged WT channel was observed, including sensitivity to intracellular LPA. For clarity and consistency with our previous work, amino acid numbering was related to the short mTREK-1 splice variant (12Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). mTREK-1, rTREK-2, mTRAAK, and mTRESK-1 were used in this study. We routinely transfected 0.1 μg of DNA for each 35-mm-diameter plate containing 20,000 cells. The external medium contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. To study the voltage dependence of TREK-1, we used an extracellular medium containing (in mm): 155 KCl, 5 EGTA, 5 EDTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH. The intracellular medium contained (in mm): 155 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH. Inside-out patches were routinely held at a holding potential of –80 mV and stimulated by voltage ramps of 660 ms in duration from –100 mV to 100 mV every 5 s. LPA (Sigma and Avanti Polar Lipids), PA (Sigma), and oleoylglycerol (Sigma) were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water/HCl (20:10:1:1) at a concentration of 5 mm, 25 mm, and 7 mm, respectively. Sphingosine-1P (Sigma) was dissolved in methanol at 2 mm. Aliquots were kept under argon at –80 °C. Daily, aliquots were evaporated with air, and lipids were dissolved in the saline solution that was sonicated on ice for 15 min before use. Control experiments were carried out using the evaporated solvent alone. AA and oleic acid (Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 100 mm, kept at –20 °C, and renewed weekly. Glycerophosphate and pyrophosphate (Sigma) were dissolved in water at a concentration of 5 mm. Chlorpromazine was dissolved in 10% ethanol at a concentration of 10 mm and stored at –20 °C. Mibefradil (Sigma) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 10 mm and stored at –20 °C. ATP K+ salt (5 mm) was dissolved in the saline solution. The Student's t test (paired or unpaired) was used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 (as indicated by asterisks in the figures). Intracellular LPA Stimulates TREK-1 Channel Activity—We expressed TREK-1 in transiently transfected COS cells and recorded channel activity in the inside-out patch configuration (Fig. 1). TREK-1 is reversibly opened by the addition of 5 μm oleoyl-LPA to the intracellular medium (Fig. 1, A and B). The LPA-activated current is not present in mock-transfected COS cells (n = 12; Fig. 1D) or in cells expressing TRESK-1 (n = 15), another K2P channel that is functionally unrelated to TREK-1 (46Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 47Czirjak G. Toth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the LPA-activated K+ current originates from TREK-1 (Fig. 1, B–D). The time constants for channel activation and recovery are τ = 14.9 ± 4.8 s and τ = 51.1 ± 10.1 s (n = 8), respectively. LPA induces a typical outwardly rectifying I-V curve that reverses at the predicted K+ equilibrium potential (Fig. 1B). Channel activation is reproduced several times on the same patch (not shown). Intracellular LPA opens TREK-1 in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 2.4 ± 0.2 μm (n = 10) and with a very steep concentration-response relationship (Fig. 1C). LPA preferentially activates TREK-1 when applied intracellularly, whereas, as reported previously (32Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10128-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), extracellular LPA only has a minimum effect in the whole-cell, outside-out, and cell-attached patch configurations (2.4 ± 0.3-fold, n = 3) (Fig. 1C, inset). LPA activation is dependent on the presence of the phosphate head group (Fig. 1, A and D). Indeed, oleoylglycerol that lacks the phosphate at position 3 of the glycerol is completely ineffective (n = 12). The acyl chain is also required, as glycerophosphate (n = 11) is without significant effect on TREK-1 (Fig. 1, A and D). Oleic acid (n = 7), glycerol (n = 5), and pyrophosphate (n = 5) do not significantly alter TREK-1 channel activity (Fig. 1, A and D). Intracellular ATP (5 mm) produces a mild, although significant, reversible inhibition of TREK-1 (–22 ± 4%, n = 6) (Fig. 1D). Intracellular stearic LPA, comprising a saturated fatty acid at position 1, potently and equally opens TREK-1 (I/I control: 74 ± 27, n = 13) (not shown). Intracellular PA induces channel activation (n = 18), although stimulation is weak compared with LPA (Fig. 1D). Sphingosine 1P is without any significant effect (I/I control: 1.5 ± 0.7, n = 11) (not shown). LPA Converts the Voltage-sensitive K+ Channel TREK-1 into a Leak Conductance—TREK-1 displays intrinsic voltage dependence (22Maingret F. Honoré E. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In a symmetrical K+ gradient lacking both intra- and extracellular Mg2+, TREK-1 shows kinetics of activation and deactivation as well as a strong outward rectification (Fig. 2). During a voltage pulse to 100 mV, the steady-state outward current (Ist) increases by about 2-fold as compared with the initial current (It0) (Fig. 2, A–C). In the presence of intracellular LPA, the activation of the current becomes instantaneous (Fig. 2, A–C). Moreover, the time constant for current deactivation at –80 mV following a voltage step to 100 mV is significantly enhanced from 7.8 ± 1.1 ms to 23.5 ± 5.7 ms (n = 11) in the presence of LPA (Fig. 2, A and B). Alteration of current kinetics by intracellular LPA is particularly evident when currents are normalized (Fig. 2B). A partial relaxation of the current is evident at depolarized potentials (τ = 41.2 ± 4.8 ms at 100 mV, n = 6) (Fig. 2, A and B). The typical outward rectification of TREK-1 is reversibly abrogated by intracellular LPA (Fig. 2D). Consequently, the stimulation by LPA is stronger at negative (89.8 ± 35.6-fold at –140 mV, n = 10) versus positive potentials (18.9 ± 6.4-fold at 140 mV, n = 10). Intracellular LPA and pH Activation of TREK-1 Are Not Additive—TREK-1 is rapidly and reversibly activated by intracellular acidosis (19Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). At intracellular pH 5.5, LPA fails to further open TREK-1 (Fig. 3A). Protonation of LPA at acidic intracellular pH may reduce the net negative charge of the molecule, thus affecting TREK-1 stimulation. Another possibility is that LPA and acidic activations are not additive. Protonation of the amino acid Glu-306, located in the proximal cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain, is critical for acid activation of TREK-1 (20Honoré E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Substitution of Glu-306 by an alanine mimics the effect of acidosis and locks the channel in the open conformation (20Honoré E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The E306A mutant, unlike TREK-1 WT, is characterized by a constitutive activity at intracellular pH 7.2 (20Honoré E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Intracellular LPA only produces a modest increase in the E306A current amplitude, an observation that is consistent with previous findings indicating that TREK-1 E306A is fully activated and cannot be further stimulated by intracellular acidification or membrane stretch (20Honoré E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that acidic and LPA activations are indeed not additive. The double mutant ΔC100 E306A, with a deletion of the last 100 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal domain, is significantly stimulated by intracellular LPA, indicating that Glu-306 does not directly participate in the LPA effect (Fig. 3, C and D). LPA Converts the Mechano-gated Channel TREK-1 into a Background Channel—At atmospheric pressure, TREK-1 channel activity is low (Fig. 4, A and C). A membrane stretch of –60 mm Hg (suction on the patch of membrane) reversibly opens TREK-1 channels (Fig. 4, A–C). TREK-1 channel activity is directly related to pressure with a P0.5 value of –23.0 ± 6.5 mm Hg (n = 6) (Fig. 4B). In the presence of intracellular LPA, TREK-1 is opened at atmospheric pressure, and membrane stretch fails to significantly increase channel activity (Fig. 4, A–C). The carboxyl-truncated mutant ΔC103 is characterized by a P0.5 value of –46.5 ± 2.7 mm Hg (n = 8), demonstrating a lower mechano-sensitivity (Fig. 4, D and E). In the presence of intracellular LPA, channel activity at atmospheric pressure strongly increases, and the P0.5 value is shifted to –11.3 ± 4.7 mm Hg (n = 6) (Fig. 4, D and E). The activity of ΔC103, unlike TREK-1 WT (Fig. 5C, inset), is significantly enhanced by membrane stretch in the presence of intracellular LPA (Fig. 4, D–F). Because of a lower basal P0.5 value, ΔC103 remains mechano-sensitive in the presence of intracellular LPA (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2157307434,"Atherosclerotic disease remains a leading cause of death in westernized societies, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in atherogenesis. Mitochondria are the main intracellular sites of ROS generation and are also targets for oxidative damage. Here, we show that mitochondria from atherosclerosis-prone, hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout mice have oxidative phosphorylation efficiency similar to that from control mice but have a higher net production of ROS and susceptibility to develop membrane permeability transition. Increased ROS production was observed in mitochondria isolated from several tissues, including liver, heart, and brain, and in intact mononuclear cells from spleen. In contrast to control mitochondria, knockout mouse mitochondria did not sustain a reduced state of matrix NADPH, the main source of antioxidant defense against ROS. Experiments in vivo showed faster liver secretion rates and de novo synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol in knockout than in control mice, suggesting that increased lipogenesis depleted the reducing equivalents from NADPH and generated a state of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic knockout mice. These data provide the first evidence of how oxidative stress is generated in LDL receptor defective cells and could explain the increased LDL oxidation, cell death, and atherogenesis seen in familiar hypercholesterolemia."
https://openalex.org/W2062311025,"Among the members of the major facilitator superfamily of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified genes involved in the transport into vacuoles of the basic amino acids histidine, lysine, and arginine. ATP-dependent uptake of histidine and lysine by isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles was impaired in YMR088c, a vacuolar basic amino acid transporter 1 (VBA1)-deleted strain, whereas uptake of tyrosine or calcium was little affected. This defect in histidine and lysine uptake was complemented fully by introducing the VBA1 gene and partially by a gene encoding Vba1p fused with green fluorescent protein, which was determined to localize exclusively to the vacuolar membrane. A defect in the uptake of histidine, lysine, or arginine was also observed in the vacuolar membrane vesicles of mutants YBR293w (VBA2) and YCL069w (VBA3). These three VBA genes are closely related phylogenetically and constitute a new family of basic amino acid transporters in the yeast vacuole."

A polymorphism in the TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) gene resulting in a juxtamembrane inversion from methionine (TNFR2196MET) to arginine (TNFR2196ARG) has been genetically associated with an increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus and familial rheumatoid arthritis. Albeit the mutation does not affect the TNF binding kinetics of TNFR2, the present study provides evidence that the mutation results in a significantly lower capability to induce TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). TNF-α mediates a dual role triggering cellular survival or induction of apoptosis depending on the complex environment (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). TNF-α binds to two distinct receptors, the 55-kDa TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1; CD120a) and the 75-kDa TNFR2 (CD120b), which are members of the TNFR superfamily. This family consists of approx. 30 receptors including Fas/Apo-1/CD95, CD27, CD30, LT-βR, OX-40, and TRAIL-R1 to R4, which share homologies within their extracellular domains containing one to six copies of highly conserved cysteine-rich amino acid motifs (4Idriss H.T.

Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). The group may be further divided by their conserved intracellular adaptor domains (e.g. death domain, DD) mediating intracellular signals via homotypic/heterotypic protein-protein interactions (6Tartaglia L.A.

TNFR1, CD95/Fas/Apo1, DR3, DR4 (TRAILR1), and DR5 (TRAILR2) contain DDs and therefore belong to the subgroup of death receptors, being able to recruit other DD proteins by homophilic association (8Song H.Y.

On the other hand, TNFR2 is a member of the non-DD receptor subgroup, such as CD30, CD40, RANK, 4-1BB, and OX40, which lacks the ability to directly activate the apoptotic machinery via DD adaptors (1Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of a DD, TNFR2 can induce cell type-specific receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-dependent cell death (10Dembic Z. Loetscher H. Gubler U. Pan Y.C. Lahm H.W. Gentz R. Brockhaus M.

It has been reported that TNFR2-mediated cell death is based on the induction of endogenous TNF-α and subsequent triggering of TNFR1 (11Grell M. Zimmermann G. Gottfried E. Chen C.M. Grunwald U.

In addition, it is now widely accepted that engagement of TNFR2 may result in cIAP1-dependent depletion of TRAF2 leading to an enhancement of TNFR1-mediated apoptosis without the involvement of endogenous TNF-α (14Weiss T.

Whereas soluble TNF-α does bind to both TNF receptors and is a strong activator of TNFR1, TNFR2 has been reported to become fully activated only upon stimulation with membrane-bound TNF-α (18Grell M.

Initially, TNFR2 was believed to play a minor role in the TNF system, only displaying modulating or supportive functions, for instance by collecting and handing over the ligand to TNFR1, a process designated as “ligand passing” (6Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the use of TNFR2- or TNFR1-specific agonistic antibodies and receptor-specific ligands, TNF-α muteins (19Krippner-Heidenreich A. Tubing F. Bryde S. Willi S. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. J.

The major adaptor protein is thought to be TRAF2, which is responsible for the activation of NF-κB signaling (via the IκB (IKK) complex) as well as engagement of the JNK pathway (21Haridas V.

The TNFR2 gene is located on chromosome 1p36.2 and is organized in 10 exons and 9 introns (25Beltinger C.P. White P.S. Maris J.M. Sulman E.P. Jensen S.J. LePaslier D. Stallard B.J.

In the present work, we examined the mechanism by which this pathophysiologically important variant TNFR2196ARG may influence inflammatory signaling pathways. Stably transfected HeLa cell populations and immortalized fibroblasts from TNFR/TNFR2-/- double knock-out mice were used as model systems. The differential NF-κB activation, target gene induction, and apoptotic properties downstream of the TNFR2196ARG risk variant suggest a common molecular mechanism which might contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the associated inflammatory diseases. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human epithelial HeLa S3 cells (ACC 161) were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from TNFR1-/-TNFR2-/- double-deficient mice have been described previously (19Krippner-Heidenreich A. Tubing F. Bryde S. Willi S. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44155-44163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). MEF and HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin (each at 50 μg/ml) and grown in 5% CO2 and 37 °C. pcDNA3.1-TNFR2 Constructs and Mutagenesis—Expression plasmids for TNFR2 were generated by inserting cDNA coding for wild-type TNFR2 (TNFR2196MET) into HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For expression of the TNFR2196ARG variant, the codon was mutated from ATG to AGG using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid for the expression of fusion protein EGFP-TRAF2 has been described before (17Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A. Parmryd I. Scheurich P. Schmid J.A. Wajant H. J.

G418 (Geneticin) for selection of transfected cells was from PAA Laboratories (Somerset, UK). Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for TNFR2 (ab8161) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal antibody mouse-anti-TNFR2 MAB726 for immunoprecipitation was purchased from R&D Systems. Alexa Fluor® 488 chicken anti-mouse IgG, goat-anti-rabbit IgG, and goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-TNFR2 was obtained from Stressgen (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-TRAF2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal mouse-anti-β-Actin antibody was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). All other primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). The monoclonal mouse antibody 80M2 for cross-linking of TNFR2 has been described elsewhere (33Grell M. Scheurich P. Meager A. Pfizenmaier K. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of HeLa Cells Stably Expressing TNFR2 Variants—HeLa cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1 constructs for TNFR2 variants with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manunfacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected by 4 weeks of cultivation in medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 and three rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (FACStar+, BD Biosciences) using mouse monoclonal antibody 80M2 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG plus IgM as secondary antibody (Dianova, Germany). Cells stably expressing TNFR2 variants were propagated at 250 μg/ml G418. HeLa stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 without insert were used as control cells (mock). Binding Experiments—To determine the effect of the amino acid substitution Met-196 → Arg on binding kinetics of TNFR2 under physiological conditions, association/dissociation studies were performed at 37 °C using stably transfected TNFR1/TNFR2-/--MEF expressing only the respective TNFR2 variant. Recombinant human 125iodotyrosyl-TNF (125I-TNF) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). For the investigation of TNF-α association kinetics, the radiolabeled ligand (20 ng/ml) was preincubated at 37 °C in 50 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide and 20 mm Hepes (binding buffer). The binding reaction was started by addition of 50 μl of cell suspension (4 × 105 cells/50 μl of binding buffer), followed by incubation for 10 s to 10 min at 37 °C. After separating the cells from the binding medium by centrifugation through a mineral oil layer (14,000 × g, 15 s), the tips of the tubes were cut off, and cell-bound radioactivity was determined in a gamma counter (LKB Wallac, Sollentuna, Sweden). For dissociation experiments, 4 × 105 cells/50 μl were preincubated at 4 °C for2hinthe presence of 20 ng/ml 125I-TNF-α in binding buffer. Subsequently, the cells were suspended in 50 μl of prewarmed (37 °C) binding buffer containing 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled TNF-α on a mineral oil layer. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 10 s to 10 min, followed by separation of the cells by centrifugation and counting of cell-bound radioactivity as described above. Unspecific binding was determined in parallel by incubating cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml 125I-TNF-α and 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled TNF-α at 4 °C for 2 h and was subtracted from total binding. All experiments were performed in triplicates.

Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell Death Assay—Cell viability was determined by crystal violet uptake (15Weiss T. Grell M. Siemienski K. Muhlenbeck F. Durkop H.

Cells were stimulated with freshly prepared serial dilutions of various TNF-α-like agents in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) with or without prestimulation with Cys-R2TNF for 6 h. Where indicated, mouse antibody 80M2 was used for cross-linking of TNFR2 at 2 μg/ml for 30 min before stimulation. After 24 h cells were washed three times in PBS and stained for 15 min (20% methanol, 0.5% crystal violet). Cells were washed three times with water and air-dried followed by dissolving of the dye with methanol. Optical density at 550 nm was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays plate reader (Milenia Kinetic, DPC Biermann GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 6-well plates overnight, followed by stimulation as indicated. Western blots were performed as described (35Rosenstiel P. Fantini M. Brautigam K. Kuhbacher T. Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Schreiber S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Lysed cells were cleared from debris by centrifugation and supernatants were collected. 15 μg of protein extract was separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking, membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To determine even transfer and equal loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody specific for β-actin (Sigma). Luciferase Assay—For quantification of NF-κB activity, transient transfection was used. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.5 × 104 (HeLa) or 8 × 103 (MEF) per well. The next day, cells were transfected with 35 ng of pcDNA3.1TNFR2196MET, pcDNA3.1TNFR2196ARG, or pcDNA3.1 empty vector (mock-control) together with 12 ng of 3× NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (Clontech) and 3 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) for normalization of transfection efficiency and cell viability. After 18 h (HeLa) or 36 h (MEF) of incubation, medium was exchanged by medium containing cross-linking antibody 80M2 (2 μg/ml) where indicated or pure medium. Cells were incubated for 30 min, followed by addition of freshly prepared serial dilutions of indicated agents. After another 18-h incubation (6 h for MEF), cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Dual luciferase assay was performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a MicroLumatPlus luminometer (Berthold, Bundoora, Australia). Target Gene Expression—Stable HeLa transfectants (5 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 6-well plate overnight. The following day cells were stimulated with freshly prepared dilutions of TNFR2-specific Cys-R2TNF ranging from 100 to 1 ng/ml or left untreated for 18 h. After washing, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Quiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed by Advantage-RT-for-PCR (Clontech), and expression of TNF-α target genes was assayed by using sequence specific primers and standard PCR procedures. The following primer pairs were used: β-actin, 5′-GAT GGT GGG CAT GGG TCA G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′ (reverse); BCL-XL, 5′-GCG TGG AAA GCG TAG ACA A-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCA TTT CCG ACT GAA GAG TGA G-3′ (reverse); cIAP1, 5′-GCC TGA TGC TGG ATA ACT GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT CTT GCC AAT TCT GAT GG-3′ (reverse); cIAP2, 5′-GCC TGA TGC TGG ATA ACT GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC GAC AGA AAA GTC AAT GG-3′ (reverse); IL-6, 5′-GAA CTC CTT CTC CAC AAG CGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGG CAA GTC TCC TCA TTG AAT CC-3′ (reverse); IL-8, 5′-ACC GGA AGG AAC CAT CTC ACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA CTT CTC CAC AAC CCT CTG C-3′ (reverse); TNFR1, 5′-CTG TAC CAA GTG CCA CAA AGG A-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT GCA ATT GAA GCA CTG GA-3′ (reverse); TRAF1, 5′-GAG GTG GAC TCT CAC CAA ATG AGA AGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCC TTT GGG GTT ATA CAT TGC TCA GTG G-3′ (reverse); TRAF3, 5′-AAG CAG ACA GCA TGA AGA GCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT TGA ATG CAT CTC CCA AAT G-3′. Resulting amplicons were resolved on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized through a UV light digital imaging system. Images were evaluated using densitometrical software (SigmaGel, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). For each mRNA, the number of cycles directly above detection level (linear phase) was determined and used for evaluation. ELISA—Stably transfected HeLa cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well. The following day cells were stimulated with freshly prepared dilutions of Cys-R2TNF as described above or left untreated. After 24 h of incubation, supernatants were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and assayed for IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF release using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (BIOSOURCE) and an ELISA plate reader. Normalization for cell number was performed using a modified crystal violet uptake protocol. Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were seeded on sterile cover slips at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and grown overnight. The next day cells were transiently transfected with 170 ng/well of pEGFP-TRAF2 and 333 ng/well of either pcDNA3.1TNFR2196MET or pcDNA3.1TNFR2196ARG using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h the medium was replaced by medium containing cross-linking antibody 80M2 (2 μg/ml) or pure medium, followed by 30 min of incubation. Cells were stimulated with 10 or 100 ng/ml Cys-R2TNF for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 80M2 in PBS + bovine serum albumin (0.1%) for 30 min and goat-anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (Molecular Probes) conjugate in the dark. Omitting the primary antibody and transfection with an empty EGFP-construct served as negative control. Slips were transferred to glass slides and examined using a TCS-SP1 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). Coimmunoprecipitation—TNFR2196MET-, TNFR2196ARG-, or mock-transfected HeLa cells were seeded in 10-ml dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish and grown overnight. The next day, cells were stimulated with 10 or 100 ng/ml Cys-R2TNF for 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plates, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm NaF, and a mixture protease and phosphatase inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture and PICII, Sigma) by vortexing three times for 45 s. After preclearing of lysate by incubation with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and centrifugation, TNFR2 complexes were precipitated using 2 μg monoclonal mouse anti-TNFR2 IgG (Abcam) for 2 h and protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. Precipitates were washed three times, denatured by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrilotriacetic acid membranes, samples were probed for precipitated TNFR2 using rabbit anti-TNFR2 antibody and, after stripping, for co-precipitated TRAF2 using rabbit anti-TRAF2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Expression of TNFR2 Variants in HeLa Cells—To investigate the effect of TNFR2 variants on TNF-α-mediated signaling events and TNF-α-induced apoptosis, we stably transfected HeLa cells with plasmids carrying the full-length cDNA for either the wild type TNFR2196MET or the mutant TNFR2196ARG or with empty vector (mock-transfection). HeLa cells do not express endogenous TNFR2 at detectable levels (36Grell M. Wajant H. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arinobu Y. Otsuka T. Sawabe T. Harashima S. Nagasawa K. Niho Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in the FACS analysis in Fig. 1, stably transfected cells expressed nearly identical levels of TNFR2 (approximately 50,000 receptors/cell; data not shown), while expression was undetectable in parental and mock-transfected HeLa. The percentage of positive cells was 78.4% for TNFR2196MET and 81.1% for TNFR2196ARG cells. To rule out an influence of the mutation on antibody affinity, different antibodies were used which gave nearly identical results. Thus, different expression levels of the two receptor variants can be ruled out to cause the observed effects. Physiological Binding Characteristics of TNFR2196MET and TNFR2196ARG Variants—The determination of binding kinetics under physiological conditions (37 °C) showed no differences between the two variants of TNFR2 in TNFR1/2 double-deficient MEF cells reconstituted with either TNFR2196MET or TNFR2196ARG (Fig. 2). Association of radioactively labeled TNF (125I-TNF) at 10 ng/ml appeared with a t½ of 60-65 s for both variants, dissociation half-life time was determined with t½ of 68-75 s. Both binding parameters are in good accordance with previous results for wild-type TNFR2 (19Krippner-Heidenreich A. Tubing F. Bryde S. Willi S. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. J. Biol.

Differential Induction of Cell Death by TNFR2196MET and TNFR2196ARG Variants; Influences of Soluble TNF-α, Crosslinking, and Receptor-specific Muteins—In a first approach, we studied the induction of cell death by different stimuli in our cell system. As described earlier, HeLa cells do not undergo apoptosis by TNF-α alone, but are sensitive to TNF-α in the presence of low doses of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (2.5 μg/ml) (40Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).

An alteration of a single residue of the membrane anchor converted it into an antibacterial peptide. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that all peptides are disordered in water but helical in micelles. Structures of the peptides were determined in membrane-mimetic micelles by solution NMR spectroscopy. The quality of the distance-based structures was improved by including backbone angle restraints derived from a set of chemical shifts (1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ) from natural abundance two-dimensional heteronuclear correlated spectroscopy. Different from the membrane anchor, antibacterial peptides possess a broader and longer hydrophobic surface, allowing a deeper penetration into the membrane, as supported by intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peaks between the peptide and short chain dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol.

Recent interest in the search for alternative therapeutics is growing because of the drug resistance problem with traditional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides have attracted much attention because of their favorable properties, such as rapid killing, wide spectrum, and rare development of drug resistance. It is believed that these properties of antimicrobial peptides can be attributed to their ability to target bacterial membranes (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev.

Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39811-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both states are essential for the protein cascade to ensure a successful phosphoryl transfer from the high energy molecule phosphoenolpyruvate to the incoming glucose. Membrane association of IIAGlc is achieved through an N-terminal membrane anchor (hereinafter referred to as peptide A1), which, according to two-dimensional NMR characterization, forms a short three-turn amphipathic helical structure in phospholipids (6Wang G. Keifer P.A. Peterkofsky A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because another membrane-targeting sequence similar to this anchor is conserved in other species (7Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the structure of the N-terminal domain of IIAGlc is a useful model for understanding those membrane anchors (6Wang G. Keifer P.A. Peterkofsky A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To provide an analytical tool for structural and functional studies of antimicrobial peptides, we have created a user-friendly antimicrobial peptide database (aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.html) (8Wang Z. Wang G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D590-D592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is of outstanding interest to note that the N-terminal sequence of the above bacterial membrane anchor, GLFD, is identical to those of 13 antibacterial peptides collected in the database. Because all of these peptides start with the sequence GLFD, we may refer to them as the GLFD family. Such a sequence similarity between an E. coli membrane anchor (6Wang G. Keifer P.A. Peterkofsky A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a group of antimicrobial peptides from Australian frogs (9Rozek T. Wegener K.L. Bowie J.H. Olver I.N. Caver J.A. Wallace J.C. Tyler M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5330-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) suggests that they might have originated from the same ancestral gene a long time ago. Because both types of peptides act on bacterial membranes, one toxic and the other nontoxic, we are curious to learn what determines their functional differences. Therefore, we have designed a series of peptides (peptides A2, A3, and A4) starting from the bacterial membrane anchor (peptide A1) (6Wang G. Keifer P.A. Peterkofsky A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and ending at a known antibacterial peptide, aurein 1.2 (peptide A5) (9Rozek T. Wegener K.L. Bowie J.H. Olver I.N.

Antimicrobial peptides are usually cationic with less than 50 residues (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet Infect.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D590-D592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, they are very suitable for NMR studies. In the antimicrobial peptide database (8Wang Z. Wang G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D590-D592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 68 peptides (13%) have been investigated by traditional two-dimensional homonuclear NMR spectroscopy in lipid-mimetic environments such as organic solvents or detergent micelles (9Rozek T. Wegener K.L. Bowie J.H. Olver I.N. Caver J.A. Wallace J.C. Tyler M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5330-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Gesell J. Zaslof M. Opella S.J. J. Biomol.

In micelles, structures of antimicrobial peptides are determined based primarily on distance restraints derived from NOEs (10Gesell J. Zaslof M. Opella S.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W.

This is because scalar coupling data, which also contain valuable structural information (12Wu ̈thrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), are not amenable to measure by homonuclear NMR methods as a result of line broadening of peptide signals from micelle binding. In contrast, chemical shifts are easy to measure and provide an alternative approach to obtaining angle restraints by using the NMR program TALOS (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). Although TALOS-derived angle restraints have been included in the structural refinement of isotope-labeled proteins, the use of such restraints in the structural refinement of micelle-bound peptides without isotope labeling has not been demonstrated. We show in this study the improvement of the structural quality of these peptides using backbone angle restraints predicted by TALOS based on a set of heteronuclear chemical shifts. This work benefitted from the recent installation of a cool probe to the 600-MHz NMR spectrometer, which allows rapid data collection in hours, even for natural abundance peptides. High quality structures allow a better correlation with the activity of these peptides. Although no good correlation was found between the peptide activity and numerous structural parameters, the membrane perturbation potential as we defined shows a nice correlation. Materials—All antibacterial peptides (>95%) investigated here are synthesized and purified by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco). The primary sequences and related information for these peptides can be found in Table I. Deuterated SDS (>99%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Protonated DOPG (>98%), dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (>99%) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Chloroform was removed from phospholipids under a stream of nitrogen gas followed by evaporation under vacuum overnight. The lipids and SDS were used without further purification. Lipid Vesicles—The lipid vesicles (4 mm) of dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (25%) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (75%) (molar ratio) in 25 mm Tris buffer in D2O, pD 7, were made as described previously (51Banerjee U. Zidovetzki R. Birge R.R. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7621-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by repeated cycles of vortexing on a mixer and 30-s heating in a water bath at 57 °C. Antibacterial Assay—The E. coli strain K12 3000 was a gift from Dr. Alan Peterkofsky (National Institutes of Health). The antibacterial activity of the peptides was analyzed using the standard approach of microdilution (14Yu K. Park K. Kang S.-W. Shin S.Y. Hahm K.-S. Kim Y. J. Peptide Res. 2002; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, a small culture was grown overnight. A fresh culture was inoculated with a small aliquot of the overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C until the optical density reached the logarithm stage. The culture was then diluted and partitioned into a 96-well plate with ∼106 cells/well (90 μl each). The cells were then treated with 10 μl of the peptide at a series of concentrations, allowing the minimum inhibition concentration measurement for each. The plate was then further incubated at the same temperature overnight (∼16 h) and read on an Ultra Microplate Reader at 620 nm (Bio-TEK Instruments). CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected at 25 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter from 185 to 250 nm using a 0.1-mm path length cell, with a scan rate of 100 nm/min, a time constant 1.0 s, a band width of 1 nm, and a sensitivity of 100 millidegrees. Each spectrum is the average of 20 scans. After background subtraction, the spectrum was expressed in molar ellipticity. NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR measurements, the peptide concentration is typically ∼2mm in 0.6 ml of aqueous solution of 90% H2O and 10% D2O at pH 5.4. The pH of each sample was adjusted by using microliter aliquots of HCl or NaOH solution and measured directly in the 5-mm NMR tube with a micro-pH electrode (Wilmad-Labglass). Based on detergent titrations, the peptide/SDS molar ratio was 1:40 and the peptide/DOPG ratio was 1:5. All proton NMR data were collected at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe. A set of NMR spectra was collected for each peptide using States-TPPI (15Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). NOESY spectra (16Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4828) Google Scholar) were acquired at mixing times of 50, 100, and 150 ms for peptide-micelle complexes. For peptides in water, NOESY spectra were collected at 200 ms. TOCSY experiments were performed with a mixing time of 75 ms using a clean MLEV-17 pulse sequence (17Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 18Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 19Griesinger C. Otting G. Wu ̈thrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). ROSEY spectra (20Bax A. Grzesiek S. Grant D.M. Harris R.K. Encyclopedia of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. 1996: 4157-4167Google Scholar) were collected at a mixing time of 35 ms. Typically, two-dimensional homonuclear spectra were collected with 512 increments (16-32 scans each) in t1 and 2,048 data points in t2 time domains using a spectral width of 8,510.6 Hz in both dimensions with the 1H carrier on the water resonance. The water signal was suppressed by low power presaturation during both the relaxation delay and the mixing period in NOESY experiments and during relaxation delay only for TOCSY (18Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) and DQF-COSY (21Rance M. S ørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Enrst R.R. Wu ̈thrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) experiments. To obtain backbone 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts, gradient-enhanced HSQC spectra (22Kay L.E. Keifer P.A. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), between 1H and 15N as well as between 1H and 13C, were collected at the natural abundance on the Varian 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 1H, 15N, and 13C carriers were set at 4.77, 118.27, and 36.37 ppm, respectively. Typically 30 increments (128 scans) and 80 increments (256 scans) were collected for the 15N (spectral width 2,200 Hz) and aliphatic 13C (spectral width 12,000 Hz) dimensions, respectively. 31P NMR spectra for vesicles, consisting of a mixture of the E. coli lipids, were recorded on a 500 MHz Varian NMR spectrometer (202.2 MHz 31P frequency) at 25 °C. The 90° pulse for 31P on this direct detected probe is 9 μs. 160,000 complex data points were collected at a spectral width of 50 kHz and a relaxation delay of 1.5 s with proton decoupling. The 31P chemical shift of phosphoric acid (85%) was set at 0.0 ppm. All NMR data were processed on an Octane work station (SGI) using the NMRPipe software (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). The data points in the indirect dimension were doubled by liner prediction (24Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 405-410Google Scholar). NMR data were apodized by a 63° shifted squared sine-bell window function in both dimensions, zero-filled prior to Fourier transformation to yield a data matrix of 2,048 × 1,024. Because anionic DSS interacts with cationic peptides (6Wang G. Keifer P.A. Peterkofsky A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was not used as an internal chemical shift standard to prevent the detergent additive effect. Instead, the proton chemical shifts of the peptide were referenced to the water signal, which in turn was referenced to internal DSS at 0.00 ppm (25Hartel A.J. Lankhorst P.P. Altona C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced based on the ratios recommended by IUPAC (26Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). NMR data were analyzed with the program PIPP (27Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The peptide proton signals were assigned using the standard procedure (12Wu ̈thrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) based on two-dimensional TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY spectra. 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts of the peptides were assigned on the basis of the known proton chemical shifts. Occasional ambiguity in assigning heteronuclear chemical shifts as a result of overlap is removed by comparison with a spectrum collected at a slightly different temperature or by comparison with standard chemical shifts as well as with the assignments of other similar peptides investigated here. Structure Calculations—Three-dimensional structures of the peptides in SDS-d25 at pH 5.4 and 25 °C were calculated based on both distance and angle restraints by using the simulated annealing protocol (28Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Bru ̈nger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) in the National Institutes of Health version of X-PLOR (29Bru ̈nger A.T. X-PLOR: A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar, 30Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 160: 65-73Crossref Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). To see the impact of TALOS-derived backbone angles on the structural quality, a separate calculation was performed for each peptide by omitting those angle restraints. The distance restraints were obtained by classifying the NOE cross-peak volumes into strong (1.8-2.8 Å), medium (1.8-3.8 Å), weak (1.8-5.0 Å), and very weak (1.8-6.0 Å) ranges (31Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 479-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The distance was calibrated on the basis of the typical NOE patterns in an α helix (12Wu ̈thrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Peptide backbone restraints were obtained from the TALOS (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar) analysis of a set of heteronuclear chemical shifts, including 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 15N. A broader range (±20°) than predicted was allowed for each angle in the structural calculations. The side chain χ1 angles were derived from a combined analysis of a short mixing time NOESY and ROESY spectra (32Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A list of the number of NMR distance and angle restraints used for structural calculations of each peptide is given in Table II. A covalent peptide structure with random φ, Ψ, and χ angles but trans-planar peptide bonds was used as a starting structure. All peptide structural templates were also amidated at the C terminus using X-PLOR (29Bru ̈nger A.T. X-PLOR: A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). In total, 100 structures were calculated. An ensemble of 50 structures with the lowest total energy was chosen for structural analysis. This final ensemble of accepted structures satisfies the following criteria: no NOE violations greater than 0.50 Å, r.m.s.d. for bond deviations from the ideal less than 0.01 Å, and r.m.s.d. for angle deviations from the ideal less than 5°.Table IIStructural statistics of group A peptides bound to SDS micelles at a peptide/SDS molar ratio of 1:40, pH 5.4, and 25 °CPeptideHelixaThe helix percentage for each peptide was calculated based on the average secondary shift of Hα divided by 0.35, where a 100% helix is assumed (49, 50).

An important enzyme of this unusual pathway is trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.44), which catalyzes reduction of enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase from Euglena was purified 1700-fold to electrophoretic homogeneity and was active with NADH and NADPH as the electron donor. The active enzyme is a monomer with molecular mass of 44 kDa. The amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry were used to clone the corresponding cDNA, which encoded a polypeptide that, when expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography, possessed trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity close to that of the enzyme purified from Euglena. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity is present in mitochondria and the mRNA is expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Using NADH, the recombinant enzyme accepted crotonyl-CoA (km = 68 μm) and trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA (km = 91 μm). In the crotonyl-CoA-dependent reaction, both NADH (km = 109 μm) or NADPH (km = 119 μm) were accepted, with 2–3-fold higher specific activities for NADH relative to NADPH. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase homologues were not found among other eukaryotes, but are present as hypothetical reading frames of unknown function in sequenced genomes of many proteobacteria and a few Gram-positive eubacteria, where they occasionally occur next to genes involved in fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis.

The mitochondrion of the photosynthetic flagellate Euglena gracilis is a facultatively anaerobic organelle that produces ATP under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate from glycolysis enters the mitochondrion and undergoes oxidative decarboxylation, the resulting acetyl-CoA enters a modified tricarboxylic acid cycle entailing a succinate-semialdehyde shunt as found in the α-proteobacerium Bradyrhizobium (1Green L.S. Li Y. Emerich D.W. Bergersen F.J. Day D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2238-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Electrons from glucose breakdown are transferred to oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (2Buetow D.E. Buetow D.E. The Biology of Euglena. 4.

In the absence of oxygen, acetyl-CoA stemming from pyruvate serves as the terminal electron acceptor of glucose oxidation via an unusual mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (4Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The shift to anaerobic conditions leads to the malonyl-CoA-independent synthesis of wax esters, levels of which can reach up to 40 μg/106 Euglena cells, from its reserve polysaccharide paramylon (5Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 89-93Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The wax ester fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA stemming from pyruvate via an unusual oxygen-sensitive enzyme, pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (6Inui H. Ono K. Miyatake K. Nakano Y.

Chem. 1980; 255: 1504-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The third, a multifunctional fatty acid synthase (FAS I) whose main products are C16 fatty acids with C14 and C18 chain lengths as minor products, is located in the cytosol of Euglena (12Goldberg I.

Biophys. 1973; 158: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fifth is the mitochondrial system, which is involved in anaerobic wax ester fermentation. It uses acetyl-CoA as primer and C2-donor, a portion of the fatty acids is reduced to alcohols, esterified with another fatty acid, and deposited in the cytosol as waxes (2Buetow D.E. Buetow D.E.

Synthesis of odd numbered fatty acids starts from propionyl-CoA, which is synthesized via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway (17Nagai J. Otha T. Saito E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Rotte C. van Grinsven K.W.A. van Hellemond J.J. Henze K. Tielens A.G.M. Martin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22422-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The net biochemistry of wax ester fermentation has been characterized, but the enzymes of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis in Euglena have not been characterized at the molecular level so far. This fatty acid synthesis has been formally described as a reversal of β-oxidation (2Buetow D.E. Buetow D.E. The Biology of Euglena. 4. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 247-314Google Scholar, 15Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) because it proceeds via CoA rather than acyl carrier protein-bound intermediates. But there is a key difference relative to β-oxidation: a trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.44), designated here as TER, reduces the double bond in enoyl-CoA to produce acyl-CoA (15Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In β-oxidation this step is oxidative and irreversible under physiological conditions because acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (mitochondrial β-oxidation) and acyl-CoA oxidase (peroxisomal β-oxidation) are both linked to O2 reduction (20Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 264-342Crossref Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 21Graham I.A. Eastmond P.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 156-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here we report the localization, purification, mass spectrometry sequencing, cloning, heterologous expression in E. coli, and kinetic parameters of TER from Euglena mitochondria. Medium and Culture Conditions—Fermenter culture of E. gracilis strain Z (SAG 1224–5/25 collection of algae Göttingen) and isolation of mitochondria was performed as described (9van der Hoffmeister M.

Enzyme Assay—The assay for TER activity was performed according to Inui et al. (15Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Eur. J.

The standard assay mixture contained potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 0.5 mm crotonyl-CoA (Sigma), 0.4 mm NADH, 2 μm FAD and enzyme. The assay mixture without substrate was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C and the reaction was started with the addition of the substrate. Activity was determined by decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. The final assay volumes were 1 ml (Ultrospec 2000 Spectrophotometer, Amersham Biosciences) or 200 μl (GENios microplate reader, Tecan Instruments). Kinetic parameters of TER were estimated using substrate concentrations of 5–1000 μm for crotonyl-CoA (Sigma) and trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA, which was kindly provided by Prof. K.

Purification of Euglena trans-2-Enoyl-CoA Reductase—All steps were performed at 4 °C with the exception of the fast protein liquid chromatography steps, which were carried out at room temperature. One kg of Euglena cells were homogenized in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD) using a French Press and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant of a 30% ammonium sulfate cut was dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD) to <6 μS/cm and applied in 10 runs to a 2.6 × 12-cm DEAE Fractogel EMD 650 S column (Merck). The column was washed with 180 ml of buffer B, proteins were eluted in a 100-ml gradient of 0–1 m KCl in buffer B, fractions of 2 ml were collected. Fractions with TER activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 m NH4(SO4)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD), and loaded in four runs to a 2.6 × 14-cm Phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 140 ml of buffer C, proteins were eluted in a 140-ml gradient of 1–0 m NH4(SO4)2 in buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μm FAD). Fractions (2.5 ml each) with TER activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and bound in five runs to a 1.6 × 9-cm Reactive Red 120 column (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B, proteins were eluted in a 200-ml gradient of 0–1 m KCl in buffer B, fractions of 3 ml were collected. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD) and applied in eight runs to a Eco-PacCHT II Cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer E. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer E, proteins were eluted in a 25-ml gradient of buffer E to buffer F (500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD). Fractions with TER activity (1 ml each) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer D, and bound in three runs to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer D. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer D, proteins were eluted in a 20-ml gradient of 0–1 m KCl in buffer D, fractions of 280 μl were collected. Active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore), applied in six runs to a continuous, preparative 6-cm 6% native polyacrylamide gel (Mini-Prepcell, Bio-Rad), electrophoresed at 250 V, and proteins were eluted at 100 μl/min in buffer G (50 mm Tris, 25 mm borate, pH 8.7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD). Fractions of 200 μl were collected, fractions with TER activity were dialyzed against buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FAD) and loaded in three runs to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer H. Proteins were eluted with 25 ml of buffer H, fractions of 230 μl were collected and assayed for TER activity. Active fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE and applied to in-gel digestion for subsequent ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. In-gel Digestion and ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS Analysis—The band of the purified enzyme was cut from the gel, washed twice with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and incubated successively with 100% acetonitrile, 100 mm NH4HCO3, and 100 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1). After vacuum drying, the gel pieces were reswollen with 10 ng μl–1 trypsin (Promega) and digested for 12 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted in 5% (v/v) formic acid using a sonication bath. Prior to mass spectrometry, samples were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore). ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides was performed with a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass). Hybridization Probe, Cloning, and Heterologous Expression—Standard molecular and biochemical methods, cDNA synthesis, and cloning in λ ZAPII were performed as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

PCR was performed, after initial denaturation for 10 min at 98 °C, for 30 cycles with 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, final extension at 72 °C for 5 min in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 1 μm of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Eppendorf), and 10–20 ng of cDNA as template. A 839-bp product was amplified with the primers 5′-GGITGGTAYA-AYACIGTIGC-3′ and 5′-GTYTCRTAICCIGCRAARTC-3′ (designed against the sequenced peptides 7 and 9 of purified Euglena TER). This fragment was cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), sequenced and used as hybridization probe to screen an Euglena cDNA library. Five independent positives were isolated and sequenced, all five represented the same transcript and varied only in length. The insert of one plasmid so derived, pEgTER1, was sequenced completely double-stranded via deletion by exonuclease III (26Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). Two different parts of the pEgTER1 were chosen for heterologous expression in E. coli. The two constructs were amplified from Euglena cDNA as described above using the primers: TER1Ndefor, 5′-TATACATATGTCGTGCCCCGCCTCGCCGTCTG-3′; TER1Bglfor, 5′-TATAGATCTTATGTCGTGCCCCGCCTCGCCGTC-TG-3′; TER2Ndefor, 5′-TATACATATGTTCACCACCACAGCGAAGGT-CATCC-3′; and TERXhorev, 5′-TATCTCGAGCTACTGCTGGGCAGCA-CTGG-3′ to introduce 5′-NdeI, respectively, 5′-BglII and 3′-XhoI restrictions sites. The amplification products were cloned into pET28a or pET32a (Novagen), cut with the same restriction enzymes, and expressed in the E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3) or Rosetta(DE3) (both Novagen).

Purification and Microsequencing of Euglena TER—Early work on E. gracilis trans-enoyl-CoA reductase uncovered its involvement in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis wax ester formation under anaerobic conditions (4Inui H.

Biochem. 1984; 142: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found roughly equal levels of NADH- and NAPDH-dependent TER activity in mitochondria isolated from both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells (Table I). The activity of the mitochondrial-specific marker enzyme of Euglena, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, was enriched 9-fold in the mitochondrial fraction versus crude extract, whereas TER was enriched even more (Table I) with no detectable TER activity in chloroplasts, suggesting that most if not all of the TER activity is localized in the mitochondrion.Table IMeasurement of marker enzymes and TER in cell fractions from E. gracilis ± S.D.Crude extract, aerobicMitochondriaChloroplasts, anaerobicAerobicAnaerobicnmol mg-1 min-1nmol mg-1 min-1nmol mg-1 min-1nmol mg-1 min-1SSDH (n = 6)18.8 ± 5.8173 ± 23154 ± 13NDaND, not detectable.GAPDH (NADP+) (n = 6)431 ± 16NDND5046 ± 320LDH (n = 6)17950 ± 15702 ± 0.86 ± 0.7NDTER NADH (n = 10)5.7 ± 1.763.5 ± 1266.3 ± 12NDTER NADPH (n = 4)NMbNM, not measured.86.4 ± 1377.6 ± 28NMa ND, not detectable.b NM, not measured. Open table in a new tab In contrast to earlier purification protocols (31Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we were unable to observe binding of TER to carboxymethylcellulose or other cation exchangers. We therefore established a new purification protocol starting from the Euglena crude extract. The purification procedure involves a 30% ammonium sulfate cut, anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction, affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, native PAGE, and gel filtration (Table II). This procedure yielded 1687-fold purification of an electrophoretically homogeneous TER preparation (Fig. 1) with a relative molecular mass of ∼44 kDa and a specific enzyme activity of 3879 nmol mg–1 min–1 (Table II). Gel filtration was applied as the final purification step and the TER activity was eluted in a single peak (Fig. 2) with molecular mass of ∼44 kDa (Fig. 2), corresponding to the molecular mass in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), indicating that the active enzyme is a monomer. Active fractions of the last purification step were separately electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3). The 44-kDa band coeluted with TER activity (Fig. 3). The 44-kDa bands (a major band and a weak doublet) were cut from the gel (marked with arrows in Fig. 3) and independently sequenced by electrospray mass spectrometry after tryptic digestion. Seventeen different internal peptide sequences were identified from purified TER protein (Table III). Below the major TER band, its weak doublet at ∼42 kDa (visible in Fig. 1) was also excised from the gel and independently sequenced; it gave the same tryptic peptides with the same amino acid sequences. The minor difference in electrophoretic mobility may be because of cofactor loss during SDS-PAGE or other electrophoretic anomaly.Table IIPurification of Euglena trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductasePurification stepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationnmolmgnmol/mg/min-foldCrude extract233,56940,9775.730% ammonium sulfate cut and dialysis57,27724,9032.3DEAE Fractogel34,47345367.63Phenyl-Sepharose14,666116412.66Reactive red14,25817880.135Hydroxyapatite13,37558230.6100Mono Q28018.4333.5145Native PAGE5870.331778.7773Superdex5590.1443879.21687 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Elution profile of TER after chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column.

Degenerate primers corresponding to peptides 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12, each with forward and reverse direction were used for PCR against Euglena cDNA. Peptide 7 (forward) and peptide 9 (reverse) primers amplified a 839-bp product, the sequence of which contained 10 additional peptides determined from purified TER (Fig. 4), identifying the probe as TER-specific. Screening of 250,000 recombinant phages in a Euglena cDNA library yielded five independent clones of differing length from the same transcript (Fig. 4). One clone, pEgTER1, contained a full-length cDNA as indicated by the presence of a 5′-TTTTCG-3′ spliced leader at the 5′ end (32Tessier L.H. Keller M. Chan R.L. Fournier R. Weil J.H. Imbault P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was 1912 bp long with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1617 nucleotides encoding a protein of 539 amino acid residues (Fig. 4). Northern hydridization revealed that Euglena TER was expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 5). TER cDNA Expressed in E. coli Is Active—Data base comparisons (see next section) revealed that the C-terminal 405 aa encoded by pEgTER1 were strongly conserved with proteins of unknown function from sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The complete ORF of pEgTER1 in addition to the 405-aa C-terminal region were amplified and cloned into expression vectors pET28a and pET32a and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli Rosetta(DE3). Induction by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight yielded expression of the complete TER ORF in pET32a and Rosetta(DE3) as shown by immunodetection of the His tag in the soluble fraction and after purification by Ni-NTA chromatography (Fig. 6). The detected band shows the expected size of 78 kDa, corresponding to the open reading frame of 59 kDa plus 19 kDa of the thioredoxin tag, but the protein was enzymatically inactive. However, when the C-terminal region of pEgTER1 beginning with Met135 (Fig. 4) was expressed in pET28a with BL21(DE3) as revealed by immunodetection of the His tag, the resulting protein was both soluble and active, also after Ni-NTA purification (Fig. 7). The reasons why the complete ORF was inactive while the Ni-NTA-purified 405-aa construct did possess high TER-specific activity are not fully clear. But because the 405-aa construct lacks the transit peptide-coding region needed to target the protein into mitochondria and has nearly the same molecular mass (45 kDa, Fig. 7) as the protein purified from Euglena (44 kDa, Fig. 1), it appears that the transit peptide-coding region present in the complete ORF interferes with enzymatic activity (see “Discussion”).Fig. 7Western blot analysis with immunodetection of the 405-aa C-terminal part of the TER cDNA clone in pET28a expressed in BL21(DE3).

We studied the cardiac role of CREM in transgenic mice with heart-directed expression of CREM-IbΔC-X, a human cardiac CREM isoform. Transgenic mice displayed atrial enlargement with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy, developed atrial fibrillation, and died prematurely. In vivo hemodynamic assessment revealed increased contractility of transgenic left ventricles probably due to a selective up-regulation of SERCA2, the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In transgenic ventricles, reduced phosphorylation of phospholamban and of the CREB was associated with increased activity of serine-threonine protein phosphatase 1. The density of β1-adrenoreceptor was increased, and messenger RNAs encoding transcription factor dHAND and small G-protein RhoB were decreased in transgenic hearts as compared with wild-type controls. Our results indicate that heart-directed expression of CREM-IbΔC-X leads to complex cardiac alterations, suggesting CREM as a central regulator of cardiac morphology, function, and gene expression.

Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 269-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CREB and CREM bind as homo- or heterodimers to the CRE, a palindromic consensus element in gene promoters of numerous target genes. One mechanism of CRE-mediated transcriptional activation is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of a critical serine in activating isoforms of CREB or CREM, finally leading to activation of the transcriptional complex (2Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Inhibitory CREM or CREB isoforms lack functional domains that mediate transcriptional activation or regulation by phosphorylation. Those repressors bind to the CRE as homodimers or as heterodimers in combination with other activating or inhibitory isoforms and suppress transcriptional activation by displacing functionally active dimers from the CRE. Several studies suggested that CRE-mediated transcriptional regulation plays an important role in cardiac gene regulation contributing to the pathophysiology of heart failure: (i) CREB and CREM are both expressed in human heart (3Mu ̈ller F.U.

Those proteins are only composed of the respective basic region/leucine zipper domains for dimerization/CRE-specific DNA binding and act as suppressors of CRE-mediated transcriptional activation. Whereas CREB-W and CREMΔC-X are implicated in spermatogenesis and in decidualization of endometrial stromal cells, respectively (9Walker W.H. Girardet C. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the function of CREM-IbΔC-X in the heart is not known. We studied the specific cardiac role of CREM-IbΔC-X in transgenic mice with heart-directed expression of this isoform fused to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope to allow the immunological identification of CREM repressors HIbI and HIbII. We show that HIbII is generated from CREM-IbΔC-X mRNA in transgenic hearts in vivo, combined with HIbI in one of two founder lines. In CREM-IbΔC-X transgenic mice, ventricular hypertrophy was accompanied by increased left ventricular (LV) contractility; selective up-regulation of SERCA2, the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR); by decreased phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) and of CREB, probably due to increased activity of serine-threonine protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1); and by premature death. Transcription factor dHAND and small G-protein RhoB were identified as potential cardiac target genes of CREM-IbΔC-X, which were down-regulated in transgenic ventricles. In addition, transgenic hearts developed considerable dilatation of atria followed by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Our results identify CREM as a central transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte function and gene expression with unique properties fundamentally different from other suppressors of CRE-mediated transcriptional activation.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity and orientation of the insert were verified by DNA sequencing. Transgenic FVB/N mice were generated by the Transgene Core Facility, Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, University of Münster, using a NruI-excised DNA fragment with the expression cassette. Two independently derived founder mice (Tg1 and Tg2) were identified on Southern blots and were continued on the same background or crossed with CD-1 mice for a separate set of experiments (Tg1FVB/N:CD-1). Experimentation was performed with transgenic mice and age-matched wild-type littermates (WFVB/N; WFVB/N:CD-1) aged 12–16 weeks according to approved protocols of local animal welfare authorities. Northern Blot Analysis—Total ventricular RNA was prepared using the RNA Midiprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 3 μg/lane of total RNA were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membrane (Genescreen, DuPont, Boston, MA), and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for ANP or GAPDH following standard protocols. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from three mouse ventricles per group as published (5Fentzke R.C. Korcarz C.E. Lang R.M. Lin H. Leiden J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed with 14 μg of nuclear protein per binding reaction and double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing a perfectly matching CRE (TGACGTCA) or a mutated CRE (TTAAACCA; mutated bases underlined) as described (3Mu ̈ller F.U.

Nuclear extracts were preincubated with an HA-specific antibody (3 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for supershift experiments (3Mu ̈ller F.U. Boknik P. Horst A. Knapp J. Linck B.

Electrocardiography—Mice were sedated using ketamine (50 μg/g) and xylazine (5 μg/g) applied intraperitoneally. Three-lead surface limb electrocardiograms were obtained in a supine position (Megacard, Siemens, München, Germany) using a filter of 10–100 Hz. Left Ventricular Catheterization—Mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol, and LV function was invasively assessed as described (7Mu ̈ller F.U. Lewin G. Matus M. Neumann J. Riemann B. Wistuba J. Schu ̈tz G. Schmitz W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The β-AR agonist isoproterenol (40 pg/g body weight) was administered as published (5Fentzke R.C.

Radioligand Binding Assay—Cardiac ventricular membranes were prepared, and binding assays were performed as published (7Mu ̈ller F.U. Lewin G. Matus M. Neumann J. Riemann B. Wistuba J. Schu ̈tz G. Schmitz W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the nonselective β-AR ligand (±)-[125I]cyanopindolol (ICYP; Amersham Biosciences) and the selective β1-AR antagonist CGP20712A. Assays were performed in the presence and absence of alprenolol (20 μm) to quantify nonspecific ICYP binding, which was 30% at 80 pm ICYP. SDS-PAGE and Quantitative Immunoblotting—Preparation of LV homogenates, electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunological detection of total PLB (not differentiating between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms), PLB phosphorylated at Ser16, PLB phosphorylated at Thr17, SERCA2, calsequestrin, junctin, total CREB, and phosphorylated CREB were performed as described (7Mu ̈ller F.U.

HA-tagged CREM repressors were identified using HA-specific antibody (1:1000) and the ECF detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein kinases and phosphatases were determined using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and primary antibodies directed against the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CKII) (1:1000; both from BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1; catalytic subunit), and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A; catalytic subunit; both from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; 1:1000). Activated forms of different mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases were determined using the ECL detection system and phosphorylation-specific antibodies directed against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2; phosphorylated at Thr202 and Tyr204), phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (phosphorylated at Thr183 and Tyr185), and phospho-p38 MAP kinase (phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Protein Phosphatase Activity—Phosphatase activity was assayed as described using 32P-radiolabeled phosphorylase a as a substrate (14Boknik P. Fockenbrock M. Herzig S. Knapp J. Linck B. Luss H. Mu ̈ller F.U. Mu ̈ller T. Schmitz W. Schro ̈der F. Neumann J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined with 1 μg of tissue homogenate in the absence (equal to total activity) and in the presence of 3 nmol/liter okadaic acid (OA) and was expressed as a percentage of the mean of total activity in wild-type littermates. 3 nmol/liter OA inhibited activity of PP2A in this assay but did not inhibit PP1 activity (data not shown). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total ventricular RNA was prepared using the RNA Midiprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed using the RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) and the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) with the following primer pairs: dHAND, forward primer (5′-ACCCGCCGACACCAAACT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGTCTCCTCCTCCTCCTT-3′); RhoB, forward primer (5′-TGCCTGCTGATCGTGTTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCACTCGAGGTAGTCATAGG-3′); GAPDH, forward primer (5′-ATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGCCCCTCCTGTTATTATGG-3′). Values for mRNA levels were determined in duplicates or triplicates with the help of Lightcycler software version 3.5, using appropriate calibration curves obtained with different amounts of control cDNAs following the manufacturer's specifications. The specificity of PCR products was controlled by melting curve analyses and by standard PCRs followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. or as box plot (quantitative real time PCR). Statistically significant differences were determined using Student's unpaired t test, the log rank test (survival), or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test (quantitative real time PCR) with p < 0.05 considered as significant. Transgenic Mice Expressing CREM-IbΔC-X—We obtained two independent lines of transgenic mice, Tg1 and Tg2, with insertion of several copies of the transgene for expression of HA-tagged human CREM-IbΔC-X under control of the heart-specific α-MHC promoter. Northern blot analysis of cardiac total RNA revealed abundant mRNA production by the transgene (data not shown). A HA-specific antibody recognized a 14-kDa protein in ventricular homogenates from Tg2 and, more weakly, from Tg1 hearts (Fig. 1A). Another weak protein band of lower migration velocity was detected by the HA-specific antibody in hearts from Tg2 but not in Tg1. This indicates internal translation of HA-tagged CREM repressor proteins HIbI (96 amino acids) and HIbII (78 amino acids), which both have identical properties in regard to CRE-specific DNA-binding and suppression of CRE-mediated transcription (4Mu ̈ller F.U. Boknik P. Knapp J. Neumann J. Vahlensieck U. Oetjen E. Scheld H.H. Schmitz W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from CREM-IbΔC-X mRNA in vivo. The predominance of the smaller CREM protein, putative HIbII (78 amino acids), agrees well with the context around the second AUG in exon H (for translation of HIbII), representing a perfect Kozak sequence for effective translation, whereas the first AUG (for translation of HIbI) does not fully comply with the Kozak rules (4Mu ̈ller F.U. Boknik P. Knapp J. Neumann J. Vahlensieck U. Oetjen E. Scheld H.H. Schmitz W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Both protein bands were not detected in lung or liver tissue and were observed in atrial and right ventricular specimens at similar levels as in LV samples (not shown). Gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from wild-type and Tg1 hearts in order to test whether the transgenic CREM protein, putative HIbII, specifically binds to the CRE (Fig. 1B). Extracts from both groups produced a CRE-specific shift, probably due to binding of CREB homo- or heterodimers (3Mu ̈ller F.U. Boknik P. Horst A. Knapp J. Linck B. Schmitz W. Vahlensieck U. Bo ̈hm M. Deng M.C. Scheld H.H. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2041-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Mu ̈ller F.U. Boknik P. Knapp J. Neumann J. Vahlensieck U. Oetjen E. Scheld H.H. Schmitz W.

Investig. 1998; 101: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A strong second CRE-specific shift was visible with transgenic extracts, was supershifted by a HA-specific antibody, and co-migrated with bacterially expressed HIbII homodimers (not shown), indicating CRE-specific DNA binding of transgenic HIbII. A corresponding weak CRE-specific shift was consistently visible with wild-type extracts. It is conceivable that this band is due to binding of endogenous HIbII lacking the HA tag and therefore migrating slightly faster than HA-tagged transgenic HIbII. Then, neglecting the semiquantitative nature of gel shift assays, the degree of overexpression of HIbII would account for 3–5-fold of control hearts. However, due to the high sequence homology of small internally translated CREB/CREM proteins, it is not possible to unambiguously distinguish HIbII from HIbI, S-CREMα, SS-CREMα, I-CREB(l), I-CREB(s) (see Introduction), or other small CREM/CREB proteins including CREMΔC-G (16Walker W.H. Sanborn B.M. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with available antibodies in immunoblots or in supershift experiments. We determined protein levels of total CREB (no differentiation between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms) and of CREB phosphorylated at Ser119/133 in ventricular homogenates from Tg1 and wild-type control hearts (Fig. 1, C and D) to study whether CREM-IbΔC-X transgenic hearts show compensatory increases in CREB expression or phosphorylation. Surprisingly, CREB phosphorylation was significantly reduced in Tg1 homogenates as compared with littermate controls, whereas CREB expression was not different in groups. Pathological Analysis—Hearts from both transgenic lines showed similar changes in cardiac morphology, suggesting that effects were due to expression of the transgene and not due to nonspecific (e.g. insertional) effects. Atria of both transgenic lines were considerably enlarged (Fig. 2, A and B) and often filled with thrombi, which were in part organized. Absolute and relative atrial weights (without thrombi) were increased more than 6-fold in both transgenic lines (Table I). Absolute and relative ventricular weights were increased to 140 and 158% in Tg2 but were only elevated to 110 and 106% in Tg1, respectively, possibly reflecting a gene dose effect. Histological analysis revealed decreased thickness of the left atrial wall in Tg1 (Fig. 2C). Increased myocyte size was accompanied by a disturbed myocyte architecture in Tg1 left ventricles (Fig. 2C). There was no fibrosis in Tg1 ventricles as determined by Sirius red staining (not shown). Tg1 ventricles showed increased mRNA levels of ANP, a marker gene of myocardial hypertrophy (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these observations (macroscopic enlargement, increased heart weight, and induction of ANP) clearly indicate hypertrophy of Tg1 hearts.Table IMyocardial hypertrophy in CREM-IbΔC-X mice Body weight (BW) and cardiac atrial/ventricular weights (AW and VW) of Tg1, Tg2, and W mice are shown.

Occasionally, transgenic mice (Tg1) could be examined shortly after spontaneous death. Those hearts displayed the same morphological changes as shown for sacrificed mice (Fig. 2) (i.e. hypertrophy of atria and ventricles), and there were no signs of heart failure (namely ventricular dilatation, pleural effusion, or edema) visible in those mice. There were no significant differences in the proportion of transgenic and nontransgenic pups at the age of genotyping (3–4 weeks), indicating that mortality of young transgenic animals was not elevated (Tg1; data not shown). Since breeding of Tg2 mice was not successful over more than two generations, all experiments of this study were performed on Tg1 mice unless otherwise noted. Functional Assessment—Atrial dilatation was accompanied by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in transgenic mice (Fig. 4A). Conversion to atrial fibrillation began at an age of 8 weeks, and atrial fibrillation was observed in all transgenic animals investigated at 16 weeks and older (n = 16). At 7 weeks, transgenic mice displayed sinus rhythm combined with enlarged atria (not shown), suggesting that atrial fibrillation occurred as a consequence of atrial dilatation. Cardiac function was studied in vivo by LV catheterization of Tg1 mice and littermate controls aged 12–14 weeks. Tg1 mice showed increased systolic LV function, as indicated by a significantly increased maximal rate of contraction (Fig. 4B and Table II). However, whereas all control mice displayed regular heart actions throughout the whole experiment, a significant portion of transgenic mice died during the experiment or were excluded from further analysis because of a highly variable, inconstant basal heart rate, probably due to atrial fibrillation. Therefore, assessment of LV function only extended to a selected group of Tg1 mice showing a regular heartbeat. In order to validate these data in a nonselected group of transgenic mice, we repeated catheterizations in CREM-IbΔC-X-expressing mice and wild-type littermates with mixed genetic background generated by crossing-in CD-1 wild-type mice (Tg1FVB/N:CD-1, WFVB/N:CD-1). The cardiac phenotype of Tg1FVB/N:CD-1 mice was similar to Tg1 (FVB/N) mice; however, the development of the cardiac phenotype was delayed. Tg1FVB/N:CD-1 mice displayed increased atrial weights at 12–16 weeks, whereas ventricular weights were not changed at this age (in mg/g body weight). Relative atrial weight: WFVB/N:CD-1, 0.35 ± 0.02, n = 14; TFVB/N:CD-1, 0.62 ± 0.08*, n = 15, *, p < 0.05. Relative ventricular weight: WFVB/N:CD-1, 4.19 ± 0.07, n = 14; TFVB/N:CD-1, 4.25 ± 0.09, n = 15). Tg1FVB/N:CD-1 mice also showed conversion to atrial fibrillation, but not before an age of 16 weeks allowing invasive assessment of LV function during sinus rhythm at 12–16 weeks of age. Confirming results from Tg1 mice, LV function was increased in Tg1FVB/N:CD-1 mice as compared with WFVB/N:CD-1 littermate controls (Table II). Under basal conditions, maximal LV pressure and maximal rates of contraction and relaxation were increased to 117, 182, and 171% of WFVB/N:CD-1 in Tg1FVB/N:CD-1, respectively, whereas basal heart rate was not different in the two groups. τ, the relaxation constant of LV pressure decay, was significantly shortened in transgenic mice from both genetic backgrounds as compared with the respective wild-type controls, indicating fastened LV relaxation in CREM-IbΔC-X transgenic hearts. Unequal basal hemodynamic parameters between WFVB/N and WFVB/N:CD-1 may be explained by previous observations that different mouse strains show considerable differences in left ventricular function. 2F.

After stimulation with isoproterenol (40 pg/g body weight) maximal rates of contraction and of relaxation were increased, and time constant τ of LV relaxation was decreased in Tg1FVB/N:CD-1 as compared with littermate controls, indicating enhanced LV function in transgenic hearts under both basal and β-AR-stimulated conditions.Table IIInvasive hemodynamic data Hemodynamic assessment of Tg1 and W mice (FVB/N) and of descendants of Tg1 with mixed genetic background (FVB/N:CD-1) is shown.

https://openalex.org/W2039426226,"S100B is a Ca2+-modulated protein of the EF-hand type expressed in high abundance in a restricted set of cell types including certain neuronal populations. S100B has been suggested to participate in cell cycle progression, and S100B levels are high in tumor cells, compared with normal parental cells. We expressed S100B in the neuronal cell line PC12, which normally does not express the protein, by the Tet-Off technique, and found the following: (i) proliferation was higher in S100B+ PC12 cells than in S100B– PC12 cells; (ii) nerve growth factor (NGF), which decreased the proliferation of S100B– PC12 cells, was less effective in the case of S100B+ PC12 cells; (iii) expression of S100B made PC12 cells resistant to the differentiating effect of NGF; and (iv) interruption of S100B expression did not result in an immediate restoration of PC12 cell sensitivity to the differentiating effect of NGF. Expression of S100B in PC12 cells resulted in activation of Akt; increased levels of p21WAF1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 and a positive regulator of cdk4; increased p21WAF1-cyclin D1 complex formation; and increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma suppressor protein, Rb. These S100B-induced effects, as well as the reduced ability of S100B+ PC12 cells to respond to NGF, were dependent on Akt activation because they were remarkably reduced or abrogated in the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of the Akt upstream kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Thus, S100B might promote cell proliferation and interfere with NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation by stimulating a p21WAF1/cyclin D1/cdk4/Rb/E2F pathway in an Akt-mediated manner.

S100B, a member of a multigenic family of Ca2+-modulated proteins of the EF-hand type with both intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities, is expressed in varying abundance in astrocytes, Schwann cells, adipocytes, melanocytes, chondrocytes, skin Langerhans cells, lymphocyte subpopulations, skeletal muscle cells, and many neuronal populations (1Donato R.

Several intracellular target proteins have been identified for S100B (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 2Heizmann C.W. Fritz G.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and S100B has been shown to regulate protein phosphorylation, the dynamics of cytoskeleton components, Ca2+ homeostasis, some enzyme activities, and transcription factors (1Donato R.

Moreover, S100B has been shown to be secreted by astrocytes, thereby affecting neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia functions within the brain (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem.

S100B likely can be released by S100B-expressing cells outside the nervous system because it is found in normal serum (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), thereby affecting functions of non-nervous cells (4Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Agneletti A.L. Marchetti C. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4870-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Among the intracellular regulatory roles attributed to S100B is its participation in cell cycle progression. It has long been known that S100B levels are high in tumor cells, compared with normal parental cells (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 2Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schäfer B.W. Front.

Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the potential role of S100B in cell proliferation has not been elucidated. S100B has been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, inhibiting its phosphorylation and oligomerization (6Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl.

We show here that (over)expression of S100B results in enhanced cell survival under stress conditions, increased cell proliferation, a reduced extent of apoptosis, and decreased responsiveness to the differentiating effect of NGF. These effects are accompanied by activation of the mitogenic kinase Akt, increased levels of p21WAF1, increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma suppressor protein Rb by cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4, and increased formation of p21WAF1-cyclin D1 complex. Our data support the possibility that S100B might play a role in neuronal proliferation and differentiation during development and potentially participate in neuronal tumorigenesis through an Akt/p21WAF1/cyclin D1-cdk4/Rb/E2F pathway. Also, our data lend support to the notion that p21WAF1 can act to promote cell proliferation under conditions that favor its association with cyclin D1-cdk4 complex (14Sherr C.J.

Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were re-plated at a low density in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and then grown for another 24 h in the same medium. Geneticin (0.8 mg/ml) was then added to select successfully transfected cells. Fourteen to 20 days after starting culture in the Geneticin-containing medium, Geneticin-resistant clones were transferred to separate wells. Selected clones were screened by luciferase assay (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The clone exhibiting the highest luciferase activity induced by doxycycline (2 mg/ml) was used for transfection with pTRE2-S100B vector. The pTRE2-S100B vector was prepared by cloning a blunt-ended fragment containing the open reading frame of the bovine S100B gene in the EcoRV site of the multicloning site of pTRE2 vector. The nucleotide sequence of the pTRE2-S100B vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Tet-Off PC12 cell line, obtained as described above, was doubly transfected with pTRE2 S100B and pTK-Hyg selection vector carrying hygromycin B resistance gene (ratio, 10:1) by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, stably transfected clones were selected by hygromycin B (0.6 mg/ml) in 10% horse serum plus 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with doxycycline (2 μg/ml). Fourteen to 20 days after starting culture in the hygromycin B-containing medium, 40 well-separated hygromycin B-resistant clones were transferred to separate wells. S100B-inducible clones were identified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. S100B-transfected PC12 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 500 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml Geneticin, 200 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 2 μg/ml doxycycline in a H2O-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (culture medium) for 24 h, after which the medium was renewed. NGF (100 ng/ml) was added to appropriate samples at the time of culture medium renewal to induce PC12 cell differentiation. Cells displaying processes ≥2× longer than the cell body diameter were considered differentiated, neuronal-like cells; hence, the number of PC12 cells exhibiting processes ≥2× the cell body diameter was taken as a measure of differentiation. Cells were cultivated under these conditions for the indicated time periods (see the figure legends) without culture medium renewal unless otherwise specified, but with the addition of fresh doxycycline and NGF every other day, where required. To induce maximum S100B expression, doxycycline was omitted from culture medium. In some experiments (see Fig. 8), NGF was replaced by recombinant S100B to document extracellular S100B neurite extension activity.Fig. 8S100B does not act on PC12 cells in an autocrine manner. A–D, PC12 cells were cultivated for 6 days in the absence or presence of doxycycline and either 50 μg/ml of non-immune IgG or 50 μg/ml of a polyclonal anti-S100B antibody. By phase-contrast microscopy, no differences can be seen in the density or morphology of S100B– or S100B+ PC12 cells, irrespective of the absence or presence of non-immune IgG or polyclonal anti-S100B antibody, whereas a 2–3-fold increase in cell number is observed in S100B+ PC12 cells, irrespective of the absence or presence of non-immune IgG or polyclonal anti-S100B antibody, compared with S100B– PC12 cells under these conditions. One representative experiment of three is shown. E, FACS analysis of cells treated in A–D. S100B+ PC12 cells proliferate to the same extent, irrespective of the presence of non-immune IgG or anti-S100B antibody, and to a larger extent than S100B– PC12 cells under the same conditions. Apoptosis also is smaller in the case of S100B+ PC12 cells than in the case of S100B– PC12 cells, irrespective of the presence of non-immune IgG or anti-S100B antibody. *, significantly different from the +DOX condition, p < 0.01.

After a 10-min incubation at 95 °C, 35 cycles were performed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 51 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as a control.For Western blot analyses, cells were cultivated as detailed in the legend of pertinent figures, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized with 2.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-S100B antibody (1:1,000; Dako); polyclonal anti-p21WAF1 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); polyclonal anti-Rb antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal anti-phosphorylated Rb antibodies recognizing phospho-Ser780, phospho-Ser795, or phospho-Ser807/811, respectively (each at 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal anti-phosphorylated (Ser473) Akt antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology); monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma); monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce). Recombinant S100B was expressed, purified, and characterized as described previously (18Huttunen H.J.

Where appropriate, doxycycline and NGF were added every other day. Cells were treated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1.036 μg/ml sodium citrate. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis to determine the percentage of cells in the G0-G1, S, and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle.For proliferation assay, cells were seeded onto 24-multiwell plastic plates (5 × 104 cells/polylysine-coated well) for 24 h, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cultivated as described above for 6 days, after which [3H]thymidine was added. Cells were then cultivated for another 24 h. Where appropriate, doxycycline and NGF were added every other day.For survival assay, conditions were as described for the proliferation assay, except that after 6 days of culture, all sets of cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and cells cultivated in the –DOX condition were switched to the +DOX condition (to interrupt S100B expression). Cells were then treated with 0.2% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline.To measure apoptosis, S100B-transfected PC12 cells were seeded onto 35-mm plastic dishes (25 × 104 cells/dish) for 24 h, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cultivated for 6 days in the absence (–DOX) or presence (+DOX) of doxycycline, without renewal of culture medium. Where appropriate, doxycycline and NGF were added every other day. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to flow cytometry as described previously (20Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar). In other experiments, PC12 cells were cultivated in the absence or presence of doxycycline for 6 days as described above, after which H2O2 was added to 500 μm for 12 h to induce apoptosis, which was measured as described previously (20Nicoletti I.

Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar).To investigate possible autocrine effects of secreted S100B, PC12 cells were cultivated for 6 days in the absence or presence of doxycycline and either 50 μg/ml of non-immune IgG or 50 μg/ml of a polyclonal anti-S100B antibody (SWant), as described previously (4Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Agneletti A.L. Marchetti C. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4870-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and examined by phase-contrast microscopy and subjected to FACS analysis as described above. As a positive control, S100B– PC12 cells were cultivated in the presence of 500 nm S100B as described previously (18Huttunen H.J. Kuja-Panula J. Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40096-40105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) to document the neurite extension activity of S100B.Immunofluorescence—For indirect immunofluorescence, PC12 cells cultivated as described for the proliferation assay were fixed and processed as described previously (21Sorci G. Bianchi R. Giambanco I. Rambotti M.G. Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). S100B and p53 were detected using a monoclonal anti-S100B antibody (1:20; Sigma) and a polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively.Immunoprecipitation—PC12 cells (15 × 106) were cultivated in the absence or presence of doxycycline for 6 days without culture medium renewal. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of aprotinin)) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C under agitation. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and used for immunoprecipitation. Extracted protein (1.5 mg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.2 ml with 3 μgof agarose-conjugated anti-p21WAF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) under vigorous agitation and centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. Pellets were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resuspended in SDS electrophoresis buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged as described above. Samples were then subjected to SDS electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-cyclin D1. The immune reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce).RESULTSCharacterization of S100B-expressing PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were stably transfected with S100B cDNA, and S100B expression was induced by the Tet-Off technique (17Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). By RT-PCR (Fig. 1A), after 6 days of culture, S100B mRNA was found in transfected PC12 cells not exposed to doxycycline, but not in PC12 cells exposed to doxycycline or in PC12 cells carrying the gene encoding the tetracycline-controlled transactivator gene only (1T cells). By Western blotting, after 6 days of culture, the amount of expressed S100B increased with decreasing doxycycline concentration, with no S100B expression detected in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, and maximum S100B expression registered in the presence of a doxycycline concentration of ∼10 ng/ml or lower (Fig. 1B, top panel). On the basis of these results and to maximize S100B expression, all experiments aimed at documenting effects of expression of S100B in PC12 cells were performed in the absence of doxycycline in parallel with PC12 cells cultivated in the presence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml), which served as a control. By immunofluorescence, the entire population of S100B-transfected PC12 cells cultivated for 6 days in the absence of doxycycline displayed S100B immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, C and D). By confocal laser scanning microscopy, S100B was detected diffusely in the cytoplasm of –DOX cells and was undetectable in +DOX cells (Fig. 1, E–H), and the amount of expressed S100B increased with increasing culture time in the absence of doxycycline, judging from the intensity of the immunofluorescence signal (Fig. 1, F and H) and Western blotting (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Also, after 4 days of cultivation, the number of S100+ PC12 cells was greater than that of S100– PC12 cells (Fig. 1, F and H). This observation prompted us to investigate the effects of S100B (over)expression on cell proliferation and survival.Fig. 1Expression of S100B in transfected PC12 cells. A, RT-PCR. S100B mRNA is expressed in PC12 cells cultivated in the absence (–DOX) but not in the presence (+DOX) of doxycycline. S100B mRNA is absent in PC12 cells carrying the gene encoding the tetracycline-controlled transactivator but not the S100B gene (1T). B, Western blot. Top panel, dose dependence of S100B protein expression in transfected PC12 cells exposed for 6 days to increasing concentrations of doxycycline as indicated. S100B is maximally expressed in the presence of ≤10 ng/ml doxycycline. Bottom panel, the S100B protein level increases in transfected PC12 cells with increasing cultivation time, at a constant tubulin level. The asterisk indicates the S100B disulfide cross-linked dimer that typically forms upon S100B storage at –20 °C. C and D, S100B-transfected PC12 cells were cultivated for 6 days in the absence of doxycycline and analyzed for S100B expression by immunofluorescence using an anti-S100B monoclonal antibody (D) and then treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to label the nuclei (C). E–H, immunofluorescence analysis of transfected PC12 cells. Cells were cultivated for 2 (E and F) or 4 (G and H) days in the presence (E and G) or absence (F and H) of doxycycline before fixation and immunofluorescence with an anti-S100B monoclonal antibody. S100B is found diffusely in PC12 cells cultivated in the absence (F and H) but not in the presence (E and G) of doxycycline. Also notice the stronger S100B immunofluorescence signal after 4 days of culture (H) as compared with after 2 days of culture (F).

Fresh doxycycline and NGF were added to appropriate samples every other day without culture medium renewal. By FACS analysis, on accumulation of S100B (–DOX), a smaller fraction of cells was in G0-G1 phase, and larger fractions were in S and G2 + M phases, compared with the +DOX condition (Fig. 2, A–C). Also, at day 6, S100B+ cells incorporated a larger amount of [3H]thymidine than did S100B– cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, accumulation of S100B resulted in increased PC12 cell proliferation. Moreover, whereas NGF reduced the number of S100B– cells in S phase and strongly reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation by these cells (Fig. 2, A–D, +DOX + NGF), it was less able to do so in S100B+ cells (Fig. 2, A–D, –DOX + NGF). By cell survival assay, no significant differences were detected after 2–4 days of culture, irrespective of the expression or non-expression of S100B in the absence or presence of NGF (Fig. 2E). However, after 6 days of culture without culture medium renewal, a higher percentage of PC12 cells survived in the –DOX condition compared with the +DOX condition (Fig. 2E), indicating that expression of S100B was beneficial to these cells. Notably, whereas the percentage of surviving S100B– cells decreased between day 4 and day 6, likely due to consumption/degradation of trophic serum factors, the percentage of surviving S100B+ cells was nearly constant in the time interval investigated (Fig. 2E), pointing to a protective effect of S100B. Consistently, after 6 days of culture, S100B+ cells displayed a smaller extent of apoptosis compared with S100B– cells (Fig. 2F). Moreover, when treated with H2O2 to induce apoptosis, S100B+ PC12 cells exhibited a remarkably smaller extent of apoptosis than S100B– PC12 cells (Fig. 2F). With 1T cells, similar (if not identical) percentages of PC12 cells were in the G0-G1, S, and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle at a given time point, irrespective of the absence or presence of doxycycline (data not shown), indicating that transfection and/or doxycycline per se did not alter PC12 cell proliferation.Fig. 2Effect of forced expression of S100B in PC12 cells on cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis.

SAR-deficient skeletal muscle carrying irregular SR ultrastructures retained normal force generation but showed slow relaxation phases after contractions. A weakened Ca2+ uptake activity was detected in the SR prepared from mutant muscle, indicating that SAR contributes to Ca2+ buffering in the SR lumen and also to the maintenance of Ca2+ pump proteins. Cardiac myocytes from SAR-deficient mice showed slow contraction and relaxation accompanied by impaired Ca2+ transients, and the mutant mice exhibited a number of impairments in cardiac performance as determined in electrocardiography, ventricular catheterization, and echocardiography.

Excitation-contraction coupling requires the physiological role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CSQ, calsequestrin; SAR, sarcalumenin; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase; LV, left ventricular; MOPS, 4-morpho-linepropanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance. in muscle cells (1Endo M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 25: 181-230Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar); SR Ca2+ release triggers contraction, and relaxation is achieved by Ca2+ uptake into the SR through Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase (SERCA). Therefore, Ca2+ sequestration in the SR is essential in muscle contraction. Several Ca2+-binding proteins have been characterized in the SR and proposed to maintain luminal Ca2+ level. Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a major Ca2+-binding protein in the striated muscle SR and shows high capacity and low affinity Ca2+ binding properties (2MacLennan D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). CSQ is associated with the SR terminal cisternae near the Ca2+ release site and likely modulates the opening of Ca2+ release channels/ryanodine receptors on the SR and store-operated Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane by regulating the luminal Ca2+ level (3Beard N.A.

Because of its abundant expression in striated muscle, CSQ is thought to greatly contribute to Ca2+-buffering effects in the SR. On the other hand, sarcalumenin (SAR) and histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein are also Ca2+-binding proteins in the SR, but their functions are as yet unknown. SAR isoforms are generated as 160- and 53-kDa glycoproteins by the alternative splicing of the primary transcript derived from the same gene and are specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (5Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression levels of SAR isoforms remarkably increase during muscle development, suggesting the involvement of the isoforms in mature SR functions (6Raeymaekers L. Verbist J. Wuytack F. Plessers L. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of the 160-kDa isoform is characterized by the juxtapositions of negatively charged residues and forms a Ca2+-binding region (5Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the 160-kDa SAR isoform binds ∼35 Ca ions/molecule with a dissociation constant of ∼0.6 mm and shows low affinity and high capacity Ca2+ binding properties. Our search of the NCBI data base found putative nucleotide-binding motifs for the P-loop-containing ATPase/GTPase in the carboxyl-terminal region shared by SAR isoforms (see Fig. 1). This observation may suggest that SAR has an enzyme activity in the SR lumen in addition to its role in Ca2+ buffering. However, there are as yet no model animal systems, such as those with genetic diseases at the locus, and the physiological role of SAR is still unknown at present. By generating and analyzing a mouse model carrying the targeted mutation, we determine the important contribution of SAR to SR functions in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Generation of Mutant Mice—A homology search using the rabbit SAR sequence data previously reported (5Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found mouse SAR cDNA sequences in the expressed sequence tag data bases. Based on the sequence data obtained, several SAR cDNA clones were isolated from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library to determine the primary structure. A mouse genomic DNA library was screened with the cDNA fragment to yield a phage clone carrying the 5′-terminal segment of the SAR gene. Mutant mice carrying a targeted mutation were generated essentially as described previously (7Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the targeting vector was constructed using genomic DNA fragments, a synthetic polylinker carrying NotI and BamHI sites, the 1.1-kb XhoI/SalI fragment from pMC1 Neo poly(A) (Stratagene), and the 0.7-kb XhoI/SalI fragment from the pMC1 diphtheria toxin gene, and pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). Of ∼300 G418-resistant embryonic stem clones originally derived from J1 cells, 12 clones showed the expected homologous mutation. The chimeric mice produced with the embryonic stem clones numbered 299 and 374 were crossed with C57BL/6J mice, and the targeted mutation was transmitted to the pups. The SAR-deficient and wild-type mice obtained by crossing the heterozygous mutants were used for the analysis in this study. To determine mouse genotypes, PCR analysis was carried out using the synthetic primers PSAR-1 (GTAAAGTTCCCAGCACAGAACAGG), PSAR-2 (GAAAACCCACGACATCTGACCTTTG),and Pneo-5′a (GCCACACGCGTCACCTTAATATGCG), as shown in Fig. 1. For immunoblot analysis, the mouse SAR cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 438–890 was cloned into pMALc-2 (New England Biolabs) to produce a maltose-binding fusion protein. Wistar rats were repeatedly immunized with the purified fusion protein to yield an antiserum, and antibody to SAR was purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Total microsomal protein from mouse hindlimb preparations was analyzed with the antibody to SAR as described previously (7Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural Analysis—Photo and electron microscopic analyses were carried out as described previously (8Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hindlimb muscles from adult mice were treated with a prefixative solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) and then post-fixed with a buffer containing 1% OsO4 and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4). The fixed samples were washed, dehydrated with alcohol and acetone, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were prepared, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under an electron microscope (JEM-200CX; JEOL). Muscle Contraction and Ca2+ Measurement—The contraction of skeletal muscle bundles was examined essentially as described previously (9Nishi M. Komazaki S. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Noda T. Iino M. Takeshima H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Muscle preparations of the extensor digitorum longus and soleus were dissected from mice and mounted on a transducer (LVS-50GA; KYOWA Electronic Instruments); Krebs-Ringer solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose) aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 was used as the bathing solution. The preparations were stretched with a resting tension of 0.5 × g at room temperature and were field-stimulated with a supramaximal voltage at various frequencies for 300 ms. Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated essentially as described previously (10Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, the hearts were excised from anesthetized mice and were mounted on a temperature-controlled perfusion system. After perfusion with a Ca2+-free solution (heart medium) composed of 111 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm KHCO3, 30 mm taurin, 2 mm carnitine, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm glucose at 37 °C for 3 min, the hearts were digested for 12 min in the heart medium containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (Worthington). The ventricular parts were then cut into pieces and gently agitated to dissociate single cells. Contractile responses of the isolated myocytes upon field stimulation (0.5 Hz, 5-ms duration) were assessed in Tyrode's solution (1.8 mm CaCl2) with or without 10–8 m isoproterenol using a video-based edge-detection system (IonOptix Corporation). For Ca2+ measurements, isolated myocytes were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl (AM) (2 μm) for 30 min in Tyrode's solution containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, and Ca2+ transients were recorded with a dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system (IonOptix) at 26 °C. The myocytes in Tyrode's solution (1.8 mm CaCl2) with or without 10–7 m isoproterenol were exposed to light emitted by a 75-W lamp and passed through either a 360- or a 380-nm filter, and fluorescence emission between 480 and 520 nm was detected by a photomultiplier tube. The 380-nm excitation scan was carried out at a 333-Hz sampling rate, and the 360-nm excitation scan was examined at the start and end of the protocol to normalize qualitative changes in the intracellular Ca2+ level. Transthoracic Echocardiography—Mice were anesthetized with Avertin (250 μg/g intraperitoneally) and subjected to transthoracic echocardiography using a Toshiba Aplio instrument and a 14-MHz linear transducer (PLT-1202S; Toshiba). Interventricular wall thickness, left ventricular (LV) posterior wall thickness, end diastolic LV dimension (EDD), and end systolic LV dimension (ESD) were measured on M-mode images. Ejection time (ET) was measured as the duration of aortic valve opening. The percentage fractional shortening (FS) and the heart rate-corrected mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mean Vcfc) were calculated as FS = (EDD–ESD)/EDD × 100 and mean Vcfc = FS/(ET/√cycle length), respectively. Electrocardiography and Hemodynamic Study—Mice anesthetized with Avertin were used for the in vivo hemodynamic study. To record the electrocardiogram, small wire electrodes were attached to each limb of the mice. The mice were placed in the supine position, and a midline cervical incision was made to expose the trachea and right carotid artery. They were intubated with a blunt 21-gauge needle tube and then connected to a volume-cycled rodent ventilator (SN-480–7; Shi-nano) with a tidal volume of 0.2 ml and a respiratory rate of 100 beats/min. A 1.4-F microtip catheter (SPR671; Millar Instruments) was retrogradely inserted into the LV through the right carotid artery, and real time data were collected with an analog-to-digital converter (Power Laboratory; ADInstruments) and analyzed using commercial software (Chart, version 4; ADInstruments). To evaluate β-adrenergic responsiveness, isoproterenol was administrated intraperitoneally. Hemodynamic data were obtained for at least 5 min. SR Ca2+ Uptake and SERCA Enzyme Assay—SR vesicles were prepared from mice hindlimbs as described previously (11Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and their Ca2+ uptake activities were measured by monitoring absorbance changes at 650 and 700 nm (BioSpec-1600, Shimadzu) using the Ca2+ indicator dye arsenazo III as described previously (12Kim D.H. Ohnishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (final volume, 1 ml) contained 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 6.8), 0.6 mg protein/ml SR vesicles, 30 μm arsenazo III, 1 mm ATP, and 30 μm CaCl2. To examine oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake, 1 mm potassium oxalate was added to the assay mixture. SERCA enzyme activity was determined as described previously (13Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 12: 820-825Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), using the reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm ATP, 1.33 μm A23187, and ∼10 μg/ml SR vesicles. Ca2+-ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, which was determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2. For the Northern blot analysis of the SERCA isoforms, total RNA was prepared from hindlimb muscle and was analyzed as described previously (8Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization probes used were PCR-amplified cDNAs derived from the 3′-noncoding sequences of the SERCA isoforms (14Wu K-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of SAR-deficient Mice—To determine the primary structure of mouse SAR isoforms, we isolated cDNA clones from the mouse skeletal muscle library. Between mouse and rabbit SAR primary structures, high conservation is observed in the carboxyl-terminal region, whereas moderate divergence is observed in the amino-terminal half (Fig. 1D). Using the cDNA fragment as a probe, the mouse genomic DNA segment carrying the SAR gene was isolated by screening a phage library. In the vector used for introducing a targeted mutation (Fig. 1A), the genomic DNA segment containing the putative promoter and first protein-coding sequence is replaced by the neomycin resistance gene. Embryonic stem cells were transfected with the targeting vector, and the resulting G418-resistant clones were screened by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Two lines of chimeric mice generated using embryonic stem cells carrying the targeted mutation were crossed for the generation of heterozygous mutants detected by PCR genotyping (Fig. 1C). In this report, 8–13-week-old mice homozygous for the targeted mutation were produced by crossing between the heterozygous mutants and were used for analyses as described below. Two SAR isoforms are generated from the same gene, and immunoblot analysis showed the absence of either the long or short SAR isoform in mutant muscle (Fig. 1E). The SAR-deficient mice thus generated exhibit no abnormalities in health or reproduction under our conventional housing conditions, demonstrating that SAR is not essential for the fundamental development and functions of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Abnormal SR Structure in SAR-deficient Skeletal Muscle— First, we analyzed the structures of skeletal muscle from SAR-deficient mice. Photo microscopy showed no significant differences in the morphology of the muscle tissues between wild-type and mutant mice (data not shown). Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the SR from SAR-deficient skeletal muscle but not in the other membrane systems or myofibril assemblies. Almost all of the SR was composed of a tubular meshwork in wild-type muscle (Fig. 2A), but most of the SR surrounding the myofibril looked like a fenestrated plate in mutant muscle (Fig. 2B). Statistical examination revealed a significant reduction in the amount of the tubular SR structure in the mutant muscle (Fig. 2C). Abnormal Contraction Responses in SAR-deficient Skeletal Muscle—To survey functional abnormalities in SAR-deficient skeletal muscle, we performed isometric tension measurements in muscle bundles. SAR-deficient extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscle preparations retained normal levels in maximum force generation (Fig. 3A and D). In experiments using the extensor digitorum longus bundle containing mainly fast fibers, SAR-deficient muscle showed a slower force decrease after contraction than wild-type muscle (Fig. 3B). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ is predominantly returned into the SR by the SERCA-mediated enzyme reaction during the relaxation phase, and the relaxation curve after contractions fitted well with a single exponential equation. In the comparison of time constants of the tension decay, the SAR-deficient muscle showed larger values in twitch and tetanus than wild-type muscle (Fig. 3C). A similar slow relaxation was observed in soleus bundles containing predominantly slow muscle fibers at high frequency (>40 Hz) stimuli (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that SAR-deficient skeletal muscle retains the normal mechanism for excitation-contraction coupling but bears partially impaired Ca2+ signaling after contraction. Impaired SR Functions in SAR-deficient Muscle—To survey functional abnormalities in the SAR-deficient SR, we next analyzed Ca2+ uptake into SR vesicles prepared from hindlimb muscles by a spectrophotometric assay using the Ca2+ indicator arsenazo III. In this assay, the addition of ATP to the reaction mixture initiates active Ca2+ uptake into the SR through the action of SERCA. SR vesicles from SAR-deficient muscle showed reduced Ca2+ accumulation compared with those of wild-type muscle (Fig. 4A). Oxalate forms an insoluble complex at high Ca2+ concentrations in the SR lumen, and SERCA activity obtains obvious relief from the “back inhibition” caused by increasing luminal-free Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, oxalate facilitates the increases in both the total amount and reaction rate of Ca2+ uptake (12Kim D.H. Ohnishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of oxalate, no difference was detected in maximum Ca2+ accumulation between the genotypes (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the reduced Ca2+ buffering effects were restored by oxalate in SAR-deficient muscle. However, the data still suggest a slow Ca2+ uptake in the SAR-deficient SR, compared with that in the control SR. Stain-all detects major Ca2+-binding proteins in the muscle SR (15Damiani E. Margreth A. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and showed no change in the expression level of CSQ or histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein (HRC) between the genotypes (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the data suggest impaired Ca2+ buffering in the SR lumen and also imply reduced Ca2+ pumping activity in SAR-deficient muscle. We then examined the expression level and enzyme activity of SERCA in the SR from SAR-deficient muscle. SERCA is the most abundant protein in the SR and is easily detected as a protein band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4D). The staining density of the SERCA protein was significantly reduced in the SAR-deficient SR (Fig. 4E), but we detected no significant changes of other protein bands including CSQ and the ryanodine receptor. SERCA enzyme activity in SR vesicles is usually monitored by ATP hydrolysis in the presence of a Ca2+ ionophore. Total SERCA activity was significantly reduced in SAR-deficient SR vesicles (Fig. 4F); this reduction correlates well with the lowered SERCA protein level. On the other hand, no obvious differences were detected in the mRNA expression level of SERCA isoforms between the genotypes in Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 4G). These biochemical results indicate the specific reduction in SERCA protein level in the mutant muscle SR. Abnormal Cardiac Functions in SAR-deficient Mice—Next, we focused on cardiac functions in SAR-deficient mice. The ratios of left ventricular weight to body weight were similar between wild-type (3.69 ± 0.08 mg/g) and mutant mice (3.48 ± 0.09 mg/g), indicating no cardiac hypertrophy in the mutant mice. Photo and electron microscopic analysis could not detect any structural abnormalities of cardiac myocytes from SAR-deficient mice. Transthoracic echocardiography (Table I) revealed that both the percentage of fractional shortening and the heart rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, both indicators of systolic cardiac function, were significantly lower in the SAR-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. LV chamber size and wall thickness were not different between the genotypes.Table IEchocardiographic abnormalities in SAR-deficient miceWild type miceSAR-deficient miceBW (g)23.3 ± 0.923.6 ± 0.8HR (bpm)440 ± 9422 ± 10LVEDD (mm)3.61 ± 0.163.77 ± 0.11LVESD (mm)2.40 ± 0.132.62 ± 0.10LV%FS (%)33.9 ± 0.930.6 ± 0.6ap < 0.01 in t test.IVSth (mm)0.60 ± 0.030.57 ± 0.02LVPWth (mm)0.60 ± 0.030.58 ± 0.01ET (ms)50.6 ± 1.355.8 ± 1.2bp < 0.05 in t test.Vcfc (circ/s)2.49 ± 0.092.08 ± 0.05ap < 0.01 in t test.a p < 0.01 in t test.b p < 0.05 in t test. Open table in a new tab Electrocardiography revealed that the QRS duration was significantly longer in SAR-deficient mice and that the heart rate and PQ interval were not different between the genotypes (Table II). Furthermore, an in vivo hemodynamic study was performed to evaluate the global cardiac function in mutant mice. The maximal derivative of left ventricular pressure, an indicator of systolic function, was significantly decreased, and the apparent time constant in the left ventricular diastolic phase, an indicator of diastolic function, was remarkably increased in the SAR-deficient mice (Table II). In response to the isoproterenol application, the maximal derivative of left ventricular pressure and the time constant became similar between the genotypes, whereas the prolonged QRS was not restored in the mutant mice. On the other hand, the mutant mice showed no abnormalities in heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, the minimal derivative of left ventricular pressure, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure.Table IIHemodynamic and electrocardiographic abnormalities in SAR-deficient miceBasalIsoproterenolWild-type miceSAR-deficient miceWild-type miceSAR-deficient miceBW (g)24.4 ± 1.726.6 ± 1.1LVW (mg)90.4 ± 8.292.2 ± 4.2RVW (mg)22.3 ± 2.123.8 ± 1.0LVW/BW (mg/g)3.69 ± 0.083.48 ± 0.09HR (bpm)461 ± 8450 ± 12627 ± 10609 ± 12PQ interval (ms)42 ± 243 ± 137 ± 139 ± 1QRS interval (ms)18.8 ± 0.622.3 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.17.1 ± 0.121.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.LVP (mmHg)90 ± 392 ± 394 ± 3101 ± 4LV dP/dt max (mmHg/ms)9221 ± 2947331 ± 628bp < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA.11,895 ± 102211,306 ± 534LV dP/d min (mmHg/ms)-5115 ± 116-5154 ± 300-7670 ± 957-7495 ± 546EDP (mmHg)2.0 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.5Tau (ms)6.5 ± 0.99.2 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA.5.3 ± 1.06.8 ± 0.7a p < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.b p < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA. Open table in a new tab These data in heart functions, together with the defined subcellular distribution of SAR, suggest that Ca2+ handling functions in the SR are remarkably impaired in SAR-deficient cardiac myocytes and that β-adrenergic stimulation can improve, in part, the irregular functions. Abnormal Cardiac Myocyte Functions in SAR-deficient Mice—We also examined the effects of SAR deficiency on contractility at the single cardiac myocyte level (Table III). SAR-deficient myocytes showed impaired performance in the percentage of cell shortening, the shortening rate (–dL/dt), and the relengthening rate (+dL/dt). Next, we evaluated the properties of intracellular Ca2+ transients in mutant myocytes (Fig. 5). The fura-2 measurements revealed that the peak amplitude of Ca2+ transient and rates in both the rise and decline phases were significantly impaired in the mutant myocytes (Table IV), whereas we did not detect any abnormality in the basal diastolic Ca2+ level. The abnormalities detected were somewhat improved but still remained abnormal when isoproterenol was applied to mutant myocytes.Table IIIAbnormal contractile properties of single cardiac myocytes from SAR-deficient miceBasalIsoproterenolWild-type miceSAR deficient miceWild-type miceSAR-deficient miceCell length (μm)127 ± 4129 ± 5141 ± 5133 ± 5Cell shortening (%)7.5 ± 0.45.8 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.12.9 ± 0.711.0 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA.Shortening velocity (mm/s)-130 ± 9-98 ± 9bp < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA.-284 ± 24-234 ± 18Relengthening velocity (mm/s)117 ± 1178 ± 8ap < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.231 ± 17185 ± 17a p < 0.01 in t test or ANOVA.b p < 0.05 in t test or ANOVA.

Open table in a new tab Cardiac muscle contains both SAR isoforms as in the case of skeletal muscle. On the other hand, skeletal muscle predominantly contains SERCA-1, whereas cardiac muscle specifically contains SERCA-2. Western blot analysis detected reduced SERCA-2 protein level in SR preparations from the mutant heart, but Northern blot showed similar SERCA-2 mRNA levels between wild-type and mutant hearts (data not shown). This observation suggests that SAR also contributes to SERCA stability in cardiac myocytes. The irregular SR structures are impressive in SAR-deficient skeletal muscle (Fig. 2). However, the fenestrated plate-like SR structures were slightly detected in wild-type muscle, and normal tubular structures were barely retained in mutant muscle. The tubular structures could transform into the fenestrated structures under certain SR conditions. Previous studies demonstrated that Ca2+ overloading induces swollen SR structures in striated muscle cells (16Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Hirose K. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3309-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Uehara A. Yasukochi M. Imanaga I. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that luminal Ca2+ level is an important determinant of the SR ultrastructure. A reduced Ca2+ level, suggested by poor Ca2+ handling in the SR (Fig. 4), could facilitate structural changes of the SR in SAR-deficient skeletal muscle. On the contrary, it seems unlikely that the structural abnormalities of the SR directly induce poor Ca2+ handling and further contractile abnormalities in the SAR-deficient muscle. Indeed, insufficient Ca2+ buffering and pumping were detected in SR vesicles, in which membrane structures should be deformed during the biochemical preparation. Previous studies have demonstrated that SAR is an SR-luminal protein capable of binding Ca2+ at a high capacity and low affinity (5Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Raeymaekers L. Verbist J. Wuytack F. Plessers L. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The present biochemical and physiological data indicate that SAR significantly contributes to Ca2+ buffering and the maintenance of the SERCA protein in the skeletal muscle SR. In skeletal and cardiac myocytes, CSQ isoforms, the most abundant Ca2+-binding proteins, are thought to predominantly contribute to the reduction in the free Ca2+ level in the SR lumen (2MacLennan D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is rather surprising that the detectable imperfection of luminal Ca2+ buffering in SR vesicles can be induced by SAR deficiency, despite normal CSQ and histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein levels in mutant muscle. CSQ is mainly localized in the junctional SR near the Ca2+ release site (18Nori A. Nadalini K.A. Martini A. Rizzuto R. Villa A. Volpe P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1420-C1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas SAR is predominantly distributed throughout longitudinal SR regions (19Leberer E. Charuk J.H. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6047-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is an interesting possibility that several Ca2+-binding proteins take part in luminal Ca2+ buffering and transfer in different SR subregion-specific manners. It is important to note that SERCA protein level decreased in the SAR-deficient skeletal muscle but that the normal expression of SERCA mRNAs was retained (Fig. 4). The data probably suggest that SERCA protein is unstable in the mutant muscle, because it is unlikely that the translation efficiency of SERCA mRNA is specifically affected by SAR deficiency. Most proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum/SR lumen contain the well known retention signal (KDEL in the one-letter code) at the carboxyl terminus of their primary structures, whereas SAR isoforms do not carry this retention signal. Moreover, a current report suggests the direct interaction between SERCA and SAR (20Dowling P. Doran P. Ohlendieck K. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and our data base search found putative GTP/ATPase motifs within the primary structures of SAR isoforms (Fig. 1). Taken together, SAR might interact with SERCA for its residency in the SR and might be involved in the protein turnover of SERCA mediated by its presumable chaperon-like activity. Because the reduction in SERCA protein level was also observed in cardiac muscle SR preparations, SAR isoforms likely stabilize both SERCA-1 and SERCA-2. SAR-deficient cardiac myocytes showed slow contraction responses (Table III) and weak Ca2+ transients (Fig. 5 and Table IV), and several hemodynamic abnormalities were detected in the SAR-deficient mice (Tables I and II). Based on the impaired SR Ca2+ handling functions defined in skeletal muscle, the SAR deficiency probably reduces total Ca2+ accumulation and also induces a weak attenuation of SERCA back inhibition in the SR. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the poor SR functions induce weak Ca2+ transients and impaired contraction in mutant cardiac myocytes and that the abnormal responses of individual myocytes likely underlie abnormal in vivo parameters observed in hemodynamic measurements. These defects in the mutant heart were somehow restored by the application of isoproterenol. Because β-adrenergic stimulation facilitates SERCA activity by the phospholamban-mediated physiological regulation in cardiac myocytes (21Tada M. Yabuki M. Toyofuku T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it may be that weakened SR functions were slightly improved by isoproterenol in the mutant heart. In addition to abnormal hemodynamic parameters, mutant mice showed the prolonged QRS, and this abnormality seems to be insensitive to β-adrenergic stimulation (Table II). The QRS expansion might be caused by impaired Ca2+ transferring from the longitudinal region to the terminal region within the SR, and this process may be insensitive to the β-adrenergic regulation. Alternatively, the SAR-deficient heart might bear an irreversible damage in the excitation conducting system. On the other hand, we found slightly impaired relaxation phases but not slow contraction phases in skeletal muscle from the SAR-deficient mice. However, SR vesicles from mutant skeletal muscle showed significantly impaired Ca2+ handling. In skeletal muscle, excess amounts of both SERCA and luminal Ca2+ may always be present under basal conditions, and thus SAR deficiency might cause minimum physiological defects.

Previously, we developed a technique for the isolation of neuropeptide-processing intermediates from mice that lack carboxypeptidase E activity (Cpefat/fat mice) due to a naturally occurring point mutation. In the present study, we used a differential labeling procedure with stable isotopic tags and mass spectrometry to quantitate the relative changes in a number of hypothalamic peptides in Cpefat/fat mice in two different paradigms that each cause an ∼10% decrease in body mass. One paradigm involved a 2-day fast under normal sedentary conditions (i.e. standard mouse cages); the other involved giving mice access to an exercise wheel for 4 weeks with free access to food. Approximately 50 peptides were detected in both studies, and over 80 peptides were detected in at least one of the two studies. Twenty-eight peptides were increased >50% by food deprivation, and some of these were increased by 2- to 3-fold. In contrast, only three peptides were increased >50% in the group with exercise wheels, and many peptides showed a slight 15–30% decrease upon exercise. Approximately one-half of the peptides detected in both studies were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides found to be elevated by food deprivation but not exercise included a number of fragments of proenkephalin, prothyrotropin-releasing hormone, secretogranin II, chromogranin B, and pro-SAAS. Taken together, the differential regulation of these peptides in the two paradigms suggests that the regulation is not due to the lower body weight but to the manner in which the paradigms achieved this lower body weight.

Neuropeptides are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, including reproduction, growth, anxiety, stress, sleep/wake cycles, pain, feeding and body weight regulation, and many other pathways (1Strand F.L. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 61: 1-37PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of most neuropeptides requires the selective proteolysis of larger precursors, usually at sites containing multiple basic amino acids, and then removal of these basic residues by a carboxypeptidase (2Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For some neuropeptides, additional steps such as acetylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, glycosylation, and/or C-terminal amidation occur; these additional modifications often alter the biological activity of the peptide (3Eipper B.A. Mains R.E.

The major peptide-processing endopeptidases are prohormone convertase (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CID, collision-induced dissociation; pro-TRH, prothyrotropin-releasing hormone; TMAB, H9- and D9-[3-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yloxycarbonyl)propyl]trimethylammonium chloride. 1 and 2 (PC1 is also known as PC3), both of which are broadly expressed in the neuroendocrine system and cleave peptide precursors to the C-terminal side of an Arg or Lys residue (5Seidah N.G.

This basic residue is then usually removed from the C terminus of the peptide-processing intermediate by carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (8Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 9Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego2004: 840-844Google Scholar). Mice lacking CPE activity due to a point mutation in the coding region of the gene (Cpefat/fat mice) show reduced levels of the mature forms of neuroendocrine peptides (10Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D.

Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar); this implies that CPE plays a major role but that a second carboxypeptidase also contributes to peptide processing in the absence of CPE activity. Carboxypeptidase D (CPD), which is present in the trans-Golgi network and is able to remove C-terminal Lys and Arg residues from a number of peptides, is presumably the enzyme that contributes to neuroendocrine peptide processing in the Cpefat/fat mice (16Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F.

Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, even though CPD is present in neuroendocrine cells, the absence of CPE activity leads to a very large increase in the levels of the Lys- and Arg-extended intermediates in Cpefat/fat mice (15Che F-Y. Biswas R. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This increase in the C-terminally extended peptides led to a scheme for the purification of neuropeptide-processing intermediates from Cpefat/fat mouse brain and pituitary (20Che F-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), described in more detail below. Studies on neuropeptides in brain are limited by the low levels of these peptides relative to the high levels of protein degradation fragments. Although radioimmunoassays can provide useful information about levels of neuropeptides, it is difficult to interpret the results, because antisera typically cross-react with larger or smaller forms of the peptide being measured and/or with forms containing various post-translational modifications. We previously developed a strategy to affinity purify neuropeptide-processing intermediates from Cpefat/fat mouse brain and pituitary using anhydrotrypsin columns (20Che F-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This resin specifically binds peptides containing C-terminal Lys or Arg residues, which accumulate in Cpefat/fat mice. By analyzing the affinity-purified material on liquid chromatography columns coupled to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LC/MS) and comparing the results obtained with Cpefat/fat versus wild type mouse brain extracts, it is straightforward to determine which peptides are highly enriched in Cpefat/fat mice (20Che F-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Then, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used to obtain sequence information and conclusively identify the peptides. Previously, these enriched peptides were found to represent either neuropeptide-processing intermediates, other fragments of proteins known to be processed in peptide-containing secretory vesicles, or novel peptides that were subsequently found to be processed in the secretory pathway (20Che F-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, we have modified this basic approach to include differential isotopic labeling so that relative quantitation can be performed (15Che F-Y. Biswas R. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 21Che F-Y. Fricker L.D. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3190-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Che F-Y. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 713-722PubMed Google Scholar, 23Che F-Y. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). In the present study, we used this quantitative peptidomics approach to examine changes in the relative levels of hypothalamic peptides in response to body weight reduction by two different paradigms. One paradigm involved food deprivation for 48 h, which resulted in a 10% reduction in body weight. The other paradigm involved voluntary exercise on activity wheels for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of this period, Cpefat/fat mice given access to wheels gained less weight than sedentary Cpefat/fat mice housed in standard cages, and the difference in body weight between exercising and sedentary groups was ∼10% (24Yuan Q. Fontenele-Neto J.D. Fricker L.D. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though both methods resulted in mice that were 10% lighter than control Cpefat/fat mice, there were dramatic differences in the relative levels of many hypothalamic peptides in the food-deprived animals, and these changes were not observed in the exercising animals. Materials—Me2SO, CHAPS, disodium phosphate, glycine, hydroxylamine, and formic acid were from Aldrich. Acetonitrile was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Anhydrotrypsin-agarose was from Panvera (Madison, WI). H9- and D9-[3-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yloxycarbonyl)propyl]trimethylammonium chloride (TMAB) were synthesized as described previously (23Che F-Y. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Animal Treatment—Several breeding pairs of BKS.HRS-Cpefat/J mice (Cpefat/+) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the barrier facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Mice homozygous for the fat mutation (i.e. Cpefat/fat mice) as well as wild type littermates were obtained from crosses of the heterozygous breeding pairs. Unless indicated below, animals were housed in standard mouse cages with rodent chow (5058, Labdiet, St. Louis, MO) and water provided ad libitum and light from 7:00 to 19:00. All experimental protocols were approved by the committee for animal experimentation of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. For the analysis of the effect of food deprivation on hypothalamic peptides, a total of 20 Cpefat/fat mice and 14 wild type littermates were used, as shown in Fig. 1. The Cpefat/fat mice were divided into four groups of five animals. Each group contained either two or three females and had an average age of 15 weeks. The number of male and female mice in each group was balanced so that the two groups that were eventually pooled (Fig. 1) had an equal number of male and female mice. Two groups were deprived of food for 48 h, while the other two groups had free access to food. Wild type mice were divided into two groups of seven animals each, with three males and four females per group. One group was deprived of food for 48 h, and the other was allowed access to food. Mice were sacrificed with CO2 vapor, and the hypothalami were dissected. Tissue was stored at –70 °C until analysis, as described below.Fig. 1Scheme showing number of animals per group, labeling reagent, and pooling strategy for the various groups in the two experimental paradigms. Top: mice were housed in standard mouse cages and were either provided free access to food or were deprived of food for 48 h before sacrifice. Bottom: mice were given free access to food and were housed in either standard mouse cages (Sedentary) or in larger rat cages equipped with exercise wheels for 4 weeks. In both studies, the mice were ∼15 weeks old at the time of sacrifice. Hypothalami were extracted and labeled with either H9-TMAB reagent (H-tag) or the D9-TMAB reagent (D-tag). The extracts were pooled as indicated and then purified on anhydrotrypsin-agarose columns and analyzed by LC/MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the study involving voluntary exercise, all mice were 11-week-old males at the start of the 4-week study. Two groups of 3–4 Cpefat/fat mice and one group of 7 wild type mice were housed individually in standard mouse cages (28 × 18 cm floor, 12-cm height) without access to exercise wheels (“sedentary” group). Another two groups of 3–4 Cpefat/fat mice and one group of 7 wild type mice were housed individually in standard rat cages (48 × 27-cm floor, 20-cm height) equipped with exercise wheels (14.5-cm diameter). Both sedentary and exercising groups were allowed free access to food and water. Body weight was measured every 2 days, as described (24Yuan Q. Fontenele-Neto J.D. Fricker L.D. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and hypothalami were dissected and stored at –70 °C until analysis. For the analysis of the effect of food deprivation on mRNA levels, a total of 16 mice were used: 8 Cpefat/fat mice and 8 wild type littermates, all 13–15 weeks of age. Four animals of each genetic background were deprived of food for 48 h, while the other four animals of the group were allowed free access to chow. Mice were then sacrificed, and hypothalami were removed. RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and stored at –80 °C. Equal amounts of RNA from each animal were analyzed separately on Northern blots, as described below. Peptide Extraction and Labeling with Differential Stable Isotopic Tags—To extract peptides from Cpefat/fat or wild type mouse hypothalami, 300 μl of 10 mm HCl was added for each hypothalamus in the tube (Fig. 1). The tissue was sonicated three times each for 5 s and incubated at 70 °C for 20 min. The homogenate was combined with 200 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 9.5, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken out, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 9.5, and centrifuged. The second supernatant was combined with the first and concentrated to 500 μl in a vacuum centrifuge. Another 200 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 9.5, was added to the supernatant, and the pH was adjusted to 9.5 with 1 m NaOH. To label the resulting mixture, 6 μl of 300 μg/μl TMAB reagent in Me2SO was added to the mixture. The extract from one group of fed or sedentary animals was labeled with the H9-TMAB reagent, and the extract from a food-deprived or exercising group was labeled with the D9-TMAB reagent, as indicated (Fig. 1). Another two groups were labeled with the reverse scheme, so that the food-deprived or exercising group received the H9-TMAB reagent while the control group received the D9 label. After 10 min, the pH was adjusted back to 9.5 with 1.0 m NaOH. The addition of TMAB and NaOH was repeated six times over 4 h. After adjustment of the pH to 9.5 again, 80 μlof2.5 m glycine was added to the reaction mixture to quench any remaining label reagents. After 40 min with glycine, the light and heavy reagent-labeled samples were pooled as shown in Fig. 1 and filtered through a Microcon YM-10 unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove molecules with a molecular mass greater than 10 kDa. After the pH was adjusted to 9.0–9.5, 2.0 m hydroxylamine (in Me2SO) was added to remove any labels that might have attached to the hydroxyl side chains of tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues. After repeating this step twice, 1.0 m NaAc, pH 5.0, 5% CHAPS, and 1.0 m CaCl2 were combined with the reaction to obtain a final concentration of 50 mm, 0.25%, and 20 mm, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 with 6 m acetic acid. The resulting mixture was subjected to affinity purification on a column containing ∼0.5 ml anhydrotrypsin-agarose (60–90 nmol of protein/ml of resin) to selectively isolate peptide containing C-terminal basic residues. The column was first washed with 28 ml of 0.25% CHAPS in 50 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0, containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 m NaCl and then rinsed with 32 ml of 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0, containing only 10 mm CaCl2. Peptides were eluted first with 6 ml of water, then with 12 ml of 6 mm HCl. The eluates were combined and concentrated to 100 μl in a vacuum centrifuge. Aliquots (50%) of sample were used for further analysis, as described below. Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectrometry—LC/MS/MS experiments were performed on an Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX API QSTAR PULSARi™ quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer coupled with a micro-ESI source. An UltiMate™ Capillary/Nano LC System was directly connected to the mass spectrometer. After loading on a PepMap™ C18 trapping column (5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm i.d. × 5 mm, LC Packings) and desalting for 20 min with 2% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, the sample was backflushed into and separated on a Vydac MS C18 capillary column (5 μm, 300 Å, 75 μm i.d. × 15 cm) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min with a gradient from 2% to 52% solvent B in 45 min, then to 90% B in 20 min. Solvent A was 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. Solvent B was 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. LC/MS/MS was carried out with the Information Dependent Acquisition method. The ion spray voltage of the micro-ESI source was 5.5 kV. MS/MS spectra were acquired for 2 s, and the dynamic exclusion time for previously fragmented ions was 300 s. The Rolling Collision Energy feature of Analyst QS software was used for the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptide ions. All m/z ions detected in the LC/MS analysis of the Cpefat/fat mice were used to search for ions with the same mass, charge, and elute time in the wild type extracts. Further analyses (i.e. quantitation and identification) were further performed only for these peptides found in the Cpefat/fat extracts and not present in the wild type extracts; previous studies have shown that those peptides unique to Cpefat/fat mice represent neuroendocrine peptides and other peptides generated in the secretory pathway (20Che F-Y.

Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative levels of peptides in treated versus non-treated Cpefat/fat mouse hypothalami were determined by the ratio of peak intensity of the H9-TMAB- and D9-TMAB-labeled peptide pairs, as described (15Che F-Y. Biswas R. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Che F-Y. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). All MS/MS spectra of labeled peptides were interpreted manually. The experimentally determined parent mass of the TMAB-labeled peptide was converted to the parent mass of the unlabeled and unprotonated peptide using the isotopic masses of the light (128.1177) and heavy (137.1728) forms of TMAB label as described previously (23Che F-Y. Fricker L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). For a peptide to be considered as “identified,” the parent mass of a peptide had to be within 30 ppm (preferably 20 ppm) of the theoretical value and more than 80% of the CID fragments observed in the MS/MS spectra had to match predicted fragments, with at least five matches to b- and/or y-ions. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA samples were fractionated on 1.2% w/v agarose gels containing formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action with 10× SSC and fixed by baking for 2 h at 80 °Cina vacuum oven. To generate a SAAS-probe for Northern blotting analysis, XbaI-linearized pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene) carrying an 835-bp PCR fragment of mouse pro-SAAS cDNA, T7 RNA polymerase, and [α-32P]UTP were used. For the proenkephalin probe, a p64E vector carrying a 1070-bp fragment of mouse proenkephalin cDNA was cut with EcoRI, and the linearized vector was used as a riboprobe template with SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP. To create the CPD probe, pGEM72 vector carrying a 600-bp mouse CPD PCR product (corresponding to carboxypeptidase domain 2) was cut with BamHI and the linearized product used in the riboprobe reaction with T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP. The blots were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (50% v/v deionized formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for 1 h at 60 °C prior to addition of [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes (12–15 × 106 cpm per 20 ml of hybridization buffer). After hybridization overnight at 60 °C, the blots were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min and twice with 0.2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. Labeled bands were detected by autoradiography at –70 °C with Kodak film. Quantitation was performed by densitization of the autoradiogram and normalization to the level of either 18 S or 28 S rRNA. Altogether, 82 different peptides were detected upon LC/MS analyses of the extracts of Cpefat/fat mouse hypothalamus that were not detectable in the extracts of wild type mouse hypothalamus (Table I). Previously, those peptides found to be greatly enriched in Cpefat/fat mouse brain extracts, relative to wild type mouse brain extracts, were neuropeptide-processing intermediates or other fragments of neuroendocrine secretory pathway proteins (20Che F-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Of the 82 peptides detected in the present study, 40 were identified by MS/MS sequencing (Table I). Representative MS/MS data are shown in Fig. 2. The criteria for considering a peptide identified include a match of the parent mass within 30 ppm of the predicted mass, and at least five fragment ions that matched a predicted b- or y-series ion, also within 30 ppm. An additional nine peptides matched the theoretical parent mass of a known hypothalamic peptide, but there was insufficient MS/MS data to permit a conclusive identification; these nine peptides are indicated in Table I with parentheses. Thirty-three other peptides that were detected upon LC/MS of the Cpefat/fat mouse hypothalamic extracts could not be assigned, either because the ions gave very low signals that were not selected by the mass spectrometer for MS/MS sequencing or because the MS/MS spectra could not be interpreted. Uninterpretable spectra could be due to a low signal strength, which results in few MS/MS fragments, a large peptide size that produces a complex MS/MS fragmentation pattern, and/or post-translational modifications that alter the parent and fragment masses. All of the 40 peptides identified from MS/MS sequencing as well as the 9 additional peptides that were tentatively assigned based only on parent mass were modified with the appropriate number of isotopic tags: one tag per free N terminus and one per Lys residue (Table I). This provides an additional confirmation that the identification of the peptide is correct.

https://openalex.org/W2032278103,"Associative learning theory assumes that prediction error is a driving force in learning. A competing view, probabilistic contrast (PC) theory, is that learning and prediction error are unrelated. We tested a learning phenomenon that has proved troublesome for associative theory —retrospective revaluation—to evaluate these two models. We previously showed that activation in right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides a reliable signature for the presence of prediction error. Thus, if the associative view is correct, retrospective revaluation should be accompanied by right lateral PFC activation. PC theory would be supported by the absence of this activation. Right PFC and ventral striatal activation occurred during retrospective revaluation, supporting the associative account. Activations appeared to reflect the degree of revaluation, predicting later brain responses to revalued cues. Our results support a modified associative account of retrospective revaluation and demonstrate the potential of functional neuroimaging as a tool for evaluating competing learning models."
https://openalex.org/W2043805631,"Cyclic nucleotides directly enhance the opening of the tetrameric CNG and HCN channels, although the mechanism remains unclear. We examined why HCN and certain CNG subunits form functional homomeric channels, whereas other CNG subunits only function in heteromeric channels. The “defect” in the CNGA4 subunit that prevents its homomeric expression was localized to its C-linker, which connects the transmembrane domain to the binding domain and contains a tripeptide that decreases the efficacy of ligand gating. Remarkably, replacement of the homologous HCN tripeptide with the CNGA4 sequence transformed cAMP into an inverse agonist that inhibits HCN channel opening. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we identified the structural basis for this gating switch: whereas cAMP normally enhances the assembly of HCN C-terminal domains into a tetrameric gating ring, inclusion of the CNGA4 tripeptide reversed this action so that cAMP now causes gating ring disassembly. Thus, ligand gating depends on the dynamic oligomerization of C-terminal binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W2111260652,"Activation of Ras or Raf in the human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line, TT, induces growth arrest and differentiation via two parallel, yet independent, pathways. One of these pathways is intracellular and the other is a cell-extrinsic, autocrine/paracrine pathway mediated by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/JAK/STAT pathway. Here, we show that IFI16 is a necessary and sufficient downstream effector for LIF effects in MTC cells, specifically required for the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway-induced growth inhibition in these cells. IFI16 was induced by Raf or LIF. Dominant-negative STAT3 could block the induction, indicating that Raf can induce IFI16 only via the cell-extrinsic pathway. Knock-down of IFI16 using siRNA abrogated LIF-induced changes in cellular levels of E2F1, cyclin D1, and p21WAF/CIP1, and cell cycle arrest. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IFI16 was sufficient to induce growth arrest. In contrast to its essential role for LIF-mediated growth arrest, IFI16 was not required for differentiation induced by LIF. Knock-down of IFI16 could not block changes in differentiation markers of the MTC cells, including calcitonin, RET, and cell morphology.

These tumor cell lines generally are derived from cell types that do not show dependence on dysregulated Ras/Raf signaling for cell growth, and mutation of Ras/Raf or elevated signaling of the pathway is rarely detected in these tumor types. This suggests that some tumor types may retain the ability to respond to Ras/Raf activation with growth arrest. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of Ras/Raf-induced growth arrest in these tumors may provide insight into the control of tumor growth. Recently, we reported that sustained expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) 1The abbreviations used are: MTC, medullary thyroid carcinoma; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; SCLC, small cell lung cancer; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. cell line, TT, induces growth arrest and differentiation via two parallel, yet independent, pathways (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of these pathways is intracellular, similar to the Ras-mediated arrest of primary fibroblasts. The other pathway is a novel autocrine/paracrine pathway, in which Ras/Raf activation induces expression and secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a multifunctional cytokine of the interleukin-6 family (19Auernhammer C.J. Melmed S. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 313-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Knight D. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 14: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). LIF then mediates a cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory signaling pathway, through the LIFR-gp130 receptor, via induction of JAK/STAT signaling. The pathway of Ras/Raf-mediated LIF expression and consequent activation of STAT3 is maintained in the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines NCI-H209 and DMS53 (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, intriguingly, these SCLC cells do not undergo growth arrest and differentiation in response to LIF, suggesting that the LIF-mediated growth inhibitory signaling in SCLC cells may be impeded at a step distal to STAT3 activation. Thus, it is important to identify downstream components of the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated growth inhibition and differentiation signaling to characterize the different responses of MTC and SCLC cells to LIF/JAK/STAT activation. This study was performed to dissect the mechanism of the Ras/Raf-induced cell-extrinsic signaling pathways in MTC cells. Using a cDNA microarray, we have identified IFI16, an interferon-inducible transcriptional repressor, as a down-stream target of the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway. We show that IFI16 is essential and sufficient for the LIF/JAK/STAT-induced growth arrest in MTC cells, but is not required for differentiation, which is also induced by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway along with growth arrest. Thus, IFI16 appears to be specific for cell cycle regulation mediated by the cell-extrinsic LIF/JAK/STAT pathway and separates the regulation of growth arrest from that of differentiation. We also show that, unlike in MTC cells, IFI16 cannot be induced by LIF in the SCLC cell line DMS53. However, IFI16 can induce growth arrest in DMS53 cells, suggesting that IFI16 may be a missing component for the LIF-induced growth inhibitory signaling in some SCLC cells. Our study defines IFI16 as an essential growth specific effector of the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated cell-extrinsic pathway of Ras/Raf. Cell Culture and Conditioned Media Treatment—The human MTC cell line TT, and the TTRaf cell line containing the activable ΔRaf-1:ER construct, the catalytic domain of Raf-1 fused to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor, have been described previously (17Carson E.B. McMahon M. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2048-2052PubMed Google Scholar). ΔRaf-1:ER was activated with 1 μm β-estradiol (Sigma). TTRaf cells were maintained in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 16% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml and 0.25 mg of G418 (Invitrogen) per ml for selection. DMS53 cells were maintained in Waymouth's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Conditioned medium containing recombinant LIF was prepared from the HEK293LIFV5 cell line as described previously (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recombinant LIF (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used at a concentration of 4,000 units/ml. Interferon-α or -γ was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and used at 1,000 units/ml or 10 ng/ml, respectively. For cell growth curves, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Cellstar, Carrollton, TX) at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and counted using a hemocytometer. Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was performed at the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Microarray Core using glass arrays embedded with 20,000 human genes (Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Microarray Core). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and labeled using a fluorescence DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Glass arrays were then hybridized for 12-18 h with the probes. Data were analyzed using the Gene Spring 5.0 program (Silicon Genetics). PCR—RT-PCR of IFI16 was performed by reverse transcription of 0.25 μg of total RNA and subsequent 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers AAATTCAGATTGCTGACTTGA and CACAAAAAAGATAATGTTTATTTA (IFI16 nucleotides 421-2477). The results were normalized for expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), using primers CAGCCGAGCCACATCG and TGAGGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTC. To measure calcitonin gene expression, real-time PCR was performed by reverse transcription of 0.25 μg total RNA and subsequent polymerase chain reaction using Hot Star TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). For calcitonin, primers AGTGAGCTGGAGCAGGAGCAAGAG and TCAAATGATCAGCACATTCAGAAG were used. For calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), AGTGAGCTGGAGCAGGAGCAAGAG and CATTACCATGTGTCCCCAGATGCC were used. The results were normalized for expression of phosphoglycerate kinase, using primers CAGTTTGGAGCTCCTGGAAG and TGCAAATCCAGGGTCCAGTG. siRNA-mediated Knock-down of IFI16—The siRNA oligomer targeted to IFI16 UCAGAAGACCACAAUCUAC (IFI16 nucleotides 1241-1259) and the control ACUCUAUCUGCACGCUGACUU were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cells were seeded at 50% confluence 1 day prior to transfection and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For stable expression of small hairpin IFI16 RNA, GATCCCGTCAGAAGACCACAATCTACTTCAAGAGAGTAGATTGTGGTCTTCTGATTTTTTGGAAA and AGCTTTTCCAAAAAATCAGAAGACCACAATCTACTCTCTTGAAGTAGATTGTGGTCTTCTGACGG were annealed and ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro (Ambion, Austin, TX). Successful knock-down of IFI16 was confirmed by Western analysis of IFI16. The pSilencer-mediated knock-down of IFI16 in culture was compared with cells transfected with the pSilencer hygro Negative Control, which was supplied with the pSilencer™ hygro kit (Ambion). The pSilencer hygro Negative Control plasmid is a circular plasmid encoding a hairpin RNA whose sequence is not found in the mouse, human, or rat genome data base. Plasmids and Recombinant Adenoviruses—From pCMVSPORT6-IFI16 (Open Biosystems), IFI16 was subcloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(-). The adenovirus AdIFI16, expressing IFI16, was made using the AdEasy system (22He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, IFI16 was subcloned into the KpnI and XbaI restriction sites of the pAdTrackCMV shuttle vector, and the resulting plasmid was recombined with the pAdEasy1 vector in BJ5183 bacterial cells. The dominant-negative STAT3 adenovirus AdSTAT3-DN and the control virus AdGFP (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the constitutively active Raf-BXB adenovirus (23Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), were described previously. The dominant-negative human STAT3 has a Y705F mutation (24Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The viral titer was measured using an Adeno-X rapid titer kit (Clontech). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 40 mm citrate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Nuclei were prepared, stained with propidium iodide (25Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar), and analyzed with an LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a gate that selects single nuclei within a normal size range. The cell cycle parameters from 10,000 gated nuclei were determined by CellQuest software. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells harvested at various times were lysed in 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS with aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, E-64, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and briefly sonicated before determining the protein concentration using BCA reagents (Pierce). 50-100 μg of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore), and stained with Fast Green reagent (Fisher Scientific). Membrane filters were then blocked in 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl-0.05% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Antibodies were diluted as follows: IFI16, 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); RET, 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); E2F1, 1:1,000 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA); cyclin D1, 1:1,000 (Neomarkers); and GAPDH, 1:5,000 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used for visualization of the signal. Colony Formation Assays—Colony formation assays were performed as described previously (26Xin H. D'Souza S. Fang L. Lengyel P. Choubey D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6828-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 4 μg of empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 harboring IFI16 gene, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following 24 h of transfection, cells were split into two 100-mm plates and selected in G418 for about 2 weeks. Colonies exhibiting G418 resistance were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue before counting. Cell Proliferation Assay—For the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, cells infected with AdIFI16 or the control AdGFP in 24-well plates were treated with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) in phenol red free RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 h at 37 °C. Then, the medium was replaced with 600 μl of Me2SO and shaken for 15 min prior to measuring optical density at 540 nm. A540 was measured every 2 days for 8 days. Ras/Raf Activation Induces IFI16 via the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated Autocrine/Paracrine Pathway—Previously, we showed that Ras/Raf-induced growth arrest and differentiation in the human MTC cell line, TT, is mediated via two parallel, yet independent, pathways (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One is intracellular and the other is the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated autocrine/paracrine pathway. These two pathways induce growth arrest accompanied by a differentiation program characterized by changes in morphology, expression of the neuroendocrine markers calcitonin and CGRP, and down-regulation of RET, the pro-to-oncogene responsible for MTC development in the MEN 2 syndromes (17Carson E.B. McMahon M. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2048-2052PubMed Google Scholar, 27Carson-Walter E.B. Smith D.P. Ponder B.A. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanism of the growth inhibition mediated by Ras/Raf-induced cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic signaling, we sought to identify downstream effectors of these parallel pathways. For this, we examined changes in gene expression induced by these signaling pathways using microarray analysis techniques. Information on genes regulated by the cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory pathway was collected by examining total RNA extracted from TT cells treated with LIF, in the absence or presence of a dominant-negative STAT3, and subsequently selecting genes induced in a STAT3-dependent manner. We have shown that STAT3 is essential for the LIF-mediated growth inhibitory response in TT cells (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We then examined gene expression upon Raf activation, which represents both intracellular and the autocrine/paracrine pathways. This result was then compared with the LIF-regulated gene expression profile. In this way, we could identify genes specifically regulated either by cell-intrinsic signaling or by the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated extrinsic pathway. We were particularly interested in the genes regulated by LIF in a STAT3-dependent manner, since they represent potential downstream targets specific for the cell-extrinsic pathway. Among these STAT3-induced genes in TT cells, IFI16, which has been shown to inhibit growth in other cell types (28Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5833-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was a fascinating candidate to mediate LIF-induced growth arrest. We further analyzed the LIF/JAK/STAT-dependent induction of IFI16 by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Indeed, increase in the mRNA level of IFI16 could be detected upon Raf activation or LIF treatment, while the induction was blocked in cells infected with a dominant-negative STAT3 adenovirus (Fig. 1, A and B). A similar pattern of STAT3-dependent induction was also observed at the protein level (Fig. 1C). Since STAT3 is activated and utilized only by the cell-extrinsic pathway, these data indicate that Raf induces IFI16 via the LIF/JAK/STAT-mediated cell extrinsic pathway but not via intracellularly mediated signaling pathways. IFI16 Is Necessary and Sufficient for Growth Inhibition but Is Not Required for Differentiation Induced by LIF—To investigate the functional relevance of IFI16 to LIF-mediated cell growth arrest and differentiation, we knocked down IFI16 expression during LIF treatment and also overexpressed IFI16 in TT cells. First, to determine whether IFI16 is necessary for LIF-mediated growth inhibition, we transfected TT cells with siRNA targeted to IFI16. The siRNA treatment could effectively block IFI16 induction by LIF (Fig. 2A). For a more durable knock-down, we stably transfected TT cells with pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector harboring a sequence to express small hairpin IFI16 RNA. We then measured cell growth in the presence of LIF. LIF suppressed growth of control TT cells, whereas TT cells expressing the small hairpin IFI16 RNA could still proliferate in the presence of LIF (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this result, the TT cells expressing the small hairpin IFI16 RNA could undergo cell cycle progression despite LIF treatment (Fig. 2C). IFI16 is known to regulate the expression of E2F1 and p53 and, thus, affect cellular levels of p21WAF/CIP1 (29Xin H. Curry J. Johnstone R.W. Nickoloff B.J. Choubey D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4831-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Johnstone R.W. Wei W. Greenway A. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6033-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the cellular level of these proteins and the cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1. Knock-down of IFI16 could block down-regulation of E2F1 and cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p21WAF/CIP1 by LIF (Fig. 2A). However, p53 expression was not affected by LIF, and IFI16 knock-down did not induce any additional effect on p53 expression in TT cells (data not shown). LIF also induces differentiation in TT cells, with changes in cell morphology, down-regulation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, and increased expression of the calcitonin/CGRP gene (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast to its effects on LIF-mediated cell growth arrest, IFI16 knock-down did not block RET down-regulation, expression of calcitonin/CGRP, or the typical morphology change induced by LIF (Fig. 3, A-C), indicating that IFI16 may not be required for the differentiation program induced by LIF in TT cells. These data show that, in TT cells, IFI16 is an essential mediator specific for cell cycle arrest, but not for differentiation, induced by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway.Fig. 3IFI16 is not required for LIF-mediated differentiation. TT cells stably transfected with pSilencer 2.1 containing sequences for expression of small hairpin RNA for IFI16 (si-IFI16) were treated with LIF for 2 days and observed for expression of RET by Western blotting (A), expression of calcitonin/CGRP by real time PCR (B), and morphological changes (C). Control cells were stably transfected with the empty vector. Data (means ± S.E.) are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether IFI16 could be a sufficient effector for the growth arrest induced by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway. To test this, we made an adenoviral construct containing the IFI16 gene and observed the effect of IFI16 overexpression in TT cells. TT cells infected with this virus showed a substantial increase of IFI16, relative to the parental cells or the control virus infected cells (Fig. 4B). Cells infected with the adenovirus-containing IFI16 gene showed significantly retarded growth, indicating that IFI16 is sufficient to induce growth arrest in TT cells (Fig. 4A). Consistently, cells infected with the IFI16 virus showed a substantial decrease in S-phase population and increase in G0/G1-phase, relative to the control virus-infected TT cells (Fig. 4C). No significant differences in growth were observed between the parental cells and the control virus infected cells. Along with this, we observed a decrease in the level of E2F1 and cyclin D1 and a modest increase in p21WAF/CIP1 level (Fig. 4B). The growth inhibitory effect of IFI16 was also confirmed by a colony formation assay (Fig. 4D). TT cells transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 harboring the IFI16 gene formed a significantly reduced number of colonies relative to the cells transfected with the empty vector. Consistent with our findings using IFI16 siRNA described above, IFI16 overexpression did not affect the differentiation of TT cells. Thus, contrary to its sufficiency for cell growth arrest, IFI16 did not induce RET down-regulation, calcitonin/CGRP, and morphological changes in TT cells (Fig. 5, A-C).Fig. 5IFI16 cannot induce differentiation in MTC cells. TT cells were infected for 2 days with AdIFI16 and the control AdGFP. Cells were then tested for expression of RET by Western blotting (A), expression of calcitonin/CGRP by real time PCR (B), and morphological changes (C). TT cells were also treated with LIF for 2 days as the positive control for morphological changes. Similar infection ratio was ascertained by GFP expression (bottom panel). Data (means ± S.E.) are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these data show that IFI16 is necessary and sufficient to mediate growth arrest induced by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway, but it is not required for differentiation that is also induced by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway in TT cells. IFI16 Is Not Induced in the SCLC Cell Line DMS53 by LIF—We previously showed that Ras/Raf activation also induced LIF expression and consequent activation of STAT3 in the SCLC line DMS53 (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, DMS53 cells did not undergo growth arrest and differentiation in response to LIF, suggesting that this SCLC cell line may be impeded in its ability to respond to LIF at a step distal to STAT3 activation. Therefore we questioned whether the expression status of IFI16 might be correlated with this lack of LIF-mediated growth arrest in DMS53 cells. We examined whether IFI16 could be induced in DMS53 cells by LIF treatment. The basal level of IFI16 was low in DMS53 cells. LIF treatment or Raf activation could not induce IFI16 expression, as tested by Western blotting, indicating that signaling between STAT3 and IFI16 may be disabled in DMS53 cells (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, IFI16 expression could be induced by the known inducers of IFI16, interferon-α or -γ (Fig. 6), indicating that the endogenous IFI16 gene is competent to be expressed in DMS53 cells. Overexpression of IFI16 Leads to Growth Arrest in DMS53 Cells—We then asked whether expression of IFI16 was able to induce growth arrest in DMS53 cells. Infection of DMS53 cells with the IFI16 adenovirus resulted in a substantial increase of IFI16 level (Fig. 7B) and inhibition of growth and cell cycle progression (Fig. 7, A and C). We further confirmed this growth inhibitory effect of IFI16 in DMS53 cells by a colony formation assay. DMS53 cells transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 harboring the IFI16 gene formed significantly reduced number of colonies relative to the cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 7D). Consistent with these data, down-regulation of E2F1 and cyclin D1 level and up-regulation of p21WAF/CIP1 level were observed in DMS53 cells infected with the IFI16 virus (Fig. 7B). Together, these data indicate that some SCLC cells, like MTC cells, are sensitive to IFI16-mediated growth arrest, but these cells may be impeded in their ability to undergo growth arrest in response to LIF, due to lack of IFI16 inducibility by the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway. This study shows that IFI16 is an essential and sufficient mediator specific for the growth inhibition induced by the Ras/Raf-mediated cell-extrinsic signaling pathway in MTC cells (Fig. 8). IFI16 is a member of the interferon-inducible HIN200 nuclear protein family that shares a structural hallmark of a 200 amino acid repeat (31Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M.J. Ramsay R.G. Eddy R.L.

IFI16 has been shown to have transcriptional repressor activity (34Johnstone R.W. Kerry J.A. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17172-17177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and also has been shown to inhibit tube morphogenesis and proliferation of primary human endothelial cells in a p53- and Rb-dependent manner (35Raffaella R. Gioia D. De Andrea M. Cappello P. Giovarelli M. Marconi P. Manservigi R. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to its originally suggested role in the control of myeloid differentiation (32Dawson M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that IFI16 may have a role in cancer biology. IFI16 can bind to p53 and modulate expression of its target genes in the control of cell cycle regulation (30Johnstone R.W. Wei W. Greenway A. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6033-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Kwak J.C. Ongusaha P.P. Ouchi T. Lee S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40899-40904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), while loss of IFI16 can result in deregulation of p53-mediated apoptosis, leading to cancer development (37Fujiuchi N. Aglipay J.A. Ohtsuka T. Maehara N. Sahin F. Su G.H. Lee S.W. Ouchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20339-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). IFI16 can also interact with BRCA1 through its Pyrin domain and mediate DNA damage-induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in a p53-dependent manner (38Aglipay J.A. Lee S.W. Okada S. Fujiuchi N. Ohtsuka T. Kwak J.C. Wang Y. Johnstone R.W. Deng C. Qin J. Ouchi T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8931-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our data show that overexpression or depletion of IFI16 can affect cellular level of E2F1, cyclin D1, and p21WAF/CIP1, suggesting that IFI16 regulation of these cell cycle control proteins may play a role in LIF-mediated growth arrest. Interestingly, IFI16 is an effector specific only for growth arrest but not differentiation, in response to the LIF-mediated cell extrinsic pathway upon Ras/Raf activation in TT cells. LIF mediates a cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory signaling pathway, through the LIFR-gp130 receptor, via induction of JAK/STAT signaling. Negative regulation of the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway can be achieved by protein-tyrosine phosphotases such as SHP-1, by proteolytic degradation, and by other regulators such as SOC (suppressor of cytokine signaling) and PIAS (protein inhibitor of STAT) (39Greenhalgh C.J. Hilton D.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK signal transduction pathway induces TT cells both to undergo growth arrest and to display changes in differentiation markers, including morphology, calcitonin/CGRP ratio, and down-regulation of RET and hASH expression (16Nakagawa T. Mabry M. de Bustros A. Ihle J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5923-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Carson E.B. McMahon M. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2048-2052PubMed Google Scholar, 27Carson-Walter E.B. Smith D.P. Ponder B.A. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Chen H. Carson-Walter E.B. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Ball D.W. Surgery. 1996; 120: 168-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These differentiation changes, except for hASH down-regulation, are also induced by the LIF-mediated cell extrinsic pathway of Ras/Raf signaling (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, these signal transduction cascades appear to induce a coordinated program of differentiation and growth arrest (Fig. 8). Identification of IFI16 as an effector specific for growth arrest, in the cell-extrinsic signaling pathway, clearly demonstrates that the downstream effectors of Ras/Raf/MEK-mediated growth arrest can be separated from those for differentiation (Fig. 8). In the LIF-induced cell extrinsic pathway, STAT3 activation is required for both differentiation and growth arrest, including induction of IFI16 (Fig. 8). Identification of the signaling components linking STAT3 activation and IFI16 expression may further elucidate the divergent mechanisms of growth arrest and differentiation signaling. Previously, we have shown that the SCLC cell lines, NCI-H209 and DMS53, could be growth-arrested by Raf activation (12Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Ravi R.K. Thiagalingam A. Weber E. McMahon M. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have also shown that these SCLC cells produce LIF in response to Ras/Raf activation (18Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The level of LIF production was high enough to activate STAT3 in the SCLC cell lines at a similar level as in TT cells and to induce growth arrest of TT cells. However, LIF could not induce growth arrest in these SCLC cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the LIF-induced growth inhibitory signaling is disabled at a step distal to STAT3 in these SCLC cell lines while their cell intrinsic pathway for growth inhibitory signaling by Ras/Raf is intact. In this study, we have found that IFI16 could not be induced by LIF in DMS53 cells, although overexpression of IFI16 could lead to growth arrest of the cell line. Thus, it appears that the inability of the LIF-mediated cell extrinsic pathway to elicit growth arrest in some SCLC cells may be due to the failure to induce IFI16 in response to LIF and that SCLC cells may be impeded in a signaling step between STAT3 and IFI16 (Fig. 8). We speculate that IFI16 induction may determine the ability of some cells to undergo growth arrest in response to LIF. The prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP undergoes growth arrest in response to Raf activation (14Ravi R.K. McMahon M. Yangang Z. Williams J.R. Dillehay L.E. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have observed that LNCaP could not respond to LIF, although it could produce LIF and activate STAT3 in response to Ras/Raf activation. 2E.-J. Kim, J.-I. Park, and B. D. Nelkin, unpublished data. IFI16 could not be induced in LNCaP by LIF, while overexpression of IFI16 was sufficient to induce growth arrest of the cell line (data not shown). IFI16-mediated growth arrest in LNCaP has also been observed in another study (29Xin H. Curry J. Johnstone R.W. Nickoloff B.J. Choubey D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4831-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The inability of SCLC cells to respond to LIF does not appear to be due to DNA methylation-induced silencing of the IFI16 gene. We considered the potential involvement of DNA methylation, since SCLC cells undergo substantial epigenetic changes during tumorigenic development (41Minna J.D. Fong K. Zochbauer-Muller S. Gazdar A.F. Cancer J. 2002; 8: S41-S46PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wistuba I.I. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 3-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of the SCLC cells with the inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2-dC, did not elicit a cellular response to LIF (data not shown), suggesting that DNA methylation is not responsible for the inability of IFI16 induction in these cells. In addition, IFI16 could be induced by interferon-α or -γ in DMS53 cells (Fig. 6), indicating that the IFI16 gene is not silenced in the cells. Further elucidation of the mechanism by which LIF activates IFI16 in TT cells will be important to understanding the biology of Ras/Raf-mediated growth arrest in neuroendocrine cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2030311719,"Mutations in the LIS1 gene cause lissencephaly, a human neuronal migration disorder. LIS1 binds dynein and the dynein-associated proteins Nde1 (formerly known as NudE), Ndel1 (formerly known as NUDEL), and CLIP-170, as well as the catalytic α dimers of brain cytosolic platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). The mechanism coupling the two diverse regulatory pathways remains unknown. We report the structure of LIS1 in complex with the α2/α2 PAF-AH homodimer. One LIS1 homodimer binds symmetrically to one α2/α2 homodimer via the highly conserved top faces of the LIS1 β propellers. The same surface of LIS1 contains sites of mutations causing lissencephaly and overlaps with a putative dynein binding surface. Ndel1 competes with the α2/α2 homodimer for LIS1, but the interaction is complex and requires both the N- and C-terminal domains of LIS1. Our data suggest that the LIS1 molecule undergoes major conformational rearrangement when switching from a complex with the acetylhydrolase to the one with Ndel1."

Garcia-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 135-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These co-signaling events are often mediated by two different but adjacent sites within fibronectin. For instance, fibroblasts plated on the RGD cell binding domain of fibronectin can adhere, but they require additional signals from the heparin (Hep) II domain of fibronectin to form focal adhesions and stress fibers (13Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Co-signaling between integrins, in contrast, appears to result in antagonistic signaling. In melanoma cells and lymphocytes, the co-engagement of α5β1 and α4β1 integrins prevents the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers that would normally form when only α5β1 integrin is engaged (16Moyano J.V. Maqueda A. Casanova B. Garcia-Pardo A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3699-3715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Porter J.C. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Likewise, α4β1 integrin suppress metalloprotease expression transduced by α5β1 integrin in synovial fibroblasts (18Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the engagement of αIIbβ3 integrin down-regulates the functions of α5β1 and α2β1 integrins (19Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ability of co-signaling events to differentially mediate these processes lies in the fact that different integrins utilize different signaling mechanisms to trigger focal adhesion formation. For instance, signaling events mediated by α5β1 integrin require a HSPG co-receptor such as syndecan and involve the activation of protein kinase Cα. In contrast, α4β1 integrin-mediated focal adhesion formation is independent of syndecans and protein kinase Cα activation (8Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Parkinson S.J. Parker P.J. Ng T.T. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of α4 integrin also interacts directly with the signaling adaptor protein paxillin, in contrast to α5β1 integrin, which does not directly interact with paxillin (20Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the need for co-signaling between integrins and syndecans in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation using primary diploid human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. HTM cells are a unique cell type found in the anterior chamber of the human eye. The cytoskeletal organization and adhesive forces of these cells play a key role in maintaining intraocular pressure. Chemical agents that disrupt the cytoskeleton or the signaling pathways that maintain the actomyosin network, such as H-7, cytochalasins, and latrunculins, cause a decrease in intraocular pressure (21Peterson J.A. Tian B. McLaren J.W. Hubbard W.C. Geiger B. Kaufman P.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1749-1758PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tian B. Kaufman P.L. Volberg T. Gabelt B.T. Geiger B. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Kaufman P.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1992; 110: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Robinson J.C. Kaufman P.L.

Therefore, understanding the signaling pathways that regulate these processes is critical for understanding the mechanisms by which intraocular pressure is maintained. Recently, the Hep II domain of fibronectin was shown to lower intraocular pressure in a human eye organ culture system, suggesting that cell-matrix signaling events mediated by the Hep II domain may be involved in controlling intraocular pressure (26Santas A.J. Bahler C. Peterson J.A. Filla M.S. Kaufman P.L. Tamm E.R. Johnson D.H. Peters D.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using a recombinant Hep II domain and the type III 7–10 repeats of fibronectin, the present studies show that limited focal adhesion and stress fiber formation can be mediated by α5β1 integrin independently of a syndecan co-receptor and that α4β1 integrin signaling mediated by the Hep II domain can augment focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in HTM cells. This is the first report that α4β1 integrin can act as a co-receptor for α5β1 integrin and that the α5β1 and α4β1 signaling pathways converge to enhance focal adhesion and stress fiber formation. This is also the first time that the specific activation of α4β1 integrin by the Hep II domain of fibronectin has been demonstrated. This dual signaling through α5β1 and α4β1 integrins may serve to control the adhesive strength and contractility of HTM cells and may provide a mechanism by which these cells can regulate intraocular pressure. Cell Culture—HTM cells isolated as described previously (27Polansky J.R. Weinreb R.N. Baxter J.D. Alvarado J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1979; 18: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar, 28Polansky J.R.

All experiments were done with proliferating, subconfluent cells from passages 6–8. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant HepII domain (type III 12–14 repeats of fibronectin) and the type III 7–10 repeats of fibronectin (Fig. 1) were made as described previously (26Santas A.J. Bahler C. Peterson J.A. Filla M.S. Kaufman P.L. Tamm E.R. Johnson D.H. Peters D.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Aukhil I. Joshi P.

The mutated Hep II domain (Hep II/RK) was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions by mutating the residues Arg9 and Lys25 in the major heparin binding site in the type III 13 repeat of the Hep II domain (15Bloom L.

The changed nucleotides are underlined. Hep II/RK, which was in the bacterial expression vector pGEX 4T1, was then expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified as described previously (26Santas A.J. Bahler C.

Spreading Assay—HTM cells serum-starved for 24 h were harvested with 0.05% trypsin and 0.25 mm EDTA and resuspended in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 2.5 μg/ml amphoteracin B, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were then plated (3–5 × 104 cells/well) in the presence of cycloheximide onto 12-mm round glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ). Coverslips were pre-coated for 1 h at 37 °C with 47 nm (1.7 μg/ml) type III 7–10 repeats of fibronectin diluted in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4). The Hep II domain was added to cells just before plating at 472 nm (12.75 μg/ml), and cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. In some cases, coverslips were co-coated with molar equivalents (47 or 472 nm) of the Hep II domain or the type III 4–5 repeats of fibronectin and 47 nm of the type III 7–10 repeats of fibronectin. At times, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris Cookson, Inc., Ellisville, MO) or the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H-7 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 1 h after plating the cells. To determine the involvement of HSPGs in Hep II domain-mediated cell spreading, cells were pretreated with 30 mm sodium chlorate for 24 h in sulfate-free media and 15% sulfate-free serum, followed by an additional 24 h in the same medium without serum as described previously (32Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). As a control, cells were incubated with 10 mm sodium sulfate or 30 mm sodium chlorate and 10 mm sodium sulfate. In other experiments, soluble heparin (50 μg/ml) was added as an inhibitor at the time of plating, or cells were treated with heparitinase and heparinase (0.0024 IU/ml; ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Irvine, CA). In these latter experiments, cells were incubated with these enzymes for 4 h before plating, with fresh enzyme added after 2 h and throughout the spreading assay (34Allen B.L. Filla M.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine whether α4β1 integrin was involved in cell spreading, an α4 integrin blocking antibody (25 μg/ml; clone A4-PUJ1; Upstate Group, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) was added at the time of plating in the presence and absence of 236 nm Hep II domain or 236 nm of recombinant vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 containing the seven extracellular domains in the spreading assay. VCAM-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HTM cells were washed with 50 mm MES at pH 6.0, permeabilized for 2 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mm MES, and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. Cells were blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (BSA/PBS). Blocked cells were incubated with anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:3000 in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 1 h and then incubated simultaneously with Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Ab) (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (0.67 unit/ml; Molecular Probes) in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Immu-mount (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA). To visualize cell surface heparan sulfate, cells were washed with PBS, fixed, blocked as described above, and incubated with mouse (IgM) antibody 10E4, which detects an epitope present in most heparan sulfates (Seikagaku America, Inc., East Falmouth, MA) (35David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cultures were then labeled with a rabbit anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA) followed by an Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab. All labeling was done for 1 h in 0.1% BSA/PBS, and coverslips were mounted as described above. Cell images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioCam HRm camera (Thornwood, NY) mounted on a Zeiss Axiophan 2 Imaging fluorescence microscope together with AxioVision version 3.1 software. In some experiments, the extent of cell spreading was determined by measuring cell width and length on the computer screen using the AxioVision software. Measurements of cells were made from 8–12 different fields of view per coverslip (n = 40). Only cells with clear borders were measured. The ratio of cell width to length was compared with control cell ratios from four different experiments (n = 160; Fig. 3) or two different experiments (n = 80; Fig. 8). In some cases, the number of cells positive for stress fibers was also counted. Cell counts were made from 8–10 different fields of view per coverslip (n = 50). The number of stress fiber-positive cells was compared with control cells from two different experiments for analysis (n = 100). F-actin Detection—HTM cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were plated onto 22-mm square glass coverslips pre-coated with the type III 7–10 repeats (47 nm) in the presence or absence of the Hep II domain (472 nm). After 3 h, the coverslips were transferred to new wells, washed with PBS, and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS followed by permeabilization for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (0.67 unit/ml) in 0.1% BSA/PBS. Cells were washed, and bound phalloidin was released by incubating the cells for 2 h at room temperature in humidified chambers with 2 ml of methanol under mild agitation (36Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The entire sample from each well was collected, and phalloidin levels were detected using the FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ) and Data Max v.2.2 software with excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/519 nm. Immunoblotting—HTM cells were plated onto 10-cm tissue culture plates in the presence or absence of the Hep II domain (472 nm). All plates were pre-coated with 236 nm of the type III 7–10 repeats (8.5 μg/ml) and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA/PBS (85 °C for 10 min) for 1 h at room temperature. After 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 h, cells were washed with PBS and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C with 15 mm CHAPS in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 10 μg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Lysate (10 μg) from the control and treated cells was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was blocked in 3% BSA/TBS and incubated with either focal adhesion kinase (FAK) polyclonal antibody (pAb; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or phosphospecific FAK pY397 pAb (Upstate Group, Inc.) in 1% BSA/TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Membranes were then washed with TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Bound antibody was detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The area of the bands from three different experiments was measured using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and averaged together to determine fold induction in FAK pY397 phosphorylation. Cell Adhesion Assay—Serum-starved HTM cells were plated in the presence of 10 μg/ml adhesion blocking β1, β3, α5, and αv integrin Abs or control mouse IgG (Sigma) into 96-well plates. Wells had been pre-coated with 47 nm of the type III 7–10 repeats for 1 h at 37 °C, blocked with 2% fatty acid-free BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed before plating the cells. Unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS. Bound cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and stained overnight with 0.5% toluidine blue in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Bound dye was redissolved in 2% SDS and detected at 600 nm using a microplate reader as described previously (37Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat β1 integrin Ab m13 and rat α5 integrin Ab m16 were both kindly provided by Dr. Steve Akiyama (National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). The β3 integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1 and the αv integrin mAb M9 were purchased from BD Biosciences and Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA), respectively. Fluorescence-activated Cell-sorting (FACS) Analysis—Adherent cells were removed with 2 mm EDTA in 0.05% BSA/TBS and washed. If syndecan expression was being detected, cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 30–45 min with rotation at 37 °C to allow regeneration of cell surface syndecans before blocking. In all experiments, cells were blocked with 1% goat serum/TBS on ice for 20 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1% BSA/TBS containing primary antibodies (1 μg/105 cells) directed against α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrins or syndecans 1–4. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were washed with 1% BSA/TBS and resuspended in 1% BSA/TBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary Ab (0.5 μg/105 cells) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1% BSA/TBS. Samples were analyzed on a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). The integrin Abs α2 pAb, α3 pAb, α4 mAb HP2/1, α5 pAb, β1 mAb Hb1.1, αvβ3 mAb LM609, αvβ5 mAb P1F6, and α5β1 mAb HA5 were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. Syndecan-1 mAb B-B4 was from Biodesign International (Seco, ME). Syndecan-2 mAb 10H4, syndecan-3 mAb 1C7, and syndecan-4 mAb 8G3 were generated as described previously (38David G. van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol.

Statistical comparisons were done using Student's t test. The Hep II Domain Induces Stress Fiber Formation and Cell Spreading—To determine whether focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in HTM cells involved co-signaling, HTM cells were plated on the type III 7–10 repeats of fibronectin containing the RGD integrin binding site in the absence or presence of soluble Hep II domain (Fig. 1) for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 2, A-C, when HTM cells were plated on the type III 7–10 repeats in the absence of the Hep II domain, cells were able to attach and spread. Morphologically, however, the cells exhibited a bipolar morphology with few stress fibers and focal adhesions, indicating that they were not completely spread. If soluble Hep II domain was added to the media, cell spreading was enhanced, as was stress fiber formation and the number and intensity of focal adhesions (Fig. 2, E-G). Comparable results are seen when cells were plated on intact fibronectin or when soluble fibronectin was added to cells plated on the type III 7–10 repeats (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, the Hep II domain significantly increased the number of stress fiber-positive cells by 56% over control cells. Measurements of cell width and length verified the immunofluorescent images and showed that the Hep II domain significantly enhanced cell spreading by 76% compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Concomitantly with the increase in spreading, measurements of F-actin levels indicated that polymerized stress fiber levels increased by 51% over controls in the presence of soluble Hep II domain (Fig. 3C). In addition, within 0.5 h, the soluble Hep II domain induced a 2.15-fold increase (p < 0.02) in the phosphorylation of FAK at the Tyr397 site compared with cells plated on the type III 7–10 repeats alone, demonstrating that the Hep II domain also enhanced focal adhesion formation (Fig. 3D). FAK pY397 phosphorylation remained elevated (although not significantly) for the duration of the experiment (3 h) compared with untreated cells. At 3 h, a similar Hep II domain-mediated increase in FAK phosphorylation was seen when HTM cells were plated on intact fibronectin (data not shown).Fig. 2Hep II domain increases stress fiber formation in a Rho kinase-dependent manner. HTM cells were plated on type III 7–10 repeats for 3 h in the absence (A-D) or presence (E-H) of soluble Hep II domain. Y-27632 (7.5 μm) was added 1 h after plating the cells (D and H). Cells were labeled for vinculin to visualize focal adhesions (A and E; red) and phalloidin to visualize actin stress fibers (B and F; green).

C, addition of soluble Hep II domain significantly (p < 0.001) increased F-actin levels by 50.7% over control cells (average of an experiment done in triplicate). F-actin levels were determined by the amount of phalloidin bound as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean percentage of control ± S.E. D, phosphorylation of Tyr397 in FAK was induced 2.15-fold (p < 0.02) at 0.5 h in the presence of the Hep II domain. Phosphorylation of Tyr397 remained elevated 1–1.5-fold for the remainder of the experiment. The blot shown is representative of the experiments that were done in triplicate. FAK phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. FAK pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to determine the levels of FAK, and FAK pY397 pAb (Upstate Group, Inc.) was used to determine phosphorylation of Tyr397 in the presence and absence of the Hep II domain.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2000322651,"Quinoxaline antibiotics are chromopeptide lactones embracing the two families of triostins and quinomycins, each having characteristic sulfur-containing cross-bridges. Interest in these compounds stems from their antineoplastic activities and their specific binding to DNA via bifunctional intercalation of the twin chromophores represented by quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QA). Enzymatic analysis of triostin A-producing Streptomyces triostinicus and quinomycin A-producing Streptomyces echinatus revealed four nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules for the assembly of the quinoxalinoyl tetrapeptide backbone of the quinoxaline antibiotics. The modules were contained in three protein fractions, referred to as triostin synthetases (TrsII, III, and IV). TrsII is a 245-kDa bimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase activating as thioesters for both serine and alanine, the first two amino acids of the quinoxalinoyl tetrapeptide chain. TrsIII, represented by a protein of 250 kDa, activates cysteine as a thioester. TrsIV, an unstable protein of apparent Mr about 280,000, was identified by its ability to activate and N-methylate valine, the last amino acid. QA, the chromophore, was shown to be recruited by a free-standing adenylation domain, TrsI, in conjunction with a QA-binding protein, AcpPSE. Cloning of the gene for the QA-binding protein revealed that it is the fatty acyl carrier protein, AcpPSE, of the fatty acid synthase of S. echinatus and S. triostinicus. Analysis of the acylation reaction of AcpPSE by TrsI along with other A-domains and the aroyl carrier protein AcmACP from actinomycin biosynthesis revealed a specific requirement for AcpPSE in the activation and also in the condensation of QA with serine in the initiation step of QA tetrapeptide assembly on TrsII. These data show for the first time a functional interaction between nonribosomal peptide synthesis and fatty acid synthesis.

Analysis of the acylation reaction of AcpPSE by TrsI along with other A-domains and the aroyl carrier protein AcmACP from actinomycin biosynthesis revealed a specific requirement for AcpPSE in the activation and also in the condensation of QA with serine in the initiation step of QA tetrapeptide assembly on TrsII. These data show for the first time a functional interaction between nonribosomal peptide synthesis and fatty acid synthesis. The family of quinoxaline antibiotics embraces two structurally similar series of compounds, the triostins and quinomycins, produced by various Streptomyces strains (1Corbaz R. Ettlinger L.

They consist of octadepsipeptide rings to which are attached two quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QA) 1The abbreviations used are: QA, quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid; 4-MHA, 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; TPA, thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid; NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; Trs, triostin synthetase; ACMS, actinomycin synthetase; Mkms, mikamycin synthetase; acm, actinomycin; trs, triostin; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ArCP, aroyl carrier protein; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; A-domain, adenylation domain; C-domain, condensation domain; M-domain, methylation domain; E-domain, epimerization domain; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. residues in amide linkages (Fig. 1). The triostins and quinomycins differ in their cross-bridges, represented by either a disulfide or a thioacetal structure, respectively. These are contributed from the thiol groups of the two cysteines present in the octadepsipeptide rings (2Dell A. Williams D.H. Morris H.R. Smith G.A. Feeney J. Roberts G.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The various members of each group differ by amino acid substitutions in the peptide chains (3Yoshida T. Katagiri K.

Other compounds with similarity to the quinoxaline antibiotics are the luzopeptins and sandramycin, which are cyclodecadepsipeptides carrying 3-hydroxyquinoline residues as side groups (5Konishi M.

Wakelin L.P. Nature. 1974; 252: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Ughetto G. Wang A.H. van der Quigley G.J. Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2305-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Like actinomycin, another intercalating agent from streptomycetes, quinoxaline antibiotics inhibit transcription (9Phillips D.R. White R.J. Trist H. Cullinane C. Dean D. Crothers D.M. Anticancer Drug Des. 1990; 5: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). More recent findings indicate that quinomycin A (known as echinomycin) also selectively inhibits DNA synthesis (10May L.G. Madine M.A. Waring M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the quinoxaline antibiotics, as well as luzopeptin and sandramycin, have antineoplastic activities (11Bailly C. Crow S. Minnock A. Waring M.J. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2000; 19: 1337-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of information on the mechanisms of action of the bis-intercalating chromopeptides, only little is known on their biosynthesis. In the case of the quinoxaline antibiotics, in vivo studies of quinomycin A (echinomycin) formation in Streptomyces echinatus have shown that QA is derived from tryptophan and that the amino acids of the peptide rings stem from the free cellular pool (12Yoshida T. Katagiri K. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2645-2651Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Importantly, the demonstration of the conversion of triostins into quinomycins by reduction and rearrangement of the triostin cross-bridge with subsequent S-methylation showed that triostins are the immediate precursors of quinomycins. Accordingly, it was shown that triostin-producing streptomycete strains lack the converting enzyme activity, whereas quinomycin producers possess it (13Cornish A. Fox K.R. Waring M.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 23: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Triostin synthetase I (TrsI), a 58-kDa protein present in triostin A-producing S. triostinicus and in echinomycin-producing S. echinatus, activates QA as the adenylate (14Glund K. Schlumbohm W. Bapat M. Keller U. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3522-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It can also activate a number of structural analogues of QA such as quinoline-2-carboxylic acid, thieno[3,2b]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid (TPA), and 3-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid. These compounds were readily incorporated into triostins or quinomycins when fed to cultures of S. echinatus instead of the endogenous QA to give new compounds (15Gauvreau D. Waring M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that TrsI is involved in the assembly of the quinoxalinoyl peptides, but this assembly remained enigmatic. In several chromopeptide biosynthesis systems, adenylating enzymes (i.e. free-standing A-domains) have been described that activate aryl carboxylic acids as adenylates with subsequent transfer to specific binding proteins that contain ArCP (aroyl carrier protein) domains (16Keller U. Schauwecker F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 233-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Crosa J.H. Walsh C.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). These ArCP domains are always fused to other proteins such as isochorismate lyase in the case of several aryl capped siderophore peptide syntheses, e.g. EntB in Escherichia coli, or to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) such as HMWP2 from Yersinia pestis (18Gehring A.M. Bradley K.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Gehring A.M. Mori I. Perry R.D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11637-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ArCP-thioester interacts with the next downstream module in the biosynthetic sequence by condensation with the tethered amino acid, resulting in an aroyl amino acid that can undergo elongation cycles until the peptide product is completed. The ArCP domains of siderophore synthetases resemble the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) or acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains of the modular NRPS or polyketide synthases of type I (17Crosa J.H. Walsh C.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In the case of synthesis of the chromopeptide actinomycin, the binding protein for the 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid starter unit (4-MHA) was found to be a small free-standing ArCP domain, AcmACP, with significant similarity to fatty acyl carrier proteins of type II fatty acid synthase and polyketide synthases (20Pfennig F. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12508-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). AcmACP is loaded by the adenylating enzyme actinomycin synthetase I (ACMSI), and transfers the 4-MHA to the bimodular NRPS actinomycin synthetase II on which 4-MHA is condensed with threonine, the first amino acid of the actinomycin peptide chain. 4-MHA threonine is later elongated in four further cycles to the 4-MHA pentapeptide lactone end product (21Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Grammel N. Keller U. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Comparing the QA tetrapeptide chains of quinoxaline antibiotics with the chains of other chromopeptide lactones such as 4-MHA pentapeptide lactone (Fig. 2), enzymatic assembly of QA tetrapeptide should have basic steps in common with other streptomycete biosynthesis systems. We show the enzymatic characterization of the triostin NRPS assembly system that surprisingly uses the acyl carrier protein of fatty acid synthase, AcpPSE, as the QA-binding ArCP domain, indicating a functional link between fatty acid synthesis and nonribosomal peptide synthesis.

DNA sequencing was performed on a ABI capillary electrophoresis sequencing system (3100 Genetic Analyzer). Amino acid and peptidyl thioester intermediates bound to protein were released either by performic acid treatment or saponification with 0.1 m NaOH and subsequent acidification and solvent extraction with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Labeled compounds on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were detected by radioscanning with a Bertolt Radioscanning System or by autoradiography using Kodak Bio-Max x-ray film. Amino acid or peptidyl intermediates were analyzed by TLC. Reference material on plates was either visualized by spraying with ninhydrin (amino acids) or by UV detection (aroyl peptides). Amino acid hydrolysis was performed with 6 m HCl under reduced pressure for 22 h at 110 °C. Autofluorography or autoradiography of SDS-PAGE gels for visualization of labeled protein bands was as described (20Pfennig F. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol.

Radioactive determinations of filters or of liquid samples were achieved by liquid scintillation counting using a Wallac scintillation system. Echinomycin production in cultures was monitored by short term incorporation tests as described (14Glund K. Schlumbohm W. Bapat M. Keller U. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3522-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Echinomycin or triostin extracted from cultures was identified by TLC along with authentic standards using solvent system I. Amino acids were chromatographed on silica gel plates using solvent system II. Quinoxalinoyl peptides were chromatographed on silica gel plates using solvent system III. Determination of optical configurations was done by TLC on chiral plates using solvent system IV. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI)-TOF Spectrometry—Protein samples were analyzed with a Voyager-DE PRO (Applied Biosystems). The MALDI-TOF MS system was operated in the linear mode. Samples were further purified with ZipTipC18 and dissolved in a 50% solution of acetonitril, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing sinapinic acid (5 mg ml–1) and dried on a sample plate. A nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm and a 3-ns pulse rate was used. The accelerating voltage was set at 25 kV, and a delay of 350 ns was used to accelerate ions into the flight tube of the mass spectrometer. The mass scale (m/z 5000–20000) was calibrated with a mixture of peptides, and 80 laser shots were used to obtain each spectrum. Buffers and Solvent Systems—Solvent systems were: I (EtOAc, MeOH, H2O (100:5:5, by volume)), II (BuOH, AcOH, H2O (4:1:1, by volume)), III (2-propanol, di-n-butylether, AcOH, H2O (4:3:3:2, by volume)), and IV (acetone, MeOH, H2O (10:2:2, by volume)). Buffer for nickel affinity chromatography was NTA (15% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm KPO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and buffer NTA-W (buffer NTA with 50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.0)). Buffer A was 15% glycerol (w/v), 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

Cloning of trsA, trsB, and trsC from S. triostinicus—A probe suitable for screening the gene trsA encoding TrsI in a plasmid gene bank of S. triostinicus DNA in E. coli was obtained by PCR using forward primer FTRIO1 derived from a part of the known amino-terminal sequence of TrsI (5′-ATGCSGACGGCTTCGTCCCSTGGGTCGACCACCT-3′) and reverse primer F2RC derived from the conserved A3 motif of the A-domains ACMSI (20Pfennig F.

Lett. 1989; 50: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (5′-GGAATTCCCTTSGGCTTGCCGGTGGTGCC-3′). The template was chromosomal DNA from S. triostinicus. A 580-bp fragment was cloned in E. coli via SalI and EcoRI restriction sites using SalI/EcoRI-cleaved pTZ18U. Sequencing revealed that the fragment encoded an amino acid sequence that comprised the complete sequenced amino terminus of TrsI and showed high sequence similarity to ACMSI, SnbA, and EntE (31Pfennig, F. (1998) Cloning, Expression, and Characterization of Actinomycin Biosynthesis Genes from Streptomyces. Ph.D thesis, Technische Universität Berlin, BerlinGoogle Scholar). The 580-bp gene fragment was 32P-labeled by using a Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) and used as a probe to localize the complete trsA gene by hybridization analysis of various restriction blots of chromosomal DNA of S. triostinicus. A 6.1-kb BamHI fragment apparently comprising the complete trsA and its flanking regions was cloned by isolating BamHI-digested S. triostinicus total DNA size fractionated on agarose gels to about 6 kb, followed by fractionation and ligation of the mixture to BamHI-cleaved pTZ18U. After introduction by transformation into E. coli DH5α, 8000 colonies were subjected to screening with the labeled probe. Two hybridizing colonies were found to contain the 6.1-kb BamHI band in the plasmid, which was named pTR1. To facilitate sequencing ∼⅓ of the insert of pTR1 was removed by KpnI digestion with subsequent religation to yield pTR1sub5. Sequencing the 4-kb BamHI-KpnI insert contained in pTR1sub5 revealed the trsA gene flanked by the two genes trsB and trsC, to the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively (GenBank™ accession number AY825941). Expression of trsA in S. lividans TK64 —To express TrsI as a carboxyl-terminal His6 fusion protein from the mel promoter of pIJ702, forward primer FTRS1 (5′-AAAGGAACGCCGCATGCTCGACGGTTTCGTCCCCCTG-3′) and reverse primer RTRS1 (5′-CGTAGATCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGAGGCATCCGCGCCGTCACGGCACG-3′) were used for PCR amplification with 200 ng of chromosomal DNA as template. The 1.6-kb fragment was digested with SphI and BglII and ligated to BglII/SphI-cleaved pSP72. From the plasmid obtained (pTRSA1) the fragment was excised with BglII and SphI and ligated to BglII/SphI-cleaved pIJ702 and introduced by transformation into S. coelicolor M145 or S. lividans TK64, to yield pTRSA2. For expression of TrsI from pTRSA2, S. lividans TK64 harboring pTRSA2 was grown for 3 days in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of YEME medium with 50 μg ml–1 thiostrepton equipped with steel springs as baffles. Expression of trsA in E. coli—Expression of trsA in E. coli was as amino- and carboxyl-terminal His6 fusion proteins. The trsA gene was amplified by PCR using pTR1sub5 as template with forward primer FTRS1 (5′-AAAGGAACGCCGCATGCTCGACGGTTTCGTCCCCTG-3′) and reverse primer GS230201 (5′-GGCAAGCTTTCAAGATCTAGGCATCCGCGCCGTCACGGCACGCTC-3′). The resulting 1.56-kb PCR fragment was digested with SphI and HindIII and ligated to SphI/HindIII-cleaved pQE32 to yield pTRSN1. Alternatively, the same PCR fragment was digested with SphI and BglII and ligated into SphI/BglII-cleaved pQE70, producing pTRSC1. pTRSN1 and pTRSC1 were introduced by transformation into E. coli strain M15, respectively. Cultures of M15/pTRSN1 and M15/pTRSC1 (1.6 liters of 2× YT medium, 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin, 25 μgml–1 kanamycin) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). Cultivation was continued for 18 h at 29 °C and cells finally harvested. Isolation of QA-binding Protein from S. echinatus—All operations were carried out at 2–4 °C. Mycelium of S. echinatus (12.5 g wet weight) was suspended in a 3.5-fold volume of buffer C (w/v). After passage through a French press (Aminco) at 10,000 p.s.i., MgCl2 was added at 15 mm (final concentration) and solid DNase (Type I, grade 2, Sigma, 50 μg ml–1 final concentration) were added. After stirring for 1 h on ice the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min in a Sorvall centrifuge at 25,000 × g. The supernatant (83 ml) was applied to a Q-Sepharose (fast flow) column (4 × 5 cm) and, after washing, a 200-ml 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient was applied. 5-ml fractions were collected. QA binding activity eluted between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and diluted to 0.1 m NaCl concentration by adding 3 volumes of buffer D. The solution was then applied onto an anion exchange column (Resource Q, 6 ml) and proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and those with the highest protein concentrations were combined (final volume 3.1 ml). This pool was applied to a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer D, and 2-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1. Active fractions were combined and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q (HR/5R) column, eluting with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer E. Fractions of 0.75 ml were collected (flow rate 0.5 ml min–1, gradient rate 5 mm min–1 NaCl). Activity eluted between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl. Further purification of the QA-binding protein was achieved by chromatography on a high-resolution anion exchange chromatography system (Smart Chromatography System, Amersham Biosciences) using a Mono Q PC 1.6/5 column. For this purpose, the enzyme pool from the Mono Q (HR/5R) step was diluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithioerythritol to 10% glycerol final concentration, to obtain the same salt concentration as in buffer F. After application to the Mono Q PC 1.6/5 column, the enzyme was eluted with a 0–0.35 m NaCl gradient in buffer F and 100-μl fractions were collected. The activity resided in one single fraction at 185 mm NaCl. SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two bands representing sizes of about 10 and 28 kDa. Determination of the Amino-terminal Sequence of the Quinoxaline-2-Carboxylic Acid-binding Protein—The fraction containing the quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid-binding protein (about 200 pmol) was incubated for 30 min at 28 °C with 2 picokatal TrsI and about 0.25 μCi of [14C]QA in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm ATP. After this, the sample was subjected to preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis and subsequently blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Autoradiography of the blot showed that the radioactivity stemming from QA exclusively resided in the 10-kDa band. The band was cut out and subjected to microsequencing. Cloning of the Gene of Quinoxaline-2-Carboxylic Acid-binding Protein from S. echinatus and Expression in E. coli—Based on the aminoterminal sequence of the QA-binding protein (G/A)ATQEEIVAGLAEIVNEIAAPIVEDDQ(Q/L)(L/D), the oligonucleotide QANTERM (5′-GCCACCCAGGAGGAGATCGTCGCCGGC-3′) was synthesized. After 5′ labeling with [32P]phosphate, the labeled oligo was used for Southern hybridizations with various restriction blots of S. echinatus DNA. In each restriction lane, two bands with different intensities were present. In the case of the BglII/PstI double digestion, these bands were of 3.6 and 1.8 kb. BglII/PstI-digested DNA was eluted from the respective size ranges of parallel gels and each DNA mixture was ligated to BamHI/PstI-cleaved pTZ18U (pM2PB). Transformation of E. coli DH5α and colony hybridization yielded clones for each fragment. In the case of the 1.8-kb fragment (with lower hybridization signal), sequence analysis did not reveal a sequence coding for a protein with similarity to an ACP or PCP domain, whereas sequence analysis of the 3.6-kb fragment (stronger hybridizing fragment contained in pM2PB) showed an open reading frame that comprised the previously determined amino-terminal sequence of the QA-binding protein. Furthermore, the sequence dis"
https://openalex.org/W2087095261,"The M3 muscarinic receptor is a prototypical member of the class A family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To gain insight into the structural mechanisms governing agonist-mediated M3 receptor activation, we recently developed a genetically modified yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which allows the efficient screening of large libraries of mutant M3 receptors to identify mutant receptors with altered/novel functional properties. Class A GPCRs contain a highly conserved Asp residue located in transmembrane domain II (TM II; corresponding to Asp-113 in the rat M3 muscarinic receptor) which is of fundamental importance for receptor activation. As observed previously with other GPCRs analyzed in mammalian expression systems, the D113N point mutation abolished agonist-induced receptor/G protein coupling in yeast. We then subjected the D113N mutant M3 receptor to PCR-based random mutagenesis followed by a yeast genetic screen to recover point mutations that can restore G protein coupling to the D113N mutant receptor. A large scale screening effort led to the identification of three such second-site suppressor mutations, R165W, R165M, and Y250D. When expressed in the wild-type receptor background, these three point mutations did not lead to an increase in basal activity and reduced the efficiency of receptor/G protein coupling. Similar results were obtained when the various mutant receptors were expressed and analyzed in transfected mammalian cells (COS-7 cells). Interestingly, like Asp-113, Arg-165 and Tyr-250, which are located at the cytoplasmic ends of TM III and TM V, respectively, are also highly conserved among class A GPCRs. Our data suggest a conformational link between the highly conserved Asp-113, Arg-165, and Tyr-250 residues which is critical for receptor activation.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All GPCRs contain a bundle of seven transmembrane (TM) helices (TM I–VII) that are connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops (4Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 5Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 6Bockaert J. Pin J.P.

Based on sequence similarity, mammalian GPCRs can be grouped into three major receptor subfamilies (A, B, and C). Family A contains by far the largest number of receptors including, for example, the receptors for light (rhodopsin), a very large number of odorant receptors, and the classical biogenic amine neurotransmitter receptors including the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5) (4Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 5Gether U. Endocr.

Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The hallmark of class A GPCRs is a set of about 20 amino acids that is highly conserved only within this GPCR subfamily (5Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The majority of these amino acids are located within the cytoplasmic half of the TM receptor core. Mutagenesis data suggest that these highly conserved residues are required for protein stability and/or for mediating the conformational changes that accompany receptor activation (5Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). At present, bovine rhodopsin, in its inactive state, is the only GPCR for which high resolution structural information is currently available (9Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4966) Google Scholar, 10Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Attempts to obtain a high resolution structure of a GPCR in its active form have not been successful so far. In the absence of this information, different mutagenesis techniques have been employed, often combined with molecular modeling approaches, to gain insight into the functional roles of specific receptor domains/amino acids in GPCR function (5Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 12Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). During the past decade, we have used the M3 muscarinic receptor as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of class A GPCRs activated by small diffusible ligands. The M3 muscarinic receptor preferentially activates G proteins of the Gq/11 family which mediate the activation of phospholipase Cβ (13Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To facilitate structure-function studies of the M3 muscarinic receptor, we recently developed a heterologous expression system that allows the functional expression of the M3 muscarinic receptor in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specifically, we expressed the M3 muscarinic receptor in a genetically modified yeast strain that requires agonist-dependent receptor/G protein coupling for cell growth. This strain, referred to as MPY578q5, harbors a mutant version of the GPA1 gene coding for a hybrid yeast/mammalian G protein α subunit in which the last five amino acids of Gpa1p were replaced with the corresponding mammalian Gαq residues (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the M3 muscarinic receptor can activate this hybrid G protein with high efficiency and selectivity (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One major advantage of the yeast expression system is that powerful genetic screens can be employed to isolate mutant receptors endowed with novel phenotypes from large receptor libraries generated by random mutagenesis (15Schmidt C.

Another advantage is that the results obtained by the use of this strategy (receptor random mutagenesis followed by yeast genetic screens) do not rely on preconceived notions of GPCR function. Using this approach, we recently identified a point mutation (Q490L) in the M3 muscarinic receptor which leads to robust agonist-independent receptor signaling in both yeast and mammalian cells (15Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We then applied a secondary yeast genetic screen to isolate second-site mutations that were able to suppress the activating effects of the Q490L mutation. This screen led to the identification of 12 amino acids predicted to play key roles in M3 receptor activation and/or receptor/G protein coupling (15Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I.

Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous reports, we initially demonstrated in the present study that the D113N mutant M3 receptor was unable to interact productively with G proteins in yeast or mammalian cells (COS-7 cells). To learn more about the functional role of the conserved Asp-113 residue in M3 receptor function, we decided to use yeast expression technology to identify second-site suppressor mutations that are able to restore function to the D113N mutant receptor. Specifically, we subjected the Asp-113 mutant receptor to random mutagenesis and then used a yeast genetic screen to recover second-site suppressor mutations. This screen led to the identification of three point mutations, R165W3.50, R165M3.50, and Y250D5.58, which were able to restore function to the D113N mutant receptor when expressed in yeast. To examine whether these results could be reproduced in a mammalian expression system, we also characterized the recovered mutant M3 receptors in transfected COS-7 cells. Moreover, we carried out additional site-directed mutagenesis studies to examine the allele specificity of the recovered second-site suppressor mutations and the ability of other amino acid substitutions at positions Arg-165 and Tyr-250 to rescue the function of the D113N receptor. Interestingly, the three recovered second-site suppressor mutations involved the mutational modification of two amino acids which, like Asp-113, are highly conserved among class A GPCRs. It is likely that these three amino acids (Asp-1132.50, Arg-1653.50, and Tyr-2505.58) participate in a network of interactions that is critical for converting the inactive state of the M3 receptor into its active conformation. Given the conserved nature of the amino acids targeted in the present study, our results should be of broad general relevance. Materials—Media for mammalian cell culture were from Invitrogen.

N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 81 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. The BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were from New England Biolabs. Construction of Plasmids—For yeast expression studies, all mutations were introduced into a modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor lacking the central portion of the i3 loop (Ala-274 to Lys-469) and containing an N-terminal, nine-amino acid hemagglutinin epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) inserted after the initiating methionine codon (14Erlenbach I.

We demonstrated previously that these modifications have little effect on the ligand binding and G protein coupling properties of the M3 receptor (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F.

For the sake of simplicity, this i3 loop-deleted, epitope-tagged version of the M3 receptor is referred to as ‘WT’ M3 receptor. The coding sequences of the ‘WT’ M3 receptor or ‘WT’ M3 receptor-based mutant constructs were inserted into the polylinker of the yeast expression plasmid, p416GPD, as described previously (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using standard PCR mutagenesis techniques or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Strains, Growth, and Transformation—The haploid yeast strain MPY578q5 (MATa gpa1::Gαq5 far1::LYS2 fus1::FUS1-HIS3 sst2::SST2-G418r ste2::LEU2 fus2::FUS2-CAN1 ura3 lys2 ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 can1) was used as a host for the expression of the ‘WT’ M3 receptor and all ‘WT’ M3 receptor-based mutant constructs (14Erlenbach I.

Moreover, it harbors a mutant version of GPA1 coding for a G protein α subunit in which the last five amino acids of Gpa1p were replaced with the corresponding sequence derived from mammalian αq. Importantly, the genomic incorporation of a FUS1-HIS3 reporter construct makes the production of His3 protein dependent on receptor-mediated activation of the yeast pheromone pathway, allowing auxotrophic (his3) yeast strains expressing coupling-competent receptors to grow in histidine-deficient media (14Erlenbach I.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) unless noted otherwise. The lithium acetate method was used to transform yeast with plasmid DNAs coding for the different receptor constructs (49Agatep R. Kirkpatrick R.D. Parchaliuk D.L. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Technical Tips Online. 1998; 1 (tto.trends.com): P01525Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and maintained in SC medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura). Yeast Liquid Bioassays—Yeast liquid bioassays were performed essentially as described previously (14Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J.

In brief, mid-log phase cell cultures (1–4 × 107 cells/ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and diluted to 105 cells/ml in SC medium lacking uracil and histidine (pH 7). 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (5 mm) was added to the medium to suppress background growth. Cell suspensions were incubated in 96-well microtiter dishes at 25 °C for 72 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of carbachol (10–13 to 10–4m). Receptor-mediated yeast growth was assessed by measuring increases in the optical density of the yeast cultures at 630 nm. Assays were conducted in triplicate, using three in"

Most intriguingly, in addition to Trk receptors, neurotrophins also bind to p75NTR. We have designed a “mini-neurotrophin” called BAG to activate TrkB in the absence of p75NTR binding. We find that BAG is as effective as the natural TrkB ligands (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4) at promoting neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons. Furthermore, the neurite outgrowth responses stimulated by BDNF and BAG are inhibited by a common set of reagents, including the Trk receptor inhibitor K252a, as well as protein kinase A and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors. However, in contrast to BDNF, BAG promotes growth in the presence of a myelin inhibitor or when antibodies directly activate the p75NTR inhibitory pathway. On the basis of this observation, we postulated that the binding of BDNF to the p75NTR might compromise the ability of BDNF to stimulate neurite outgrowth in an inhibitory environment. To test this, we used NGF, and an NGF-derived peptide, to compete for the BDNF/p75NTR interaction; remarkably, in the presence of either agent, BDNF acquired the ability to promote neurite outgrowth in the presence of a myelin inhibitor. The data suggest that in an inhibitory environment, the BDNF/p75NTR interaction compromises regeneration. Agents that activate Trk receptors in the absence of p75NTR binding, or agents that inhibit neurotrophin/p75NTR binding, might therefore be better therapeutic candidates than neurotrophins.

Agents that activate Trk receptors in the absence of p75NTR binding, or agents that inhibit neurotrophin/p75NTR binding, might therefore be better therapeutic candidates than neurotrophins. The central nervous system shows very limited repair after injury, and this has been postulated to be due in part to the presence of inhibitory products associated with damaged myelin that prevent axonal regeneration (1Berry M. Bibl. Anat. 1982; 23: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). In support, biochemical studies on central myelin have identified two protein fractions that contain inhibitory activity (2Caroni P. Schwab M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibodies that bind to these fractions enhance the growth of axons from cultured sensory and sympathetic neurons into otherwise nonpermissive optic nerve explants (3Caroni P. Schwab M.E. Neuron. 1988; 1: 85-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibody delivery and immunotherapy strategies in animals have provided “proof-of-concept” evidence that some degree of functional recovery can be obtained by counteracting the activity of the myelin inhibitors (4Bregman B.S.

Nature. 1990; 343: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). To date, three myelin molecules have been reported to be potent inhibitors of axonal growth, and these are the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) 1The abbreviations used are: MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; TrkA, -B, and -C, receptor tyrosine kinase A, B, and C; p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin receptor; NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NT-3, neurotrophin 3; NT-4, neurotrophin 4; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; 3T3 cells, embryonic Swiss mouse fibroblast cells; PKA, protein kinase A; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GT1b, trisialoganglioside 1b; GAP-43, growth-associated protein 43.

Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has emerged as the signaling component of a multimeric inhibitory receptor complex that can bind all three myelin inhibitors (12Domeniconi M.

Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Activation of the complex stimulates RhoA, and inhibitors of RhoA, and/or its downstream effector Rho kinase, facilitate growth on myelin substrates (16Dergham P. Ellezam B. Essagian C. Avedissian H. Lubell W.D. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fournier A.E. Takizawa B.T. Strittmatter S.M. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 normally promote axonal growth from cultured neurons by activating their specific Trk receptors (19Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of myelin inhibitors, these neurotrophins are prevented from stimulating neurite outgrowth (20Cai D. Shen Y. De Bellard M. Tang S. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Also, although beneficial effects of exogenous neurotrophins on the damaged central nervous system have been reported (21Horner P.J. Gage F.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), these tend to be associated with cell survival and limited sprouting. The failure of neurotrophins to promote robust long range axonal regeneration in the damaged nervous system might also be related to the effects of myelin and possibly other inhibitors. Most interestingly, p75NTR not only mediates the effects of the myelin inhibitors, it also serves as a low affinity receptor for the above neurotrophins (19Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Recent crystal studies suggest that a neurotrophin dimer can simultaneously engage a Trk receptor and a p75NTR monomer (22He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and this raises the possibility that neurotrophins might in some instances recruit Trk receptors to inhibitory signaling complexes and thereby undermine their own ability to overcome myelin inhibition. If this hypothesis is correct, then agents that activate Trk receptors in the absence of p75NTR binding might be expected to promote neurite outgrowth in an inhibitory environment. To test this, we have used a peptide mimetic approach to design a minimalistic version of NT-4 that should be able to activate TrkB but should not be able to form a bridge between TrkB and p75NTR monomers. We show that in a permissive environment this agent fully mimics the neurite outgrowth promoting activity that natural TrkB agonists BDNF and NT-4 have on cerebellar granule cells. However, unlike the natural TrkB ligands, this agent can also promote neurite outgrowth when the myelin inhibitory pathway is activated in neurons. A second independent test of the hypothesis is that agents that interfere with the neurotrophin/p75NTR interaction should allow neurotrophins to promote neurite outgrowth in an inhibitory environment. NGF and BDNF are very effective at competing for binding to the p75NTR, but they do not compete effectively for each other's binding their respective Trk receptor (23Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the fact that cerebellar neurons do not express TrkA receptors (24Courtney M.J. Akerman K.E. Coffey E.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4201-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have used NGF to compete for BDNF binding to the p75NTR in these cells. We find that in the presence of NGF, BDNF acquires the ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth in an inhibitory environment. The same response was found when a monomeric peptide mimetic of a small loop that NGF uses to bind to the p75NTR was used instead of NGF. These experiments not only provide a plausible explanation as to why endogenous neurotrophins might not be effective at promoting regeneration in the damaged nervous system, they also point to at least two novel strategies for promoting brain repair. For example, agents that activate Trk receptors in the absence of p75NTR binding might be more effective than neurotrophins at promoting repair. Also, antagonists of the neurotrophin/p75NTR interaction might allow endogenous neurotrophins, which have long been known to be synthesized in response to injury (25Nieto-Sampedro M. Lewis E.R. Cotman C.W. Manthorpe M. Skaper S.D. Barbin G. Longo F.M. Varon S. Science. 1982; 217: 860-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 26Sebert M.E. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), to acquire the ability to promote regeneration. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Cerebellar neurons isolated from postnatal day 2/3 rat pups were cultured over monolayers of parental 3T3 cells or N-cadherin-expressing 3T3 cells (the LK8 cell line) (27Doherty P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), essentially as described previously (28Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Monolayers were established by seeding ∼80,000 cells into individual chambers of an eight-chamber tissue culture slide coated with poly-l-lysine and fibronectin. The cell lines, and monolayers, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Co-cultures were established by removing the media from the monolayers and seeding ∼6000 dissociated cerebellar neurons into each well in SATO medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. When looking for trophic factor or peptide stimulation of neurite outgrowth, the monolayers were set up 4 h before the addition of the neurons, and the co-cultures were maintained for ∼16 h before fixation. The same procedure was followed when looking at the MAG-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth over N-cadherin-expressing 3T3 cells. However, when looking at MAG inhibition of growth over parental 3T3 cells, the monolayers were established for 24 h prior to addition of the neurons, and the cultures were maintained for ∼23 h. This increases the basal neurite outgrowth and gives a better window for looking at inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG. Following careful fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the neurons were immuno-stained with a GAP-43 antibody, and the mean length of the longest neurite per cell was measured for ∼120-150 neurons, again as described previously (28Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Structures—For the purposes of molecular modeling, we primarily made use of the NT-4-TrkB complex (29Banfield M.J. Naylor R.L. Robertson A.G. Allen S.J. Dawbarn D. Brady R.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that can be found in the Protein Data Bank, code 1HCF. Swiss Protein Data Bank software packages were used to isolate the structure of various motifs from the binding interfaces of the crystals, and Accelrys software was used to generate images. Reagents—Recombinant human FGF2, NGF, BDNF, and NT-4 were obtained from R&D Systems. K252a was obtained from Calbiochem and used at a final concentration of 100 nm. Recombinant MAG-Fc chimera was obtained from R&D Systems and used at a final concentration of 5-25 μg/ml. The monoclonal antibody to GT1b (clone GMR5) was obtained from Seikagaku America and was used at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. A p75NTR rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of the receptor (30Huber L.J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Moses Chao and was used at a 1:200 dilution of the serum. The PKA inhibitors KT5720 and H-89 were obtained from Calbiochem and used at final concentration of 200 and 400 nm, respectively. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem, and both were used at final concentrations of 10 μm. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 was obtained from Tocris Bristol UK and used at 10 μm. All reagents were diluted into the co-culture media and in general added to the cultures just prior to the plating of the neurons. The exception was the antiserum raised against the p75NTR; a high density neuronal suspension was treated with a 1:200 dilution of the serum for 60 min, and the neurons were then diluted by a factor of ∼20 and seeded out for culture. The residual amount of p75NTR antibody in the cultures was approximately a 1:5000 dilution of the serum. Control experiments showed this antibody had no effect on neurite outgrowth at a dilution of 1:1000. Peptide Synthesis and Purity—Synthetic peptides were all obtained from a commercial supplier (Multiple Peptide Systems). All peptides were purified to the highest grade by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and obtained at the highest level of purity (>97%). With all peptides, there was no indication of higher molecular weight species. Where peptide sequences are underlined (see under “Results”), this denotes a peptide that has been cyclized via a disulfide bond between the given cysteine residues. All peptides were acetylated and amide blocked. Design of a TrkB Antagonist Peptide—In order to design a small agent that might activate TrkB in the absence of p75NTR binding, we used a peptide mimetic strategy that calls first for the design of an antagonist peptide, with a view to using an established strategy for turning this into an agonist (31Williams G. Williams E.J. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Peptides that bind to functional sites on TrkB can be identified from the NT-4/TrkB crystal structure (29Banfield M.J. Naylor R.L. Robertson A.G. Allen S.J. Dawbarn D. Brady R.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We noted that the SRRGE motif at the amino terminus of NT-4 makes the dominant contact at the a1/b1 interface of the NT-4/TrkB crystal (Fig. 1A). A constrained cyclic peptide mimetic of this motif (N-Ac-CSRRGEC-NH2), that we call BANT, shares structural overlap with the natural SRRGE motif (not shown) and would therefore be expected to bind to TrkB. If it does, it should function as a TrkB antagonist. To test this, we cultured postnatal day 2/3 rat cerebellar neurons over monolayers of 3T3 fibroblasts for 16-17 h. Under these conditions the TrkB agonists NT-4 and BDNF stimulate a robust neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1, B and C). This is in accord with results obtained in survival assays and should be viewed alongside evidence that the neurons do not express functional levels of TrkA or TrkC receptors (32Nonomura T. Kubo T. Oka T. Shimoke K. Yamada M. Enokido Y. Hatanaka H. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 97: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The BANT peptide inhibits the NT-4 response in a dose-dependent manner, with a full inhibition seen at ∼125 μm (Fig. 1B). The SRRGE motif is well conserved in NGF (FHRGE) and NT-3 (SHRGE), and constrained peptide mimetics of these motifs (N-Ac-CFHRGEC-NH2 and N-Ac-CSHRGEC-NH2) also inhibit the NT-4 response; however, they are considerably less potent (Fig. 1B). As expected, BANT was also a very effective BDNF antagonist, with the NGF and NT-3 peptides again being substantially less active (Fig. 1C). Concentrations of the BANT peptide that fully inhibit NT-4 and BDNF responses have no effect on basal neurite outgrowth or neurite outgrowth stimulated by FGF2 or N-cadherin (Fig. 1D). Also, a linear unconstrained version of the NT-4 motif (N-Ac-SRRGELA-NH2), which would not be expected to share robust structural overlap with the natural motif, does not inhibit the BDNF and NT-4 responses (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that the NT-4 derived BANT peptide is an effective TrkB antagonist in this model. Development of a TrkB Agonist Peptide—The SRRGE motif in NT-4 runs anti-parallel to itself in the NT-4 dimer, and this suggests that the “tandem repeat” mimetic approach that we have used to develop N-cadherin agonist peptides (31Williams G. Williams E.J. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) might also be used for the development of a TrkB agonist peptide. We anticipated that a tandem repeat of the motif might be constrained within the cyclic N-Ac-CSRRGELAASRRGELC-NH2 peptide (called the BAG peptide) in a manner that might allow the peptide to engage with, and perhaps stabilize, a TrkB receptor dimer in an active conformation (Fig. 2A). In cultures of cerebellar neurons growing at low density over a 3T3 monolayer for 16-17 h, BAG stimulates neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal response seen at 10 μg/ml (∼6 μm) (Fig. 2B). BAG is as effective as maximally active concentrations of NT-4, BDNF, and FGF2 in promoting neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons (Fig. 2C). Like the response to BDNF (Fig. 1B), the response to BAG was fully inhibited by the BANT peptide (Fig. 3). Likewise, the response to BAG and BDNF is fully inhibited by K252a, a drug that inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Trk receptor (33Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKA and PI3K activity couple the activated TrkB receptor to neurite outgrowth (34Gao Y. Nikulina E. Mellado W. Filbin M.T. J.

All of the above inhibitors have little or no effect on the neurite outgrowth over 3T3 cells or neurite outgrowth stimulated by FGF2 and other agents (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3). These data support the view that BDNF and BAG stimulate neurite outgrowth by activating a common TrkB-dependent signaling cascade in the cerebellar neurons.Fig. 3Neurite outgrowth stimulated by BAG and BDNF is inhibited by common kinase inhibitors. Cerebellar neurons were cultured over monolayers of 3T3 cells in media supplemented with the BAG peptide at 10 μg/ml (blank bars), BDNF at 5 ng/ml (striped bars), or FGF2 at 5 ng/ml (black bars) as indicated. These experiments were done in control media, media supplemented with the N-Ac-CSRRGEC-NH2 peptide (125 μm), K252a (100 nm), or media that contained a PKA inhibitor (KT5720 at 200 nm or H-89 at 400 nm) or a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin or LY294002 at 10 μm) as indicated. The cultures were maintained for 16 h before being fixed and stained for GAP-43. The mean length of the longest neurite was then determined from 100 to 120 neurons under each culture condition. The results show the percentage increase in neurite outgrowth induced by BAG, BDNF, and FGF2 relative to control in the presence of the various kinase inhibitors. The results for the N-Ac-CSRRGEC-NH2 peptide on the BDNF and FGF2 responses are shown in Fig. 1D, and so are not reproduced here. The kinase inhibitors did not affect basal growth (data not shown). The individual PKA inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors had the same effect on the responses, and the data were therefore pooled. The results are pooled from at least three independent experiments, and the bars show the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BAG, but Not BDNF, Promotes Neurite Outgrowth in an Inhibitory Environment—MAG was the first inhibitory component of myelin to be identified (see Introduction), and it can inhibit neurite outgrowth when presented to neurons as a soluble Fc chimera (36Tang S.

To look at MAG inhibition, we cultured cerebellar neurons over monolayers of N-cadherin-expressing fibroblasts, as this gives an enhanced basal outgrowth response over an ∼16-h culture period when compared with parental 3T3 cells (Fig. 1D) (28Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, BAG and BDNF do not promote additional growth, suggesting that the rate of growth is optimal (Fig. 4). The MAG-Fc inhibited neurite outgrowth at 5 μg/ml, with a more robust inhibition seen at 25 μg/ml (Fig. 4). As reported previously (see Introduction), MAG does not inhibit growth when the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (10 μm) is present (Fig. 4). Also in agreement with Cai et al. (20Cai D. Shen Y. De Bellard M. Tang S. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) we found that BDNF was unable to promote neurite outgrowth in the presence of the MAG-Fc (Fig. 4). However, the BAG peptide was able to stimulate neurite outgrowth in this inhibitory environment to the extent that it completely circumvented the inhibitory activity of MAG (Fig. 4). In order to ascertain the robustness of these observations, we repeated the experiments with neurons cultured for a longer period of time (∼23 h) over established monolayers of 3T3 fibroblasts. Again, the MAG-Fc inhibits neurite outgrowth in control media and media containing BDNF; however, this inhibition was not seen when the BAG peptide was present (Fig. 5).Fig. 5MAG inhibition of neurite outgrowth over 3T3 monolayers can be overcome by BAG but not BDNF. Cerebellar neurons were cultured over monolayers of 3T3 cells in control media (open bars) or media supplemented with the MAG-Fc at 25 μg/ml (hatched bars). These experiments were done with no other agents added to the media (control), or in the presence of the BAG peptide at 10 μg/ml or BDNF at 5 ng/ml. The cultures were maintained for 23 h before being fixed and stained for GAP-43. The mean length of the longest neurite was then determined from 100 to 120 neurons under each culture condition. The results are pooled from three independent experiments, and the bars show the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To date, all of the inhibitory molecules in myelin have been reported to signal via p75NTR. It follows that direct activation of this complex in neurons should also inhibit neurite outgrowth. In this context, direct clustering of p75NTR with an antibody might be expected to inhibit neurite outgrowth. Indeed, we observed that pretreatment of cerebellar neurons with a p75NTR polyclonal antibody for 60 min was sufficient to inhibit the subsequent growth of the neurons over the N-cadherin monolayers (Fig. 6). The response to the p75NTR antibody was not seen when Rho kinase was inhibited after the pretreatment period, confirming that the antibody triggers the same downstream signaling cascade as the natural activators of the receptor (Fig. 6). BDNF did not have any effect on neurite outgrowth when added after treatment of the neurons with the p75NTR antibody. In contrast, under the same conditions, the BAG peptide was able to completely circumvent the inhibitory activity of the p75NTR antibody treatment (Fig. 6). These data show that the BAG peptide, but not BDNF, can stimulate neurite outgrowth when administered after the direct activation of the p75NTR pathway by a p75NTR antibody. NGF and an NGF Loop 1 Peptide Allow BDNF to Circumvent MAG Inhibition—We wanted to test if agents that interfere with the BDNF/p75NTR interaction can influence neurite outgrowth in an inhibitory environment. BDNF and NGF can effectively compete with each other for binding to the p75NTR, but they are not effective at competing for binding at their respective Trk receptors (23Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). When neurons are grown over established 3T3 monolayers for ∼23 h in media containing 25 μg/ml of the MAG-Fc, neither NGF nor BDNF inhibited the MAG response (Fig. 7); we can therefore conclude that the neurotrophin-binding site on p75NTR is not required for the formation and/or function of the p75NTR inhibitory signaling complex that is activated by the MAG-Fc. Based on this observation, and the fact that p75NTR is the only NGF receptor expressed by cerebellar neurons, we conclude that NGF is a reasonable agent to use to compete out BDNF binding to p75NTR in the cerebellar neurons. Effective competition between NGF and BDNF at the p75NTR receptor requires an ∼100-fold excess of one neurotrophin to the other (23Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and we therefore used BDNF at 1 ng/ml and NGF at 100 ng/ml. In contrast to the results seen when these agents are added in the presence of the MAG-Fc on their own, a significant neurite outgrowth response is seen when BDNF (1 ng/ml) and NGF (100 ng/ml) are added together (Fig. 7). Increasing the BDNF concentration to 5 and then 10 ng/ml diminished the molar excess of NGF to BDNF and resulted in a considerably smaller neurite outgrowth response, demonstrating the competitive nature of the interaction between the two factors (Fig. 7). NGF contains four main exposed loops (47McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) with a considerable body of evidence showing that the TDIKGKE motif that constitutes the first β-hairpin loop plays a crucial role in binding to p75NTR (22He X.L.

Constrained peptide mimetics of this motif interact with p75NTR and would be expected to compete for neurotrophin binding to the receptor (38Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y.M. Varon S. J. Neurosci.

However, the expression profile of the Cyp1a1 gene in the developing embryo is not well under-stood. Using established transgenic mouse lines where 8.5 kb of the rat CYP1A1 promoter is cloned upstream of the lacZ reporter gene (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J.

In contrast to the absence of constitutive Cyp1a1 and lacZ transgene expression in tissues of the adult mouse, a constitutive cell-specific and time-dependent pattern of CYP1A1 promoter activity was observed in the embryo. This expression pattern was confirmed as reflecting the endogenous gene by measuring Cyp1a1 mRNA levels and protein expression by immunohistochemistry. The number of cells displaying endogenous CYP1A1 activity could be increased in the embryo upon xenobiotic challenge, but only within areas where the CYP1A1 promotor was already active. When reporter mice were bred onto a genetic background expressing a lower affinity form of the Ah receptor (DBA allele), transgene and murine Cyp1a1 protein expression were both attenuated in the adult mouse liver upon xenobiotic challenge. By comparison, constitutive CYP1A1 promoter activity in the embryo was identical in the presence of either the high or low affinity Ah receptor. These novel data suggest that the Cyp1a1 protein may play a role in murine development and that regulation of the Cyp1a1 gene during this period is either through the action of a high affinity Ah receptor ligand or by an alternative regulatory pathway.

Certain members of this multigene family also play a central role in the biosynthesis and/or degradation of steroid hormones, fatty acids, and cholesterol (2Danielson P.B. Curr.

Many of the enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism are highly inducible, and exposure to a chemical often results in the induction of single or multiple cytochrome P450s that increase the rate of metabolism and disposition of the agent involved (4Conney A.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The paradigm for this is cytochrome P450 CYP1A1, which in adults is not constitutively expressed but is highly inducible in many different tissues by a wide range of environmental chemicals such as the cigarette smoke components known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254, and dioxins such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (5Whitlock Jr., J.P.

It has been suggested that CYP1A1 mRNAs have a short half-life that contributes to the difficulty in reliable detection (11Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Matlib R.S. Childs N.L. Shertzer H.G. Genter M.B.

Targeted deletion of the Cyp1a1 gene in mice resulted in no obvious phenotype, which implies that the protein has no essential developmental role; however, it was postulated that the structurally and functionally homologous catalytic Cyp1a2 might fulfill the functions of Cyp1a1 (11Dalton T.P.

The double knock-out has not been reported. It is generally agreed however, that CYP1A1 transcription is elevated in the developing liver upon exposure to a wide range of xenobiotics (12Wu Q.

Biochem. 1993; 25: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The mechanism of Cyp1a1 gene regulation involves the binding of the foreign compound to a cytoplasmic receptor, the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, which then dissociates from the heat shock protein-90, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it dimerizes with the transcription factor Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), to activate the promoters of responsive genes (for review, see Ref. 16Ma Q. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ARNT (also known as hypoxia inducible factor-1β) can also heterodimerize with hypoxia inducible factor-1α, the transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to hypoxia (17Bracken C.P. Whitelaw M.L. Peet D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1376-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and to a number of other basic helix-loop-helix proteins (18Cowden K.D. Simon M.C.

Rubenstein J.L. Nicolas J.F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).To study the function of the CYP1A1 gene in more detail using a method independent of mRNA stability, we have previously exploited a transgenic mouse line where 8.5 kb of the rat CYP1A1 promoter is used to drive the expression of the reporter gene, lacZ. Using this model in previous studies, we have demonstrated that the transgene, in a number of different mouse lines, is expressed in a manner indistinguishable from that of the endogenous Cyp1a1 protein in the uninduced state and upon challenge with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in adult transgenic mice (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar). In this current study we use these models to investigate the constitutive and xenobiotic-inducible expression of the Cyp1a1 gene in the developing mouse embryo. In contrast to the adult mouse, we show that the CYP1A1 promoter is constitutively active in a cell-specific manner at certain stages of development. Furthermore the CYP1A1 promoter is apparently only inducible by xenobiotics in those cells and at those times at which constitutive expression is also found.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—TCDD was a kind gift from Dr. A. G. Smith, University of Leicester, United Kingdom. 3-Methylcholanthrene was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, and Aroclor 1254 was a kind gift from Dr. H. R. Glatt of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIFE), Potsdam, Germany. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.Production of Transgenic Embryos—(C57BL/6 × CBA) male mice carrying the transgene pAHIR1β-galactosidase from the transgenic line D/34 described previously (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar) were mated with non-transgenic females. Mice were examined each morning for the presence of plugs. The positive identification of a plug was regarded as the first day of gestation (E1). Embryos were collected at 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 days post-conception (E7–E14).Induction of Transgene Expression in Developing Embryos—Aroclor 1254 (500 mg/kg), in a suspension of Mazola brand corn oil or an equivalent volume of corn oil vehicle was administered by intraperitoneal injection 7 days prior to the harvesting of the embryos. The inducing agent Aroclor 1254 has been shown previously to cross the transplacental barrier and induce the expression of CYP1A1 (20Borlakoglu J.T. Scott A. Henderson C.J. Jenke H.J. Wolf C.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Embryos were collected at 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 days post-conception (E7–E14) in the D/34 transgenic mouse line. In a second transgenic line, D/4, three time points were selected (E7, E9, and E12) for study.Analysis of lacZ Activity—After the selected gestational time point, mothers were culled by cervical dislocation, and embryos were collected, dissected from embryonic sacs for E9 and later stages, and then stained as whole mounts for lacZ activity essentially as described previously (21Sanes J.R. Rubenstein J.L. Nicolas J.F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Animals were analyzed in transverse 10-μm paraffin wax sections from rump to crown. Older embryos (E13–E14) were re-analyzed by serial 10-μm frozen cryosections as described previously for adult tissue analysis (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar) to control for reagent penetration. A minimum of six embryos at each gestational stage from at least two separate births were analyzed. Non-transgenic litter mates were co-analyzed at all ages to ensure that the lacZ expression observed was pAH1R1β-galactosidase-driven.Breeding of Transgenic Mice to Express the Low Affinity Ah(-/-) Receptor—(C57BL/6 × CBA) transgenic mice expressing the high affinity Ahb form of the Ah receptor were bred with DBA/2 mice naturally expressing the variant low affinity Ahd form of the Ah receptor (Harlan, Bicester, UK) for four generations. For the purposes of this study, Ahb and Ahd mouse strains are detailed as responsive Ah(+/+) and non-responsive Ah(-/-), respectively. Offspring of pAH1R1β-galactosidase transgenic mice were selected over non-transgenic mice after each round of breeding using Southern analysis as described previously (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar). At each breeding stage, the transgenic offspring were crossed with DBA/2 mice. After three generations, transgenic mice were screened by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays (see below) for the expression of the variant Ah(-/-) receptor. Transgenic mice positive for the Ah(-/-) receptor were bred with non-transgenic DBA/2 mice to produce a breeding colony of mice homozygous for Ah(-/-) containing the pAH1R1β-galactosidase transgene.Identification of Ah Receptor Alleles—Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tail biopsies following the procedure as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used as a PCR template. A region of exon 10 of the Ah receptor from either (C57BL/6 × CBA) or DBA/2 wild-type mice was amplified using the primers 5′-GCTCCCAGTCAACCCCAAG-3′ (1304–322 bp) and 5′-CCAATTTGCTCATGTTTCA-3′ (1499–1517 bp) to yield a product of 213 bp. PCR amplification consisted of 94 °C for 4 min (one cycle), 59 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 94 °C for 30 s (34 cycles), followed by 59 °C for 5 min and 72 °C for 5 min (1 cycle). PCR products were then used in SSCP reactions. Briefly, PCR product was diluted in SSCP loading dye (95% (w/v) formamide, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF, and 20 mm EDTA, pH 8) and heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then analyzed on a 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The products of SSCP analysis were visualized by silver staining of the gel as described previously (23Orita M.

Genomics. 1989; 5: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (3319) Google Scholar). Control banding patterns observed in DNA from wild-type (C57BL/6 × CBA) and DBA/2 mice were compared with banding patterns observed in test animals. Initially PCR products were directly sequenced to confirm the specificity of this assay.Induction of Transgene Activity in Transgenic Ah(+/+) and Ah(-/-) Mice—Transgenic Ah(+/+) and Ah(-/-) adult mice were challenged intraperitoneally with vehicle, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC, 75 mg/kg), or TCDD (75 μg/kg) dissolved in Mazola corn oil. Doses were based on previous experiments (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shen E.S. Guengerich F.P. Olson J.R.

Animals were culled by cervical dislocation 3 days post-induction, and the liver was snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen.Extraction of mRNA and RT-PCR—E13 embryos were collected from time-mating of wild-type embryos. Embryos were decapitated, and heads and liver samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for Taq-Man RT-PCR. mRNA extraction was performed using RNA extraction columns (Qiagen Ltd.). RNA was treated with DNase I according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Ltd.). TaqMan PCR was carried out essentially as described previously (26Campbell S.J. Hughes P.M. Iredale J.P.

Cyp1a1 levels in unknown samples were calibrated against standard curves generated using cDNA isolated from the liver of a 3-MC-treated mouse. mRNA is expressed in arbitrary units corrected to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels in unknown samples were assayed using rodent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer and probes sets (Applied Biosystems) and calibrated against a six point standard curve according to manufacturer's instructions.Analysis of Cyp1a1 Expression by Western Blotting—Liver samples were homogenized (Ultra-Turrax T8, IKA Labortechnik) in four volumes of buffer containing protease inhibitors (1% Igepal, 25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.4 m KC1, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and then incubated on ice for 15 min prior to centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and aliquots were taken for protein determination and further analysis. Protein concentrations were estimated using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to manufacturers' instructions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed using standard methods (27Harlow E.E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Briefly, total protein extracts (50 μg) were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.), and an anti-Cyp1a1 antibody (28Smith G. Henderson C.J. Parker M.G. White R. Bars R.G. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used to assay Cyp1a1 protein expression.Analysis of Cyp1a1 Protein Expression by Immunohistochemistry— E12 embryos were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight prior to processing and embedding in paraffin wax using standard procedures. 10-μm paraffin wax sections were cut using a microtome on to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Antigens were heat-retrieved by a 10-min treatment in boiling citrate buffer, pH 6, in a standard 800-watt microwave. Slides required additional treatment with an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, to reduce nonspecific immunoreactivity due to endogenous biotin. The Cyp1a1 protein was identified using the same rabbit polyclonal anti-rat Cyp1a1 antibody (28Smith G. Henderson C.J. Parker M.G. White R. Bars R.G. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) used in our Western blotting analysis. The Cyp1a1 antibody was then detected using biotinylated secondary reagents with standard ABC amplification according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Immunoreactivity was revealed with diaminobenzamidine diluted in 10 mm imidazole for increased sensitivity to produce a brown, insoluble precipitate at immunopositive sites. Sections were counterstained in hematoxylin and mounted on coverglasses.RESULTSWe have described previously the production of transgenic mouse lines expressing the lacZ reporter gene under the control of the rat CYP1A1 promoter to obtain information on the cell-specific regulation of CYP1A1 gene expression in adult mice (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar). In this present study, we examine the expression of the reporter gene in two lines of transgenic mice after an analysis of serial sections through embryos at successive stages in development from E7–E14 (Theiler stages 10–22). Each of the transgenic lines carry four transgene copies in tandem repeats at a single chromosomal location (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar).The CYP1A1 Reporter Is Constitutively Active during Early Development—In adult mice, the CYP1A1 gene is not expressed but is highly inducible by exposure to exogenous foreign compound inducers. However, as early as day 7 of development (E7), high levels of constitutive CYP1A1 promoter activity were observed in the embryo and extra-embryonic ectoderm at a very low level. Although a few more strongly labeled cells were located in the embryonic endoderm, the majority of the labeling was weak, especially in the embryonic mesoderm. Marked changes in lacZ staining occurred during rapid organogenesis between stages E8 and E9. During this period, a marked restriction in the expression pattern of the reporter was observed that became more apparent with advancing development. In contrast to observations in adult mice, surprisingly high constitutive levels of expression were observed in selected tissues in restricted windows throughout development (Fig. 1, A and C). This observation has been summarized by the color intensity within a schematic (Fig. 1A), which is complemented by histological examples of the cellular expression of the lacZ transgene in embryos throughout the advancing age range (Fig. 1C, sections i–iv). The intensity of the blue coloration (Fig. 1) provided is a representation of the color intensity of the lacZ expression within that tissue.At the early stages of organogenesis (E8.5), a high level of lacZ activity was measured in the heart in all myocardial cells within the walls of the common ventricular chamber (Fig. 1C, section i). Interestingly, the myocardial cells in the left side of the chamber were more intensely labeled relative to other cells within the primitive heart (Fig. 1C, section i). Significant lacZ expression was also observed in the walls of the common atria and the sinus venosus (Fig. 1C, section i). CYP1A1 promotor activity was also found in the prospective hindbrain extending into the prospective midbrain, which, by comparison, had only single, weakly labeled, neuroepithelial cells (Fig. 1C, section i). A few individual cells were also labeled throughout the neural tube in the anterior hindbrain, although this was much weaker than that seen in the primitive heart and brain.By E10, intense lacZ activity was observed in the thin roof of the anterior region of the hindbrain within all neuroepithelial cells, whereas in the lateral walls of the hindbrain a more heterogeneous staining pattern was observed (Fig. 1C, section ii). Promoter activity was observed in great numbers of neuroepithelial cells, possibly because of the increased cellular mass, and was of a similar intensity to that seen during earlier periods of development (Fig. 1C, sections i and ii). By E12, the number of lacZ-expressing cells had decreased, although intense staining was observed in the thin roof of the anterior part of the hindbrain that extended to the dorsal parts of the lateral walls, where the expression decreased ventrally. Labeling in the hindbrain continued to the E13 stage in a similar pattern but was now limited to fewer positive cells. In addition, weak labeling was observed in a number of cells in the choroid plexus, and this labeling was still apparent in reduced cell numbers at E14. There was generally no CYP1A1 promoter activity in the midbrain during early development, with the exception of single cells in the midline of the midbrain roof. By E13, however, the midbrain was intensely labeled at both the ventricular and intermediate layers (Fig. 1C, section iv), where stripes of intense transgene expression were observed; very strong labeling was observed in a column of cells adjacent to a column of histologically identical cells that were completely unlabeled (Fig. 1C, section iv, arrow). At the E14 stage, intense labeling was observed in the ventricular and intermediate layers of the hindbrain, but the overall number of expressing cells, as elsewhere, was dramatically reduced. Weak labeling was also observed in the trigeminal ganglion in E12–E14 embryos.By E10, at the time of early organogenesis, the primitive left ventricle was heavily stained and labeling was now observed in the primitive right ventricle, although labeling in the left and right components of the differentiating common atrial chamber was very weak. By E12, activity was observed in the myocardial cells of the left ventricle and, to a lesser extent, in the right ventricle and the atria. In comparison with early stages of development, the number of cells involved was reduced. By E13 and E14 the same pattern was observed, although the left ventricle was more strongly labeled than the rest of the heart. At the E14 stage, an increase in activity was observed in the right and left atria, where previously no activity had been observed. Weak staining was measured in the dorsal aorta from E10–E14, whereas vessels such as the capillaries and lateral mesenchyme and other parts of the venous system showed no activity.The first expression in the developing kidney was in the epithelium and the associated mesenchyme of a single nephric duct within the mesonephros of E10 embryos, (Fig. 1C, section v). By E12, the number of positive cells had increased and, at E13, all nephric ducts were now positive, although the intensity of the staining was noticeably reduced. By E14, labeling continued to be observed in the degenerating mesonephros but was no longer present in the epithelium or associated mesenchyme in the more advanced metanephros.Labeling was first observed in the liver of E12.5 embryos, where a minority of individual cells were weakly labeled. By E13, the number of labeled cells had increased, and positive cells appeared in small clusters throughout the organ. The expression of the transgene was restricted to a short time frame, as no positive cells were observed in the liver of E14 embryos (data not shown).Cells Exhibiting Constitutive CYP1A1 Promoter Activity Respond to Exogenous Inducing Agents—To determine whether exogenous agents that cross the transplacental barrier could induce the CYP1A1 promoter during murine development, we analyzed transgene expression in mouse embryos exposed for 7 days in utero to Aroclor 1254 (Fig. 1, B and D, sections i and ii). At E7, no induction of transgene expression was observed in the embryonic ectoderm and endoderm. However, as development proceeded, a marked induction of CYP1A1 promoter activity was observed within the major areas and during the developmental periods when constitutive CYP1A1 expression was observed (Fig. 1B, rows marked Hindbrain, Heart, Kidney, and Muscle). The administration of Aroclor 1254 did not extend the time windows when the CYP1A1 promoter was constitutively active in the developing embryo (Fig. 1B). Three embryonic stages (E7, E9, and E12) were studied in a second transgenic line (D4) and examined for lacZ expression, and an identical pattern to that described for the primary D/34 transgenic line was observed (data not shown).CYP1A1 Promoter Activity Is a Legitimate Reporter of Cyp1a1 mRNA and Protein Expression—Although the temporal and spatial pattern of promoter activity in the pAHIR1β-galactosidase transgenic mice was conserved in different transgenic lines in the adult mouse (1Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark A.J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar) and now in the developing embryo, we investigated whether lacZ staining indeed reflected genuine Cyp1a1 expression. We used immunohistochemistry specific for mouse Cyp1a1 in E12 wild-type embryos to localize the protein in coronal embryonic sections. Similarly as in lacZ expression, we observed Cyp1a1 protein in the neuroepithelial cells of the hindbrain roof (Fig. 1C, section iii). The immunostaining and lacZ labeling were complimented by Cyp1a1-specific TaqMan RT-PCR. E13 embryos were selected for mRNA analysis because we observed high levels of CYP1A1 reporter activity in multiple brain regions, and microdissected embryos of this age would produce sufficient mRNA for analysis. Taq-Man RT-PCR was used to assay the Cyp1a1 mRNA expression in regions where high (h"

Previously, we reported a cell-free reaction that reconstitutes transport from the yeast TGN to the late endosome/prevacuolar compartment (PVC) and requires the PVC t-SNARE Pep12p. Here, we report that factors required both for formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN (the Chc1p clathrin heavy chain and the Vps1p dynamin homolog) and for vesicle fusion at the PVC (the Vps21p rab protein and Vps45p SM (Sec1/Munc18) protein) are required for cell-free transport. The marker for TGN-PVC transport, Kex2p, is initially present in a clathrin-containing membrane compartment that is competent for delivery of Kex2p to the PVC. A Kex2p chimera containing the cytosolic tail (C-tail) of the vacuolar protein sorting receptor, Vps10p, is also efficiently transported to the PVC. Antibodies against the Kex2p and Vps10p C-tails selectively block transport of Kex2p and the Kex2-Vps10p chimera. The requirements for factors involved in vesicle formation and fusion, the identification of the donor compartment as a clathrin-containing membrane, and the need for accessibility of C-tail sequences argue that the TGN-PVC transport reaction involves selective incorporation of TGN cargo molecules into clathrin-coated vesicle intermediates.

Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1067-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A study of the transport events between the TGN and these various compartments is fundamental to understanding molecular sorting in the distal arm of the biosynthetic pathway. TGN-to-late endosome transport serves at least two known trafficking functions in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. First, vesicle-mediated transport between the TGN and the late endosome is an important intermediate step in lysosomal/vacuolar biogenesis, facilitating transport of hydrolytic enzymes destined for the lysosome (2Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Second, TGN-to-late endosome transport functions in the localization of TGN integral membrane proteins; a function critical in maintaining the processing and sorting activities of the TGN (3Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Similar to the pathway of lysosomal biogenesis in mammalian cells, inactive precursors of vacuolar enzymes in yeast are recognized in the TGN by the Vps10p transmembrane receptor, which delivers the cargo enzymes to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) by a clathrin-dependent vesicle intermediate (4Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After reaching the PVC, the hydrolytic enzymes are delivered to the vacuole where they are activated, and the receptors are recycled back to the TGN for another round of transport. TGN-to-PVC transport represents the forward step in a highly regulated bi-directional, vesicle-mediated exchange between these two compartments. TGN integral membrane proteins, such as the proprotein processing enzymes Kex2p and Ste13p, cargo-sorting receptor Vps10p, and components of the vesicle fusion machinery, require continual cycling between the TGN and the late endosome for proper function and stability (5Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 6Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interruption in this cycling mechanism causes the mislocalization of TGN resident proteins, with consequent loss of processing and sorting activities in the TGN. In yeast, fusion of TGN-derived transport vesicles with the PVC requires Pep12p, a PVC-localized t-SNARE (9Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Gerrard S.R. Levi B.P. Stevens T.H. Traffic. 2000; 1: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized a cell-free reaction in which membranes containing the proprotein processing protease, Kex2p, fuse with membranes containing a PVC-localized Pep12p chimera (12Blanchette J.M. Abazeed M.E. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48767-48773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This reaction exhibited characteristics of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion, including dependence on Pep12p. Here, we offer a detailed biochemical analysis of this TGN-to-PVC transport reaction to identify the precise mechanism by which Kex2p and Pep12p compartments undergo fusion in cell extracts. We find that molecules required for both formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN, the Chc1p clathrin heavy chain and the Vps1p dynamin homolog, and vesicle fusion at the PVC, the Vps21p rab protein, and Vps45 SM (Sec1/Munc18) protein, are required for cell-free transport. These results offer strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that fusion between Kex2p- and Pep12p-containing membranes in this system represents authentic TGN-to-PVC transport. Beyond this validation phase, we show that Kex2p molecules competent for delivery to the PVC reside initially in a clathrin-containing compartment. In addition, we show that a Kex2p chimera containing the cytosolic tail (C-tail) of the vacuolar protein sorting receptor, Vps10p, is also efficiently transported to the PVC, allowing us to now study the direct transport of two TGN transmembrane proteins that exhibit different trafficking itineraries (13Sipos G. Brickner J.H. Brace E.J. Chen L. Rambourg A. Kepes F. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3196-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, we show antibodies against the C-tails of Kex2p and Vps10p selectively block transport of Kex2p and the Kex2-Vps10p chimera, consistent with the interpretation that these TGN proteins must be incorporated into a coated vesicle in order to reach the PVC. Taken together, these results argue that delivery of TGN proteins to the PVC in this system is a cargo-selective process that proceeds through a clathrin-coated vesicular intermediate. Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I; their construction is described below. JBY209 and BLY9 were as described (14Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). BLY26 was generated by transforming JBY209 with plasmid pRS314vps45-37ts expressing TRP1 and subsequently deleting the chromosomal VPS45 gene by the PCR method using the URA3 gene from pUG72 as a marker. PCR primers were designed with homology to 45 nucleotides upstream and down-stream of the VPS45 structural gene. vps45Δ was confirmed by colony PCR. The vps1-100 temperature-sensitive allele was introduced by transplacement (15Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). JBY209 was transformed with plasmid pCAV40 linearized with EcoRI and Ura+ colonies selected. MAY1 was a Ura– loop-out (selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates) that exhibited temperature-sensitive growth. The chc1-521ts allele was introduced, similarly, by transforming JBY209 with YIpchc521-ΔCla linearized with XbaI, selecting Ura+ colonies. MAY2 was a Ura– loop-out (selected on 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates) that exhibited temperature-sensitive growth. pRS314vps45-37ts was constructed by inserting a ApaI/SacI fragment containing vps45-37ts allele into vector pRS314. A gene encoding the Kex2-Vps10p chimera was constructed by replacing codons 698 and 699 in KEX2 and codons 1416 and 1417 in VPS10 with an NdeI site (CATATG) and replacing sequences encoding the Kex2p C-tail with the NdeI-BstYI fragment encoding the Vps10p C-tail. The predicted amino acid sequence across chimeric junction, Met-Phe-His-Met-Gly-Ile, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A plasmid encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Vps21p fusion, pYEX4T1-VPS21, was isolated from an ordered array (16Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J.

Bovine α-thrombin was from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Membrane and Cytosol Preparations—Medium-speed supernatant (MSS) membranes, high speed pellet (HSP) membranes, and high speed supernatant (HSS) cytosol were prepared from semi-intact yeast cells as described (14Brickner J.H.

Cell-free Transport—Cell-free transport reactions containing MSS membranes were performed essentially as described (12Blanchette J.M. Abazeed M.E. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48767-48773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were prepared from JBY209 containing pCWKX10 or pPEP12STE13ΔTMDα3xHA (PSHA). Frozen spheroplasts (200 μl) were thawed (25 °C, 2 min) and centrifuged (5 min, 14,000 rpm), and MSS fractions were collected. MSS isolated under these conditions has been previously shown to contain cytosol and late Golgi and endosomal membranes but not ER or early Golgi vesicles (14Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For cell-free fusion, 10 μl of MSS membranes from both the Kex2p- and PSHA-expressing strains were added to 10 μl of 3× reaction mix (0.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7, 75 mm KOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 0.25 mm EGTA, 140 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.375 mg ml–1 creatine kinase) on ice. Reactions were started by shifting to 30 °C and unless indicated otherwise were incubated for 20 min. 10 μl were then removed and added to tubes containing either immunoprecipitation mix (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μl of pansorbin, 1 μl of 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA, and 1 μl of rabbit anti-mouse IgG) or mock IP mix (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μl of pansorbin, and 2 μl of water). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 30 min. Pansorbin was pelleted, and 30 μl of each supernatant fraction were assayed for DPAP activity. The fraction of PSHA processed was calculated as the ratio of DPAP activity in the supernatant fraction (i.e. the activity that was immunodepletion-resistant) to the DPAP activity in the mock immunoprecipitation reaction (i.e. the total). Typically, incubation of PSHA and Kex2p MSS resulted in 10–12% of DPAP remaining in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation. Incubation of PSHA MSS with kex2Δ MSS resulted in 1–3% of DPAP remaining in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation. Tests for temperature-sensitive protein requirements were conducted by preincubating membranes at the permissive (25 °C) or non-permissive (35 °C) temperatures in the absence of reaction mix. After preincubation, reaction mix (0.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES pH 7, 75 mm KOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 0.25 mm EGTA, 140 mm phosphocreatine, 0.375 mg/ml creatine kinase) was added on ice, and reactions were initiated by shifting to 25 °C and incubated for 20 min prior to processing as described (14Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Data points represent mean values of duplicates; all reactions were performed at least twice with comparable results. Error bars represent the S.D. of the average of at least two reactions. Preparation of Soluble Vps21p—A GST-Vps21p fusion protein, with a free C terminus to permit in vivo geranyl-geranylation, was expressed in yeast strain JBY209 from plasmid pYEX4T1-VPS21 and the protein was purified. Two hours prior to harvest, GST-Vps21p expression was induced by adding 100 μm CuSO4 to activate the CUP1 promoter on pYEX4T1. A control culture did not receive copper. Extract prepared from induced and uninduced cells by spheroplast lysis was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were washed 3× (10 ml) with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and GST fusion protein bound to beads was cleaved by bovine α-thrombin to release Vps21p. Thrombin was inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the soluble fraction and three 1-ml washes of thrombin-treated beads were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against PBS buffer. A Coomassie-stained gel of the purified fraction from induced cells showed substantial enrichment of the Vps21p to about 50% purity. A Coomassie-stained gel of the mock-purified fraction from uninduced cells showed no Vps21p band. Subcellular Fractionation—JBY209 cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 1.0 in YPD and collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Spheroplasts, generated by lyticase treatment, were frozen over liquid N2. Frozen spheroplasts (200-μl samples equivalent to 40 ml of cells at OD600 = 1.0) were thawed (25 °C, 2 min) and centrifuged (5 min, 14,000 × g), and the MSS fraction containing microsomes and cytosol was collected. To separate membranes from cytosol, MSS membranes were centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h at 4 °C to generate HSP membranes and HSS cytosol. Samples equivalent to 2 ml of cells (OD600 = 1.0) of the medium speed pellet (MSP), MSS, HSP, and HSS were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoisolation of Clathrin-containing Membranes—Immunoisolation of clathrin-containing membranes proceeded as described (19Deloche O. Yeung B.G. Payne G.S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Cells were converted to spheroplasts by lyticase treatment and lysis was induced by a slow freeze over liquid N2 vapors followed by a rapid thaw at 25 °C for 2 min (18Baker D. Schekman R. Methods Cell. Biol. 1989; 31: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MSS generated by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g was gently layered on a 200-μl cushion of 80% Percoll and centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet fraction was resuspended in 500 μl of MES buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). 20 μl of antiserum against Clc1p were added to resuspended membrane preparations diluted in 1 ml of MES buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. These mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Immunocomplexes were isolated by addition of 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (20% in MES buffer) and by incubation for an additional hour at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose pellets were subsequently washed and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. TGN-to-PVC Membrane Fusion Is Cytosol-dependent— Elsewhere, we have reported a cell-free fusion reaction between Kex2p- and Pep12p-containing MSS membranes released from semi-intact yeast cells that exhibited specific biochemical and molecular requirements (12Blanchette J.M. Abazeed M.E. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48767-48773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this reaction, fusion of MSS membranes containing Kex2p with MSS membranes containing a Pep12p fusion protein, PSHA (see Fig. 1A for description), results in cleavage of PSHA by Kex2p, monitored by enzymatic activity of Ste13 dipeptidyl aminopeptidase released in the soluble phase of an immunoprecipitation (14Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether this reaction exhibited characteristics expected of TGN-to-PVC transport in vivo, we examined specific requirements for proteins involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation at the TGN and vesicle fusion at the PVC. Vesicle formation, targeting and fusion depend on recruitment of cytosolic components to membranes. To assess the cytosol dependence of the reaction, Kex2p and Pep12p membranes were pelleted at 200,000 × g (P200) through a 12.5% Ficoll cushion and resuspended in membrane extraction buffer. HSP incubated under standard reaction conditions exhibited poor processing of the PSHA substrate (Fig. 1B). The addition of cytosol (HSS) to the membrane fractions restored fusion in a concentration-dependent fashion. The reconstituted reaction reached completion in 60 min (data not shown) and thus was slower than the reaction using unfractionated membranes, which reaches maximal level of PSHA processing after 20 min of incubation (12Blanchette J.M. Abazeed M.E. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48767-48773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the extent of the reconstituted reaction (80% of the control) was similar to the reaction using unfractionated membranes. Requirement for Rab Vps21p and SM Protein Vps45p—In vivo studies indicate that the Rab GTPase protein Vps21p is involved in fusion of Golgi-derived transport vesicles with the PVC (20Gerrard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Membranes from vps21 mutant cells should therefore be defective for cell-free TGN-PVC transport. Membranes from a vps21 mutant strain expressing either Kex2p or PSHA were prepared and tested for fusion. Although there was a modest reduction in the level of PSHA cleavage when membranes from the Kex2p vps21 strain were used, a severe defect was observed when the PSHA-containing membranes were prepared from a vps21 mutant strain (Fig. 2A). Absence of Vps21p function from both membrane preparations resulted in a further loss of fusion competence (Fig. 2A). Although it was evident that the lack of Vps21p function on PSHA-containing membranes led to the majority of loss of fusion activity, it was not clear whether this loss was due to missorting of the PSHA substrate in vivo or whether the defect was due directly to the inability of Golgi-derived vesicles to fuse with the Pep12p compartment. To distinguish between these possibilities, wild-type Vps21p expressed in yeast as a GST fusion, purified from yeast extracts and cleaved from the GST tag from a Cu2+-inducible GST-VPS21 vector was purified from yeast as described under “Experimental Procedures” (16Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Addition of purified Vps21p to MSS membranes from the vps21 mutant strain led to a recovery of membrane fusion that was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B). The required time of incubation was similar to that needed for reconstitution of fusion using P200 membranes incubated with cytosol, suggesting that the delay in that experiment represents reassociation of protein factors with membranes. This experiment suggested that Vps21p was required for fusion of Kex2p and Pep12p membranes, but it was important to determine whether or not the vps21 mutation altered the localization of the PSHA substrate. Loss of Vps21p function in vivo might result in accumulation of PSHA in TGN membranes. To rule out the possibility that addition of purified Vps21p promoted Kex2p-dependent cleavage of PSHA through TGN homotypic fusion, which also requires Vps21p (14Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we examined inhibition by the actin depolymerizing compound Latrunculin B, which blocks TGN homotypic fusion but not TGN-PVC transport (12Blanchette J.M. Abazeed M.E. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48767-48773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, Latrunculin B did not inhibit PSHA cleavage in vps21 membranes supplemented with purified Vps21p (Fig. 2C). These observations indicate that cell-free fusion of Kex2p-containing membranes and PVC-localized PSHA is Vps21p-dependent. Mutations in the class D VPS genes PEP12, VPS21, or VPS45 result in similar phenotypes; moreover, all three gene products are thought to be part of a multiprotein complex that mediates tethering and fusion of TGN transport vesicles with the PVC (22Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). VPS45 encodes a Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein that binds directly to and regulates the syntaxin Pep12p (23Tall G.G. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Horazdovsky B.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1873-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, Vps45p is selectively involved in mediating entry of TGN-derived cargo proteins into the PVC and is not required for entry of endocytic cargo (24Bryant N.J. Piper R.C. Gerrard S.R. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Involvement of Vps45p in cell-free fusion of Kex2p and Pep12p membranes would thus provide additional evidence that delivery of Kex2p to the Pep12p membranes represents authentic TGN-PVC transport. This is important because although Kex2p is mainly localized at the TGN at steady state (17Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), Kex2p cycles through both the early endosome (EE), and PVC (13Sipos G. Brickner J.H. Brace E.J. Chen L. Rambourg A. Kepes F. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3196-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, fusion between Kex2p and Pep12p membranes in the cell-free assay could represent TGN-to-PVC transport, EE-to-PVC transport, or a combination of these events. To distinguish these possibilities, we prepared membrane extracts from a vps45ts strain expressing either Kex2p or the PSHA substrate. The use of the conditional vps45 allele eliminated possible complications of in vivo missorting of Kex2p or Pep12p. MSS membranes were prepared from the vps45ts strains grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C). Prior to the reaction, membranes were preincubated separately at 25 or 35 °C (non-permissive temperature) for 10 min. Preincubation at 35 °C had only a slight effect on the VPS45 wild-type membranes (Fig. 3A). When only the Kex2p-containing or PSHA-containing membranes were from the vps45ts background, preincubation at 35 °C resulted in a partial reduction (50–60%) in PSHA cleavage relative to that observed with membranes preincubated at 25 °C (Fig. 3A). PSHA cleavage was reduced to background levels (i.e. observed with kex2Δ membranes) when both Kex2p and PSHA membranes were from vps45ts strains and were preincubated at 35 °C (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that inactivation of the temperature-sensitive form of Vps45p blocks cell-free fusion of Kex2p and Pep12p membranes. Recently it has been demonstrated that Vps45p associates and disassociates from membranes at different stages of SNARE complex assembly (25Bryant N.J. James D.E. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 161: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that vesicle docking regulates Vps45 recruitment to membranes"
https://openalex.org/W2095549736,"ERp29 is a major resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that seemingly plays an important role in most animal cells. Although a protein-folding association is widely supported, ERp29's specific molecular function remains unknown. A chaperone activity was postulated from evidence that ERp29 forms multimers like the classical ER chaperones, but conflicting results have emerged from our recent studies. Here a biophysical approach was used to clarify this issue and also reveal a key structural role for ERp29's characteristic cysteine, Cys-125. Applying hydrodynamic parameters derived from sedimentation and dynamic light-scattering analyses, a model of ERp29's quaternary structure was assembled from existing tertiary substructures. Comparison with Windbeutel, an ERp29-like protein from fruit fly with specialized chaperone activity, revealed similar tri-lobar gross structures but some finer differences consistent with functional divergence. Solubility and hydrophobic probe assays revealed moderate surface hydrophobicity, which was reduced in mutant ERp29 in which serine replaced Cys-125. This mutant was also relatively labile to proteolytic degradation, providing two reasons for the strict conservation of Cys-125. No multimerization was observed with untagged ERp29, which existed as tight homodimers (Kd < 50 nm), whereas His-tagged ERp29 artifactually formed 670-kDa oligomers. These findings distinguish ERp29 biophysically from its peers in the ER including Windbeutel, endorsing our postulate that ERp29 adds a distinct type of folding activity to the ER machinery. By invoking novel functional associations for Cys-125 and the adjoining linker, new clues about how ERp29 might work have also arisen.

As central components of the ER machinery, reticuloplasmins play pivotal roles in the high quality production of secretory proteins, safe storage of calcium, and an associated range of serious health disorders (1.Ellgaard L.

The most abundant reticuloplasmins include four ubiquitous “housekeepers” that help newly synthesized proteins fold by editing disulfide bonds (protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)) and acting as molecular chaperones (BiP, calreticulin, endoplasmin, PDI) (2.Michalak M.

Although these classical ER protein-folding assistants have well characterized individual roles, less is known about how they cooperate with one another and with additional ER constituents to ensure that diverse secretory proteins are folded correctly in different cell types. Compounding this issue is the recent discovery of several novel reticuloplasmins with uncertain functions (1.Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A.

First characterized in 1997, ERp29 is now recognized as another major reticuloplasmin that might add distinct functionality to the ER machinery (10.Demmer J. Zhou C. Hubbard M.J.

ERp29 is expressed ubiquitously in animal cells and with similar abundance as the four main folding assistants, implying a general housekeeping role (12.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J.

Although a protein-folding activity seems likely, ERp29's specific molecular function remains unknown. Our studies have localized ERp29 primarily to the beginning of the secretory pathway (rough ER) and, by identifying various cell types that utilize ERp29 highly, implicated it in the production of hydrophobic proteins destined for membranes and export. ERp29 was also distinguished from its peers by regulatory and biochemical differences, including a distinctive lack of calcium binding activity (13.Shnyder S.D. Hubbard M.J. J. Histochem.

Others have provided further evidence of such a distinct role, including ERp29's novel tertiary structure (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), lack of classical ER stress-response elements (23.Sargsyan E. Baryshev M. Backlund M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17009-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We recently purified ERp29 under native conditions and unexpectedly found no evidence of classical chaperone or PDI-like activities. This led to a revised hypothesis that ERp29 is a distinct type of folding assistant and highlighted some significant uncertainties about ERp29's biophysical features (21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Improved biophysical understanding of ERp29 is desirable for two prime reasons. Several gaps exist in current knowledge of ERp29's structure, and these might be bridged by learning more about the associated hydrodynamic properties. Like other major reticuloplasmins, ERp29 has eluded attempts to determine its structure crystallographically (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Soling H.D. Uson I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a major advance came with production of NMR-based structures for the two constituent domains (named N and C (10.Demmer J. Zhou C. Hubbard M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and evidence that the N domains are solely responsible for ERp29's self-association as a dimer. Modeled assemblies of the N-C monomer and the dimerized N domains gave exciting insights to ERp29's novel structure, albeit significant uncertainties accompanied both inferred substructures (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Indeed, the elongate homodimer implicit from combination of these part models conflicts with ERp29's reported behavior as a globular protein during size-exclusion chromatography (24.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25.Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Soling H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further questions have been raised by the crystallographic structure obtained recently for Windbeutel, an ERp29-like protein from fruit fly, which shows a quite different position for the dimer interface (27.Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Soling H.D. Uson I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, key functional attributes of ERp29 are likely to be reflected in its surface-based properties, yet studies to date have produced discordant results. Repeated evidence that ERp29 forms not only dimers but also higher order oligomers (multimers) was used aptly to promote a chaperone role (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M.

This study sought to establish a hydrodynamically valid structural model for ERp29 and use it to evaluate relatedness with Windbeutel at the quaternary level. We also aimed to address the hypotheses that ERp29 is either a chaperone (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S.

J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) through characterization of its surface properties. Thirdly, the biophysical influence of ERp29's strictly conserved cysteine (Cys-125) was questioned because, with no evidence of involvement in a PDI-like activity (21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we postulated that Cys-125 might instead play an important structural role. With the availability of pure, tissue-derived (native) ERp29 limiting, our approach was to make a true, tag-free copy of the rat protein by recombinant expression and authenticate this using biochemical criteria established for native protein (12.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3785-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that Cys-125 does indeed have structural importance and that ERp29 is biophysically distinct from its peers including Windbeutel, collectively supporting the notion of a distinct protein-folding activity. Sources of native ERp29, anti-ERp29, liver microsomes, and protein standards were as described (21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NDSB-201 (3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate) was from Fluka, and ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid) was from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were supplied by Roche Applied Science, Amersham Biosciences, and New England Biolabs. Wild Type rERp29—The pET 22b+ system (Novagen) was used to express mature ERp29 in the periplasm of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). An ERp29 insert without signal sequence was PCR-amplified from the original rat ERp29 clone (prnERp29 (10.Demmer J. Zhou C. Hubbard M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and ligated into the MscI/BamHI-restricted vector, directly behind its PelB signal sequence. After transformation with this sequence-verified construct (pETERp29), hosts were induced lightly (0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 30 min), and the periplasmic fraction was isolated by osmotic shock (Novagen protocol). Stronger inductions were found unsuitable, giving incomplete cleavage of the signal sequence which could not be fully resolved by purification. Periplasmic extract was adjusted to contain 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and filtered (0.45 μm), and then recombinant ERp29 (rERp29) was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose essentially as described (21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Edman analysis revealed the expected mature N-terminal sequence, and circular dichroism indicated a high helical content (55% α-helix, 11% β-strand, 34% other, calculated using the K2d tool at www.embl.de/~andrade/k2d.html) as expected (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). C125S Mutant—The region surrounding Cys-125 was excised from pETERp29 (NdeI, StuI) and replaced with an equivalent PCR-amplified insert that coded for serine in place of Cys-125. The sequence-verified construct (pETERpCS) was used to produce C125S mutant protein as outlined for wild type rERp29, except that protease inhibitors (benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added at 4-fold higher concentrations and elution from the heparin-affinity column was modified as detailed below (see Fig. 6). His-tagged Variants—The ProEx-1 system (Invitrogen) was used to add an N-terminal His6 tag (MGHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAHM) to mature rERp29 and the C125S mutant and express them cytoplasmically in E. coli MC1061. The coding inserts were PCR-amplified from pETERp29 and pETERpCS and ligated into the NdeI/XhoI-restricted vectors, giving pProEx-ERp29 and pProEx-C125S, respectively. Following induction (0.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 3 h), conventional procedures were used to prepare cell lysates and isolate tagged proteins by nickel affinity chromatography on a chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Mini-scale chromatography on Sephacryl-S200HR (8-ml bed, 10 μgof rERp29 loaded in 0.1 ml) with internal calibration was as described (21.Hubbard M.J. Mangum J.E. McHugh N.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For higher loads (170 μg of rERp29 in 0.8 ml), samples were chromatographed (0.2 ml/min, 20 °C) on a 24-ml Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% isopropyl alcohol. External calibration and calculation of the Stokes radius, RS, was done using the following standards: bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa, RS = 3.7 nm; ovalbumin, 44 kDa, RS = 3.05 nm; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa, RS = 2.4 nm; cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa, RS = 1.9 nm (36.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). For equilibrium analysis, samples (145 μl, 0.32 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 °C, An-60 Ti rotor) in a Beckman XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge until equilibrium was achieved (∼24 h). Data were analyzed with SEDEQ1b software, initially assuming a single sedimenting species (37.Atcliffe B.W. MacRaild C.A. Gooley P.R. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Calculations of solvent density and ERp29's partial specific volume (v = 0.7433 cm3/g from composition) were made with SEDENTERP software, and ERp29 was quantified from A280 values using the molar extinction coefficient (25,460 m–1·cm–1 for monomer) calculated with the ProtParam tool (ExPASy; www.expasy.org). For sedimentation velocity analysis, samples (145 μl, 0.17 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) were centrifuged (40,000 × g, 20 °C) in the same instrument, and radial scans (230 nm, 4-min intervals) were analyzed with SEDFIT software (38.MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples (12 μl, 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) were analyzed at 20 °C using a DynaPro 99E instrument and Dynamics software (Protein Solutions) after centrifugation to remove any gross particulates (15,000 × g, 10 min). Translational diffusion constants (D) were obtained directly from the rate of optical decay, and standard approaches were used to calculate RS (Stokes-Einstein equation), frictional coefficient (Einstein-Sutherland equation), and M (assuming spherical protein with typical hydration, h = 1.3). Polydispersity was defined as one S.D. of RS (Dynamics software). For comparison with “anhydrous” molecular models of ERp29, it was necessary to downscale the hydrodynamic dimensions of rERp29 (see Table I) since these represented hydrated protein (39.Durchschlag H. Zipper P. Eur. Biophys. J. 2003; 32: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40.Garcia De La Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The frictional ratio of a typical globular protein (f/fo = 1.2) is 0.2 higher than expected for an equivalent sphere because of bound water (41.Edsall J.T. Neurath H. Bailey K. The Proteins. Academic Press Inc., New York1953: 549-726Google Scholar). Consequently, ERp29 was “dehydrated” by adjusting the principal dimensions of the ellipsoid to reduce f/fo by 0.2 (Perrin equation (41.Edsall J.T. Neurath H. Bailey K. The Proteins. Academic Press Inc., New York1953: 549-726Google Scholar)). Structural modeling was done with MOLMOL software (42.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), using the NMR-based structures of ERp29's N and C domains (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1g7d and 1g7e (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S.

The ERp29 quaternary model was refined to the dehydrated ellipsoid (f/fo = 1.17) by introducing at each interdomain linker a 5° bend toward the long axis and a minimal (0.4 nm) longitudinal “stretch” as needed to avoid conflict between the N and C domains. This refinement was permissible within the diverse conformers reported for the (bisected) linker region (22.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S.

Dilution series were prepared in the same buffer, and then triplicated 20-μl samples of each starting concentration were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (4 °C) using Slide-A-Lyzer microdialysis units (Pierce). After centrifuging (15,000 × g, 15 min), soluble protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye binding microassay (Bio-Rad) and compared with controls (i.e. stock solution, before and after overnight storage at 4 °C). To assay surface hydrophobicity (32.Primm T.P. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43.Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), ERp29 and control proteins (5 μm, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) were incubated with 100 μm ANS for 2 h at 4 °C and then analyzed in a PolarStar spectrofluorimeter (BMG LabTechnologies) using appropriate settings (350 nm excitation, 490 nm emission, 10-nm bandwidths). Proteins were quantified from A280 values in 4 m urea, based on extinction values (ProtParam tool, ExPASy). Although the fixed-wavelength capability of the fluorimeter precluded a fully quantitative analysis, the expected rank order of hydrophobicity was observed with control proteins (see Fig. 5) (cf. Ref. 43.Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Conventional procedures for SDS-PAGE, denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, Edman microsequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry were as described (12.Hubbard M.J.

For cross-linking, ERp29 (0.2 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl) was incubated with 0.6 mm BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) for 30 min before SDS-PAGE, essentially as before (21.Hubbard M.J.

Here, we demonstrate that DFF directly binds to DNA in vitro without promoting DNA cleavage. DNA binding by DFF is mediated by the nuclease subunit, which can also form stable DNA complexes after release from DFF. Recombinant and reconstituted DFF is catalytically inactive yet proficient in DNA binding, demonstrating that the nuclease subunit in DFF is inhibited in DNA cleavage but not in DNA binding, revealing an unprecedented mode of nuclease inhibition. Activation of DFF in the presence of naked DNA or isolated nuclei stimulates DNA degradation by released DFF40 (CAD). In transfected HeLa cells transiently expressed DFF associates with chromatin, suggesting that DFF could be activated during apoptosis in a DNA-bound state.

DFF40 (CAD) activity is also enhanced by architectural chromatin proteins such as histone H1 and HMGB1 and 2. For example, DFF40 (CAD) directly binds to histone H1, suggesting that this protein perhaps targets the nuclease to the DNA linker region where nucleosomal DNA fragmentation occurs (6Liu X. Li P.

In the present study, we provide evidence that DFF in addition to the above mentioned interactions can directly interact with DNA in vitro without inducing DNA cleavage and is able to associate with chromatin in transfected HeLa cells. This is the first known case of a DNase-inhibitor complex in which DNA binding occurs but DNA cleavage is blocked. Intriguingly, DNA binding by DFF prior to or concomitant with its activation by caspase-3 stimulates the activity of the released nuclease DFF40 (CAD) on naked DNA and isolated nuclei, suggesting that during apoptosis nuclear DFF can be activated in a DNA-bound state. Bacterial and Mammalian Expression Vectors—Vectors for the expression of differentially tagged subunits of DFF in mammalian cells, pCI-EGFP-DFF40, pCI-GST-DFF45, and pCS2-MT-DFF40, were described previously (22Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). pcDNA-3.1-EGFP-DFF45 was constructed by inserting the cDNA of DFF45 into a modified pcDNA-3.1 vector, allowing expression of GFP fusion proteins. pEGFP-C2-CTCF was a kind gift from Ru Zhang (Institute for Genetics, JLU-Giessen). For bacterial expression of DFF subunits, the following vectors were used: pGEX-2T-CAD and pACET-DFF45, allowing coexpression of GST-CAD and DFF45 in Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (22Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pET-Duet1-HisCAD, for the expression of N-terminally His-tagged CAD, was constructed by inserting CAD cDNA into the expression vector pET-Duet-1 (Merck Biosciences). pRSETB-ICAD-L (a kind gift from W. C. Earnshaw) was used to express His-tagged ICAD-L (24Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). His-tagged ICAD-S was expressed using vector pLK-His-ICAD-S as described previously (22Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Non-detergent Cell Lysis and Immunodetection of Endogenous DFF— Non-detergent cell lysis was performed using the CNM compartmental protein extraction kit (BioChain Institute, Inc.) according to the supplier's recommendations. Western blotting was performed using polyclonal anti-DFF40 and anti-DFF45/35 antibodies (ProSci, Inc.) in combination with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Merck Biosciences-Calbiochem) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—Mammalian cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For in situ nuclear matrix preparations, HeLa cells were grown as described above on glass slides in 9.4-cm dishes and transfected by Ca2+-phosphate co-precipitation using a total of 30 μg of DNA. For preparative nuclear matrix preparations, HeLa cells grown in maxidishes were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with 60 μg of DNA. Nuclear Matrix Preparations—In situ nuclear matrix preparations were performed as described previously with a slight modification (25Mattern K.A. van der Kraan I. Schul W. de Jong L. van Driel R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with appropriate GFP fusion constructs were extracted with 0.25% Triton X-100, instead of 1%, in CSK100 buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.3 m sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture) to account for the Triton X-100 sensitivity of DFF. Cells were examined with a Leica TCS4D confocal laser-scanning microscope as described previously (22Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For in-batch nuclear matrix preparations, transfected HeLa cells were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK100 buffer for 5 min on ice and then passed five times through a 22-gauge injection needle. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet washed with 1× CSK100 buffer. Matrix stabilization, chromosomal DNA cleavage, and chromatin depletion were achieved as described above. Chromatin-depleted nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and washed twice with CSK50 buffer. The Triton X-100 soluble fraction, matrix-stabilized nuclei, and chromatin-depleted nuclei were analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit GFP antiserum (α-GFP; Invitrogen) and an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Merck Biosciences-Calbiochem) in combination with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Production of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Mutagenesis—Recombinant His-tagged DFF was produced as described previously with minor modifications (23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-tagged DFF was expressed in E. coli BL21Gold (DE3) cells transformed with the two compatible plasmids pACET-DFF45 and pET-Duet1-HisCAD. The soluble protein fraction containing His-tagged DFF was purified by standard Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Eluted DFF was concentrated using centricon microconcentrators and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography using a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column. Bound protein was eluted in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) using a 15-ml gradient of NaCl (100–300 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions of recombinant DFF were collected and concentrated as before in buffer A. GST-tagged DFF containing wild-type CAD or the K155Q and H263N CAD mutants were produced as described before (23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Where desired, GST-tagged DFF bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4-B beads in PBS was incubated with thrombin (50 units) overnight to remove the GST tag. The processed complex from the supernatant was purified by anion exchange chromatography as described above. Caspase-3 was expressed and purified as described before (23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). His-tagged ICAD-L was expressed using plasmid pRSET-ICAD-L (see above) and His-tagged ICAD-S as described elsewhere (22Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were first purified by standard Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and further purified by anion-exchange chromatography similarly as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Standard DNA binding reactions were performed for 30 min in shift buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% CHAPS) containing 12.5 ng/μl plasmid DNA (pBS-VDEX) and indicated amounts of proteins (see figures) in a final volume of 20 μl. Aliquots of the binding reactions were transferred into shift loading buffer (75% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue), loaded onto 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.05 μg/ml ethidium bromide and separated by electrophoresis in TBE buffer (Tris borate/EDTA, pH 8.3). Aliquots of the binding reactions with PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6 or 5% polyacrylamide gels in TPE buffer (Tris phosphate, pH 8.2). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide. UV Cross-linking—A-39 bp double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide at a concentration of 5 μm with photoactivatable 5-iododeoxyuridine incorporated at three adjacent sites in the center of one DNA strand radioactively labeled with 32P at its 5′-end was incubated with 5 μm DFF in buffer A. UV irradiation of the DFF-DNA complex with a helium/cadmium laser at 325 nm for 30 min was applied to induce cross-linking. Aliquots of the reaction mix were separated by PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Plasmid DNA and protein were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 30 ng of DNA and different concentrations of DFF ranging from 0 to 300 ng (molar ratios of enzyme to DNA between 30:1 and 300:1) in shift buffer. Complexes were fixed with 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and, after 3-fold dilution in 10 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2, adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica. Micrographs were taken using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 100 kV and a Fastscan CCD camera (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems GmbH, Gauting, Germany). Reconstitution of DFF—For reconstitution of DFF we activated GST-tagged DFF (5 μm final concentration) in shift buffer (see above) or shift buffer supplemented with Mg2+ (5 mm final concentration) containing plasmid DNA (pBS-VDEX, 12.5 ng/μl) with caspase-3, then added pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (88 μm final concentration) and substituted the reaction mix with recombinant ICAD-L or ICAD-S, respectively, at 15 and 30 μm final concentration, corresponding to 3- and 6-fold molar excess of inhibitory subunits over free nuclease. Aliquots of the reaction were mixed with shift loading buffer and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer (Tris borate/EDTA, pH 8.3). Time Order of Addition Experiments—To examine the cleavage activity of DFF premixed with DNA prior to caspase-3 activation, we incubated His-DFF (20 nm) with plasmid DNA (pBS-VDEX, 25 ng/μl) for 5 min, added recombinant caspase-3 and then stopped caspase-3 processing of DFF after 15 min by addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA cleavage was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. To analyze the cleavage activity of DFF activated by caspase-3 in the absence of DNA, we incubated recombinant DFF (20 nm) with caspase-3 for 15 min and stopped caspase-3 activation of DFF by adding pan-caspase inhibitor. Activated DFF was then incubated with DNA (pBS-VDEX, 25 ng/μl) for 20 min, and the cleavage reaction started by addition of MgCl2 as above. To analyze DNA cleavage activity of DFF incubated with DNA concomitant with caspase-3 activation, we mixed DFF (20 nm), DNA (pBS-VDEX, 25 ng/μl), and caspase-3, stopped caspase-3 activation of DFF after 15 min by addition of pan-caspase inhibitor and then started the DNA cleavage reaction after a further 5 min incubation by addition of MgCl2. Aliquots of the DNA cleavage reactions were taken at 0 (immediately after addition of MgCl2), 1, 3, 9, and 15 min time points, loaded onto 0.8% agarose gels and analyzed by electrophoresis as described above. To quantify DNA cleavage, the decrease of the supercoiled plasmid DNA band in the gels was measured and transformed into relative cleavage rates. To use chromatin as substrate, nuclei were isolated from HeLa cells by standard centrifugation procedures using Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.5) and a cell lysis buffer (0.325 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) and cleaved using 50 nm DFF. Inhibited and Released DFF40 (CAD) but Not DFF45 (ICAD-L) Interact with DNA—In an attempt to identify the DNA binding domain of DFF40 (CAD) we to our surprise found that not only the released nuclease subunit itself but also the nuclease/inhibitor complex DFF forms stable DNA complexes in vitro. In the EMSA shown in Fig. 1B, we used GST-tagged wild-type DFF and the active site variant H263N of murine DFF40 (CAD) as well as recombinant DFF45 and GST with plasmid DNA as substrate. His263 is an important catalytic residue of murine DFF40 (CAD) situated in the active center close to the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A) (23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Sakahira H. Takemura Y. Nagata S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The H263N variant of murine DFF40 (CAD) was used to see, whether this catalytically inactive enzyme retains the ability to bind DNA despite of its inability to cleave it. Recombinant DFF45 and GST were analyzed for control. As shown in Fig. 1B, DFF and the nuclease subunits released from DFF, but neither the inhibitory subunit DFF45 nor GST, form stable DNA complexes. Formation of these complexes is not dependent on the presence of Mg2+, which is an essential cofactor for DNA cleavage by the nuclease DFF40 (CAD) as seen in Fig. 1B (27Sakahira H. Takemura Y. Nagata S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mg2+, the wild-type nuclease and the H263N variant induce a similar mobility shift in the DNA. In the presence of Mg2+, the wild-type nuclease readily cleaves the DNA, loosing its ability to induce a mobility shift (Fig. 1B, lane 13), whereas the active site variant H263N cannot cleave but can still bind the DNA (Fig. 1B, lane 15). These results clearly show that not only the nuclease subunit released from DFF but also the unprocessed nuclease/inhibitor complex DFF can form stable DNA complexes, which is highly unusual both for nonspecific nucleases and nuclease/inhibitor complexes. The data also suggest that the nuclease subunit in DFF mediates DNA binding of the nuclease/inhibitor complex, since the inhibitory subunit alone does not form DNA complexes (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 16). EMSA with a second inactive variant of murine DFF40 (CAD) with substitution of Lys155 by Gln supports this suggestion. Lys155 in murine DFF40 (CAD) is not an active site residue but closer to the CAD/CIDE-N-domain of the enzyme and appears to be involved in maintaining the protein structure and/or DNA binding (Fig. 1A) (23Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this EMSA we used thrombin-treated GST-DFF complexes in order to rule out that the binding activity seen is an artifact caused by the GST fusion (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, DFF with the K155Q mutant of CAD, DFFN-K155Q, does not form stable DNA complexes whereas DFFN-H263N and wild-type DFF do (Fig. 1C). This corroborates that the nuclease subunit in DFF mediates DNA binding and suggests that Lys157 (Lys155) in DFF40 (CAD) directly or indirectly plays an important role in DNA binding. The recently published crystal structure of murine DFF40 (CAD) illustrates that Lys155 is a buried residue stabilizing the N-terminal end of α-helix 4, which presumably binds in the major groove of the DNA (Fig. 1A) (28Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recombinant DFF Binds to Various DNA Substrates in Vitro—So far our results revealed that DFF forms stable DNA complexes in vitro via its nuclease subunit DFF40 (CAD). In order to further characterize the DNA binding capacity of DFF we produced recombinant DFF with the nuclease subunit carrying an N-terminal extension of 12 amino acid residues [MGRSH6KL] including a hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification and replacing the GST tag (Fig. 2A). This protein complex was used to carry out EMSA as well as UV cross-linking experiments with DFF and various DNA substrates including plasmid DNA as well as synthetic PCR products and oligodeoxynucleotides. As shown in Fig. 2B, His-tagged DFF, and the nuclease released from DFF by caspase-3 processing induce a mobility shift in the DNA. As seen from lane 4 in Fig. 2B, nuclease released from DFF by caspase-3 treatment in the absence of Mg2+ led to high molecular weight complexes that stick to the wells of the agarose gel, which can be explained by the fact that released DFF40 (CAD) has the propensity to form oligomers (20Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 29Widlak P. Lanuszewska J. Cary R.B. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). Such high molecular weight DFF40 (CAD)-DNA complexes might be unable to enter the gel matrix. In some cases with free DFF40 (CAD) we also observed a smear instead of homogenous complex formation indicating a non-homogenous distribution of DNA complexes and suggesting that under the conditions applied the DFF40 (CAD)-DNA complexes are less stable than the DFF-DNA complexes. DFF also binds to synthetic DNA such as PCR products of various sizes (Fig. 2C) as well as to a 39-bp double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide as demonstrated by UV cross-linking (Fig. 2D), apparently with a greater affinity toward larger DNA fragments. Titration of a 273-bp double-stranded PCR-derived DNA fragment with DFF in the presence (data not shown) or absence of Mg2+ revealed a dissociation constant Kd ≈ 5 × 10-6m (Fig. 2E). The sequences of the plasmid DNA, PCR products, and the oligodeoxynucleotide were unrelated, indicating that, as expected for a nonspecific nuclease, DFF binding to DNA is not sequence specific. Visualization of DFF-DNA Complex Formation and DNA Cleavage by Transmission Electron Microscopy—In order to obtain additional information about the nature of the DFF-DNA complexes formed we analyzed DNA binding and cleavage by DFF using transmission electron microscopy. When plasmid DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of DFF at physiological salt concentration the decrease in electrophoretic mobility of the DFF-DNA complex compared with the free plasmid DNA analyzed by EMSA was dependent on the concentration of DFF (Fig. 3A). When such complexes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, similar results were obtained (Fig. 3A). Depending on concentration, DFF binds to plasmid DNA in a nonspecific manner, independent of the absence or presence of Mg2+. As seen from Fig. 3A, DFF forms large aggregates on the DNA rather than sitting side by side on its substrate and more than one plasmid molecule is bound by such aggregates. When the nuclease subunit released from DFF by caspase-3 treatment was analyzed in the same way (Fig. 3B), we again observed nonspecific DNA binding in the absence of Mg2+ but, as expected, cleavage of the DNA into short linear fragments in the presence of Mg2+, corroborating the results obtained from the gel shift experiments. Recombinant and Reconstituted DFF Allow Formation of Stable DFF-DNA Complexes—Our results indicated that the free nuclease released from DFF and recombinant DFF obtained from co-expression of its subunits interact with DNA. It was pertinent to investigate if reconstitution of DFF, i.e. addition of inhibitory subunit to the nuclease subunit released from activated DFF results in the restoration of a DNA binding proficient but catalytically deficient nuclease/inhibitor complex. To this end, we have activated recombinant DFF using caspase-3, then added the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and finally supplemented the reaction mixture with recombinant ICAD-S (DFF35) or ICAD-L (DFF45) again (Fig. 4A). As shown, reconstituted DFF is able to bind to the DNA substrate similar to recombinant DFF obtained from co-expression of its subunits, allowing formation of a stable DNA complex but inhibiting the activity of the nuclease subunit (Fig. 4B). When the reconstituted DFF complexes were activated by excess caspase-3 (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 4), DNA cleavage by DFF40 (CAD) was regained. This result clearly shows that inhibition of the nuclease subunit in DFF is due to blocking the catalytic activity but not the DNA binding capacity of DFF40 (CAD). The results also suggest that ICAD-S (DFF35) and ICAD-L (DFF45) use the same mechanism for inhibition of DFF40 (CAD). To our knowledge, this mode of nuclease inhibition has not been seen yet with any other known nuclease/inhibitor complex (see below). DNA Binding by DFF Stimulates the Activity of Released DFF40 (CAD)—To elucidate if binding of DFF to DNA prior to or concomitant with its activation by caspase-3 has an influence on the activity of DFF40 (CAD), we performed time order of addition experiments. We compared the DNA cleavage kinetics of DFF40 (CAD) released from DFF incubated with DNA prior to or concomitant with its activation by caspase-3 with DNA cleavage kinetics of DFF40 (CAD) released from DFF activated by caspase-3 in the absence of DNA. Under the conditions applied, incubation of DFF with DNA prior to or concomitant with its activation by caspase-3 clearly stimulated the activity of released DFF40 (CAD) (Fig. 5A). This suggests that activation of DNA-bound DFF leads to an apparently higher cleavage efficiency of the released nuclease subunit compared with the nuclease released in the absence of DNA.

Melino M.R. Koprak S.L. Williams D. Witzel B. Pisano J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The binary complexes of Cyp18-CsA and FKBP12-FK506 act as inhibitors for their common cellular target, Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) (4Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J.

Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). In this case, the PPIases function as presenter molecules for the immunosuppressive drugs. CaN has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in signaling in activated T cells. Thus, the CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NFAT nuclear translocation, and NFAT transcriptional activation (6Zhu J. McKeon F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) provide an instance of a pathway that is essentially targeted by CsA and FK506 in immunosuppression (8Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 115-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although earlier studies of the immunosuppressive mechanism of CsA and FK506 revealed the CaN-NFAT pathway in activated T cells, some recent evidence has suggested that Cyp18 plays a role in immune response on its own (9Colgan J. Asmal M. Neagu M. Yu B. Schneidkraut J. Lee Y. Sokolskaja E. Andreotti A. Luban J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been reported that the immunosuppressant sanglifehrin A, which is also a potent inhibitor of Cyp18, exerts inhibitory effects on T cell proliferation in a CaN-independent manner (11Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L.H. Youn H.D. Liu J.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34793-34799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). There is no indication that Cyp18 acts as a presenter protein for sanglifehrin A. Apart from its presence in the immune cells, Cyp18 appears to be abundantly expressed in all tissues (2Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and is involved in many physiological processes (14Fischer G. Aumuller T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 148: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For example, it has been demonstrated that human immunodeficiency virus 1 incorporates host Cyp18 into its virion and that Cyp18 is required for the viral life cycle (15Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CsA inhibits the association of Cyp18 with HIV-1 virions in a dose-dependent manner (16Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Therefore, monospecific Cyp18 inhibitors that have no CaN inhibitory potency in their complex forms with Cyp18 and thus avoid the CaN inhibition associated with CsA treatment could facilitate the studies of various cellular functions of Cyp18 (16Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that, for [dimethylaminoethylthiosarcosine3]CsA, the Cyp18-CsA derivative interaction did not lead to CaN inhibition, but the drug derivative potently inhibited CaN on its own (17Baumgrass R. Zhang Y. Erdmann F. Thiel A. Radbruch A. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2470-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, several CsA derivatives have been shown to exhibit diminished immunosuppression, whereas the Cyp18 inhibition by these compounds is similar to that of CsA. Together with the crystal structures of the Cyp18-CsA-CaN complex (18Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), structure-activity relationship studies have demonstrated that the protein binding surface of CsA involves two distinct parts of the molecule (Fig. 1). Modification of residues at positions 9 to 2 (termed the Cyp18 binding domain of CsA) reduces the affinity to Cyp18, whereas CaN inhibition by the Cyp18-CsA derivative complex could be impaired by changing the residues at positions 4–7 (termed the CaN binding domain of CsA). For instance, [N-methyl-Ala6]CsA exhibits a 2-fold decrease in Cyp18 inhibition but a 25-fold decrease in CaN inhibition and a ∼250-fold decrease in immunosuppressive activity (18Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G.

Rich D.H. Kishore V. Rosborough S.L. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. Harding M.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2139-2147PubMed Google Scholar) as compared with CsA. The side chain of Me-Leu6 of CsA makes extensive contacts with CaN (18Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of the isobutyl side chain in the Me-Leu6 residue by a methyl group results in the loss of most contacts, thereby reducing the CaN affinity of the Cyp18-[N-methyl-Ala6]CsA complex. Similarly, Me-Leu4 fits tightly into a hydrophobic pocket of CaN (19Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the Cyp18-CsA-CaN complex. Consequently, [N-methyl-Ile4]CsA (SDZ NIM811) and [N-methyl-Val4]CsA, which lack the stabilizing interaction, have proved to be monospecific Cyp18 inhibitors with only minor effects on CaN activity. However, an inspection of the nature of CsA substitutions resulting in a monospecific Cyp18 inhibitor reveals considerable synthetic effort. Moreover, to design CsA derivatives whose specificity can be regulated in situ (as discussed later), the C–C bond-based side chain branching in positions 4 and 6 of CsA indicates the difficulty of employing simple chemical interventions to achieve switching between the inhibitory types based on the structures of these known monospecific CsA analogues. In cells treated with inhibitors, modulation of the target protein activity would be of considerable value when controlled in timing, location, and amplitude (22Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 755-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Marriott G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the precondition can be achieved by photomodulation, caged CsA derivatives are still lacking. Furthermore, caged CsA derivatives, when properly designed, could principally be used to recover the inhibited cellular CaN phosphatase activity upon photolysis and to differentiate Cyp18 inhibition from the combined Cyp18-CaN effects of CsA, avoiding time-dependent drug partitioning into cells. Such a compound would be expected to allow the rescue of the T cell proliferation after photolysis. Given that most residues within CsA are important for contacting Cyp18 and CaN, modifications that introduce photolabile groups will result in caged compounds with reduced inhibitory efficiency for Cyp18 and CaN, whereas the photolysis (uncaging) would recover the drug inhibition to the enzymes. Apparently, all of the known specificity-determining positions in CsA and their chemical features (as discussed above) are not suitable for making derivatives selective for Cyp18-CaN and Cyp18 in the caged and uncaged form, respectively. Here we present a novel strategy for designing CsA derivatives that provides a new specificity-determining position in CsA and allows for the photochemical interconversion between a CaN inhibitory and a non-inhibitory Cyp18-CsA derivative complex. This approach is based on the hypothesis that some functional groups on the residue 8 of CsA, which flanks the Cyp18 and CaN binding domains of CsA, could interfere with the CaN contacting surface in the Cyp18-CsA derivative complex (18Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The introduction of photolabile 2-nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC) protecting group changes the dissociation constant of Cyp18-CsA derivative-CaN several orders of magnitude, whereas the effect can be reversed upon photolysis. The CsA derivatives with modified residue 8 were synthesized from [d-Ser8]CsA without protecting the hydroxyl of MeBmt1 as reported by Eberle et al. (24Eberle M.K. Hiestand P. Jutzi-Eme A.M. Nininger F. Zihlmann H.R. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1853-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reverse phase-HPLC was applied for monitoring the reactions and for preparative separations. The identities of all derivatives were confirmed with electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. We analyzed the samples with analytic reverse phase-HPLC, and the purities of all CsA derivatives are >95%. Possessing a hydrophilic side chain on residue 8, CsA derivative 9 is more water-soluble than CsA and can be easily separated from its CaN inhibitory precursors during the preparation (purity of > 99%), thus preventing immunosuppression resulting from chemical impurities. For irradiation of CsA derivative 11 with light of 366 nm in situ, a handheld UV lamp (type 2-5062, Dr. Gröbel UV-Elektronik, Ettlingen, Germany) was used. The emission spectrum of the handheld UV lamp shows a narrow band of ∼366 nm without a detectable emission in the UV-C and UV-B ranges (supplemental Fig. S1, available in the on-line version of this article). For irradiation of CsA derivative 11 with light of 366 nm in vitro, a HG-XE lamp (Hamamatsu E7536) equipped with a monochromator (model 101, Photon Technology International) has been used. Because derivative 11 is more hydrophobic than derivative 9, derivative 11 and its photolysis product, derivative 9, possess different retention times on HPLC. The photolysis of derivative 11 has been monitored by using analytic HPLC. The cleavage of the photolabile NVOC group of derivative 11 was complete (> 95%) after 30 min of irradiation at 366 nm, either in ethanol solution or in Jurkat T cell lysate. No byproduct was observed during the photoreaction. The PPIase activity of recombinant human Cyp18 was measured with a protease-coupled assay on a Hewlett-Packard 8452a diode array spectrophotometer according to Fischer et al. (25Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar), with succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide as the substrate and α-chymotrypsin (Merck) as the auxiliary protease in 35 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, at 7 °C. After a 10-min incubation of Cyp18 (2.5 nm) with an inhibitor of the desired concentration, protease and substrate were added. The final substrate concentration was 40 μm. The cis to trans isomerization was monitored at 390 nm. The rate was calculated according to first order reaction. The residual enzymatic activities were plotted versus the inhibitor concentrations and used for calculating the IC50. Materials—Scintiplates coated with streptavidin were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The biotinylated RII peptide (biotin-DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE-OH), a partial sequence of the RII subunit of the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, was synthesized with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid phase peptide synthesis. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was purchased from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). Calmodulin, buffer, and salts were purchased from Sigma. Expression and purification of recombinant human CaN was performed as described (26Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CaN Activity Assay Using RII Phosphopeptide Substrate—The biotinylated RII peptide was phosphorylated by protein kinase A. The reaction mixture containing 700 μm peptide, 100 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and 10 kilounits of protein kinase A in a final volume of 100 μl (in the buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The phosphorylated peptide was separated from [γ-33P]ATP by 1 ml of an RP-C2 cleanup extraction column (Amchro, Sulzbach, Germany). The eluted peptide was lyophilized and reconstituted with deionized water. The scintillation proximity concept was applied for measuring CaN activity using ScintiStrip surfaces coated with streptavidin. Preincubation of calmodulin (50 nm), CaN (1.22 nm), and inhibitors of desired concentrations in the assay buffer (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). Biotinylated RII phosphopeptide was added to a final concentration of 100 nm, and the total assay volume was 100 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 90 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to the ScintiPlates coated with streptavidin. The streptavidin immobilized the biotinylated peptide in the wells. After 20 min at 22 °C, the well was washed once with water, and the biotinylated RII phosphopeptide-associated [33P] was measured in a MicroBeta top counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Cyp18 was fused to the C-terminal end of GST. The fusion protein (25 μm) was incubated with CaN (50 μm) in the presence of Me2SO, CsA, or CsA derivative 9 (25 μm) in 200 μl at 22 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Bound proteins were precipitated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by heating at 90 °C for 10 min after the beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The supernatants after centrifugation were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membrane by a tank blotting procedure and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using polyclonal antibodies specific for CaN or Cyp18. T Cell Proliferation—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester before stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies (2 × 106 cells/ml) in the presence of inhibitors or Me2SO as control in 24-well plates. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and added to a desired final concentration with 0.5% Me2SO in each cell sample. The cells were cultured for 5 days and analyzed directly on proliferating cells by flow cytometry. Intracellular Cytokine Production—PBMCs (2 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated with inhibitors at various concentrations at 37 °C for 10 min in 24-well plates. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and added to desired final concentration with 0.5% Me2SO in each cell sample. PBMCs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin (both Sigma) for 5 h with the addition of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) for the last 3 h of stimulation. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized by washing in PBS supplemented with 0.5% saponin and 1% fetal calf serum, incubated with anti-cytokine phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated antibody, and measured by flow cytometry. Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with the NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) by electroporation (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 20 min, additionally incubated for 30 min with or without light irradiation at 366 nm by the hand-held UV lamp, and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 5 h. After cell lysis, the level of the extracted luciferase from these cells was determined by bioluminescence measurement using the luciferase assay system (Promega). In addition, a β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected as internal standard. Under our conditions, irradiation in the UV-A range does not exhibit significant influence on the transcriptional activity of NFAT. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of AP-1 is also not affected (supplemental Fig. S2, available in the on-line version of this article). The synthesis of CsA derivatives 2–12 was carried out by regioselective modification of the hydroxyl group of d-Ser8 of [d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 1) without protecting the hydroxyl group of MeBmt1 (24Eberle M.K. Hiestand P. Jutzi-Eme A.M. Nininger F. Zihlmann H.R. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1853-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The compounds investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The starting material [d-Ser8]CsA can be obtained from fermentation (28Traber R. Hofmann H. Kobel H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Acidic Modifications—First we investigated the influences of acidic functional groups attached to the d-Ser8 oxygen of [d-Ser8]CsA on both the direct Cyp18 inhibition and the CaN inhibition by the Cyp18-CsA derivative complex. The inhibitory efficacies of the CsA derivatives toward Cyp18 PPIase activity were measured using a protease-coupled assay (29Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, CsA and the four derivatives [O-phosphoryl-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 3), [O-H-phosphoryl-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 4), [O-carboxymethyl-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 6), and [O-(HOOC(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 7) inhibit Cyp18 with very similar IC50 values. Obviously, negative charges at CsA residue 8 do not have a significant influence on the inhibition of Cyp18 PPIase activity.Table IIC50 values of CsA derivatives for inhibition of Cyp18 PPIase activity and Cyp18-CsA derivative complexes for inhibition of CaN phosphatase activity The PPIase activity of Cyp18 was measured in a protease-coupled assay at 7 °C with succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide as the substrate in the presence of an inhibitor at the desired concentrations. The CaN phosphatase activities were measured using a scintillation assay and a 33P-labeled biotinylated RII phosphopeptide as the substrate at 30 °C in the presence of 1.22 nm CaN, 50 nm calmodulin, 10 μm CsA derivative, and Cyp18 at different concentrations.AbbreviationsInhibitorsInhibition of Cyp18 by CsA derivatives (IC50)aS.D. <20 %Inhibition of CaN by Cyp18-CsA derivative complexes(IC50)bS.D. <10 %nmnmCsACyclosporin A3.71001[d-Ser8]CsA2.3402[O-Methyl-d-Ser8]CsA3.91203[O-Phosphoryl-d-Ser8]CsA5.050004[O-H-Phosphoryl-d-Ser8]CsA7.31305[O-(Dimethylphosphoryl)-d-Ser8]CsA2.64506[O-Carboxymethyl d-Ser8]CsA0.92207[O-(HOOC(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA5.02008[O-2-Aminoethoxyethyl-d-Ser8]CsA12.71009[O-(NH2(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA3.2No inhibitionc<5 % inhibition of CaN at 10 μm of Cyp18-derivative 9 complex10[O-(Boc-NH(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA100200011[O-(NVOCNH(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA1033012[O-(Ac-NH(CH2)5NHC(O)CH2)-d-Ser8]CsA8.12000a S.D. <20 %b S.D. <10 %c <5 % inhibition of CaN at 10 μm of Cyp18-derivative 9 complex Open table in a new tab The CaN phosphatase activities toward 33P-labeled biotinylated 19-residue phosphopeptide (RII phosphopeptide) were measured using a scintillation assay (27Baumgrass R. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Liu J.O. Wunderlich D. Grabley S. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47914-47921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The CaN inhibitions by Cyp18-CsA derivative complexes were accessed by addition of 10 μm inhibitor and Cyp18 of desired concentrations. Neither CsA and its position 8-substituted derivatives nor Cyp18 alone produces any detectable inhibition of CaN. Because of the high concentrations of CsA and its derivatives (10 μm) and their high binding affinities to Cyp18 (0.9–100 nm; Table I), the concentrations of the Cyp18-CsA derivative complexes are assumed to be equal to that of Cyp18. CsA and the derivatives 4, 6, and 7 in their complexes with Cyp18 show potent CaN inhibition (Table I). However, the Cyp18-derivative 3 complex inhibits CaN phosphatase activity 50-fold less effectively than the Cyp18-CsA complex. We synthesized an uncharged analogue of [O-phosphoryl-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 3), namely [O-(dimethylphosphoryl)-d-Ser8]CsA (derivative 5), and measured its inhibitory efficiency to demonstrate that this remarkable effect is contributed mainly by the dianionic phosphate moiety. As shown in Table I, derivative 5 possesses potent Cyp18 inhibition like derivative 3, whereas the complex of Cyp18-derivative 5 exhibits 10-fold higher potency in CaN inhibition than the Cyp18-derivative 3 complex. Basic Modifications—The consequences of incorporating free amino groups on flexible tethers of variable length in position 8 were assessed with derivatives 8 and 9. As compared with CsA, the Cyp18 inhibition by derivatives 8 and 9 demonstrates only a small change in IC50 values (Table I and Fig. 2A), whereas CaN inhibition shows an abrupt deterioration associated with the long side chain in derivative 9. Whereas the Cyp18-derivative 8 complex inhibits CaN phosphatase activity as potently as the Cyp18-CsA complex (Table I), the Cyp18-derivative 9 complex is inactive, showing <5% CaN inhibition at a Cyp18 concentration as high as 10 μm (Table I and Fig. 2A). Coprecipitation experiments of CaN with GST-Cyp18 in the presence of derivative 9, using CsA as a positive control, have been performed. CaN could only be coprecipitated together with GST-Cyp18 by glutathione-Sepharose in the presence of CsA, but not in the presence of derivative 9 or the CsA derivative-free control (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that not only the functional but also the physical interactions of Cyp18-derivative 9 with CaN are much weaker than that of Cyp18-CsA with CaN. To demonstrate that the dramatic impairment observed in CaN inhibition assay is caused mainly by the electrostatic effect involving the protonated amino group on the residue 8 of derivative 9 (Fig. 3), we tested the Cyp18 inhibitory efficiencies of derivatives 7 and 12 and the CaN inhibition by the Cyp18-derivative 7 and Cyp18-derivative 12 complexes (Fig. 1 and Table I). Instead of the amino group in derivative 9, derivative 7 has a carboxyl group at the end of the side chain, and derivative 12 possesses an acetyl-protected amino group. Like CsA, both derivative 7 and derivative 12 are potent inhibitors of Cyp. Furthermore, both the Cyp18-derivative 7 complex and the Cyp18-derivative 12 complex display potent CaN inhibition, as compared with the Cyp18-derivative 9 complex. Thus, neither a neutral nor an acidic functional group affects the Cyp18-CsA-CaN tertiary complex formation significantly. Similarly, with a photoremovable protecting group, NVOC, on the amino group of derivative 9 at residue 8, derivative 11 exhibits high Cyp18 inhibitory efficiency with an IC50 value of 10 nm,as well as potent CaN inhibition by the Cyp18-derivative 11 complex with an IC50 value of 330 nm. We investigated the immunosuppressive effect of derivative 9 on the proliferation of human T cells. Isolated PBMCs were labeled with 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl ester and stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3-CD28, allowing the cytometric discrimination and determination of cell numbers in the individual generation of proliferating cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, CsA, but neither derivative 9 nor the Me2SO control inhibits the cell proliferation. Similar results could be obtained using sorted CD4+ and CD8+ cells (data not shown). It is well established that CsA inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of a family of early activation genes, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. To investigate whether derivative 9 has any effects on cyt"
https://openalex.org/W1980185464,"Signals transduced by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) play a central role in regulating the functional response of the cell to antigen. Depending on the nature of the antigenic signal and the developmental or differentiation state of the B cell, antigen receptor signaling can promote either apoptosis or survival and activation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BCR-mediated apoptosis constitutes an important area of research because aberrations in programmed cell death can result in the development of autoimmunity or cancer. Expression of the adaptor protein hematopoietic Src homology 2 (HSH2) was found to significantly decrease BCR-mediated apoptosis in the murine WEHI-231 cell line. Analysis of signal transduction pathways activated in response to BCR ligation revealed that HSH2 does not significantly alter total protein tyrosine phosphorylation or Ca2+ mobilization. HSH2 does not potentiate the activation-dependent phosphorylation of AKT either. With respect to MAPK activation, HSH2 was not observed to alter the activation of ERK or p38 in response to BCR ligation, but it does significantly potentiate JNK activation. Analysis of processes directly associated with apoptosis revealed that HSH2 inhibits mitochondrial depolarization to a significant degree, whereas it has only a slight effect on caspase activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. BCR-induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells is associated with the loss of endogenous HSH2 expression within 12 h, whereas inhibition of apoptosis in response to CD40-mediated signaling leads to stabilization of HSH2 expression. Thus, endogenous HSH2 expression correlates directly with survival of WEHI-231 cells, which supports the hypothesis that HSH2 modulates the apoptotic response through its ability to directly or indirectly promote mitochondrial stability. Signals transduced by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) play a central role in regulating the functional response of the cell to antigen. Depending on the nature of the antigenic signal and the developmental or differentiation state of the B cell, antigen receptor signaling can promote either apoptosis or survival and activation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BCR-mediated apoptosis constitutes an important area of research because aberrations in programmed cell death can result in the development of autoimmunity or cancer. Expression of the adaptor protein hematopoietic Src homology 2 (HSH2) was found to significantly decrease BCR-mediated apoptosis in the murine WEHI-231 cell line. Analysis of signal transduction pathways activated in response to BCR ligation revealed that HSH2 does not significantly alter total protein tyrosine phosphorylation or Ca2+ mobilization. HSH2 does not potentiate the activation-dependent phosphorylation of AKT either. With respect to MAPK activation, HSH2 was not observed to alter the activation of ERK or p38 in response to BCR ligation, but it does significantly potentiate JNK activation. Analysis of processes directly associated with apoptosis revealed that HSH2 inhibits mitochondrial depolarization to a significant degree, whereas it has only a slight effect on caspase activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. BCR-induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells is associated with the loss of endogenous HSH2 expression within 12 h, whereas inhibition of apoptosis in response to CD40-mediated signaling leads to stabilization of HSH2 expression. Thus, endogenous HSH2 expression correlates directly with survival of WEHI-231 cells, which supports the hypothesis that HSH2 modulates the apoptotic response through its ability to directly or indirectly promote mitochondrial stability. Normal B lymphocyte homeostasis and immune function are critically dependent on regulatory pathways that control programmed cell death (apoptosis) (1Strasser A. Bouillet P. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Sohn S.J. Rajpal A. Winoto A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Rathmell J.C.

Aberrant function of apoptotic pathways can lead to numerous life-threatening problems including the development of immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or cancer. Therefore, it is essential to develop a complete understanding of the pathways that control apoptosis of B lymphocytes.

Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar). Because BCR-mediated signal transduction plays a central role in regulating B lymphocyte apoptosis, understanding the molecular mechanism by which it does so constitutes an important area of investigation with a high degree of relevance for understanding numerous immunologic disease processes. Nevertheless, significant questions remain concerning the molecular linkage between antigen receptor signaling and apoptosis. Ligation of the BCR leads to the activation of several distinct yet interacting signal transduction pathways that ultimately control the functional response of the cell (4Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 5Gold M.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin.

The initiation of signal transduction via the BCR involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate downstream effector proteins, leading to activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and the production of second messengers that promote protein kinase C- and Ca2+-dependent signal transduction processes. Additionally, BCR ligation leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the downstream serine/threonine kinase AKT, which can promote survival of the cell (8Astoul E. Watton S.

Finally, signaling through the BCR has been shown to regulate the function of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (4Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 11Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These distinct pathways in turn promote activation of numerous transcriptional regulatory proteins including NFAT, NF-κB, and the AP-1 complex that act in concert to regulate gene transcription and the functional response of the B cell (4Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 11Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). How BCR-mediated signaling ultimately determines the fate of the cell in terms of whether it proliferates or undergoes apoptosis is in part due to inherent differences in the strength of the antigenic signal, which in turn can affect the activation of pro-survival effector proteins (4Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar). However, additional factors including developmental differences in partitioning of BCR-associated signaling components (12Chung J.B.

A growing body of literature has begun to delineate the key role that adaptor proteins play in modulating signal transduction via lymphocyte antigen receptors. Adaptor proteins have the ability to quantitatively and/or qualitatively change the nature of antigen receptor signaling by generating diverse multimolecular signaling complexes in unique spatial/temporal contexts (16Leo A. Schaven B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Kelly M.E. Chan A.C. Curr. Opin.

In the B cell, studies have shown that BLNK (SLP-65) is involved in coupling BCR proximal protein tyrosine kinases to PLCγ, thereby promoting its activation, as well as recruiting and promoting activation of Vav and Nck (19Fu C.

Recently, Bam32 has been shown to regulate the activation of the MAPKs ERK and JNK through a novel pathway that involves its interaction with HPK1 (22Marshall A.J. Niiro H. Lerner C.G. Yun T.J.

Similarly, GRPL/Gads and NTAL/LAB are thought to regulate MAPK activation through their respective association with HPK1 and Grb2 (25Yankee T.M. Solow S.A. Draves K.D. Clark E.A. J.

Importantly, evidence suggests that the expression of specific adaptor proteins may vary with the developmental or differentiation stage of the B cell, thereby increasing their potential for differentially regulating BCR signaling (4Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar). In the current study, we have examined the biochemical and functional role of the hematopoietic Src homology 2 (HSH2) adaptor protein using the WEHI-231 B lymphoma cell line. HSH2 is expressed predominantly in cells of the lymphoid lineage but can be detected in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage as well (28Oda T. Muramatsu M. Isogai T. Masuho Y. Asano S. Yamashita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 288: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HSH2 contains a single SH2 domain, three conserved proline-rich regions and two tyrosine residues that are potential sites of phosphorylation. Expression of HSH2 in the WEHI-231 B cell line was found to protect these cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to BCR ligation. Although HSH2 was not observed to cause global changes in BCR-mediated signal transduction, it did potentiate JNK activation. Moreover, HSH2 was observed to prevent mitochondrial destabilization, whereas it exerted only a modest effect on caspase activation. A key finding is that the endogenous level of HSH2 was observed to decrease in response to pro-apoptotic BCR signaling, whereas it was maintained by anti-apoptotic CD40-mediated signaling. These findings support the conclusion that HSH2 has the ability to modulate the apoptotic response to signals delivered through the BCR complex. Cells and Cell Culture—WEHI-231 murine B lymphoma cells and Phoenix gp retroviral packaging cells (provided by Gary Nolan, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 μm l-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercapto-ethanol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin-penicillin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Antibodies—WEHI-231 cells were stimulated with polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgM (F(ab′)2) Ab purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). For Western blot analysis, the following antibodies were purchased: mouse anti-FLAG mAb conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma); anti-phosphotyrosine mAb conjugated to HRP (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA); mouse anti-Bcl-xL mAb, and mouse anti-Caspase-7 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA); mouse anti-actin mAb (AC-40; Sigma); rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK (197G2, Thr-0202/Tyr-204), anti-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK (98F2, Thr-183/Tyr-185), anti-JNK, anti-phospho-p38 (3D7, Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-p38, anti-phospho-AKT (244F9, Thr-308; 193H12, Ser-473), anti-AKT, anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-9, and anti-poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) Abs (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The hybridoma producing anti-CD40 mAb (1C10) was obtained from Dr. Frances Lund at the Trudeau Institute (Saranac Lake, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HSH2 Ab was generated by immunizing rabbits with intact recombinant HSH2. Plasmids—The cDNA encoding full-length HSH2 and Bcl-xL were PCR-amplified from total murine splenocyte cDNA using KOD high fidelity polymerase from Novagen (Madison, WI). For HSH2, a BglII site was included in the forward primer (5′-GAGAAGATCTCCGCCATGGCAGAAGCC-3′), and a FLAG tag and HpaI site were included in the reverse primer (5′-GAGAGTTAACTCACTTGTCATCGTC-3′). The HSH2 PCR product was digested with BglII and HpaI restriction enzymes and then ligated into the BglII and HpaI sites of the pMSCV-puro vector from Clontech. For Bcl-xL, an XhoI site was included in the forward primer (5′-GAGACTCGAGCCGCCATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGG-3′), and an EcoRI site was incorporated into the reverse primer (5′-GAGAGAATTCTCACTTCCGACTGAAGAG-3′). The Bcl-xL PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pMSCV-puro. Transfection and Transduction—HSH2:pMSCV-puro, Bcl-xL:pMSCV-puro, or empty pMSCV-puro plasmids were co-transfected with the pCL-ECO plasmid encoding the ecotropic receptor envelope into Phoenix gp retroviral packaging cells using Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Virus-containing supernatant was collected from transfectants 36 h after transfection. The viral supernatant was incubated with WEHI-231 cells for 12 h in the presence of polybrene (2.5 μg/ml). After transduction, cells were incubated with (1.5 μg/ml) puromycin (Mediatek, Inc., Herndon, VA) for 48 h to select against nontransduced cells. DNA Content Analysis—WEHI-231 cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab for up to 48 h. After stimulation, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed with a solution containing 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove nucleotide fragments. Following the wash step, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Events with sub-G0/G1 DNA content were scored as apoptotic. Annexin V Staining of Cell Surface Phosphatidylserine—WEHI-231 cells (1 × 105/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab for up to 48 h. After stimulation, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin-binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated with 5 μl of annexin V (ANV) conjugated with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and PI (50 μg/ml) (30Wilkins R.C. Kutzner B.C. Truong M. Sanchez-Dardon J. McLean J.R. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated protected from light at room temperature for 15 min and then immediately analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Two-color ANV/PI staining was analyzed to discriminate between three distinct populations of cells. Cells that were ANV–,PI– were scored as viable cells, ANV+,PIlo cells were scored as early apoptotic cells, and ANV+,PIhi cells were scored as late apoptotic or necrotic as the assay could not differentiate between the two possibilities. Western Blot Analysis—WEHI-231 cells (2 × 107 cells/sample) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab in the presence or absence of anti-CD40 mAb (1C10, 1.5 μg/ml) for the time points indicated. After stimulation, cells were immediately washed in ice-cold PBS to stop the reaction. Next, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added to the lysis buffer just before use. Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h on ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Detergent-soluble lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 3% nonfat milk (or TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin for 4G10 blotting) overnight at 4 °C and then washed four times with TBST. Next, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then washed four times with TBST. For primary antibodies not directly conjugated to HRP, secondary goat anti-mouse Ig or goat antirabbit Ig Abs conjugated to HRP (BIOSOURCE International) were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature and then washed four times with TBST. Finally, proteins of interest were visualized using ECL West-Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and subsequent exposure to autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For Western blot analysis of caspase cleavage, WEHI-231 cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab for up to 48 h in 10 ml of normal culture medium. After stimulation, cells were pelleted and lysed in 0.1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture, which were added just before use. The lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The total protein content of the detergent-soluble lysate was quantitated using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal quantities of protein for each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blotting procedures were carried out as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—WEHI-231 cells (2 × 107/sample) were washed with PBS following stimulation and then resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were incubated in homogenization buffer on ice for 15 min to allow cells to swell and then lysed with 20 passages through a 28-gauge syringe. Lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed and used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The heavy membrane pellet was resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and is designated the mitochondrial fraction. The BCA assay (Pierce) was used to quantitate total protein content of the fractions for equal loading on SDS-PAGE gels. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Apaf-1 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and mouse monoclonal anti-Hsp60 (Pharmingen) Abs were used to validate the purity of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization (ΔΨm)—WEHI-231 cells (1 × 105/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab for up to 48 h. At the end of the stimulation time course, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide (DiOC6) (Molecular Probes) was added directly to the cell culture to a final concentration of 40 nm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.2 ml of RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum and 40 nm DiOC6 and kept on ice until analyzed by flow cytometry. HSH2 Protects WEHI-231 Cells from Undergoing BCR-induced Apoptosis—Oda et al. (28Oda T. Muramatsu M. Isogai T. Masuho Y. Asano S. Yamashita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 288: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) first identified human HSH2 after searching existing databases for genes that encode proteins with regions homologous to SH2 domains. The hsh2 gene encodes a 352-amino-acid protein with expression of transcripts restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including B and T lymphocytes. Based on a search of expressed sequence tag databases using the BLAST algorithm, we identified the mouse and rat homologues of human HSH2 consisting of 334 and 335 amino acids, respectively. Recently, another group has cloned the mouse homologue of HSH2 referred to as ALX (29Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Primary amino acid sequence analysis of mouse HSH2 revealed an N-terminal SH2 domain and three conserved PXXP motifs that are likely to facilitate protein-protein interactions; however, no domains associated with catalytic activity were detected. Based on this sequence analysis, it was logical to hypothesize that HSH2 functions as an adaptor protein. Moreover, the expression of HSH2 in lymphocytes raised the possibility that it might function as a regulator of antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction. To determine whether HSH2 is capable of regulating antigen receptor signal transduction, the WEHI-231 B lymphoma cell line was chosen. Cross-linking of membrane IgM on WEHI-231 cells results in growth arrest and the induction of apoptosis (31Wu M. Yang W. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. FitzGerald M.J. Lee H. Sonenshein G.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar, 32Benhamou L.E. Cazenave P.A. Sarthou P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1405-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 33Page D.M. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of this functional response, WEHI-231 cells have been used extensively as a model for immature B cell negative selection. Additionally, stimulation of WEHI-231 cells through the BCR initiates a tyrosine phosphorylation-based signaling cascade, which makes them a useful model for studying BCR-mediated signal transduction. Finally, WEHI-231 cells can be efficiently transduced by retroviruses, thus facilitating their genetic manipulation (34Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell. Sci. 1999; 21: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We utilized these properties of WEHI-231 cells to examine the functional and biochemical consequences of HSH2 expression on antigen receptor signaling following surface immunoglobulin M cross-linking. Retrovirus encoding full-length FLAG-tagged HSH2, Bcl-xL, and the empty pMSCV-puro vector were used to transduce WEHI-231 cells to express these proteins. Bcl-xL overexpression was used as a control for the apoptosis assays that follow because it has been demonstrated to function as a potent inhibitor of antigen receptor-induced apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells (35Merino R. Grillot D.A. Simonian P.L. Muthukkumar S. Fanslow W.C. Bondada S. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3830-3838PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wiesner D.A. Kilkus J.P. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding empty pMSCV-puro to control for any effects that retroviral transduction might have on WEHI-231 function. After transduction, nontransduced cells were eliminated using puromycin drug selection. Even before drug selection, transduction efficiencies of 70–80% were achieved as determined by the percentage of enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive WEHI-231 cells after transduction with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing retrovirus (data not shown). As expected, HSH2 was detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG mAb only in HSH2-transduced WEHI-231 cells. Similarly, Bcl-xL expression could only be detected by Western blotting with anti-Bcl-xL mAb in WEHI-231 cells transduced with retrovirus encoding Bcl-xL (data not shown). The extent of apoptosis initiated by antigen receptor cross-linking can be quantitated based on the analysis of DNA content. The induction of apoptosis results in activation of nucleases that cleave the genome of apoptotic cells into nucleotide fragments. Cells undergoing apoptosis will therefore have less total DNA than nonapoptotic cells. Using a dye that quantitatively binds DNA, such as PI, these populations can be discriminated. To determine whether HSH2 expression alters the apoptotic response of WEHI-231 cells to stimulation through the BCR, cells expressing empty vector, HSH2, or Bcl-xL were stimulated with polyclonal anti-IgM F(ab′)2 Ab. Cells were then assayed for the induction of apoptosis based on PI staining (Fig. 1A). As expected, ∼70% of the WEHI-231 cells transduced with empty vector had undergone apoptosis by the 48-h time point. Also, as expected, WEHI-231 cells expressing Bcl-xL were almost completely resistant to BCR-induced apoptosis with only 10% of the population containing sub-G0/G1 levels of DNA. In contrast to control WEHI-231 cells, only 37% of HSH2-expressing WEHI-231 cells contained sub-G0/G1 levels of DNA at the 48-h time point. Indeed, at both the 24- and 48-h time points, approximately half of the number of HSH2-expressing cells had undergone apoptosis when compared with control cells transduced with empty vector. The results of these initial experiments suggest that HSH2 expression is capable of inhibiting apoptosis initiated in response to stimulation of cells through the BCR. To confirm that HSH2 is capable of inhibiting apoptosis initiated by antigen receptor cross-linking, WEHI-231 cells transduced with empty vector, HSH2, or Bcl-xL were stimulated"

To test the proposed ligation of the tetranuclear iron-sulfur cluster N5 of respiratory chain complex I, we replaced the conserved histidine 129 in the 75-kDa subunit from Yarrowia lipolytica with alanine. In the mutant strain, reduced amounts of fully assembled but destabilized complex I could be detected. Deamino-NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity was abolished completely by the mutation. However, EPR spectroscopic analysis of mutant complex I exhibited an unchanged cluster N5 signal, excluding histidine 129 as a cluster N5 ligand.

Respiratory chain complex I links the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone to the translocation of four protons across the respiratory membrane (1Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dro ̈se S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Only low resolution structures of complex I are available, demonstrating that the mitochondrial enzyme is L-shaped and consists of a membrane arm and a peripheral arm (2Guenebaut V. Schlitt A.

Acta. 2000; 1459: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism is largely unknown. Electrons from NADH are first transferred to FMN, non-covalently bound to the 51-kDa subunit, then to a series of iron-sulfur clusters in the peripheral arm, and finally to the ubiquinone reduction site which, as has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis in the obligate aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, is partly contained in the 49-kDa subunit of the peripheral arm (5Kashani-Poor N.

Localization by electron microscopic single particle analysis of two anti-49-kDa subunit monoclonal antibody epitopes has provided evidence that this catalytic core of complex I is located ∼70–80 Å away from the phospholipid bilayer (6Zickermann V.

From these and other results, an indirect coupling mechanism between quinone reduction in the peripheral arm and proton pumping in the membrane arm seems likely (1Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dro ̈se S.

Two EPR-silent [Fe4S4] clusters, termed N6a and N6b, have been assigned to the ferredoxin-like subunit of Neurospora crassa complex I homologous to bovine TYKY (10Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The tetranuclear iron-sulfur cluster N5 is only observed at very low temperatures and high microwave power. After its initial discovery in pigeon heart complex I (11Ohnishi T. Salerno J.C.

In Y. lipolytica, cluster N5 shows very fast spin relaxation with a half-saturation parameter of ∼180 milliwatts at 5 K. The line width of the gz signal (Lz) is in the range of 2.5–3 millitesla. Similar to observations in other model systems, the spin concentration of cluster N5 is much lower than that of the other EPR-detectable clusters (13Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the 75-kDa subunit contains three highly conserved iron-sulfur cluster motifs and is homologous to the N-terminal portion of iron-only hydrogenases (15Smith M.A. Finel M. Korolik V. Mendz G.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of the iron-only hydrogenase from CpI of Clostridium pasteurianum, these motifs ligate one [Fe2S2] and two [Fe4S4] iron-sulfur clusters (16Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, direct evidence for the presence of three iron-sulfur clusters in the heterologously expressed 75-kDa subunit from Paracoccus denitrificans has been presented (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the same study, the fast relaxing [Fe4S4] cluster N5 has been assigned to the second binding motif of the 75-kDa subunit, an unusual HXXXCXXCXXXXXC motif that contains three cysteines and a histidine. Secondary structure predictions using the PROF algorithm (26Ouali M. King R.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1162-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) suggest that this sequence element, both in hydrogenases and complex I from various organisms, forms a loop bounded by α-helices (Fig. 1). To test the proposed assignment of this sequence as a cluster N5 ligation motif in fully assembled complex I, we mutated the conserved histidine 129 of the Y. lipolytica 75-kDa subunit to alanine. The Y. lipolytica deletion strain nuamΔ (ura3–302, leu2-270, lys11-23, nuam::URA3, NUGM-Htg2, NDH2i, MatB), in which a 1.7-kb ClaI/KpnI fragment corresponding to codons 34–598 of the NUAM gene encoding the 728-amino acid precursor of the 75-kDa subunit of complex I is replaced with the Y. lipolytica URA3 gene (1.6 kb) oriented in opposite direction to the original NUAM open reading frame, was constructed by the double homologous recombination strategy published previously (18Kerscher S. Dro ̈se S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A wild type and a PCR-generated H129A mutant version of the NUAM gene were then subcloned as 5.2-kb SalI fragments (after an internal SalI site in the NUAM open reading frame had been mutagenized to GTTGAC) into the replicative plasmid pUB4 (19Kerscher S. Eschemann A. Okun P.M. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3915-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed into strain nuamΔ, resulting in the strains nuamΔ, pNUAM-wild type (parental) and nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A (mutant). The presence of the point mutation in large scale cultures of strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A was verified by the isolation of total DNA from 5-ml aliquots and the direct sequencing of PCR products. Complex I catalytic activities in Y. lipolytica mitochondrial membranes were measured as deamino-NADH:n-decylubiquinone (DBQ) or NADH:HAR catalytic rates as described (20Kerscher S. Be ́nit P. Abdrakhmanova A. Zwicker K. Rais I. Karas M. Rustin P. Brandt U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3588-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A BN-PAGE (21Scha ̈gger H. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Scha ̈gger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 105-130Crossref Google Scholar) of mitochondrial membranes was performed using 4–16% gradient gels. A His-tagged complex I was isolated by the extraction of mitochondrial membranes with dodecyl maltoside followed by Ni2+ affinity and size exclusion chromatography as published previously (22Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Low temperature EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium continuous flow cryostat, ESR 900, from Oxford instruments. 150-μl samples were reduced with 1 mm NADH. As a qualitative test for complex I assembly, mitochondrial membranes from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A were analyzed by BN-PAGE. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a fully assembled enzyme appeared to be present in the mutant strain, but the intensities of all subunit bands were strongly reduced compared with those in the parental strain. In contrast, electron transfer from NADH to the artificial acceptor HAR (23Gavrikova E.V. Grivennikova V.G. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was only slightly reduced in mitochondrial membranes from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A and still amounted to 74% of the parental strain value (Table I). This result could be explained by the presence of subcomplexes in the membranes from this mutant; because FMN bound to the 51-kDa subunit is sufficient to catalyze the non-physiological reaction, subcomplexes containing this subunit can show NADH:HAR activity. These subcomplexes may have escaped detection by BN-PAGE because of their instability. At any rate, it was clear that the H129A mutation had markedly reduced complex I stability. It should be noted that significant residual NADH:HAR activity was also found in the nuamΔ strain carrying the empty plasmid pUB4 (Table I), although no assembled complex I was detectable by BN-PAGE in this strain (not shown). We also mutated several cysteines in all three iron-sulfur binding motifs of the 75-kDa subunit to alanines, but in all cases we failed to detect complex I assembly or NADH:HAR activity above the level observed in strain nuamΔ, pUB4 (data not shown).Table INADH:HAR and dNADH:DBQ activities of mitochondrial membranesStrainNADH:HAR activitydNADH:DBQ activityμmol min-1 mg-1Percent of activityμmol min-1 mg-1Percent of activityNuamΔ,pNUAM-WT0.841000.290100NuamΔ,pNUAM-H129A0.6274<0.01<3NuamΔ,pUB40.2833<0.01<3 Open table in a new tab Specific deamino-NADH:n-decylubiquinone activity of membranes from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A was below detection level. This finding demonstrated that even the fully assembled fraction of complex I (Fig. 2) in the mitochondrial membranes lacked ubiquinone reductase activity. The mutant strain exhibited very low growth yields in complete media (14 g/liter wet weight, i.e. 4–6 times less than that commonly observed for the parental strain). This result is remarkable, as strain nuamΔ, which lacked most of the open reading frame for the 75-kDa subunit, grew normally. The reason for this growth phenotype is unknown. Complex I from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A was purified by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography (22Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes equivalent to 4.5 grams of total protein were used for a complex I preparation, which gave 1.5 mg of purified enzyme. This was <10% of the yield typically obtained from the parental strain, suggesting that a considerable portion of assembled complex I had dissociated during the purification procedure. This finding supports the notion that the mutation H129A had destabilized complex I. EPR spectroscopy was performed with complex I from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A and from the parental strain. At a temperature of 40 K and a microwave power of 1 milliwatt, a single binuclear cluster called N1 could be detected (Fig. 3A). At a temperature of 12 K and a microwave power of 1 milliwatt, signals arising from clusters N1, N2, N3, and N4 could be seen (Fig. 3B). Cluster N5 signals were detected at 5 K and a microwave power of 100 milliwatts (Fig. 3C). Confirming previously published results (13Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the g values of cluster N5 from wild-type Y. lipolytica complex I were gz,y,x = 2.062, 1.93, and ∼1.89. The gx and gy signals of cluster N5 were difficult to assign, because they overlapped with the gx and gy signals of clusters N1 and even more with N4. Interference by the N4 signal also was much more severe, as this cluster was not completely power saturated under the EPR conditions used. However, the gz signal of cluster N5 was clearly separated from any other EPR signal in isolated complex I from Y. lipolytica. The spectra shown in Fig. 3C clearly show that the cluster N5 gz signals of both preparations were virtually identical in terms of peak intensity, peak width, and field position (Fig. 3C). This result indicated that cluster N5 was still present in complex I from strain nuamΔ, pNUAM-H129A and that its geometry was unaffected. Virtually identical results were obtained in two independent preparations of the mutant enzyme. We have replaced a strictly conserved histidine residue (His-129) in the 75-kDa subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I with alanine to test whether this residue is a ligand of iron-sulfur cluster N5, as has been proposed recently (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As the EPR signature of cluster N5 was completely unchanged in complex I purified from the mutant strain, we could exclude this possibility. Our results are in contradiction with a recent study with a heterologously expressed 75-kDa subunit from P. denitrificans (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). From changes in the EPR spectrum of the iron-sulfur cluster N5 that were caused by a mutation changing the corresponding histidine to a cysteine, the authors concluded that the HXXXCXXCXXXXXC motif of the 75-kDa subunit binds cluster N5. The most obvious explanation for the results obtained with the P. denitrificans H106C mutant would be that structural changes had indirectly changed the geometry of cluster N5. Such EPR signal reduction, peak broadening, and shifting effects have been described, e.g. for point mutations affecting amino acids in the vicinity of cluster N2 of complex I from Y. lipolytica (5Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24082-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and can be expected to be more pronounced when single subunits instead of completely assembled multi-subunit complexes are studied. In fact, significant instability of the mutant P. dentrificans 75-kDa subunit was noted (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although we also observed destabilization of Y. lipolytica complex I by the H129A mutation, it obviously did not affect the EPR spectra of the purified enzyme. A more fundamental problem with complex I from P. denitrificans is that the g signal values of cluster N5, detected at 5 K, are very close to those of cluster N4, detected at 12 K (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Distinction between these clusters relies on the assumption that the cluster N4 signals of P. denitrificans complex I are completely power saturated at 5 K and a microwave power of 100 milliwatt, which in our hands is clearly not the case for cluster N4 of Bos taurus and Y. lipolytica complex I. Therefore, although at least the gz signals of clusters N4 and N5 are well separated in the latter two model organisms, the assignment of EPR signals to cluster N5 of P. denitrificans complex I is more difficult. It should be noted that the cluster N4 EPR signals were also found to be somewhat affected by the H106C mutation in P. denitrificans complex I (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, there is another possibility in regard to how the findings in P. denitrificans and Y. lipolytica could be reconciled. If the iron-sulfur cluster assignment within the 75-kDa subunit was revised, the mutation of the conserved histidine in Y. lipolytica may have resulted in the removal of a cluster N1b ligand, leaving the EPR signature of cluster N5 unchanged. The histidine to cysteine exchange in P. denitrificans as such may then have been EPR-silent, but it may have caused a structural alteration that affected the EPR patterns of both clusters N4 and N5. However, because the study by Yano et al. (17Yano T. Sklar J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrates the presence of three iron-sulfur clusters in the heterologously expressed 75-kDa subunit of P. denitrificans, this proposal raises another problem. If all three motifs in the 75-kDa hold an iron-sulfur cluster, why did the H129A mutation not have any effect on the EPR spectra of Y. lipolytica complex I? Possible answers are that cluster N1b is either not present or undetectable by standard EPR spectroscopy in complex I from Y. lipolytica. Although complex I from bovine heart mitochondria and various other sources is known to contain two EPR detectable binuclear iron-sulfur clusters called N1a and N1b (9Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), only one binuclear iron-sulfur cluster (called N1) could be detected in complex I from Y. lipolytica to date. The stoichiometry of clusters N1/N2/N3/N4 was determined as 1:1: 1:1 (13Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As the N1 signal of Y. lipolytica complex I was not detectable in a subcomplex 2V. Zickermann, K. Zwicker, M. Bostina, M. Radermacher, and U. Brandt, manuscript in preparation. including the 75-kDa but lacking the 24-kDa subunit, which in bovine heart complex I contains binuclear cluster N1a, it seems tempting to speculate that also in the Y. lipolytica enzyme the 75-kDa subunit may carry a second binuclear cluster that has, to date, escaped detection by EPR. If the HXXXCXXCXXXXXC motif ligated this EPR silent cluster, it would have been removed by the H129A mutation, offering a straightforward explanation of why ubiquinone reductase activity was lost. As a consequence, one has to conclude that in complex I the use of the iron-sulfur binding motifs has changed from iron-only hydrogenases. Either the histidine in question that is conserved in all known complex I sequences has acquired a different function in complex I, or the motif ligating a binuclear cluster in hydrogenase binds a tetranuclear cluster (N5) in complex I and vice versa.

In the presence of the virus-encoded protease, the Gag precursor is cleaved as the immature virion buds, generating three products: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC), which refold and organize spatially to form an infectious mature virion. The CA protein condenses around the NC·RNA complex at the center of the virion to form a core structure within a shell composed of MA proteins. Whereas the noninfectious immature particles of all retroviruses are generally spherical, the mature infectious particles are morphologically distinct and are characterized by the shape of the CA core structure. The mature virion is conical for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses and spherical or irregularly polyhedral for human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and other members of the retrovirus group, including Rous sarcoma virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus. The morphology of the core and viral infectivity are closely correlated; mutations that result in loss of the characteristic core structure also result in loss of infectivity (2von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L.

The CA protein that forms the core consists of two independently folded domains joined by a flexible linker peptide (4Gitti R.K. Lee B.M. Walker J. Summers M.F. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I.

Mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HIV-1 impair CA protein assembly to a significantly lesser extent, but the assembled particles are noninfectious (3von Schwedler U.K. Stray K.M.

In contrast, mutations in the C-terminal domain of the HTLV-1 CA protein had little effect on viral particle assembly and release, whereas mutations throughout the NTD of the protein had much greater impact (15Rayne F. Bouamr F. Lalanne J. Mamoun R.Z. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NTD insertion mutations completely blocked particle release of assembled particles; NTD substitution mutations reduced release of mature particles by 5–50%. In particular, a substitution in helix 3 (Asp54-Leu55 to Arg-Ser) produced a 10-fold greater defect than substitutions elsewhere in the NTD and blocked particle assembly almost completely (15Rayne F. Bouamr F. Lalanne J. Mamoun R.Z. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the NTD and C-terminal domain in the HIV-1 and HTLV-1 CA proteins do not function in the same manner. The N-terminal residues of the HTLV-1 (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), HIV-1 (4Gitti R.K. Lee B.M. Walker J. Summers M.F. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I. Science. 1996; 273: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and Rous sarcoma virus (6Kingston R.L. Fitzon-Ostendorp T. Eisenmesser E.Z. Schatz G.W. Vogt V.M. Post C.B. Rossmann M.G. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar) CA proteins form a β-hairpin structure. It has been proposed that upon proteolysis from the Gag precursor, the liberated amino-terminal end of the CA protein refolds into a β-hairpin structure that is stabilized by the formation of a salt bridge between the highly conserved Pro1 and an Asp/Glu residue from helix 3. The refolded amino terminus is hypothesized to create a new CA-CA interface that is essential for building the condensed conical core that will initiate replication in the next round of infection (2von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1555-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The fact that the spumavirus subgroup lacks the conserved Pro and Asp residues and does not undergo proteolytic maturation supports the hypothesis that the sequence conservation is linked to the refolding function and core assembly. Interestingly, a 2-amino acid insertion next to the conserved Asp54–Leu55 residues in helix 3 of the HTLV-1 CA protein significantly reduced formation of viral particles (15Rayne F. Bouamr F. Lalanne J. Mamoun R.Z. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, an insertion next to the conserved Asp51–Leu52 residues in the NTD of the HIV-1 CA protein had no detectable effect on viral particle formation (13Reicin A.S. Paik S. Berkowitz R.D. Luban J. Lowy I. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 642-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This difference suggests that structurally equivalent regions can form functionally distinct assembly interfaces during capsid assembly, despite conservation of the secondary and tertiary structures. However, it seems unlikely that the insertion perturbed the β-hairpin structure, since a point mutation in the HIV-1 CA helix 3 contact residue, Asp51 to Ala, reduced viral particle assembly to ∼20–100% of WT efficiency, reduced viral infectivity correspondingly, and blocked formation of the typical cone-shaped core structure (2von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1555-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The fact that much of the Gag precursor incorporated into the viral particles was processed aberrantly to truncated CA protein suggests that the mutation exposed the N terminus to inappropriate proteolysis and possibly accounts for the reduced assembly efficiency. These several observations suggest that the outcome of perturbing the CA protein assembly process can be significantly different for HTLV-1 and HIV-1. Our previous studies (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicated that, although the β-hairpins of both CAs make contact with the helical core through the conserved salt bridge, they adopt significantly different orientations relative to it. Subsequent NMR transverse relaxation T1ρ and steady-state hetero-nuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements (16Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Carter C. Tjandra N. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) also showed the rigidity of this structural element with values virtually identical to the rest of the well structured protein backbone. In contrast, the β-hairpin in HIV-1 CA exhibited a pattern of significant local mobility (on a fast time scale) in the same type of experiments (17Campos-Olivas R. Newman J.L. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, the same structural element can exhibit distinct dynamics and orientations in two highly related proteins. In this study, we adopted an approach that combines structural, biochemical, and functional techniques to study the effect of disrupting the β-hairpin loop on the structure and dynamics of HTLV-1 CA in solution and on the ability to assemble virus-like particles (VLPs) in mammalian cells. We examined the effect of disrupting the HTLV-1 CA Pro1–Asp54 salt bridge by mutating Asp54 to Ala. Consistent with the notion that the HTLV-1 NTD is a less flexible structure (16Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Carter C. Tjandra N. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we found that the D54A mutation completely destabilized the β-hairpin in the HTLV-1 NTD and caused localized conformational and dynamical changes in the region near the mutation. We observed significantly smaller changes (<0.2-ppm amide proton shifts) in helices 1, 2, 3, and 6, which are proximal to the β-hairpin in the three-dimensional structure. These findings contrast with the greater perturbation of the equivalent regions that result from the D51A mutation in the HIV-1 CA NTD (2von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1555-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The conformational alterations detected by NMR in CA134 were maintained in the Gag protein expressed in 293T cells, as indicated by differential monoclonal antibody recognition of the WT and D54A mutated CA proteins following proteolytic maturation. The mutated CA protein was assembled and released into VLPs formed by the Gag and Gag-Pro proteins. Moreover, processing of D54A Gag polyprotein, in contrast to HIV-1 D51A Gag, was not affected. Thus, our data indicate that differences in the backbone dynamics of the β-hairpin of retroviral capsids correlate with differences in the course of mature CA assembly, processing, and release. Protein Expression, Purification, and Preparation of NMR Samples— The DNA fragment encoding the D54A mutant was cloned into the NdeI/SapI sites of the pTYB1 plasmid vector (New England BioLabs), as described previously (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Carter C. Tjandra N. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli ER2566 strain for protein expression, and the purified D54A mutant was obtained by the method described previously (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Carter C. Tjandra N. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled NMR samples (0.8–1.0 mm protein concentration) were prepared in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris acetate, 0.1 mm NaN3, pH 6.0, containing 92.5% H2O and 7.5% 2H2O. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out either on a Bruker AVANCE 600, operating at the 1H frequency of 600 MHz, or on a Bruker AVANCE 800, operating at the 1H frequency of 800 MHz, both equipped with a 5-mm shielded triple gradient triple resonance probe head. The NMR experiments were performed at 27 °C. The spectra were processed using the NMRPipe package (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PIPP/STAPP (19Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal water signal (4.735822 ppm at 27 °C). Chemical Shift Assignments—The sequence backbone NMR resonance assignments were derived from the three-dimensional HNCO (20Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar), CBCA(CO)NH (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (926) Google Scholar), and HNCACB (22Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1993; 101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (852) Google Scholar) experiments. The side chain 13Cβ and 1Hβ assignments were obtained from analysis of the three-dimensional HBHACONH (23Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB spectra. Backbone 15N Relaxation Measurements—Longitudinal (T1) and transversal (T1ρ) relaxation times for the backbone 15N nuclei were measured using conventional pulse sequences (24Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), adapted to include the Watergate scheme (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), pulsed field gradient (26Bax A. Pochapsky S.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 638-642Google Scholar), and a semiconstant time evolution period in t1 (23Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The T1ρ experiment used continuous 15N spin-lock field strength of 2.5 kHz (27Peng J.W. Thanabal V. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 421-427Google Scholar). 800-MHz Data—T1, T1ρ, and NOE data were acquired as 768*(t2) × 128*(t1) data sets with 16, 32, and 64 scans per t1 point, respectively. Eight spectra were recorded for the T1 experiments using relaxation delays of 12, 84, 324, 524, 724, 884, 1084, and 1284 ms. For T1ρ values, eight spectra were recorded in an interleaved manner (to minimize any effects from spectrometer field drifting and sample heating) using the following 15N delays: 4.89, 14.49, 28.89, 43.29, 55.29, 74.49, 93.69, and 117.69 ms. 15N-{1H} NOE values were measured using a relaxation delay of 3.76 s with the water flip-back NOE pulse sequence described by (28Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), yielding data sets of 768*(t2) × 128*(t1) after accumulation of 64 scans per t1 point. 600-MHz Data—All experiments were acquired as 512*(t2) × 128*(t1) data sets with 32, 64, and 128 scans per t1 point for T1, T1ρ, and NOE, respectively. The following 15N delays were used for the T1 experiments: 11, 83, 123, 323, 403, 563, 803, and 1003 ms. The T1ρ relaxation decay was sampled at eight different time points: 4.84, 14.44, 26.44, 38.44, 60.04, 88.84, 112.84, and 139.24 ms. 15N-{1H} NOE values were measured using a relaxation delay of 3.76 s with the water flip-back NOE pulse sequence. Relaxation times were calculated by nonlinear fittings of the delay-dependent peak intensities to an exponential decay function with a peak intensity base line of zero. 15N-{1H} NOE values were calculated as the intensity ratios of the 15N-1H correlation peaks from pairs of spectra acquired with and without 1H presaturation during the recycle time. The saturated and unsaturated experiments were interleaved; the absence of saturation was obtained by shifting the proton frequency offresonance by ∼3 MHz during the recycle time. 15N-{1H} NOE values were corrected as described previously to compensate for the effects of incomplete 1H magnetization recovery (28Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutated HTLV-1 gag and gag-pro—HTLV-1 Gag and Gag-Pro mammalian cell expression plasmids were constructed as described previously (15Rayne F. Bouamr F. Lalanne J. Mamoun R.Z. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fragment containing the entire HTLV-1 gag or gag and pro genes was cut from p5′X13 plasmid (a gift from Therese Astier-Gin, University of Bordeaux, France) using AvrII and ApaI sites, and the cDNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid pSV between XbaI and SmaI sites. The plasmids obtained were named pSVgag and pSVgag-pro. ptax, prex, and pX plasmids that express the HTLV-1 X region accessory proteins Tax and Rex were gifts from Dr. David Derse (NCI-Frederick). Mutants in which alanine was substituted for the aspartic acid residue in position 54 (D54A) and alanine or isoleucine was substituted for the glycine residue in position 7 (G7A and G7I, respectively) were constructed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human 293T cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed in 10-cm dishes containing ∼2 × 106 cells by using either calcium phosphate or Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extracts, Isolation of VLPs, and Protein Analysis—Cells were lysed on ice in 300–500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS), sonicated, and centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm. HTLV-1 Gag proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-HTLV-1 capsid antibody (Advanced Biosciences Laboratories) and collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. Proteins were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp.). Gag was subsequently detected by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-CA or goat anti-CA antibodies. To detect HTLV-1 Gag proteins released from transfected cells, the culture medium was collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and spun through a 20% sucrose cushion for 1 h at 25,000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, negative staining and electron microscopy, or rate zonal centrifugation. HTLV-1 Gag proteins were then visualized by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-CA, goat anti-CA, or mouse anti-MA antibodies. Experimental Approach—Initial studies were conducted to determine whether the substitution to A of the Asp54 residue in the NTD of the HTLV-1 CA 134 fragment changed the structure of the protein. The [1H-15N] HSQC spectrum, a “fingerprint” of the protein that correlates backbone amide 1H and 15N resonances, is a very good indicator of whether the protein undergoes a substantial or minute change(s). This is due to the sensitivity of the NMR resonances to the local chemical environment. A substantial change in the HSQC spectrum can mean global or local structural changes close to the mutation site. This can further be evaluated by looking at the full backbone (amide H and N as well as Cα, Cβ, and C′) resonances and comparing them to the wild type structure. The areas in the structure associated with the largest chemical shift changes are the ones experiencing the largest perturbation due to the mutation. Furthermore, since the backbone chemical shifts are indicative of the secondary structure, they will also provide a measure of possible changes in the secondary structure caused by the mutation. However, backbone resonance data do not differentiate a local geometric change (such as reorientation of a secondary structure element) from local unfolding. Thus, we also obtained NMR backbone relaxation data to complement the above data sets and to address whether the observed changes were associated with folding or unfolding of parts of the protein structure. Backbone Resonance Assignments for the CA134 D54A Mutant—The effect of mutating HTLV-1 CA134 residue Asp54 to Ala on the β-hairpin structure was determined. The [1H-15N] HSQC spectrum of the D54A mutant was obtained (Fig. 1B) and is compared with that of wild type (WT) CA134 in Fig. 1A. 116 of 121 possible 1HN and 15N resonances (134 residues minus 13 prolines) were assigned (97.5%). Sequential connectivities for the 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ nuclei were derived from HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra. The 13C′ frequencies were identified from three-dimensional HNCO analysis. 1Hα, 1Hβ assignments were obtained from HBHACONH analysis. The assignments of 13Cα/13Cβ and 1Hα/1Hβ were checked using the [13C-1H] CT-HSQC analysis. In total, 94% of the backbone assignments as well as 90% of the 13Cβ and 1Hβ were obtained. Interestingly, two residues downstream of Asp54, Gln56 and Asp57, could not be assigned due to exchange. This is in contrast to the WT protein, in which these residues do not exhibit exchange (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Leu55 did not exhibit exchange in either protein. The fact that a comparable percentage of backbone assignments could be made for the WT and mutated proteins indicates that the substitution of Ala for Asp54 did not cause gross aggregation or unfolding. Secondary Structure for the CA134 D54A Mutant—The predicted ϕ and ψ torsion angles using TALOS (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) together with the analysis of the 15N-edited NOE spectroscopy (that showed no long range NOEs for residues 1–15 that form the β-hairpin in the wild type HTLV-1 CA and the deviation of the Cα and Cβ chemical shifts from the random coil values suggest the presence of six α-helices (residues 17–27, 35–48, 52–62, 65–83, 98–101, and 105–121) and seven loops (Fig. 1D), whereas the wild type adopts a ββαααααα fold (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the secondary structure of the D54A mutant was exclusively helical. This finding is consistent with the conclusion that the D54A mutation disrupted the β-hairpin. Chemical Shift Changes—Backbone 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shift differences between the WT and the mutant are presented in Fig. 2. A total of 44 of 121 residues exhibited displacements larger than 0.2 ppm in 1HN and 0.3 ppm in 15N chemical shifts. The changes in chemical shifts of backbone 13Cα, 13Cβ, 1HN, and 15N reflect the difference in local chemical environment due to the D54A mutation. As might be expected, the largest changes were observed for Asp54. In addition, substantial changes also were detected at the N-terminal residues (Pro1–Met17) that form the β-hairpin in the WT protein. Smaller differences occurred throughout the α-1 region (residues Asp19–Ser28), at the carboxyl terminus of α-2 (residues Ile41–Asp49), at α-5 (residues Gln100–Asn102) and at the beginning of α-6 (residues Gln107–Tyr113). A worm representation of the WT protein structure (colored red) with the locations of residues exhibiting significant 1H and 15N chemical shift changes (colored green and blue) is shown in Fig. 3. Changes due to D54A mutation were mainly localized to the immediate environment of the β-hairpin.Fig. 315N, HN chemical shift differences in the wild type “worm” representation. Residues coded in blue have chemical shift differences larger than 0.2 ppm for HN or 0.3 ppm for 15N, green for the D54A mutation site, yellow for residues that are not assigned (Gln56 and Asp57), and red for residues with small chemical shift differences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Backbone 15N Relaxation Measurements of CA134 and CA134 D54A—To assess the effect of D54A mutation on backbone dynamic properties, the longitudinal relaxation time, T1, the transverse relaxation time, T1ρ, and the steady-state 15N-{1H} NOE were obtained for 107 and 112 of the 121 protonated backbone 15N nuclei at 600 and 800 MHz, respectively. These quantitative measurements were needed to establish whether the changes observed in the chemical shifts were associated with a simple reorientation or an unfolding of a structural element. Data for residues His12, Leu43, Lys53, and Asp130 could not be fitted satisfactorily because of either significant signal overlapping or broadening due to chemical exchange. The experimental values of T1 at both fields are plotted versus the residue number in Fig. 4. As a reference, the WT T1 data (8Cornilescu C.C. Bouamr F. Yao X. Carter C. Tjandra N. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2024101604,"Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. It is an N-glycosylated, copper-containing transmembrane protein, whose post-translational processing involves intracytoplasmic movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and, eventually, to the melanosome. The expression of the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene is controlled by several regulatory regions including a locus control region (LCR) located 15 kb upstream from the promoter region. The extreme dilution mottled mutant mice (Tyrc-em) arose spontaneously at the MRC Institute in Harwell (United Kingdom) from a chinchilla-mottled mutant (Tyrc-m) stock, whose molecular basis corresponds to a rearrangement of 5′-upstream regulatory sequences including the LCR of the Tyr gene. Tyrc-em mice display a variegated pigmentation pattern in coat and eyes, in agreement with the LCR translocation, but also show a generalized hypopigmented phenotype, not seen in Tyrc-m mice. Genomic analyses of Tyrc-em mice showed a C1220T nucleotide substitution within the Tyr encoding region, resulting in a T373I amino acid change, which abolishes an N-glycosylation sequon located in the second metal ion binding site of the enzyme. Tyrosinase from Tyrc-em displayed a reduced enzymatic activity in vivo and in vitro, compared with wild-type enzyme. Deglycosylation studies showed that the mutant protein has an abnormal glycosylation pattern and is partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that the phenotype of the extreme dilution mottled mouse mutant is caused by a combination of coding and noncoding genomic alterations resulting in several abnormalities that include suboptimal gene expression, abnormal protein processing, and reduced enzymatic activity. Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. It is an N-glycosylated, copper-containing transmembrane protein, whose post-translational processing involves intracytoplasmic movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and, eventually, to the melanosome.

The relevance of Tyr post-translational processing is enhanced by the recent consideration of some types of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) as ER retention diseases.

Some of these mutations in the Tyr gene are associated not only with low enzymatic activities but also with processing or trafficking defects (6Garcia-Borron J.C. Solano F.

The Tyr gene is expressed exclusively in two cell types: melanocytes, derived from migrating neural crest cells, which eventually colonize iris, choroid, skin, and cochlea; and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells, derived from the optic cup (26Beermann F.

The presence of a LCR was inferred from the analyses of artificial chromosome-type transgenes in mice harboring the entire Tyr expression domain (37Schedl A. Montoliu L. Kelsey G. Schutz G. Nature. 1993; 362: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 38Giraldo P. Montoliu L.

Proceedings of the XIth International Pigment Cell Conference 1980. Sendai, Japan1981: 153-157Google Scholar). Tyrc-m mice displayed a variegated pigmentation in the coat, RPE cells, and choroid (39Phillips R.J.S. Mouse News Lett. 1970; 42: 26Google Scholar, 40Porter S. Larue L. Mintz B. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This phenotype was correlated with a genomic rearrangement of ∼30 kb 5′ upstream Tyr regulatory sequences, which included the LCR (41Deol M.S. Truslove G.M. Proceedings of the XIth International Pigment Cell Conference 1980. Sendai, Japan1981: 153-157Google Scholar). Interestingly, the subsequent analysis of transgenic mice carrying large Tyr genomic constructs, in which the LCR has been experimentally deleted, showed most similar variegated phenotypes (42Gimenez E. Giraldo P. Jeffery G. Montoliu L. Genesis. 2001; 30: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Giraldo P. Montoliu L.

The extreme dilution mottled (Tyrc-em) mutation arose spontaneously at the MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit in Harwell (UK) from a chinchilla mottled mouse stock. 2Peter Glenister, personal communication.2Peter Glenister, personal communication. Tyrc-em mice display a variegated pattern of pigmentation in coat, but also an overall hypopigmented phenotype, compared with chinchilla mottled mice, from which they originated, thus suggesting the presence of additional mutations in the Tyr gene. The molecular basis of the extreme dilution mottled mutation was not known. We decided to investigate this Tyr allele because we believed that it could contribute to the understanding of the Tyr gene regulation, including LCR function. We have rescued Tyrc-em mice from frozen embryos and performed a series of phenotypic, genomic, and biochemical analyses that have resulted in the description of the molecular and functional basis of the extreme dilution mottled mutation. Animals—The following types of mouse were used in this study: heterozygous wild-type pigmented YRT2 YAC-tyrosinase transgenic mice (YRT2/-; Tyrc/Tyrc) (line 1999; 37), heterozygous YRT4 YAC-tyrosinase transgenic mice (YRT4/-; Tyrc/Tyrc) (line 2138; 34, 42), homozygous or heterozygous extreme dilution mottled (Tyrc-em) and chinchilla mottled mutant mice (Tyrc-m) (39Phillips R.J.S.

Proceedings of the XIth International Pigment Cell Conference 1980. Sendai, Japan1981: 153-157Google Scholar), and albino outbred NMRI (Harlan Interfauna Iberica, S. L., Barcelona, Spain) mice (Tyrc/Tyrc). Tyrc-em and Tyrc-m mice were rescued from frozen embryos (embryos kept frozen since 1984) at the Frozen Embryo and Sperm Archive (FESA) of the MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit, in Harwell (UK) and sent to the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (CNB; Madrid) with the following initial genotypes: Tyrc-em/Tyr+ and Tyrc-m/Tyrc-m; a/a; Ednrbs/Ednrb+, respectively. Thereafter, extreme dilution mottled and chinchilla mottled mutant mice as well as YRT2 and YRT4 transgenic mice were bred and have been maintained in an albino outbred NMRI genetic back-ground. Histological analysis of adult mouse retinae was performed as reported (42Gimenez E. Giraldo P. Jeffery G. Montoliu L. Genesis. 2001; 30: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All experiments complied with local and European legislation concerning vivisection and the experimentation and use of animals for research purposes. Quantification of Melanin and Tyrosinase Enzymatic Activity Assays—Melanin contents were measured by spectrophotometry as described previously (44Donatien P.D. Orlow S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two types of tyrosinase assay were performed in whole eye extracts following described procedures (45Pomerantz S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 16: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 46Jara J.R. Solano F. Lozano J.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1988; 1: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first one consisted of a tyrosine hydroxylase activity determination by a radiometric method based on the release of tritiated water from labeled l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine. The second assay measured melanin formation from l-[14C]tyrosine, and therefore provides an estimate of rate of the complete melanogenic pathway. The tyrosine hydroxylase activity of Tyr in whole cell extracts was determined using the same radiometric method described above, except that shorter incubation times (1 h instead of 14-16 h) and smaller volumes of extract (usually 5 μl of the cell lysates instead of 25 μl, used for whole eye extracts) were employed. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of 1 μmol of l-tyrosine/min, in the presence of a 50 mm concentration of the substrate and 10 mm l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine as cofactor (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15735-15743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For statistical analyses, where indicated, paired Student's t tests were applied and statistical signification indicated as follows: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Southern Blot Analyses—For high resolution Southern blot analysis, megabase-size genomic DNA from mouse cells was prepared from splenocytes following described procedures (48Schedl A. Ruppert S. Kelsey G. Thies E. Niswander L. Magnuson T. Klebig M.L. Rinchik E.M. Schutz G. Genomics. 1992; 14: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). EcoRI and ApaI digestions (0.5 units/μl) were run at 37 °C for 12-14 h on agarose plugs (Seaplaque LMP, Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME) containing mouse genomic DNA. Plugs were resolved by horizontal gel electrophoresis in a 20 × 25-cm gel of 0.5% (w/v) Seakem Gold-agarose (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc.), 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA), at 3 V/cm, 4 °C for 16 h. The gel was transferred onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting and hybridized with a random primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled D probe (904 bp LCR internal probe, nucleotide positions 8574 to 9478, GenBank AF364302; 35) in hybridization buffer (0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 16 h at 65 °C, washed at 65 °C in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and finally autoradiographed and/or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Standard Southern blot analyses were carried out using previously described procedures (34Montoliu L. Umland T. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6026-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, 15-20 μg of genomic DNA from mouse tail biopsies was digested with EcoRI or HindIII (Roche Applied Science), fractionated by horizontal electrophoresis in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel (Invitrogen), transferred by capillary blotting onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequently hybridized with a full-length mouse Tyr cDNA probe (pmcTyr1; 28). Rescue of the Tyrc-em cDNA and Preparation of a Tyrc-em Expression Construct—Several overlapping fragments comprising the entire Tyrc-em coding region were obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or by reverse transcription-PCR, from RNA extracted from eyes (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen), using specific oligonucleotides designed according to reported mouse Tyr cDNA sequences (GenBank X12782 and M24560). PCR products were cloned into pCRII T/A vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and analyzed (alignments) using MacVector (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego). A detailed description of oligonucleotides and plasmids used is available upon request. A full-length Tyrc-em cDNA was reconstituted, sequenced entirely (GenBank AY526904), and cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). DNA sequences were obtained and confirmed from three independent Tyrc-em homozygous mutant mice. The Tyr+ expression construct, as well as those encoding the TyrΔ6 and TyrMeB mutant variants, all generated in pcDNA3, have been described previously (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J.

Culture and Transient Transfection of Mammalian Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 6-well plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences) with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and harvested 24 h after transfection. Whole cell crude extracts were prepared in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA pH 8, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) as reported previously (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15735-15743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein content of the extracts was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Deglycosylation Analysis—Endo H or Endo F digestions were made as described previously (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15735-15743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, 8 μg of total protein was incubated at 37°C for 3 h in the presence of 20 milliunits of Endo H or 4 units of Endo F (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Analytical SDS-PAGE was performed in 12% (v/v) acrylamide gels as described previously (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol.

Immunodetection of tyrosinase was performed with rabbit polyclonal αPEP7 (a generous gift from Dr. V. Hearing, National Institutes of Health) (50Jimenez M. Maloy W.L. Hearing V.J. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 354: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Staining and detection was done with the ECL Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the Tyr+, TyrMeB, TyrΔ6 (47Olivares C. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15735-15743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Tyrc-em cDNA constructs, cloned in pcDNA3 vector, as described above. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (12Toyofuku K. Wada I. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Ferrans V.J. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) para-formaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C and then permeabilized with methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. After blocking with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C, cells were incubated with 1:500 mouse monoclonal antibody against KDEL (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Inc., San Diego) (a generous gift from Dr. V. Hearing, National Institutes of Health) in 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with 1:500 αPEP7 in 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS (50Jimenez M. Maloy W.L. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 25 °C. Appropriate secondary antibodies were used to reveal specific signals: Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-mouse (dilution, 1:500) and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (dilution, 1:500) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), for 1 h at 25 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with 1:200 TO-PRO3 in PBS (Molecular Probes). All preparations were examined in an Axiovert 200 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), and images were processed with Laser Sharpe 2000 program (Bio-Rad). Phenotypic Analysis of extreme dilution mottled Mutant Mice—The phenotype of adult heterozygous extreme dilution mottled mice (Tyrc-em/Tyrc) was characterized by ruby eyes and a very faintly pigmented, almost albino coat. Homozygous extreme dilution mottled mice showed darker eyes and variegated light gray coat, with more pigmentation than observed in heterozygous animals. Both heterozygous and homozygous extreme dilution mottled mice showed less pigmentation than chinchilla mottled (Tyrc-m) mice (41Deol M.S. Truslove G.M. Proceedings of the XIth International Pigment Cell Conference 1980. Sendai, Japan1981: 153-157Google Scholar), from which the Tyrc-em arose (Fig. 1A). In the eye, both heterozygous and homozygous extreme dilution mottled mice exhibited a variegated pigmentation pattern at the RPE cells and irises (Fig. 1, B-G), similar but much lighter than that described previously in adult chinchilla mottled (Tyrc-m) mice (41Deol M.S. Truslove G.M. Proceedings of the XIth International Pigment Cell Conference 1980. Sendai, Japan1981: 153-157Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, H-J). In contrast to chinchilla mottled mice, the choroid of extreme dilution mottled mice was weakly pigmented (Fig. 1, K-M). Tyrosinase Activity and Melanin Content in the Eyes of extreme dilution mottled Mutant Mice—We measured the Tyr enzymatic activity of heterozygous extreme dilution mottled (Tyrc-em/Tyrc) mutant mice in crude protein eye extracts and compared it with the corresponding enzymatic activities of albino mice (Tyrc/Tyrc, NMRI), heterozygous chinchilla mottled (Tyrc-m/Tyrc) mice (39Phillips R.J.S.

YRT2 animals are indistinguishable from wild-type pigmented mice (52Jeffery G. Schutz G. Montoliu L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 53Jeffery G. Brem G. Montoliu L. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas YRT4 mice display a variegated pigmentation phenotype in the eye and coat, associated with the experimental deletion of the locus control region (LCR) in the YAC-tyrosinase transgene (42Gimenez E. Giraldo P. Jeffery G. Montoliu L. Genesis. 2001; 30: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The tyrosine hydroxylase and melanogenic activities of Tyr in extreme dilution mottled mice were intermediate between those of control albino NMRI and wild-type pigmented YRT2 transgenic mice but indistinguishable from those observed in chinchilla mottled or YRT4 transgenic mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Whole eye melanin contents in extreme dilution mottled mice were lower than in any other pigmented mouse analyzed and similar to albino NMRI mice (Fig. 2C). Genomic Analysis of the Tyrc-em Locus—To gain insight into the potential alterations affecting the Tyrc-em locus we performed a series of genomic analyses (Fig. 3). First, we investigated using Southern blot analysis the presence and endogenous location of the LCR element in the Tyrc-em mutant allele on homozygous extreme dilution mottled genomic DNA samples digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and ApaI, using an internal LCR-specific probe (probe D, Fig. 3A; 35). The expected 3.7-kb EcoRI DNA fragment containing the LCR element (32Ganss R. Montoliu L. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3083-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was found in all mice analyzed (Fig. 3B). Further, we observed that the Tyrc-em LCR was located approximately at -40 kb from the transcription start site, a distance similar to that observed previously in chinchilla mottled mice, further upstream from its endogenous normal position in wild-type mice, found approximately at -15 kb (35Giraldo P.

https://openalex.org/W2070980279,"This study examined the mechanism of Ca2+ entry and the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in Ca2+ signaling induced by activation of the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in HEK293 cells stably expressing the CaR. We demonstrate that influx of Ca2+ following CaR activation exhibits store-operated characteristics in being associated with Ca2+ store depletion and inhibited by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. Inhibition of PKC with GF109203X, Gö6983, or Gö6976 and down-regulation of PKC activity enhanced the release of Ca2+ from internal stores in response to the polyvalent cationic CaR agonist neomycin, whereas activation of PKC with acute 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment decreased the release. In contrast, overexpression of wild type PKC-α or -ϵ augmented the neomycin-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores, whereas dominant negative PKC-ϵ strongly decreased the release, but dominant negative PKC-α had little effect. Prolonged treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate effectively down-regulated immunoreactive PKC-α but had little effect on the expression of PKC-ϵ. Together these results indicate that diacylglycerol-responsive PKC isoforms differentially influence CaR agonist-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores. The fundamentally different results obtained when overexpressing or functionally down-regulating specific PKC isoforms as compared with pharmacological manipulation of PKC activity indicate the need for caution when interpreting data obtained with the latter approach.

The Ca2+ receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, Ca2+ receptor; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; wt, wild type; DN, dominant negative; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). is a G-protein-coupled receptor that senses the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) in parathyroid and other cell types. It is involved in Ca2+ and mineral homeostasis as well as other cellular processes including secretion (1Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). In parathyroid cells or HEK293 cells stably transfected with the CaR (HEK-CaR), stimulation of the receptor by its agonists triggers the activation of phospholipase C-β that catalyzes the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Whereas inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and raises the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Elevation of [Ca2+]o to levels that activate the receptor leads to increased cellular levels of these second messengers (3Kifor O. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4McKay C. Miller A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2473-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and consequently a rise of [Ca2+]i (5Racke F.K. Hammerland L.G. Dubyak G.R. Nemeth E.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and activation of some PKC isoforms (6Onyango I. Hjälm G. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 247: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that activation of the CaR in HEK-CaR cells stimulates Ca2+ entry independently of store release (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in other cell types Ca2+ influx following the stimulation of several G-protein-coupled receptors occurs by a store-operated Ca2+ entry mechanism (9Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 10Kondo I. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11Chen L.W. Shen A.Y. Chen J.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27540-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type and the receptor that is activated, PKC activation inhibits or facilitates this process (14Albert A.P. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 113-125Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Ma R. Pluznick J. Kudlacek P. Sansom S.C. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 2000; 529: 159-169Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+ storage capacity (18Ribeiro C.M. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Most reports on the role of PKC in CaR-mediated processes are based on pharmacological modulation of the activity of the enzyme. In HEK-CaR cells direct activation of PKC with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) reduces the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of the CaR (19Nygren P. Gylfe E. Larsson R. Johansson H. Juhlin C. Klareskog L. Åkerström G. Rastad J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Racke F.K. Nemeth E.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 468: 141-162Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because PKC phosphorylates the CaR, the activity of this receptor is believed to be modulated by PKC by a feedback mechanism (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that TPA-induced PKC activation affects Ca2+ handling independently of the receptor via activation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (22Gylfe E. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 135: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Kuo T.H. Wang K.K. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with such an effect, the amounts of mobilized intracellular Ca2+ were reduced when TPA-treated parathyroid cells were exposed to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (24Shoback D.M. Chen T.H. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using pharmacological modulators of PKC activity it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the role of PKC as a modulator of CaR activity and in CaR-mediated processes including parathyroid hormone secretion. In the present study, we overexpressed PKC-α or -ϵ in HEK-CaR cells to examine how these DAG-responsive PKC isoforms activated via the CaR or by treatment of HEK-CaR cells with TPA influence receptor-mediated Ca2+ handling. It will be shown that activation of the receptor apart from mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ activated influx of the ion by a pathway inhibited by the store-operated Ca2+ channel blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Based on overexpression of PKC-α and -ϵ in HEK-CaR cells, we found that they differentially affected the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. However, pharmacological modulation of PKC activity influenced the release of Ca2+ from internal stores in response to CaR activation in a manner opposite to that obtained when specific PKC isoforms were overexpressed or functionally down-regulated. These results urge for caution when interpreting data obtained with phorbol esters and/or PKC inhibitors. Establishment of PKC-α or -ϵ Overexpressing HEK-CaR Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the human kidney CaR (HEK-CaR cells) or the T888A mutant CaR (herein referred to as mCaR) as well as HEK-CaR cells overexpressing either wild type (wt) or dominant negative (DN) PKC-α (K368D) or DN PKC-ϵ (K437R) were generated as described previously (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, 10% fetal bovine serum and Ca2+ to a final concentration of 1.25 mm. Before use in experiments, cells were serum-starved for 12–16 h in the same medium in which fetal bovine serum was replaced by 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—[Ca2+]i measurements on cells in suspension were carried out as described previously (25Gylfe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5044-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5.5 mm glucose. Approximately 10 mm Na+ was also added when setting the pH to 7.4. The cells were then washed twice in this buffer and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the same buffer containing 1 μm fura-2/AM. The cells were subsequently harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 ml of similar buffer lacking the indicator and containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgSO4. The washed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a Ca2+- and albumin-deficient version of the latter buffer and transferred to a quartz cuvette with continuous stirring and placed in the thermostatically controlled holder of a time-sharing multichannel spectrophotofluorimeter. The excitation fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm as well as the 340/380 ratio were recorded every 10 msec with emission at 510 nm. Activation of CaR was performed by addition of the polyvalent cation neomycin or divalent cations at low [Ca2+]o or in Ca2+-deficient buffer supplemented with the indicated concentrations of EGTA. At the end of each experiment, cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 to record the maximum 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio as well as the 380 nm fluorescence under both saturating Ca2+ conditions and in the nominal absence of Ca2+ (<1nm). The latter was accomplished by addition of an excess of EGTA as well as Tris to raise pH above 8.3. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described previously (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In attempts to determine the rate of Ca2+ influx, the Ca2+-buffering capacity of the cytoplasm was increased with the aid of the chelator BAPTA, which was loaded into the cells (5 μm BAPTA-AM) in parallel with fura-2. To determine the effects of PKC inhibition, cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of GF109203X, Gö6976, or Gö6983 during the fura-2 loading period, whereas acute activation of PKC was accomplished by 5–10 min exposure to TPA prior to initiation of experiments. Prolonged pretreatment with TPA was also used to down-regulate PKC (see below). The amounts of releasable Ca2+ from internal stores in response to maximal CaR activation by neomycin were estimated in Ca2+-deficient medium as the time integrated peak [Ca2+]i response. Statistical analyses were performed by the paired Student's t test. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting—HEK-CaR cells were treated with either TPA (200 nm) or Me2SO vehicle (0.03%) for 20 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 during serum starvation or with 500 nm TPA for 10 min. The cells were harvested in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and protease inhibitor mixture, disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and fractionated by differential velocity centrifugation as described previously (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in the cytosolic and detergent-solubilized membranes was estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent, and equal amounts of protein from subcellular fractions (cytosol or detergent-solubilized membrane proteins) were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Hybond C-extra membranes. After blocking overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were probed with isoform-specific anti-PKC antibodies followed by the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described previously (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantification of the blots was performed using the Fujifilm image gauge software. Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC Augments CaR-mediated Release of Ca2+ from Internal Stores—PKC inhibition has been suggested to increase the sensitivity of the CaR to its agonists (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We now screened CaR-expressing HEK293 (HEK-CaR) cells for effects of pharmacological PKC modulators on the CaR agonist-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores. When control cells in Ca2+-deficient medium were first exposed to a modest increase of the Ca2+ concentration (1 mm) there was a small rise of [Ca2+]i with an initial overshoot followed by sustained elevation (Fig. 1, control). Subsequent maximal CaR activation with 200 μm neomycin caused a much more pronounced overshooting of the [Ca2+]i peak and a further rise of the sustained elevation. The overshooting peaks represent intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and the sustained elevation represents activation of Ca2+ influx. GF109203X, which inhibits most PKC isoforms, or Gö6976, a drug selective for Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (27Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), markedly increased the release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools in response to 1.0 mm Ca2+ and also the sustained elevation. Because the intracellular Ca2+ stores became more depleted in these situations, subsequent maximal stimulation with neomycin gave smaller [Ca2+]i peaks preceding the further rise of the sustained elevation. Acute (10 min) activation of PKC with TPA on the other hand reduced both the Ca2+- and neomycin-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores (Fig. 1, TPA). These data indicate that PKC inhibition sensitizes the CaR resulting in a left shifted dose-response relationship for activation as suggested previously (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By maximally stimulating the CaR with 200 μm neomycin in Ca2+-deficient medium we next studied the effect of PKC modulators on the amounts of Ca2+, which could be released from intracellular stores. As depicted in Fig. 2, inhibition of most PKC isoforms with GF109203X or Gö6983, or inhibition of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms with Gö6976 increased the total amounts of releasable Ca2+ (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas acute activation of PKC with TPA decreased the total amounts. Attempts were made to use the Mn2+ quench technique (12Dyachok O. Gylfe E. J. Cell. Sci. 2001; 114: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to estimate the rate of Ca2+ influx induced by CaR activation by neomycin in medium containing low concentration of Ca2+. Unfortunately, this method proved difficult because Mn2+ itself was found to be an effective activator of the CaR. Therefore we tried to measure influx as the rate of the slow gradual rise of [Ca2+]i in response to activation of Ca2+ influx into cells loaded with high concentrations of the Ca2+-buffering chelator BAPTA. With sufficient loading it was possible to completely eliminate the initial [Ca2+]i peak in response to neomycin-induced intracellular mobilization and observe a subsequent slow rise of [Ca2+]i in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. However, it was difficult to obtain consistent results, perhaps because the intracellular concentration of BAPTA varied between experiments after loading the cells with BAPTA-AM. Because of these difficulties we instead used the rise of [Ca2+]i in response to introduction of 1 (Fig. 2) or 6 mm Ca2+ (data not shown) in the presence of 200 μm neomycin as an indirect indicator of Ca2+ influx. This approach did not reveal any significant differences between control cells and cells exposed to modulators of PKC. PKC-α Is More Sensitive to TPA-induced Down-regulation Than PKC-ϵ in HEK293 Cells Stably Expressing the CaR—In several types of cells, prolonged treatment with TPA causes depletion of PKC activity. To verify the involvement of PKC in the modulation of [Ca2+]i, cells were pretreated with TPA (200 nm) or Me2SO vehicle for 20 h during serum starvation or acutely treated with TPA (500 nm). As shown in Fig. 3A, PKC-α was efficiently down-regulated in both the cytosolic (S100) and the detergent-soluble membranes (DSM), whereas PKC-ϵ, which is predominantly membrane-associated, was only minimally affected. Although cell type specific, several studies have reported similar effects of chronic treatment of cells with TPA on the expression levels of PKC-ϵ (28Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fujii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1004-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with depletion of PKC activity, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores calculated from the integrated [Ca2+]i peaks in response to neomycin were increased by 34% (p < 0.02) after TPA treatment overnight compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Co-expression of wt PKC-α or -ϵ with the CaR in HEK293 Cells Increased Whereas Co-expression of Dominant Negative PKC-ϵ Decreased Intracellular Ca2+ Release—The relative unspecific pharmacological PKC inhibitors increased the amounts of intracellular Ca2+ released upon receptor activation, and activation of PKC with TPA had the opposite effect (see above). A different picture emerged when manipulating the expression of individual PKC isoforms. Overexpression of wt PKC-α or -ϵ in HEK-CaR cells thus increased intracellular Ca2+ release in response to neomycin, and functional down-regulation of these isoforms (DN mutants) had or tended to have the opposite effect (Fig. 4). Using the rise of [Ca2+]i in response to introduction of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4A) in the presence of 200 μm neomycin as an indirect indicator of Ca2+ influx no significant differences were found. However, the elevation of [Ca2+]i obtained when subsequently raising Ca2+ to 6 mm (data not shown) was significantly lower in DN PKC-ϵ (40% reduction, p < 0.001). PKC-induced phosphorylation of the CaR has been suggested to influence the activity of the receptor (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol.

To clarify whether the effects of PKC activation were mediated via the receptor, we examined Ca2+ signaling in HEK293 cells overexpressing T888A mutant CaR, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKC at this position. Although a small reduction of the neomycin-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores in these mCaR cells did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4) the elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to subsequent rise of extracellular Ca2+ to 6 mm (data not shown) was reduced by about 40% (p < 0.001). Ca2+ Influx in CaR-expressing Cells Exhibits Store-operated Characteristics—Previous studies have indicated that the CaR activates Ca2+ entry independently of store release (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z.

Commun. 1996; 226: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further clarify the nature of the Ca2+ influx we used 2-APB, which is a reliable blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry (35Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Peppiatt C.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) with slight inhibitory effect on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ mobilization (35Bootman M.D. Collins T.J.

Venkatachalam K. Parys J.B. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6915-6922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Consistent with a minor inhibitory effect on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release treatment of HEK-CaR cells with 100 μm 2-APB slightly decreased the magnitude of the initial [Ca2+]i peak in response to 200 μm neomycin (data not shown). However, compared with Me2SO vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5A), 2-APB completely inhibited the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i observed after stimulation with neomycin in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). Even the rise of [Ca2+]i observed after increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 5.5 mm in neomycin-stimulated cells was prevented by 2-APB (cf. Fig. 5, A and B). To clarify whether the cation influx following activation of the CaR is selective for Ca2+, 0.5 mm Ba2+ was introduced into Ca2+-deficient medium. Such addition caused a small elevation of the fluorescence signal without overshooting the initial peak apparently because of failure to potently activate the CaR (Fig. 5C). The accompanying sluggish rise of the signal is consistent with slow entry of Ba2+. In this situation subsequent maximal CaR activation by neomycin induced the expected initial peak because of mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. However, there was no or little sustained elevation of the fluorescence signal above the extrapolated pre-stimulatory base line indicating failure of Ba2+ to enter through the CaR-activated influx pathway (Fig. 5C). Indeed, 2-APB did not seem to alter the rate of fluorescence increase obtained with elevation of the Ba2+ concentration to 6.5 mm during continued neomycin stimulation (Fig. 5D). Therefore, the influx pathway exhibits specificity for Ca2+ over Ba2+. The arguments for a direct involvement of PKC in CaR-mediated processes including the Ca2+-regulated secretion of parathyroid hormone from parathyroid cells are based on the effects of TPA and/or PKC inhibitors. Cellular effects resulting from activation of PKC via agonist-induced activation of the CaR have received little attention. The present data indicate that the effects of pharmacological modulation of PKC activity on the CaR-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores contradict those obtained when overexpressing or functionally down-regulating specific PKC isoforms. Studies of PKC effects are complicated not only by the existence of at least eight family members that are DAG-dependent and therefore activated by TPA but also by the fact that individual isoforms have special properties and that they are involved in different cellular processes. Treatment of cells with TPA bypasses receptor-mediated physiological activation of the enzyme and may cause a global activation of several DAG-responsive PKC isoforms that directly or indirectly interfere with numerous important processes within the cell. Apart from these complications, it is clear that TPA treatment activates a number of proteins that have only the C1 domain in common with PKC. Among these are Munc-13 proteins (involved in exocytosis), chimaerins (a family of Rac GTPase activating proteins), RasGRPs (exchange factors for Ras/Rap1), and diacylglycerol kinase (39Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell. Sci. 2002; 115: 4399-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 40Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to separate primary effects of pharmacological manipulation of the activity of these enzymes from secondary or tertiary effects. One way to support the conclusion that an observed effect of TPA treatment is caused by PKC activation is to try to reverse that effect by prior inhibition of PKC. This has proved effective in many instances, but PKC inhibitors are at best selective, not specific. An alternative way to study possible PKC involvement in a certain signal transduction chain is to overexpress individual wt or DN PKC isoforms and then measure putative effects on the process studied. This approach is more specific because a single isoform can be studied at a time. Moreover, as in this study the effects of a given PKC isoform can be investigated under physiological conditions in response to activation via the relevant receptor. Unfortunately, even this approach is not without flaws. Increased amounts of a certain PKC isoform may cause compensatory changes in the expression levels or activity of other isoforms (42Tonetti D.A. Chisamore M.J. Grdina W. Schurz H. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PKC activation by TPA has been found to interfere with Ca2+ signaling at several levels by phosphorylating PLC isoforms (43Strassheim D. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6486-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and even the CaR (33Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the putative importance of PKC in CaR signaling, we compared neomycin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools after pharmacological modulation of PKC activity in HEK-CaR cells with the neomycin effect in HEK-CaR cells after overexpressing or functionally down-regulating either of two DAG-responsive PKC isoforms. Inhibition of PKC by pre-treatment of cells with three different inhibitors increased the sensitivity of the CaR to extracellular Ca2+ and enhanced the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Acute treatment of cells with TPA had the opposite effects. We could not observe any significant differences on Ca2+ influx caused by the PKC modulators compared with mock treated cells. CaR-induced Ca2+ influx into CaR expressing HEK cells has been reported to occur independently of intracellular Ca2+ release (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the present data not only indicated association between CaR activation, intracellular Ca2+ store depletion, and activation of Ca2+ influx but also demonstrated that this influx is abolished by 2-APB. Because 2-APB is a potent inhibitor of store-operated Ca2+ influx (12Dyachok O. Gylfe E. J. Cell. Sci. 2001; 114: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the simplest interpretation is therefore that the influx is indeed store-operated. The effects of pharmacological modulators of PKC on the release of Ca2+ from internal stores corroborate the findings reported previously (8Jiang Y.F. Zhang Z. Kifor O. Lane C.R. Quinn S.J. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50543-50549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These authors deduced that the effects involve a feedback effect by which treatment of cells with TPA leads to activation of PKC, which in turn phosphorylates the CaR at Thr888 or other potential PKC phosphorylation sites, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the receptor. TPA has also been shown to drain agonist sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools by stimulating of Ca2+ efflux after PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (22Gylfe E. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 135: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Kuo T.H. Wang K.K. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we did not find any significant effect of mutating Thr888 to a nonphosphorylatable residue on neomycin-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores, but the mutation reduced Ca2+ influx at high [Ca2+]o. However, the Thr888 residue was necessary for full activation of ERK1/2 in response to CaR activation with high [Ca2+]o (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation may be related to inhibition of Ca2+ influx into the T888A mutant cells as indicated by the reduced elevation of [Ca2+]i after exposure to high [Ca2+]o. CaR activation in parathyroid cells leads to elevation of [Ca2+]i and activation of PKC, which are associated with inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion (47Shoback D.M. Thatcher J. Leombruno R. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3113-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 48LeBoff M.S. Shoback D. Brown E.M. Thatcher J. Leombruno R. Beaudoin D. Henry M. Wilson R. Pallotta J. Marynick S. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is apparent that the elevated [Ca2+]i is an inhibitory signal for secretion (49Wallfelt C. Lindh E. Larsson R. Johansson H. Rastad J. Åkerström G. Gylfe E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the effect of physiological PKC activation is unclear. Data obtained with pharmacological modulators indicate that PKC exerts a stimulatory action on secretion (50Membreno L. Chen T.H. Woodley S. Gagucas R. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 51Ridefelt P. Nygren P. Hellman P. Larsson R. Rastad J. Åkerström G. Gylfe E.

(Lond.). 1993; 468: 163-176Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and it has therefore been assumed that physiological CaR activation generates both an inhibitory and a stimulatory signal (2Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 54Hofer A.M. Brown E.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that Ca2+ stimulation of HEK-CaR cells leads to activation of PKC-α and -ϵ (7Sakwe A.M. Larsson M. Rask L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The present overexpression of these isoforms and functional down-regulation of PKC-ϵ indicate that these isoforms positively modulate the amounts of Ca2+, which are mobilized from internal stores in response to CaR activation. However, pharmacological manipulation of PKC activity gave opposite results suggesting that a less specific activation of PKC has additional and opposing effects on Ca2+ signaling. Therefore it is impossible to excluded that physiological activation of PKC contributes to the rise of [Ca2+]i that serves as an inhibitory messenger for parathyroid hormone secretion. In any case caution is warranted when drawing conclusions about PKC effects based on pharmacological modulators of the enzyme."
