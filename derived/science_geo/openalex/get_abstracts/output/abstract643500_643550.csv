https://openalex.org/W2990288178,"Invasive bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most lethal malignant urological tumors. Although miR-200a has been reported as an onco-miRNA that targets the PTEN gene in endometrioid carcinoma, its biological significance in BC invasion has been poorly explored. In the current study, we found that miR-200a was markedly overexpressed in both human BC tissues and BBN-induced muscle-invasive BC tissues. We further showed that miR-200a overexpression specifically promoted human BC cell invasion, but not migration, via transcriptional upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. Mechanistic studies indicated that the increased phosphorylation of c-Jun mediated the increasing levels of MMP-2 mRNA transcription. Further investigation revealed that Dicer was decreased in miR-200a overexpressed BC cells; this resulted in inhibition of miR-16 maturation and consequently led to increased JNK2 protein translation and c-Jun activation. Taken together, the studies here showed that miR-200a overexpression inhibited Dicer expression, in turn, resulted in inhibition of miR-16 maturation, leading to upregulation of JNK2 expression, c-Jun phosphorylation, MMP-2 transcription and, ultimately, BC invasion. Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-200a is an onco-miRNA that is a positive regulator for BC invasion. This finding could be very useful in the ongoing development of new strategies to treat invasive BC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2989858787,"Background: Voluntary shifts of visuospatial attention are associated with a lateralization of occipitoparietal alpha power (7-13Hz), i.e. higher power in the hemisphere ipsilateral and lower power contralateral to the locus of attention. Recent noninvasive neuromodulation studies demonstrated that alpha power can be experimentally increased using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that tACS at alpha frequency over the left parietal cortex induces shifts of attention to the left hemifield. However, spatial attention shifts not only occur voluntarily (endogenous), but also stimulus-driven (exogenous). In order to study the task-specificity of the potential effects of tACS on attentional processes, we administered three conceptually different spatial attention tasks. Methods: 36 healthy volunteers were recruited from an academic environment. In two seperate sessions, we applied either high-density tACS at 10Hz, or sham tACS, for 35-40 minutes to their left parietal cortex. We systematically compared performance on endogenous attention, exogenous attention, and stimulus detection tasks. Results: In the Endogenous attention task, we found a greater leftward bias in reaction times during left parietal 10Hz tACS as compared to sham. There were no stimulation effects in the exogenous attention or stimulus detection task. Conclusion: The study shows that high-density tACS at 10Hz can be used to modulate visuospatial attention performance. The tACS effect is task-specific, indicating that not all forms of attention are equally susceptible to the stimulation."

However, the estimates suffer from non-availability of reliable data for NCDs from sub populations. In order to fill the knowledge gap, the distribution and determinants of NCD risk factors were studied along with awareness, treatment and control of NCDs among the adult population in Haryana, India.NCD risk factors survey was conducted among 5078 residents, aged 18-69 years during 2016-17. Behavioural risk factors were assessed using STEPS instrument, administered through an android software (mSTEPS). This was followed by physical measurements using standard protocols. Finally, biological risk factors were determined through the analysis of serum and urine samples.Males were found to be consuming tobacco and alcohol at higher rates of 38.9% (95% CI: 35.3-42.4) and 18.8% (95% CI: 15.8-21.8). One- tenth (11%) (95% CI: 8.6-13.4) of the respondents did not meet the specified WHO recommendations for physical activity for health. Around 35.2% (95%CI: 32.6-37.7) were overweight or obese. Hypertension and diabetes were prevalent at 26.2% (95% CI: 24.6-27.8) and 15.5% (95% CI: 11.0-20.0). 91.3% (95% CI: 89.3-93.3) of the population had higher salt intake than recommended 5gms per day.The documentation of strikingly high and uniform distribution of different NCDs and their risk factors in state warrants urgent need for evidence based interventions and advocacy of policy measures."
https://openalex.org/W2990246522,"Background and objectives Impacts of mindfulness-based programs on blood pressure remain equivocal, possibly because the programs are not adapted to engage with determinants of hypertension, or due to floor effects. Primary objectives were to create a customized Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) program, and to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and effects on hypothesized proximal self-regulation mechanisms. Secondary outcomes included modifiable determinants of blood pressure (BP), and clinic-assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP). Methods This was a Stage 1 single-arm trial with one year follow-up. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were performed to evaluate acceptability and feasibility. Self-regulation outcomes, and determinants of BP, were assessed using validated questionnaires or objective assessments. The MB-BP curriculum was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to direct participants’ mindfulness skills towards modifiable determinants of blood pressure. Results Acceptability and feasibility findings showed that of 53 eligible participants, 48 enrolled (91%). Of these, 43 (90%) attended at least 7 of the 10 MB-BP classes; 43 were followed to one year (90%). Focus groups (n = 19) and semi-structured interviews (n = 10) showed all participants viewed the delivery modality favorably, and identified logistic considerations concerning program access as barriers. A priori selected primary self-regulation outcomes showed improvements at one-year follow-up vs. baseline, including attention control (Sustained Attention to Response Task correct no-go score, p<0.001), emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Score, p = 0.02), and self-awareness (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, p<0.001). Several determinants of hypertension were improved in participants not adhering to American Heart Association guidelines at baseline, including physical activity (p = 0.02), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-consistent diet (p<0.001), and alcohol consumption (p<0.001). Findings demonstrated mean 6.1 mmHg reduction in SBP (p = 0.008) at one year follow-up; effects were most pronounced in Stage 2 uncontrolled hypertensives (SBP≥140 mmHg), showing 15.1 mmHg reduction (p<0.001). Conclusion MB-BP has good acceptability and feasibility, and may engage with self-regulation and behavioral determinants of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2990796166,"The replacement of Neanderthals by Anatomically Modern Humans has typically been attributed to environmental pressure or a superiority of modern humans with respect to competition for resources. Here we present two independent models that suggest that no such heatedly debated factors might be needed to account for the demise of Neanderthals. Starting from the observation that Neanderthal populations already were small before the arrival of modern humans, the models implement three factors that conservation biology identifies as critical for a small population's persistence, namely inbreeding, Allee effects and stochasticity. Our results indicate that the disappearance of Neanderthals might have resided in the smallness of their population(s) alone: even if they had been identical to modern humans in their cognitive, social and cultural traits, and even in the absence of inter-specific competition, Neanderthals faced a considerable risk of extinction. Furthermore, we suggest that if modern humans contributed to the demise of Neanderthals, that contribution might have had nothing to do with resource competition, but rather with how the incoming populations geographically restructured the resident populations, in a way that reinforced Allee effects, and the effects of inbreeding and stochasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2991342118,"Only 40% of World Health Assembly member states achieved 90% national full vaccination coverage in 2015. In the African region, 79% of the countries had not achieved the target in 2015. In Ethiopia, only 39% of children 12-23 months of age were fully vaccinated. Though different studies were conducted in Ethiopia, they were limited in scope and used single level analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to assess individual and community level factors associated with full immunization among children 12-23 months of age in Ethiopia.The data was obtained from Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016, conducted from January 2016 to June 2016. The sample was taken using two stage stratified sampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per Enumeration Area were selected systematically. Weighted sample of 1929 children 12-23 months of age were included in the study. Data was extracted from http://www.DHSprogram.com. Multilevel logistic regression was employed. Akaike Information Criteria was used to select best fit model.Mother's education, husband employment, mother's religion, mother's antenatal care visit, presence of vaccination document, region and community antenatal care utilization were significantly associated with children full vaccination. The odds of full vaccination were 2.5 [AOR = 2.48 95% CI: 1.35, 4.56] and 1.6 [AOR = 1.58 95% CI: 1.1, 2.28] times higher in children of mothers with secondary or higher and primary education respectively than children of mothers with no education.This study showed that children full vaccination is affected both by the individual and community level factors. Therefore, efforts to increase children full vaccination status need to target both at individual and community level."
https://openalex.org/W2990309907,"Available literature identifies the need for a deeper understanding of the role of gender, age and socioeconomic status in children's exposure to violence and associations with mental health (MH) outcomes. The 1548 participants for this study were enrolled from 28 public charter schools and 9 community-based settings; youth were administered a screener that assessed exposure to traumatic events and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Respondents reported extremely high levels of exposure to indirect violence: 41.7% witnessed shooting/stabbing/beating; 18.3% witnessed murder; and 53.8% experienced the murder of someone close. Frequency of adverse MH outcomes was high: 21.2% screened positive for depression; 45.7% for lifetime PTSD; and 26.9% for current PTSD. More males than females reported witnessing shooting/stabbing/beating (p = .04); females more often reported experiencing the murder of someone close (p = .001). Indirect violence exposure generally increased with age. Youth attending schools with ≥90% free/reduced lunch participation (FRLP) showed significantly higher levels of violence exposure compared to youth in schools with <90% FRLP. Females endorsed significantly higher levels of depression (21.4% vs. 9.7%), and lifetime (53.9% vs. 34.9%) and current (32.5% vs. 19.6%) PTSD, compared with males (p < .0001, all comparisons). Female sex (aOR = 2.6), FRLP (aOR = 1.4 for ≥90% vs. <90%) and the number of different indirect violence exposures (aORs from 1.3 to 10.4), were significantly associated with a positive screen for any adverse MH outcome. Our data add important insights into gender heterogeneity of viewed violence, mental health symptoms, and their association-all of which are critical to guiding effective intervention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2991202994,"Increasing evidence highlights the central role of neurotoxic oligomers of the 42-residue-long β-amyloid (Aβ42) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very limited information is available on the structural transition from oligomer to fibril, particularly for pathologically relevant amyloids. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first site-specific structural characterization of Aβ42 misfolding, from toxic oligomeric assembly yielding a similar conformation to an AD-associated Aβ42 oligomer, into a fibril. Transmission EM (TEM) analysis revealed that a spherical amyloid assembly (SPA) of Aβ42 with a 15.6 ± 2.1-nm diameter forms in a ∼30-μm Aβ42 solution after a ∼10-h incubation at 4 °C, followed by a slow conversion into fibril at ∼180 h. Immunological analysis suggested that the SPA has a surface structure similar to that of amylospheroid (ASPD), a patient-derived toxic Aβ oligomer, which had a diameter of 10–15 nm in negative-stain TEM. Solid-state NMR analyses indicated that the SPA structure involves a β-loop-β motif, which significantly differed from the triple-β motif observed for the Aβ42 fibril. The comparison of the 13C chemical shifts of SPA with those of the fibril prepared in the above conditions and interstrand distance measurements suggested a large conformational change involving rearrangements of intermolecular β-sheet into in-register parallel β-sheet during the misfolding. A comparison of the SPA and ASPD 13C chemical shifts indicated that SPA is structurally similar to the ASPD relevant to AD. These observations provide insights into the architecture and key structural transitions of amyloid oligomers relevant for AD pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2991577183,"Forest understory vegetation is an important characteristic of the forest. Predicting and mapping understory is a critical need for forest management and conservation planning, but it has proved difficult with available methods to date. LiDAR has the potential to generate remotely sensed forest understory structure data, but this potential has yet to be fully validated. Our objective was to examine the capacity of LiDAR point cloud data to predict forest understory cover. We modeled ground-based observations of understory structure in three vertical strata (0.5 m to < 1.5 m, 1.5 m to < 2.5 m, 2.5 m to < 3.5 m) as a function of a variety of LiDAR metrics using both mixed-effects and Random Forest models. We compared four understory LiDAR metrics designed to control for the spatial heterogeneity of sampling density. The four metrics were highly correlated and they all produced high values of variance explained in mixed-effects models. The top-ranked model used a voxel-based understory metric along with vertical stratum (Akaike weight = 1, explained variance = 87%, cross-validation error = 15.6%). We found evidence of occlusion of LiDAR pulses in the lowest stratum but no evidence that the occlusion influenced the predictability of understory structure. The Random Forest model results were consistent with those of the mixed-effects models, in that all four understory LiDAR metrics were identified as important, along with vertical stratum. The Random Forest model explained 74.4% of the variance, but had a lower cross-validation error of 12.9%. We conclude that the best approach to predict understory structure is using the mixed-effects model with the voxel-based understory LiDAR metric along with vertical stratum, because it yielded the highest explained variance with the fewest number of variables. However, results show that other understory LiDAR metrics (fractional cover, normalized cover and leaf area density) would still be effective in mixed-effects and Random Forest modelling approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2997465389,"Tooth replacement rate is an important contributor to feeding ecology for polyphyodont animals. Dinosaurs exhibit a wide range of tooth replacement rates, mirroring their diverse craniofacial specializations, but little is known about broad-scale allometric or evolutionary patterns within the group. In the current broad but sparse dinosaurian sample, only three non-avian theropod tooth replacement rates have been estimated. We estimated tooth formation and replacement rates in three additional non-avian theropod dinosaurs, the derived latest Cretaceous abelisaurid Majungasaurus and the more generalized Late Jurassic Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. We created the largest dental histological and CT dataset for any theropod dinosaur, sectioning and scanning over a dozen toothed elements of Majungasaurus and several additional elements from the other two genera. Using this large sample, we created models of tooth formation time that allow for theropod replacement rates to be estimated non-destructively. In contrast to previous results for theropods, we found high tooth replacement rates in all three genera, with Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus rates of ~100 days and 56 days for Majungasaurus. The latter rate is on par with those of derived herbivorous dinosaurs including some neosauropods, hadrosaurids, and ceratopsians. This elevated rate may be a response to high rates of tooth wear in Majungasaurus. Within Dinosauria, there is no relationship between body mass and tooth replacement rate and no trends in replacement rate over time. Rather, tooth replacement rate is clade-specific, with elevated rates in abelisaurids and diplodocoids and lower rates in coelurosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2991395654,"Abstract High YAP activity is associated with poor prognosis human breast cancers, but its role during the initial stage of mammary cell transformation is unknown. To address this question, we designed experiments that exploit the ability of KRAS G12D -transduced subsets of freshly isolated normal human mammary cells to form invasive tumors rapidly and efficiently when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Initial examination of the newly developing tumors thus generated revealed a consistent marked loss of nuclear YAP, independent of the initial primary human mammary cell type transduced. Conversely, co-transduction of the same subsets of primary human mammary cells with KRAS G12D plus the constitutively active YAP S127A prevented tumor formation. These findings contrast with the enhanced display of transformed properties obtained when the immortalized, but non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells are transduced just with YAP S127A . In addition, we show that YAP S127A -transduction of the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (that carry a similar KRAS mutation) enhances their metastatic activity in vivo. We also discover that the KRAS G12D - induced early loss of YAP in primary human mammary cells is associated with their induced secretion of amphiregulin. Collectively, these findings suggest that YAP can differentially affect the acquisition of malignant properties by human mammary cells at different stages of their transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2990158669,"This study uses species distribution modeling and physiological and functional traits to predict the impacts of climate change on native freshwater fish in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. We modelled future changes in taxonomic and functional diversity in 2050 and 2080 for two scenarios of carbon emissions, identifying areas of great interest for conservation. Climatic-environmental variables were used to model the range of 23 species of native fish under each scenario. The consensus model, followed by the physiological filter of lethal temperature was retained for interpretation. Our study predicts a severe negative impact of climate change on both taxonomic and functional components of ichthyofauna of the Murray-Darling Basin. There was a predicted marked contraction of species ranges under both scenarios. The predictions showed loss of climatically suitable areas, species and functional characters. There was a decrease in areas with high values of functional richness, dispersion and uniqueness. Some traits are predicted to be extirpated, especially in the most pessimistic scenario. The climatic refuges for fish fauna are predicted to be in the southern portion of the basin, in the upper Murray catchment. Incorporating future predictions about the distribution of ichthyofauna in conservation management planning will enhance resilience to climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2990274915,"Grit (effortful persistence) has received considerable attention as a personality trait relevant for success and performance. However, critics have questioned grit's construct validity and criterion validity. Here we report on two studies that contribute to the debate surrounding the grit construct. Study 1 (N = 6,230) examined the psychometric properties of a five-item grit scale, covering mainly the perseverance facet, in a large and representative sample of German adults. Moreover, it investigated the distribution of grit across sociodemographic subgroups (age groups, genders, educational strata, employment statuses). Multiple-group measurement models demonstrated that grit showed full metric, but only partial scalar, invariance across all sociodemographic subgroups. Sociodemographic differences in the levels of grit emerged for age, education, and employment status but were generally small. Study 2 investigated how grit relates to career success (income, job prestige, job satisfaction) and career engagement (working overtime, participation in continuing professional development courses, attitudes toward lifelong learning) in an employed subsample (n = 2,246). When modeled as a first-order factor, grit was incrementally associated with all indicators of career success and especially of career engagement (.08 ≤ β ≤ .75)-over and above cognitive ability and sociodemographic characteristics. When modeled as a residual facet of conscientiousness, grit largely retained its criterion validity for success but only partly for engagement (-.14 ≤ β ≤ .61). Our findings offer qualified support for the psychometric quality of the short grit scale and suggest that grit may provide some added value in predicting career outcomes. We critically discuss these findings while highlighting that grit hardly differs from established facets of conscientiousness such as industriousness/perseverance."

Instead, FXII-W268R carriers experience cold-inducible urticarial rash, arthralgia, fever, and fatigue. Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics of the FXII-W268R variant. We expressed wild type FXII (FXII-WT), FXII-W268R, and FXII-T309R (which causes HAE), as well as other FXII variants in HEK293 freestyle cells.

A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving a sample of 746 adolescents representative of students aged 15 to 19 years at the public and private school systems in a city in northeast Brazil. Two examiners who had undergone a training and calibration exercise (inter-examiner and intra-examiner Kappa coefficient: 0.87 to 0.93) performed the diagnosis of caries using the Nyvad Index and evaluated the level of OHL (BREALD-30) of the adolescents. The participants answered questions regarding their history of visits to the dentist and the parents/caregivers answered a questionnaire addressing socioeconomic characteristics. A directed acyclic graph was created to direct the selection of covariables for adjustments in the Poisson multiple regression analysis to test the association between dental caries and OHL (α = 5%). Cavitated carious lesions (codes 3 to 6 on the Nyvad index) were found in 41.6% of the adolescents. Only 29.4% had a high level of OHL (BREALD-30 scores between 23 and 30); 42.3% of the families belonged to the A-B social class and 93% of the adolescents had been to the dentist at least once in their lifetimes. In the multivariate analysis, adolescents with inadequate (PR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.18-2.41; p = 0.004) and marginal (PR; 1.42; 95% CI: 1.01-1.99; p = 0.042) OHL and those in the lower social classes (C-D-E) (PR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.39-2.47; p<0.001) had more teeth with cavitated carious lesions. In conclusion, adolescents aged 15 to 19 years with poorer levels of OHL had a larger number of teeth with cavitated carious lesions, independently of their socioeconomic status and history of visiting a dentist."

We found that extracellular tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRS) exhibited proinflammatory activities. In addition to acting as a monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant, YRS initiated signaling through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) resulting in NF-κB activation and release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and multiple chemokines, including MIP-1α/β, CXCL8 (IL8), and CXCL1 (KC) from THP1 monocyte and peripheral blood mononuclear cell–derived macrophages. Furthermore, YRS up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in a TNFα-dependent manner in M0 macrophages. Because MMPs process a variety of intracellular proteins that also exhibit extracellular moonlighting functions, we profiled 10 MMPs for YRS cleavage and identified 55 cleavage sites by amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS) positional proteomics and Edman degradation. Stable proteoforms resulted from cleavages near the start of the YRS C-terminal EMAPII domain. All of the MMPs tested cleaved at ADS386↓387LYV and VSG405↓406LVQ, generating 43- and 45-kDa fragments. The highest catalytic efficiency for YRS was demonstrated by MMP7, which is highly expressed by monocytes and macrophages, and by neutrophil-specific MMP8. MMP-cleaved YRS enhanced TLR2 signaling, increased TNFα secretion from macrophages, and amplified monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis compared with unprocessed YRS. The cleavage of YRS by MMP8, but not MMP7, was inhibited by tyrosine, a substrate of the YRS aminoacylation reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2991617415,"Cross-sectional and experimental research have shown that task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., mind wandering) relate to sleep disturbances, but there is little research on whether this association generalizes to the day-level and other kinds of task-unrelated mentation. We employed a longitudinal daily diary design to examine the within-person and between-person associations between three self-report instruments measuring mind wandering, maladaptive daydreaming (a condition characterized by having elaborate fantasy daydreams so insistent that they interfere with daily functioning) and sleep disturbances. A final sample of 126 participants self-identified as experiencing maladaptive daydreaming completed up to 8 consecutive daily reports (in total 869 daily observations). The scales showed acceptable-to-excellent within-person reliability (i.e., systematic day-to-day change) and excellent between-person reliability. The proportion of between-person variance was 36% for sleep disturbances, 57% for mind wandering, and 75% for maladaptive daydreaming, respectively (the remaining being stochastic and systematic within-person variance). Contrary to our pre-registered hypothesis, maladaptive daydreaming did not significantly predict sleep disturbances the following night, B = -0.00 (SE = 0.04), p = .956. Exploratory analyses indicated that while nightly sleep disturbances predicted mind wandering the following day, B = 0.20 (SE = 0.04), p < .001, it did not significantly predict maladaptive daydreaming the following day, B = -0.04 (SE = 0.05), p = .452. Moreover, daily mind wandering did not significantly predict sleep disturbances the following night, B = 0.02 (SE = 0.05), p = .731. All variables correlated at the between-person level. We discuss the implications concerning the differences between maladaptive daydreaming and mind wandering and the possibility of targeting sleep for mind wandering interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2989610481,"Early modern humans (EMH) are often touted as behaviorally advanced to Neandertals, with more sophisticated technologies, expanded resource exploitation, and more complex clothing production. However, recent analyses have indicated that Neandertals were more nuanced in their behavioral adaptations, with the production of the Châtelperronian technocomplex, the processing and cooking of plant foods, and differences in behavioral adaptations according to habitat. This study adds to this debate by addressing the behavioral strategies of EMH (n = 30) within the context of non-dietary anterior tooth-use behaviors to glean possible differences between them and their Neandertal (n = 45) counterparts. High-resolution casts of permanent anterior teeth were used to collect microwear textures of fossil and comparative bioarchaeological samples using a Sensofar white-light confocal profiler with a 100x objective lens. Labial surfaces were scanned, totaling a work envelope of 204 x 276 μm for each individual. The microwear textures were examined for post-mortem damage and uploaded to SSFA software packages for surface characterization. Statistical analyses were performed to examine differences in central tendencies and distributions of anisotropy and textural fill volume variables among the EMH sample itself by habitat, location, and time interval, and between the EMH and Neandertal samples by habitat and location. Descriptive statistics for the EMH sample were compared to seven bioarchaeological samples (n = 156) that utilized different tooth-use behaviors to better elucidate specific activities that may have been performed by EMH. Results show no significant differences between the means within the EMH sample by habitat, location, or time interval. Furthermore, there are no significant differences found here between EMH and Neandertals. Comparisons to the bioarchaeological samples suggest both fossil groups participated in clamping and grasping activities. These results indicate that EMH and Neandertals were similar in their non-dietary anterior tooth-use behaviors and provide additional evidence for overlapping behavioral strategies employed by these two hominins."
https://openalex.org/W2991520222,"South Africa is confronted with a high burden of diabetes, the majority of which are poorly controlled. The use of mHealth, specifically text messaging for fostering health, is evolving and studies on its efficacy, the majority of which were conducted in developed countries, have documented mixed findings. There is no such study done amongst patients living with diabetes in the resource-poor settings of South Africa. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of text-messaging in improving glycaemic control and other clinical outcomes among individuals living with diabetes in low-resource settings in Eastern Cape, South Africa. The study adopted a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel, randomised-controlled trial design. The study was conducted amongst patients with an uncontrolled glycaemic status. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 108) and the control arm (n = 108). Participants in the intervention arm received daily educational text messages on diabetes for six months. Data was collected at baseline and six months post-intervention. Blood glucose, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements followed standard procedure. Mixed-model analysis was used to assess the impact of the text messages on blood glucose while linear regression was used to assess its effect on other clinical outcomes such as weight, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean age of the participants was 60.64 (SD± 11.58) years. The majority of the participants had a secondary level of education (95.3%) and earned 104.80 to 991.42 USD per month (67.7%). Both arms of the study showed improvement in their blood glucose levels, but the intervention did not have any significant effect, the mean adjusted change in blood glucose was 0.26 (-0.81 to 1.32), p = 0.634. Also, the intervention did not have any significant effect on weight, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Almost all participants (90.74%) were pleased with the intervention and felt it was helpful. Of those who participated in the intervention, 91% completed the follow-up after 6 months. Unidirectional text-messaging was acceptable and feasible amongst adults living with diabetes in this setting. However, its efficacy in improving glycaemic status and other clinical outcomes remains doubtful. Trial Registration: Pan African Clinical Trial Registry PACTR201810599931422."
https://openalex.org/W2989798025,"Cancer cachexia is common in patients with oesophagogastric cancer (OG) and is linked to overall survival (OS). One of the key components of cachexia is anorexia; it is not known whether anorexia impacts on OS and there is no method of routine screening in current practice. Diagnosis relies on patients describing the symptoms, clinicians diagnosing anorexia and acting upon it. Patients with oesophageal/gastroesophageal junction or gastric cancer were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Anorexia Cachexia Therapy Anorexia/Cachexia Subscale (FAACT A/CS). FAACT A/CS includes 12 questions validated previously to diagnose anorexia in patients with cancer. Of the 182 patients included, 69% scored ≤37/48 and were considered to be anorexic; FAACT A/CS was a better predictor of OS in metastatic patients than body mass index or weight loss in the six months prior to cancer diagnosis. The median OS of patients with FAACT A/CS scores of >37 was longer than patients with scores of ≤37 (19.3 months vs 6.7 months, Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.4-6.0, p<0.0001). Patients with performance status (PS) 0-2 and FAACT A/CS >37 had substantially longer OS than those with PS 0-2 and FAACT A/CS ≤37 (18.7 months vs 7.9 months, HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.2-5.1, P<0.0001). The FAACT A/CS questionnaire allows clinicians to identify patients with anorexia who may benefit from early nutrition interventions. Importantly, this is the first study to show the association between anorexia and survival in patients with metastatic OG cancers. This will form the basis of future interventional studies to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2989874170,"Introduction ITGAM has consistently been associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in many ethnically diverse populations. However, in populations with higher Amerindian ancestry (like Yucatan) or highly admixed population (like Mexican), ITGAM has seldom been evaluated (except few studies where patients with childhood-onset SLE were included). In addition, ITGAM has seldom been evaluated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we evaluated whether four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located within ITGAM, were associated with SLE and RA susceptibility in patients from Mexico. Methods Our study consisted of 1,462 individuals, which included 363 patients with SLE (292 from Central Mexico and 71 from Yucatan), and 621 healthy controls (504 from Central Mexico and 117 from Yucatan). Our study also included 478 patients with RA from Central Mexico. TaqMan assays were used to obtain the genotypes of the four SNPs: rs34572943 (G/A), rs1143679 (G/A), rs9888739 (C/T), and rs1143683 (C/T). We also verified the genotypes by Sanger sequencing. Fisher's exact test and permutation test were employed to evaluate the distribution of genotype, allele, and haplotype between patients and controls. Results Our data show that all four ITGAM SNPs are significantly associated with susceptibility to SLE using both genotypic and allelic association tests (corrected for multiple testing, but not for population stratification). A second study carried out in patients from Yucatan, a southeastern part of Mexico (with a high Amerindian ancestry), also replicated SLE association with all four SNPs, including the functional SNP, rs1143679 (OR = 24.6 and p = 9.3X10-6). On the other hand, none of the four SNPs are significant in RA after multiple testing. Interestingly, the GACC haplotype, which carries the ITGAM rs1143679 (A) minor allele, showed an association with protection against RA (OR = 0.14 and p = 3.0x10-4). Conclusion Our data displayed that ITGAM is a risk factor to SLE in individuals of Mexican population. Concurrently, a risk haplotype in ITGAM confers protection against RA."
https://openalex.org/W2989805760,"Introduction Maternity waiting homes, defined as residential lodging near a health facility, are recommended by the WHO. An improved MWH model, responsive to community standards for functionality and comfort, was implemented at two purposively selected health facilities in rural Zambia providing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC) services (intervention MWHs), and compared to three existing standard-of-care MWHs (comparison MWHs) at other CEmONC sites in the same districts. Methods We used a mixed-methods time-series design for this analysis. Quantitative data including MWH quality, MWH utilization, and demographics of women utilizing MWHs were collected from September 2016 through May 2018 to capture pre-post intervention trends. Qualitative data were obtained from two focus group discussions conducted with pregnant women at intervention MWHs in August 2017 and May 2018. The primary outcomes were quality scoring of the MWHs and maternal utilization of the MWHs. Results MWH quality was similar at all sites during the pre-intervention time period, with a significant change in overall quality scores between intervention (mean score 83.8, SD 12) and comparison (mean score 43.1, SD 10.2) sites after the intervention (p <0.0001). Women utilizing intervention and comparison MWHs at all time points had very similar demographics. After implementation of the intervention, there were marked increases in MWH utilization at both intervention and comparison sites, with a greater percentage increase at one of two intervention sites. Conclusions An improved MWH model can result in measurably improved quality scores for MWHs, and can result in increased utilization of MWHs at rural CEmONC facilities. MWHs are part of the infrastructure that might be needed for health systems to provide high quality “right place” maternal care in rural settings."

This study aimed to investigate the knowledge of HFMD and acceptability of EV71 vaccine among parents of under-five in Chongqing, China. Methodology /Principal findings A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017. A validated questionnaire consisting of three sections including demographic information, knowledge of HFMD, acceptability and reasons for declining vaccination was developed based on literature review. Factors associated with unwillingness to receive EV71 vaccine were explored using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 992 parents finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 91.9%. Awareness of HFMD and EV71 vaccine were reported by 823 (83.0%) parents and 386 (38.9%) parents respectively. Knowledge about HFMD was with a mean score of 5.0 (standard deviation = 3.5) out of a total score of 12. Only 369 (37.2%) participants were classified as with good knowledge level about HFMD. 279 (28.1%) participants had their children received EV71 vaccine and 271 (27.3%) expressed willingness to vaccinate their children after a short-time education about EV71 vaccine. Acceptability of EV71 vaccine increased along with parents’ education level (p = 0.008) and HFMD knowledge level (p<0.001). Parents of scattered children had higher acceptability than those of preschool children (p = 0.002). 442 (44.6%) of participants were unwilling to have their children vaccinated with EV71 vaccine. The most common reasons for declining EV71 vaccine were doubts about its safety (56.6%) and efficacy (48.3%), and the necessity of vaccination (38.3%). Physicians and vaccination certificate were the parents’ most trusted sources of vaccine information. Conclusions Parents’ knowledge about HFMD was not sufficient, and nearly half of the parents expressed unwillingness to vaccinate their children with EV71 vaccine. Our findings stress that more efforts by health authorities in Chongqing are needed to increase the acceptability of EV71 vaccine, especially among parents of preschool children with lower education level."
https://openalex.org/W2990484734,"Streptococcus mutans primary thrives on the biofilm formation on the tooth surface in sticky biofilms and under certain conditions can lead to carious lesions on the tooth surface. To search for a new preventive material for oral biofilm-associated diseases, including dental caries, we investigated the effects of polypyrrole, which contains an electrochemical polymer and causes protonation and incorporation of anion under low pH condition, on the biofilm formation of S. mutans and other streptococci. In this study, polypyrrole was applied in biofilm formation assays with the S. mutans strains UA159 and its gtfB and gtfC double mutant (gtfBC mutant), S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii on human saliva and bovine serum albumin-coated 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. The effects of polypyrrole on biofilm formation were quantitatively and qualitatively observed. High concentrations of polypyrrole significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. mutans UA159 and S. sanguinis. As an inhibition mechanism, polypyrrole attached to the surface of bacterial cells, increased chains and aggregates, and incorporated proteins involving GTF-I and GTF-SI produced by S. mutans. In contrast, the biofilm formation of gtfBC mutant, S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii was temporarily induced by the addition of low polypyrrole concentrations on human saliva-coated plate but not on the uncoated and bovine serum albumin-coated plates. Moreover, biofilm formation depended on live cells and, likewise, specific interaction between cells and binding components in saliva. However, these biofilms were easily removed by increased frequency of water washing. In this regard, the physical and electrochemical properties in polypyrrole worked effectively in the removal of streptococci biofilms. Polypyrrole may have the potential to alter the development of biofilms associated with dental diseases."

This is an observational study of the participants in the intervention arm of the randomized controlled trial Diabetes Care in General Practice (DCGP) in Denmark. 494 newly diagnosed persons with Type 2 DM aged 40 years and over with three or more measurements of HbA1c during six years of intervention were included in the analyses. Based on a regression line, fitted through the HbA1c-measurements from 1 to 6 years after diabetes diagnosis, glycaemic control was characterized by the one-year level of HbA1c after diagnosis, and the slope of the regression line. Outcomes were incident diabetes-related morbidity and mortality from 6 to 19 years after diabetes diagnosis. The association between change in HbA1c (the slope of the regression line) and clinical outcomes were assessed in adjusted Cox regression models. The median HbA1c level at year one was 60 (IQR: 52–71) mmol/mol or (7.65 (IQR: 6.91–8.62) %). Higher HbA1c levels one year after diagnosis were associated with a higher risk of later diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. An increase in HbA1c during the first 6 years after diabetes diagnosis was associated with later microvascular complications (HR per 1.1 mmol/mol or 0.1% point increase in HbA1c per year; 95% CI) = 1.14; 1.05–1.24). Change in HbA1c did not predict the aggregate outcome ‘any diabetes-related endpoint, all-cause mortality, diabetes-related mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral vascular diseases. We conclude that suboptimal development of glycaemic control during the first 6 years after diabetes diagnosis was an independent risk factor for microvascular complications during the succeeding 13-year follow-up, but not for mortality or macrovascular complications."

Most species of phospholipids were significantly down-regulated in phosphorus-deplete leaves, whereas diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine (DGTS), triglycerides (TG), galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), certain species of glucuronosyldiacylglycerols (GlcADG), and certain species of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) were significantly upregulated, accounting for the change in phosphorus content, as well as structural differences in the leaves of plants growing across regions of varying elemental availability. These data suggest that seagrasses are able to modify the phosphorus content in leaf membranes dependent upon environmental availability."
https://openalex.org/W2989638179,"Objectives The secondary use of medical data contained in electronic medical records, such as hospital discharge letters, is a valuable resource for the improvement of clinical care (e.g. in terms of medication safety) or for research purposes. However, the automated processing and analysis of medical free text still poses a huge challenge to available natural language processing (NLP) systems. The aim of this study was to implement a knowledge-based best of breed approach, combining a terminology server with integrated ontology, a NLP pipeline and a rules engine. Methods We tested the performance of this approach in a use case. The clinical event of interest was the particular drug-disease interaction “proton-pump inhibitor [PPI] use and osteoporosis”. Cases were to be identified based on free text digital discharge letters as source of information. Automated detection was validated against a gold standard. Results Precision of recognition of osteoporosis was 94.19%, and recall was 97.45%. PPIs were detected with 100% precision and 97.97% recall. The F-score for the detection of the given drug-disease-interaction was 96,13%. Conclusion We could show that our approach of combining a NLP pipeline, a terminology server, and a rules engine for the purpose of automated detection of clinical events such as drug-disease interactions from free text digital hospital discharge letters was effective. There is huge potential for the implementation in clinical and research contexts, as this approach enables analyses of very high numbers of medical free text documents within a short time period."

https://openalex.org/W2991170755,"Diabetes in the mother during pregnancy is a risk factor for birth defects and perinatal complications and can affect long-term health of the offspring through developmental programming of susceptibility to metabolic disease. We previously showed that Streptozotocin-induced maternal diabetes in mice is associated with altered cell differentiation and with smaller size of the placenta. Placental size and fetal size were affected by maternal diet in this model, and maternal diet also modulated the risk for neural tube defects. In the present study, we sought to determine the extent to which these effects might be mediated through altered expression of nutrient transporters, specifically glucose and fatty acid transporters in the placenta. Our results demonstrate that expression of several transporters is modulated by both maternal diet and maternal diabetes. Diet was revealed as the more prominent determinant of nutrient transporter expression levels, even in pregnancies with uncontrolled diabetes, consistent with the role of diet in placental and fetal growth. Notably, the largest changes in nutrient transporter expression levels were detected around midgestation time points when the placenta is being formed. These findings place the critical time period for susceptibility to diet exposures earlier than previously appreciated, implying that mechanisms underlying developmental programming can act on placenta formation."
https://openalex.org/W2991400514,"In some species of myxobacteria, adjacent cells sufficiently similar at the adhesin protein TraA can exchange components of their outer membranes. The primary benefits of such outer membrane exchange (OME) in natural populations are unclear, but in some OME interactions, transferred OM content can include SitA toxins that kill OME participants lacking an appropriate immunity gene. Such OME-dependent toxin transfer across Myxococcus xanthus strains that differ only in their sitBAI toxin/antitoxin cassette can mediate inter-strain killing and generate colony-merger incompatibilities (CMIs)-inter-colony border phenotypes between distinct genotypes that differ from respective self-self colony interfaces. Here we ask whether OME-dependent toxin transfer is a common cause of prevalent CMIs and antagonisms between M. xanthus natural isolates identical at TraA. We disrupted traA in eleven isolates from a cm-scale soil population and assayed whether traA disruption eliminated or reduced CMIs between swarming colonies or antagonisms between strains in mixed cultures. Among 33 isolate pairs identical at traA that form clear CMIs, in no case did functional disruption of traA in one partner detectably alter CMI phenotypes. Further, traA disruption did not alleviate strong antagonisms observed during starvation-induced fruiting-body development in seven pairs of strains identical at traA. Collectively, our results suggest that most mechanisms of interference competition and inter-colony kin discrimination in natural populations of myxobacteria do not require OME. Finally, our experiments also indicate that several closely related laboratory reference strains kill some natural isolates by toxins delivered by a shared, OME-independent type VI secretion system (T6SS), suggesting that some antagonisms between sympatric natural isolates may also involve T6SS toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2989912846,"Increasing reliance on electronic medical records at large medical centers provides unique opportunities to perform population level analyses exploring disease progression and etiology. The massive accumulation of diagnostic, procedure, and laboratory codes in one place has enabled the exploration of co-occurring conditions, their risk factors, and potential prognostic factors. While most of the readily identifiable associations in medical records are (now) well known to the scientific community, there is no doubt many more relationships are still to be uncovered in EMR data. In this paper, we introduce a novel finding index to help with that task. This new index uses data mined from real-time PubMed abstracts to indicate the extent to which empirically discovered associations are already known (i.e., present in the scientific literature). Our methods leverage second-generation p-values, which better identify associations that are truly clinically meaningful. We illustrate our new method with three examples: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Optic Neuritis. Our results demonstrate wide utility for identifying new associations in EMR data that have the highest priority among the complex web of correlations and causalities. Data scientists and clinicians can work together more effectively to discover novel associations that are both empirically reliable and clinically understudied."
https://openalex.org/W2990581023,"Escherichia coli O145 serogroup is one of the big six non-O157 Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) that causes foodborne illnesses in the United States and other countries. Cattle are a major reservoir of STEC, which harbor them in their hindgut and shed in the feces. Cattle feces is the main source of hide and subsequent carcass contaminations during harvest leading to foodborne illnesses in humans. The objective of our study was to determine the virulence potential of STEC O145 strains isolated from cattle feces and hide samples. A total of 71 STEC O145 strains isolated from cattle feces (n = 16), hide (n = 53), and human clinical samples (n = 2) were used in the study. The strains were subjected to whole genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform. The average draft genome size of the fecal, hide, and human clinical strains were 5.41, 5.28, and 5.29 Mb, respectively. The average number of genes associated with mobile genetic elements was 260, 238, and 259, in cattle fecal, hide, and human clinical strains, respectively. All strains belonged to O145:H28 serotype and carried eae subtype γ. Shiga toxin 1a was the most common Shiga toxin gene subtype among the strains, followed by stx2a and stx2c. The strains also carried genes encoding type III secretory system proteins, nle, and plasmid-encoded virulence genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering of cattle fecal strains separately from hide strains, and the human clinical strains were more closely related to the hide strains. All the strains belonged to sequence type (ST)-32. The virulence gene profile of STEC O145 strains isolated from cattle sources was similar to that of human clinical strains and were phylogenetically closely related to human clinical strains. The genetic analysis suggests the potential of cattle STEC O145 strains to cause human illnesses. Inclusion of more strains from cattle and their environment in the analysis will help in further elucidation of the genetic diversity and virulence potential of cattle O145 strains."
https://openalex.org/W2990359563,"The aim of our study was to understand how male partners of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome perceive sexuality. Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenology and the Roy Adaptation Model provided the overall framework for this research study. Eighteen participants were recruited through convenience and purposive sampling. Data collection was conducted between February and July of 2017 and included a focus group and twelve in-depth interviews. Two main themes were extracted: ""facing a new sex life"" and ""resisting the loss of the couple’s sexuality"". Fibromyalgia syndrome compromises the couple’s sex life. Enhancing intimacy, skin-to-skin contact (during acute FMS outbreaks), finding new positions, non-coital sex and use of sex toys can increase female desire and help coping."
https://openalex.org/W2990558818,"The overflow of the flame plume from the window is the main cause of the vertical spread of the fire on the facade of the building. This paper considers the geometry of the window by taking measures to prevent the flame from propagating along the vertical wall. In this paper, a residential building is taken as an example to evaluate the flame plume characteristics through experimental tests and numerical simulations. The objective of the present study is to study the flame plume characteristics under the air blow on the outer window side of the building. The theoretical equations of the flame tilt angle, non-dimensional temperature and non-dimensional velocity are derived. A series of experimental tests were carried out in a reduced-scale building model corresponding to the changes of lateral blow ventilation velocity. Reduced scale numerical simulations were conducted to verify the experiments. Results showed that the flame tilt angle increases with ventilation velocity increases. Meanwhile, the experimental results were compared with the reduced-scale tests and numerical simulations. These showed a good agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. All these findings provide theoretical basis for building fire prevention outside window."
https://openalex.org/W2991004953,"Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) has been identified as predominant lactic acid bacteria in spontaneously fermented dairy products (FDPs) in sub-Saharan Africa including Cote d'Ivoire. However, Sii belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC). Most SBSEC members are assumed to be involved as opportunistic pathogens in serious diseases in both humans and animals. A population-based cross-sectional survey, including 385 participants was conducted in Korhogo, northern Cote d'Ivoire, to identify risk factors for Sii fecal carriage, including consumption of local FDPs. A structured questionnaire was used to gather participant's socio-demographic and economic characteristics, their relation to livestock and dietary habits. In addition, fresh stool and milk samples were collected. The identification of Sii was done using a SBSEC-specific PCR assay targeting 16S rRNA and groEL genes. The overall prevalence of SBSEC and Sii carriage was 23.2% (confidence interval CI 95% = 18.9-27.5) and 12.0% (CI 95% = 8.4-15.5) for stool, respectively. Prevalence of Sii was significantly higher in consumers of artisanal butter compared with non-consumers (57.1% vs 10.1%, odds ratio OR: 11.9, 95% CI: 3.9-36.6), as well as in persons handling livestock (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.6-9.3) and livestock primary products (OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 2.3-14.3). The closer contact with livestock was a risk factor for Sii fecal carriage. Sii strains were isolated from fresh and fermented milk products with a prevalence of 30.4% and 45.4%, respectively. Analysis of Sii population structure through the SBSEC multi locus sequence typing assay revealed a close relationship across human and dairy isolates, possibly linked to a Kenyan human isolate. All these outcomes underline the interest of in-depth investigations on the ecology, potential reservoirs and pathways of contamination by Sii at the human-animal-environment interface in comparison to yet to be collected data from Europe, Asia and the Americas to further elucidate the various roles of Sii."
https://openalex.org/W2991597158,"This study investigated the consequences of a low supply of dietary Ca with or without a low dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) during early lactation on bone mobilization and reconstitution during lactation and on the dynamics of milk Ca content. Fifteen multiparous Holstein cows were distributed among 3 treatments 5 weeks before their expected calving date. These treatments differed based on the provision of diets through the first 10 weeks of lactation. During this period, the control treatment (NCa) consisted of a diet providing 100% of the Ca requirement, with a DCAD of 200 mEq/kg dry matter (DM). The LCa (low Ca) and LCaLD (low Ca, low DCAD) treatments consisted of diets providing 70% of the Ca requirement, with a DCAD of 200 and 0 mEq/kg DM, respectively. After 10 weeks, all cows received the same total mixed ration, which was formulated to meet 100% of the Ca requirement. LCa and LCaLD tended to decrease the body retention of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation compared with NCa but affected neither the dynamics of the blood biomarkers of bone formation and resorption during lactation nor the body retention of Ca at 17 weeks of lactation. Cows almost entirely compensated for the decrease in Ca supply caused by LCa and LCaLD by increasing their apparent digestive absorption of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation, whereas their apparent digestive absorption was unaffected by the treatments at 17 weeks of lactation. Milk production tended to be lower throughout lactation with LCa and LCaLD compared with NCa, with a mean difference of 2 kg/d. The results of this study also indicated that measuring the dynamics of milk Ca content during lactation cannot be considered effective for indirectly estimating the dynamics of bone mobilization in cows. The results also suggested that limited Ca intake at the beginning of lactation may have deleterious effects on milk production."
https://openalex.org/W2989941946,"Large carnivores are recolonizing many regions in Europe, where their ungulate prey have lived without them for >150 years. Whether the returning large carnivores will modify ungulate behavior and indirectly affect lower trophic levels, depends on the ability of ungulates to recognize risk based on past encounters and cues indicating carnivore presence. In two case studies, we tested, by means of camera trapping, the behavioral response of deer to wolf urine. The first case study was in the Netherlands where deer (still) live in absence of wolves, and the second in Poland with long-term wolf presence. As controls we used water (no scent) and all-purpose soap (unfamiliar scent). Deer vigilance level on control plots was 20% in both case studies indicating that wolf occupancy per se does not lead to a consistent difference in behavior. Placing wolf urine did not significantly affect deer behavior in either the wolf-absent or the wolf-present area. More intense cues, or a combination of cues, are likely needed to affect deer behavior. Moreover, we found an unexpected reaction of deer towards all-purpose soap of reduced foraging (and tendency for increased vigilance) in the wolf-present area, whereas it did not affect deer behavior in the wolf-absent area. We hypothesize that deer associate all-purpose soap with human presence, causing no response in human-dominated landscapes (the Netherlands), but triggering a behavioral reaction in more remote areas (Poland). This illustrates attention should be paid to controls used in scent experiments as they may be associated differently than intended."
https://openalex.org/W2990878672,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate to what extent different assays of innate immunity reveal similar patterns of variation across ungulate species. We compared several measures of innate antibacterial immune function across seven different ungulate species using blood samples obtained from captive animals maintained in a zoological park. We measured mRNA expression of two receptors involved in innate pathogen detection, toll-like receptors 2 and 5 (TLR2 and 5), the bactericidal capacity of plasma, as well as the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Species examined included aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), American bison (Bison bison bison), yak (Bos grunniens), Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti), fallow deer (Dama dama), sika deer (Cervus nippon), and Damara zebra (Equus quagga burchellii). Innate immunity varied among ungulate species. However, we detected strong, positive correlations between the different measures of innate immunity–specifically, TLR2 and TLR5 were correlated, and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was positively associated with TLR2, TLR5, and bacterial killing ability. Our results suggest that ecoimmunological study results may be quite robust to the choice of assays, at least for antibacterial innate immunity; and that, despite the complexity of the immune system, important sources of variation in immunity in natural populations may be discoverable with comparatively simple tools."
https://openalex.org/W2991547018,"A detailed osteological study of the poorly known and critical endangered ghost knifefish, Tembeassu marauna, from the rio Paraná, Brazil, was conducted using X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT scan). A redescription of the external anatomy was performed, including the unusual presence of a rostral patch of extra teeth on the region of the upper lip anterior to the premaxilla and the prominent anterior fleshy expansions in both upper and lower lips. The newly surveyed characters were included and analyzed in light of a recent morphological data matrix for Gymnotiformes. In spite of some uncertainties that remains as to phylogenetic allocation of the genus, the most probable hypothesis is that Tembeassu is the sister group of a clade that includes Megadontognathus and Apteronotus sensu stricto. The phylogenetic analysis also supports that Tembeassu is considered a valid genus of Apteronotidae. An amended diagnosis for the genus is also provided."
https://openalex.org/W2989933547,"This study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators to improve the use of health technology assessment (HTA) for the selection of medicines listed in the e-Catalogue and the national formulary in Indonesia.Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit the stakeholders consisting of policymakers, a pharmaceutical industry representative, healthcare providers, and patients. The data were analyzed using directed content analysis and following the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative studies (COREQ).The twenty-five participants interviewed agreed with the use of HTA for supporting the e-Catalogue and the national formulary and perceived the advantages of HTA implementation outweighed the disadvantages. Barriers mentioned were a lack of capability of local human resources, financial incentives, a clear framework and insufficient data. Strategies suggested to overcome the barriers were establishing (inter)national networks to build up capacity, setting up departments of HTA in several universities in Indonesia, and introducing a clear HTA framework. Facilitators mentioned were the ambition to achieve universal health coverage, the presence of legal frameworks to implement HTA in the e-Catalogue and the national formulary, and the demands for appropriate medicine policies.Several barriers are currently hampering broad implementation of HTA in medicine pricing and reimbursement policy in Indonesia. Solutions to these issues appear feasible and important facilitators exist."
https://openalex.org/W2990789434,"The prostrate cultivars of ground-cover chrysanthemum have been used in landscape gardening due to their small stature, large crown width and strong branching ability. qRT-PCR is a rapid and powerful tool for gene expression analysis, while its accuracy highly depends on the stability of reference genes. The paucity of authentic reference genes presents a major hurdle in understanding the genetic regulators of prostrate architecture. Therefore, in order to reveal the regulatory mechanism of prostrate growth of chrysanthemum stems, here, stable reference genes were selected for expression analysis of key genes involved in shoot development and graviresponse. Based on transcriptome data, eleven reference genes with relatively stable expression were identified as the candidate reference genes. After the comprehensive analysis of the stability of these reference genes with four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder), we found that TIP41 was the most stable reference gene in all of the samples. SAND was determined as a superior reference gene in different genotypes and during the process of shoot development. The optimal reference gene for gravitropic response was PP2A-1. In addition, the expression patterns of LA1 and PIN1 further verified the reliability of the screened reference genes. These results can provide more accurate and reliable qRT-PCR normalization for future studies on the expression patterns of genes regulating plant architecture of chrysanthemums."

https://openalex.org/W2990494008,"Species of terebratulide brachiopods have been largely characterized qualitatively on the basis of morphology. Furthermore, species-level morphological variability has rarely been analyzed within a quantitative framework. The objective of our research is to quantify morphological variation to test the validity of extant named species of terebratulide brachiopods, focusing on the lophophore-supporting structures—the “long loops.” Long loops are the most distinctive and complex morphological feature in terebratellidine brachiopods and are considered to be phylogenetically and taxonomically informative. We studied eight species with problematic species identities in three genera distributed in the North Pacific: Laqueus, Terebratalia, and Dallinella. Given how geometrically complex long loops are, we generated 3D models from computed tomography (CT) scans of specimens of these eight species and analyzed them using 3D geometric morphometrics. Our goal was to determine ranges of variation and to test whether species are clearly distinguishable from one another in morphospace and statistically. Previous studies have suggested that some species might be overly split and are indistinguishable. Our results show that these extant species of terebratellidines can be reliably distinguished on the basis of quantitative loop morphometrics. Using 3D geometric morphometric methods, we demonstrate the utility of CT beyond purely descriptive imaging purposes in testing the morphometric validity of named species. It is crucial to treat species described and named from qualitative morphology as working hypotheses to be tested; many macroevolutionary studies depend upon the accurate assessment of species in order to identify and seek to explain macroevolutionary patterns. Our results provide quantitative documentation of the distinction of these species and thus engender greater confidence in their use to characterize macroevolutionary patterns among extant terebratellidine brachiopods. These methods, however, require further testing in extinct terebratellidines, which only rarely preserve the delicate long loop in three dimensions. In addition, molecular analyses of extant terebratellidines will test the species delimitations supported by the morphometric analyses presented in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2991147460,"Most interventions aimed at improving social interactions either target internalising or externalising problem behaviour in children. However, a recent review shows that a transdiagnostic approach might fit better to the diversity of problems within a group and within an individual (comorbidity). We examined the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic intervention, called Topper Training: a cognitive behavioural intervention in the peer group with parents included, that targets both internalising and externalising behaviour problems. A randomised trial with a waiting list control group was conducted, using 132 children with mild to severe psychosocial problems. Children were randomised into 77 intervention and 55 waiting list children (50% boys; age = 8–11 years). GLM repeated measures analyses yielded significant intervention effects directly after the training on parent-reported (but not teacher-reported) emotional symptoms (Cohen’s d = .70), peer relationship problems (d = .41), and impact of these problems (d = .59). Significant effects were also found for child-perceived peer victimisation (d = .62), self-esteem (d = .45) and teacher-reported conduct problems (d = .42). Parent-reported effects on emotional, conduct problems and impact of the problems and child-reported effects on self-esteem were clinically relevant. No significant effects of Topper Training were found for prosocial behaviour and bullying. Within-participant t-tests in the intervention group between post-intervention and follow-up indicated that effects extended over a six-month follow-up period. Depression decreased significantly from post-test to follow-up. In conclusion, children with mild to severe internalising and/or externalising problems can benefit from the transdiagnostic Topper Training intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2991375812,"Hypoxia is one of the key factors affecting the survival of islet cells transplanted via the portal vein. Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) is the only imaging technique that can detect the level of blood oxygen level in vivo. However, so far no study has indicated that BOLD-fMRI can be applied to monitor the liver oxygen level after islet transplantation.To evaluate the value of Carbogen-challenge BOLD MRI in assessing the level of hypoxia in liver tissue after portal microcapsules implanted.Fifty-one New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three experimental groups (15 in each group) were transplanted microencapsulated 1000 microbeads/kg (PV1 group), 3000 microbeads/kg (PV2 group), 5000 microbeads/kg (PV3 group), and 6 rabbits were injected with the same amount of saline as the control group, BOLD-fMRI was performed following carbogen breathing in each group after transplantation on 1d, 2d, 3d and 7d, T2* weighted image, R2* value and ΔR2* value parameters for the liver tissue. Pathological examinations including liver gross pathology, H&E staining and pimonidazole immunohistochemistry were performed after BOLD-fMRI. The differences of pathological results among each group were compared. The ΔR2* values and transplanted doses were analyzed.ΔR2* values at the 1-3d and 7d after transplantation were significantly different in each groups (P<0.05). ΔR2* values decreased gradually with the increase of transplanted dose, and was negatively correlated with transplant dose at 3d after transplantation (r = -0.929, P <0.001). Liver histopathological examination showed that the degree of hypoxia of liver tissue increased with the increase of transplanted doses, Carbogen-challenge BOLD-fMRI can assess the degree of liver hypoxia after portal microcapsules implanted, which provided a monitoring method for early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2990966055,"We recently provided highly suggestive preliminary evidence that the renal interstitium contracts reactively in vivo. We demonstrated that renal medullary direct interstitial volume expansion (rmDIVE = 100 μl bolus infusion of 0.9% saline (SS)/30 s) brought about a biphasic renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) response which was abolished when dibutyryl-cAMP was concomitant and interstitially infused. To assess more deeply the feasibility of the concept that the renal interstitium contracts in vivo, two experimental series (S1, S2) were performed in hydropenic rats subjected to acute left renal-denervation, hormonal clamping, and control of renal arterial pressure. In S1, RIHP and renal outer medullary blood flow (RoMBF) were continuously measured before and after a sudden micro-bolus (5μl) injection, into the renal medullary interstitium, of SS containing α-trinositol (α-TNS, anti-inflammatory drug) to either two doses 2 or 4 mM (SS + 2 α-TNS and SS + 4 α-TNS groups). No overall differences between groups in either ΔRIHP or %ΔRoMBF time courses were found; however, in the SS + 2 α-TNS group the data were less scattered and the ΔRIHP time course tended to peak faster and then persisted there, so that, this α-TNS dose was selected for S2. In S2, RIHP and RoMBF were similarly measured in rats randomly assigned to three groups: the CTR group (sham time-control), SS group (SS alone), and SS + α-TNS group. The micro-bolus injection of SS alone (SS group) was unable to increase ΔRIHP. The group with no micro-bolus injection (CTR group) experienced a decrease in ΔRIHP. The micro-bolus injection of SS + 2 α-TNS was accompanied by a differential increase in ΔRIHP (vs. CTR and SS groups). These responses were not associated with differential changes among groups in %ΔRoMBF or hemodilution parameters. These results provide additional evidence that the renal interstitium contracts in vivo."
