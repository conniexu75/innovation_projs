https://openalex.org/W1985062663,"THE industrial use of hexanitrodiphenylamine (dipicrylamine, DPA) and the consequent exposure of human beings to it led us to study the chronic toxicity of this compound in experimental animals. In the first part of a feeding test with rats, the substance appeared to have a low toxicity ; but towards the end of the life-span of animals which were fed with large amounts of hexanitrodiphenylamine, we were surprised to see that all the females had big and often multiple mammary tumours. These were fibroadenomata, adenofibromata or fibromata of the same type as occur spontaneously in our rats."

Ketonuria was marked, but was not accompanied by severe acidosis. These observations are in contrast with those on the depancreatized cat or dog, and the question arises whether a pure beta-cell deficiency diabetes induced by alloxan in the pig is also different from the corresponding condition in other animals. No account of this form of experimental diabetes in the pig has been found in the literature, and this is a preliminary report on the effects of alloxan on the young pig."
