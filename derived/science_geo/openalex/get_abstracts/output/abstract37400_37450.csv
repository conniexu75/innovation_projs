https://openalex.org/W1493824599,"We have investigated the composition and function of membrane microparticles released from platelets exposed to the C5b-9 proteins of the complement system. Gel-filtered human platelets were incubated with sub-lytic amounts of the purified C5b-9 proteins and the distribution of surface antigens was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. C5b-9 assembly caused secretory fusion of the alpha-granule membrane with the plasma membrane and the release of membrane vesicles (approximately 0.1-micron diameter) that contained the plasma membrane glycoproteins (GP) GP Ib and GP IIb-IIIa as well as the alpha-granule membrane protein GMP-140. These microparticles were highly enriched in the C9 neoantigen of the C5b-9 complex. The apparent surface density of C5b-9 on the microparticles was approximately 10(3)-fold higher than on the platelet itself, suggesting that the vesicles were selectively shed from the plasma membrane at the site of C5b-9 insertion. C5b-9 induced the expression of an activation-dependent epitope (recognized by monoclonal antibody, PAC1) in GP IIb-IIIa on the platelet surface but not in GP IIb-IIIa on the microparticles. The surface of the microparticles was also highly enriched in alpha-granule-derived coagulation factor V (or Va), accounting for nearly half of all the membrane-bound factor V detected. The number of potential membrane binding sites for factor Va was probed by adding saturating concentrations of factor Va light chain. Under these conditions, the density of factor Va binding sites on the microparticle surface exceeded that on the C5b-9-treated platelet by three to four orders of magnitude. Moreover, the microparticles provided most of the membrane surface for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by VaXa. These studies demonstrate that the microparticles shed by C5b-9-treated platelets (and not the platelets themselves) provide the principal binding sites for coagulation factor Va and the principal catalytic surface for the prothrombinase complex. Platelet-derived microparticles formed during complement activation in vivo could provide a membrane surface that facilitates the assembly and dissemination of procoagulant enzyme complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2014594279,Neutrophils kill microorganisms with oxygen radicals generated by an oxidase that uses the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as substrate. This system requires both membrane and cytosolic components and is defective in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. A cytosolic complex capable of activating latent membrane oxidase was eluted from guanosine triphosphate-agarose and was used to raise polyclonal antiserum that recognized 47- and 67-kilodalton proteins. These proteins were restricted to the cytosol of myeloid cells. Both proteins were associated with NADPH oxidase-activating capacity when neutrophil cytosol was purified on nucleotide affinity matrices or molecular sizing columns. Neutrophils from patients with two different forms of autosomal chronic granulomatous disease lacked either the 47- or 67-kilodalton protein.
https://openalex.org/W1543999675,"The glycoinositol phospholipid membrane anchor of human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) contains a novel inositol phospholipid which in this and the accompanying paper (Roberts, W.L., Santikarn, S., Reinhold, V.N., and Rosenberry, T.L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem 263, 18776-18784) is shown to be a plasmanylinositol that is palmitoylated on the inositol ring. The inositol phospholipid was radiolabeled with the photoactivated reagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I] iodophenyl)diazirine and characterized by various chemical and enzymatic cleavage procedures whose products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography or gas chromatography. Acidic methanolysis of human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (Ehu AChE) revealed 18:0 and 18:1 alkylglycerols (0.55 and 0.20 mol/mol AChE, respectively). Acetolysis was shown by TLC to release alkylacylglycerol acetates from Ehu AChE. Analysis by gas chromatography revealed that 83% of the alkylacylglycerol acetates contained an 18:0 or 18:1 1-alkyl group and a 22:4 (n - 6), 22:5 (n - 3), or 22:6 (n - 3) 2-acyl group. The inositol phospholipid is linked to the anchor by a glucosamine in glycosidic linkage, and deamination with nitrous acid cleaved the glycosidic linkage and released the phospholipid. The deamination and acetolysis products from Ehu AChE were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and fatty acid analysis following acidic methanolysis of the purified products revealed that 2 fatty acid residues were associated with the deamination product and only one with the alkylacylglycerol acetolysis product. The other fatty acid residue was primarily palmitate and was indicated to be in ester linkage to an inositol hydroxyl(s). This linkage was shown to be responsible for the resistance of the inositol phospholipid to cleavage by Staphylococcus aureus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase. Deacylation of the inositol phospholipid deamination product by treatment with base removed this palmitoyl group and facilitated release of alkyl- and alkylacylglycerol species by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C with concomitant formation of inositol 1-phosphate. In contrast, digestion of Ehu AChE with a recently reported anchor-specific phospholipase D resulted in release of plasmanic acids from the intact palmitoylated plasmanylinositol."

https://openalex.org/W1984200009,"Chronic granulomatous diseases of childhood (CGD) are a group of disorders of phagocytic cell superoxide (O2.-) production (respiratory burst). Anion exchange chromatography separated from normal neutrophil cytosol a 47-kilodalton neutrophil cytosol factor, NCF-1, that restored activity to defective neutrophil cytosol from most patients with autosomally inherited CGD in a cell-free O2.--generating system. A 65-kilodalton factor, NCF-2, restored activity to defective neutrophil cytosol from one patient with autosomal CGD. NCF-1, NCF-2, and a third cytosol fraction, NCF-3, were inactive alone or in pairs, but together replaced unfractionated cytosol in cell-free O2.- generation. Neutrophils deficient in NCF-1, but not NCF-2, did not phosphorylate the 47-kilodalton protein. It is proposed that NCF-1, NCF-2, and NCF-3 are essential for generation of O2.- by phagocytic cells and that genetic abnormalities of these cytosol components can result in the CGD phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1568628251,"The glycoinositol phospholipid membrane anchor of human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) is composed of a glycan linked through a glucosamine residue to an inositol phospholipid that is resistant to the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Deamination cleavage of the glucosamine with nitrous acid released the inositol phospholipid which was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry with negative ion monitoring and by the complementary technique of collision-induced dissociation revealed molecular and daughter ions that indicated a plasmanylinositol with a palmitoyl group on an inositol hydroxyl. The intact membrane anchor was released from reductively methylated human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase by proteolysis with papain or Pronase, deacylated by base hydrolysis, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the major products isolated by high performance liquid chromatography indicated the following structure for the complete glycoinositol phospholipid anchor. (formula; see text) Methylation of free amino groups by reduction with deuterium instead of hydrogen permitted determination of the number of free amino groups in individual fragment ions as further confirmation of structural assignments. The structure of the glycan portion of the human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase membrane anchor appears to be similar to that described for Trypanosome brucei variant surface glycoprotein MITat 1.4 (variant 117) (Ferguson, M.A.J., Homans, S.W., Dwek, R.A., and Rademacher, T.W. (1988) Science 239, 753-759) except for the absence of a galactose antenna and the presence of a phosphorylethanolamine on the hexose adjacent to glucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1569934864,"Abstract A transcriptional cAMP-responsive enhancer element (CRE) consisting of the 8-base pair (bp) palindrome, 5' TGACGTCA 3', is found in several eukaryotic genes. We analyzed the effects on gene transcription of point mutations within the CRE, the influence of the bases surrounding the CRE, and the requirements for transcriptional synergism of tandemly repeated CREs. When inserted as an oligonucleotide with restriction enzyme linker sites, the 8-bp CRE itself is as active in conferring cAMP responsivity on an enhancerless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid as is a single copy of the choriogonadotropin alpha (CG alpha), twice repeated 18-bp sequence containing the CRE. Point mutations in the first (T to A), fourth (C to G), or eighth (A to T) positions of the CRE, when contained within the CG alpha 18-bp sequence, each inhibited transcriptional activity greater than 90%. However, the identical eighth position A to T mutation occurs in the cAMP-responsive sequence of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene, and that mutant sequence in the context of the adjacent bases of the native VIP sequence is maximally cAMP responsive when inserted in the reporter plasmid. The substantially reduced activity of the core 8-bp CRE when synthesized as a cassette including the adjacent bases of the rat glucagon or bovine parathyroid hormone gene further emphasizes the restrictive influence of particular surrounding sequences. Active oligonucleotides containing the 8-bp palindrome and different but equally permissive contexts have comparable properties in transfected reporter genes and gel mobility-shift assays. The pair of tandemly repeated 18-bp elements containing the CRE in the CG alpha gene synergistically stimulate transcription either with paired native CREs or when one native CRE is paired with one mutant CRE, suggesting the presence of cooperative interactions. Tandem insertion of more than two 18-bp sequences, or insertion of additional sequences between the two CREs, inhibits transcription. These observations indicate that the contexts of the bases adjacent to CREs exert profound influences on the transcriptional activities mediated by the cAMP-responsive elements."

https://openalex.org/W2060053228,"Human gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor subunits were expressed transiently in cultured mammalian cells. This expression system allows the simultaneous characterization of ligand-gated ion channels by electrophysiology and by pharmacology. Thus, coexpression of the alpha and beta subunits of the GABAA receptor generated GABA-gated chloride channels and binding sites for GABAA receptor ligands. Channels consisting of only alpha or beta subunits could also be detected. These homomeric channels formed with reduced efficiencies compared to the heteromeric receptors. Both of these homomeric GABA-responsive channels were potentiated by barbiturate, indicating that sites for both ligand-gating and allosteric potentiation are present on receptors assembled from either subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1564788673,"The Ashkenazi Jewish population is enriched for carriers of a fatal form of Tay-Sachs disease, an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-chain of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase A. Until recently it was presumed that Tay-Sachs patients from this ethnic isolate harbored the same alpha-chain mutation. This was disproved by identification of a splice junction defect in the alpha-chain of an Ashkenazi patient which could be found in only 20-30% of the Ashkenazi carriers tested. In this study we have isolated the alpha-chain gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient, GM515, with classic Tay-Sachs disease who was negative for the splice junction defect. Sequence analysis of the promoter region, exon and splice junctions regions, and polyadenylation signal area revealed a 4-base pair insertion in exon 11. This mutation introduces a premature termination signal in exon 11 which results in a deficiency of mRNA in Ashkenazi patients. A dot blot assay was developed to screen patients and heterozygote carriers for the insertion mutation. The lesion was found in approximately 70% of the carriers tested, thereby distinguishing it as the major defect underlying Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population."

https://openalex.org/W1602308712,"The mechanisms whereby P2-purinergic receptors for extracellular ATP are coupled to the inositol phospholipid-signaling system were studied in the HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Brief pretreatment of either undifferentiated or differentiated HL60 cells with various activators of protein kinase C Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (e.g. phorbol myristate acetate) produced a 50-fold decrease in the potency of extracellular ATP to induce mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The ATP-induced increase in rate of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) accumulation in these 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate-treated cells was characterized by a 40% decrease in the maximal rate of InsP3 accumulation. Incubation of the cells with NaF also induced mobilization of the same Ca2+ stores released in response to extracellular ATP; this provided indirect evidence that the transmembrane signaling actions of P2-purinergic receptors may be mediated by GTP-binding regulatory proteins. This latter possibility was further supported by the finding that treatment of either undifferentiated or differentiated HL60 cells with pertussis toxin produced a significant, but partial, inhibition of ATP-induced signaling actions. These included: 1) a 60-70% decrease in the maximum rate of InsP3 accumulation, and 2) a 1.5 log unit increase in the half-maximally effective [ATP] required for mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In cells treated with both pertussis toxin and 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, there was an 80% decrease in maximal rate of ATP-induced InsP3 accumulation and near-complete inhibition of ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Significantly, the residual, pertussis toxin-insensitive portion of ATP-induced signaling was observed in the same samples of differentiated HL60 cells wherein pertussis toxin treatment produced complete abolition of InsP3 accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization in response to occupation of chemotactic peptide receptors. These results indicate that the activation of inositol phospholipid breakdown by P2-purinergic receptors in HL60 cells may be mediated by both pertussis toxin-sensitive and toxin-insensitive mechanisms; this suggests that these myeloid progenitor cells may express two distinct types of GTP-binding proteins coupled to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1591998251,"Two peptide analogs of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-(peptides)) were synthesized and used to probe interactions of the various regulatory domains of the kinase. CaMK-(281-289) contained only Thr286, the major Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation site of the kinase (Schworer, C. M., Colbran, R. J., Keefer, J. R. & Soderling, T. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13486-13489), whereas CaMK-(281-309) contained Thr286 together with the previously identified calmodulin binding and inhibitory domains (Payne, M. E., Fong, Y.-L., Ono, T., Colbran, R. J., Kemp, B. E., Soderling, T. R. & Means, A. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7190-7195). CaMK-(281-309), but not CaMK-(281-289), bound calmodulin and was a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.88 +/- 0.7 microM using 20 microM syntide-2) of exogenous substrate (syntide-2 or glycogen synthase) phosphorylation by a completely Ca2+/calmodulin-independent form of the kinase generated by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin. This inhibition was completely relieved by the inclusion of Ca2+/calmodulin in excess of CaMK-(281-309) in the assays. CaMK-(281-289) was a good substrate (Km = 11 microM; Vmax = 3.15 mumol/min/mg) for the proteolyzed kinase whereas phosphorylation of CaMK-(281-309) showed nonlinear Michaelis-Menton kinetics, with maximal phosphorylation (0.1 mumol/min/mg) at 20 microM and decreased phosphorylation at higher concentrations. The addition of Ca2+/calmodulin to assays stimulated the phosphorylation of CaMK-(281-309) by the proteolyzed kinase approximately 10-fold but did not affect the phosphorylation of CaMK-(281-289). A model for the regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is proposed based on the above observations and results from other laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W1491896962,"The addition of inositol to the growth medium of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in rapid changes in the rates of phospholipid biosynthesis. The partitioning of the phospholipid intermediate CDP-diacylglycerol was shifted to phosphatidylinositol at the expense of phosphatidylserine and its derivatives phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Serine at 133-fold greater concentrations than that of inositol shifted the partitioning of CDP-diacylglycerol to phosphatidylserine at the expense of phosphatidylinositol but to a much lesser degree. Kinetic experiments with pure phosphatidylserine synthase and phosphatidylinositol synthase indicated that the partitioning of CDP-diacylglycerol between phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol was not governed by the affinities both enzymes have for their common substrate CDP-diacylglycerol. Instead, the main regulation of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine synthesis was through the exogenous supply of inositol. The Km of inositol (0.21 mM) for phosphatidylinositol synthase was 9-fold higher than cytosolic concentration of inositol (24 microM). The Km of serine (0.83 mM) for phosphatidylserine synthase was 3-fold below the cytosolic concentration of serine (2.6 mM). Therefore, inositol supplementation resulted in a dramatic increase in the rate of phosphatidylinositol synthesis, whereas serine supplementation resulted in little affect on the rate of phosphatidylserine synthesis. Inositol also contributed to the regulation of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine synthesis by having a direct affect on phosphatidylserine synthase activity. Kinetic experiments with pure phosphatidylserine synthase showed that inositol was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a Ki of 65 microM."
https://openalex.org/W2116553207,"Phospholamban is the major membrane protein of the heart phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. A role for phospholamban in the control of Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been postulated, but the mechanism is incompletely understood. Structural characterization of the purified protein suggests that it is capable of forming a membrane-spanning pore (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, J. L., Wegener, A. D., and Jones, L. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333-13341). The experiments described here tested the hypothesis that canine cardiac phospholamban, isolated in the fully dephosphorylated state, forms ion channels in lipid bilayers. Phospholamban purified by two different methods formed channels that were permeable to cations, exhibited spontaneous openings and closings, and were selective for Ca2+ over K+. Dihydropyridine drugs and ryanodine did not affect channel activity. The putative membrane-spanning portion of the molecule, residues 26-52, also formed channels in the bilayer. The putative regulatory portion of the molecule, residues 2-25, did not. The results suggest that phospholamban may regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ flux by acting as a Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1956056524,"The import of cytochrome c into Neurospora crassa mitochondria was examined at distinct stages in vitro. The precursor protein, apocytochrome c, binds to mitochondria with high affinity and specificity but is not transported completely across the outer membrane in the absence of conversion to holocytochrome c. The bound apocytochrome c is accessible to externally added proteases but at the same time penetrates far enough through the outer membrane to interact with cytochrome c heme lyase. Formation of a complex in which apocytochrome c and cytochrome c heme lyase participate represents the rate-limiting step of cytochrome c import. Conversion from the bound state to holocytochrome c, on the other hand, occurs 10-30-fold faster. Association of apocytochrome c with cytochrome c heme lyase also takes place after solubilizing mitochondria with detergent. We conclude that the bound apocytochrome c, spanning the outer membrane, forms a complex with cytochrome c heme lyase from which it can react further to be converted to holocytochrome c and be translocated completely into the intermembrane space."
https://openalex.org/W1997911454,"In whole cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubation of precursor mRNA transcripts encoding the sequences essential in vivo for forming the 3' end of the iso-1-cytochrome c mRNA (CYC1) revealed an endonuclease activity with the characteristics required for producing the mature mRNA 3' end. The observed cleavage in vitro is (i) accurate, occurring at or near the polyadenylation site of CYC1 RNA, (ii) 30 to 50 percent efficient, (iii) adenosine triphosphate dependent, (iv) specific for the 3' ends of at least two yeast pre-mRNA's, and (v) absent with related pre-mRNA's carrying mutations that abolish correct 3' end formation in vivo. In addition, a second activity in the extract polyadenylates the product under appropriate conditions. Thus, the mature 3' ends of yeast mRNA's may be generated by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation rather than by transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W1563929437,"Hydropathy analysis of the Mr 27,000 rat liver gap junction protein sequence deduced from a cDNA clone has suggested the presence of four transmembrane segments (Paul, D. L. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 123-134). In the present report, several features of the molecular topology of the protein were investigated by microsequence analysis of peptides generated by treatment of isolated gap junctions with a variety of proteases. Under the experimental conditions used, the proteases had access only to the portion of the Mr 27,000 protein that was originally (in vivo) the cytoplasmic surface of the gap junction. Microsequencing of the peptides resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the amino terminus of the protein is disposed at or near the cytoplasmic surface of the gap junction, and that this surface also contains a protease-hypersensitive hydrophilic sequence between residues 109 and 123, presumably connecting the second and third transmembrane segments. Immunocytological localization of binding of monoclonal antipeptide antibodies demonstrates that the carboxyl terminus of the protein is also localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the gap junction. No protease sensitivity was found in the hydrophilic sequences thought to connect either the first and second transmembrane segments or the third and fourth segments, supporting the model's prediction that these sequences face the narrow intercellular gap which cannot be penetrated by proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1942230339,"A genomic clone encoding the gene for the mouse M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor has been isolated, placed under the control of the zinc-inducible mouse metallothionein promoter, and transfected into mouse Y1 adrenal cells. The receptor concentration was about 300 fmol/mg membrane protein in the absence of zinc and could be increased to 4000 fmol/mg membrane protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of zinc. The receptor expressed in zinc-induced cells exhibits the high affinity binding for quinuclidinyl benzilate, atropine, and pirenzepine expected of the M1 muscarinic receptor. The M1 receptor when expressed in Y1 or L cells is physiologically active, as measured by agonist-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism, but does not inhibit forskolin stimulation of cAMP accumulation. In contrast, a cloned M2 muscarinic receptor when expressed in Y1 cells is able to inhibit forskolin stimulation of cAMP accumulation, but is unable to stimulate phosphatidylinositol metabolism. The stimulation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism mediated by the M1 receptor was not altered by prior treatment of Y1 cells with concentrations of islet-activating protein sufficient to eliminate M2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The cloned M1 receptor gene thus exhibits both the pharmacological and physiological properties expected of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. In addition, these results indicate that different subtypes of the muscarinic receptor are coupled to different physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1611251110,"The periplasmic hydrogenase of Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenbourough NCIB 8303) belongs to the category of [Fe] hydrogenase which contains only iron-sulfur clusters as its prosthetic groups. Amino acid analyses were performed on the purified D. vulgaris hydrogenase. The amino acid composition obtained compared very well with the result derived from the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene (Voordouw, G., Brenner, S. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 148, 515-520). Detailed EPR reductive titration studies on the D. vulgaris hydrogenase were performed to characterize the metal centers in this hydrogenase. In addition to the three previously observed EPR signals (namely, the isotropic 2.02 signal, the rhombic 2.10 signal, and the complex signal of the reduced enzyme), a rhombic signal with resonances at the g-values of 2.06, 1.96, and 1.89 (the rhombic 2.06 signal) was detected when the samples were poised at potentials between 0 and -250 mV (with respect to normal hydrogen electrode). The midpoint redox potentials for each of the four EPR-active species were determined, and the characteristics of each EPR signal are described. Both the rhombic 2.10 and 2.06 signals exhibit spectral properties that are distinct from a ferredoxin-type [4Fe-4S] cluster and are proposed to originate from the same H2-binding center but in two different conformations. The complex signal of the reduced hydrogenase has been shown to represent two spin-spin interacting ferredoxin-type [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters (Grande, H. J., Dunham, W. R., Averill, B., Van Dijk, C., and Sands, R. H. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 136, 201-207). The titration data indicated a strong cooperative effect between these two clusters during their reduction. In an effort to accurately estimate the number of iron atoms/molecule of hydrogenase, plasma emission and chemical methods were used to determine the iron contents in the samples; and four different methods, including amino acid analysis, were used for protein determination. The resulting iron stoichiometries were found to be method-dependent and vary over a wide range (+/- 20%). The uncertainties involved in the determination of iron stoichiometry are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559171641,"We have purified putative L-type Ca2+ channels from chick heart by virtue of their associated high affinity receptors for the Ca2+ channel effectors, dihydropyridines (DHPs), and phenylalkylamines (PAAs). A peptide of 185,000-190,000 daltons was found to comigrate with the peak of DHP binding activity during purification through two successive cycles of lectin affinity chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A previously described peptide of 140,000 daltons, whose Mr was increased to approximately 180,000 under nonreducing conditions, also copurified with the 185-kDa peptide and dihydropyridine binding activity. When cardiac membranes were photolabeled with either the dihydropyridine [3H]azidopine or the PAA [3H]azidopamil prior to purification, a single, specifically labeled component of 185,000-190,000 daltons was present in the purified fractions. The properties of this 185-kDa cardiac DHP/PAA receptor were compared to the smaller 165-kDa DHP/PAA receptor previously purified from skeletal muscle. Antibodies raised against the 165-kDa skeletal muscle DHP/PAA receptor reacted with both rabbit and chick skeletal muscle receptors, but only poorly recognized, if at all, the cardiac 185-190 kDa component. The 185-kDa peptide present in the purified fractions obtained from cardiac muscle did not undergo substantial phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, while the purified 165-kDa peptide from rabbit and chick skeletal muscle was a good substrate for this kinase. The results show that the DHP and PAA receptors in cardiac muscle are contained in a 185-190-kDa peptide that is significantly larger than, and structurally and immunologically different from, it skeletal muscle counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W1579795672,"The effects of fasting/refeeding and untreated or insulin-treated diabetes on the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase and its mRNA in rat liver were determined. Both enzymatic activities fell to 20% of control values with fasting or streptozotocin-induced diabetes and were coordinately restored to normal within 48 h of refeeding or 24 h of insulin administration. These alterations in enzymatic activities were always mirrored by corresponding changes in amount of enzyme as determined by phosphoenzyme formation and immunoblotting. In contrast, mRNA for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase did not decrease during starvation or in diabetes, but there was a 3-6-fold increase upon refeeding a high carbohydrate diet to starved rats or insulin treatment of diabetic rats. The decrease of the enzyme in starved or diabetic rats without associated changes in mRNA levels suggests a decrease in the rate of mRNA translation, an increase in enzyme degradation, or both. The rise in enzyme amount and mRNA for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase with refeeding and insulin treatment suggests an insulin-dependent stimulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression. Northern blots of RNA from heart, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle probed with restriction fragments of a full-length cDNA from liver showed that only skeletal muscle contained an RNA species that hybridized to any of the probes. Skeletal muscle mRNA for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was 2.0 kilobase pairs but in contrast to the liver message (2.2 kilobase pairs) was not regulated by refeeding."
https://openalex.org/W1524090380,"Abstract A human placental soluble 5'-nucleotidase has been separated from 5'-nucleotidase and nonspecific phosphatase by AMP-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The enzyme was purified 8000-fold to a specific activity of 25.6 mumol/min/mg. The subunit molecular mass is 53 kDa, and the native molecular mass is 210 kDa, suggesting a tetrameric structure. Soluble high Km 5'-nucleotidase is most active with IMP and GMP and their deoxy derivatives. IMP is hydrolyzed 15 times faster than AMP. The enzyme has a virtually absolute requirement for magnesium ions and is regulated by them. Purine nucleoside 5'-triphosphates strongly activate the enzyme with the potency order dATP greater than ATP greater than GTP. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate activates the enzyme as potently as ATP. Three millimolar ATP decreased the Km for IMP from 0.33 to 0.09 mM and increased the Vmax 12-fold. ATP activation was modified by the IMP concentration. At 20 microM IMP the ATP-dependent activation curve was sigmoidal, while at 2 mM IMP it was hyperbolic. The A0.5 values for ATP were 2.26 and 0.70 mM, and the relative maximal velocities were 32.9 and 126.0 nmol/min, respectively. Inorganic phosphate shifts the hyperbolic substrate velocity relationship for IMP to a sigmoidal one. With physiological concentrations of cofactors (3 mM ATP, 1-4 mM Pi, 150 mM KCl) at pH 7.4, the enzyme is 25-35 times more active toward 100 microM IMP than 100 microM AMP. These data show that: (a) soluble human placental high Km 5'-nucleotidase coexists in human placenta with the low Km enzyme; (b) under physiological conditions the enzyme favors the hydrolysis of IMP and is critically regulated by IMP, ATP, and Pi levels; and (c) kinetic properties of ATP and IMP are each modified by the other compound suggesting complex interaction of the associated binding sites."

These cells exhibit a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd = 0.51 +/- 0.25 nM) with an average density of 55,000 +/- 5,000 binding sites/cell. After solubilization with detergent, the receptor retained its ability to bind free TNF-alpha but failed to bind to TNF-alpha immobilized on various solid supports. For receptor purification, 125I-TNF-alpha was covalently attached to the receptor on intact cells by the bifunctional cross-linking reagents ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) or 3,3-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate). The cells were then solubilized with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, and the supernatants, clarified by centrifugation, were passed over an IgG-Sepharose column prepared from TNF-alpha antiserum. The receptor-rich fraction from the antibody column was further purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These two steps together provided approximately 165,000-fold purification of the TNF-alpha receptor. The TNF-alpha receptor-ligand complex obtained by this method had a subunit molecular weight of 100,000 +/- 5,000 when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but on gel filtration the complex migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 480,000 +/- 32,000. However, the receptor showed a molecular weight of 65,000 +/- 32,000 when gel filtration was performed in the absence of ligand. Additional characteristics of the receptor are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552398236,"Transforming growth factor type beta (TGF beta) alters the cellular response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) for a variety of processes ranging from early transport activities and gene transcription to mitogenesis. In order to test the hypothesis that altered signal transduction mechanisms may mediate both the transforming effects of TGF beta and the modulation of EGF-stimulated processes by TGF beta, we have examined second messenger levels in response to growth factor treatment. The addition of EGF or prolonged treatment with TGF beta increased the rate of 45Ca influx in serum-deprived, confluent Rat-1 cells, while the addition of EGF to TGF beta-pretreated cells produced an additive increase in Ca2+ influx. The stimulation of Ca2+ influx by TGF beta was only observed at incubation times greater than 1 h and was inhibited by inclusion of actinomycin D, suggesting that a newly transcribed gene product was required for the observed response to TGF beta. Both EGF and TGF beta displayed similar time and concentration dependencies for stimulation of Ca2+ influx and for accumulation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The increase in IP3 accumulation in response to either EGF or TGF beta required the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and the observed concentration dependencies were similar for the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover and Ca2+ influx. The EGF- and TGF beta-stimulated increases in Ca2+ influx could be blocked by cobalt, cadmium, and [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)] tetraacetic acid, but not by specific Ca2+ channel blockers such as nifedipine or verapamil, suggesting that these growth factors do not act via L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Those calcium blockers which inhibited Ca2+ influx also inhibited inositol phosphate release. These data, taken together, indicate that Ca2+ influx and inositol phosphate release are coupled in Rat-1 cells and suggest that influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium is responsible for the changes in IP3 accumulation observed in response to both EGF and TGF beta."
https://openalex.org/W1581758335,"Two mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the intracellular pH (pHi) of aortic smooth muscle cells: the Na+/H+ antiporter and a Na+-independent HCO3-/Cl- antiporter. The Na+/H+ antiporter acts as a cell alkalinizing mechanism. It is activated by vasopressin and by phorbol esters when cells are incubated in the presence of bicarbonate but is not affected in the absence of bicarbonate. The HCO3-/Cl- antiporter acts as a cell acidifying mechanism. Agents such as forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and isoproterenol which raise intracellular cAMP levels inhibit the HCO3-/Cl- antiporter by shifting its pHi dependence in the alkaline direction. Thus, within the same cell type, different hormones control pHi variations by acting on different pHi regulating systems. An increase in pHi can be achieved either by a stimulation of a cell alkalinizing mechanism or by inhibition of a cell acidifying mechanism. A change of the activity of one pHi regulating mechanism modifies the responsiveness of the other to regulatory agents. Bicarbonate turns on the HCO3-/Cl- antiporter, decreases pHi and allows its regulation by protein kinase C through the Na+/H+ antiporter. Inhibition of the HCO3-/Cl- antiporter by cAMP increases the pHi and switches off the protein kinase C-mediated regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1544683983,"The expression of the major protein of rabbit pulmonary surfactant (SP-A), a glycoprotein of Mr congruent to 29,000-36,000, is regulated during development and by hormones. In the present study, utilizing a cDNA insert complementary to mRNA coding for SP-A and nuclear transcription elongation assays, we have investigated the developmental and hormonal regulation of transcription of the SP-A gene in rabbit fetal lung tissue. The relative rates of transcription of SP-A mRNA increased as a function of the gestational age of the fetus. The rate of transcription reached a maximum level in lung tissues of 28-day gestational age fetuses and declined slightly in those of neonatal rabbits. The relative rate of transcription of SP-A mRNA increased in rabbit fetal lung explants maintained in organ culture in control medium as a function of incubation time. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) treatment of fetal lung explants increased the rate of transcription of SP-A mRNA over that of control tissues by several-fold; after 12 h of incubation in the presence of Bt2cAMP, there was greater than 4-fold increase in the rate of transcription of SP-A mRNA as compared to control lung explants. In contrast, glucocorticoids had a rapid effect to decrease the rate of SP-A mRNA transcription. The rapid effect of glucocorticoids to inhibit the transcription of SP-A mRNA was transient; in fetal lung explants incubated in the presence of dexamethasone for greater than 24 h, there was an increase in the rate of transcription of SP-A mRNA over that of control explants. Cycloheximide caused an inhibition of both basal as well as Bt2cAMP-stimulated rates of transcription of SP-A mRNA in the rabbit fetal lung tissue in vitro. This finding is suggestive of a role of labile protein factor(s) in mediating transcription of the SP-A gene as well as its induction by Bt2cAMP. The magnitude of changes in the relative rates of transcription of SP-A mRNA during development of rabbit fetal lung in vitro as well as those effected by hormones in vitro were similar to changes in the steady-state levels of SP-A mRNA, suggestive that the regulation of the levels of SP-A mRNA in fetal rabbit lung tissue both in vivo and in vitro occurs primarily at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1498574086,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the human parathyroid hormone-related peptide (hPTHrp) were used to characterize the interaction of hPTHrp with parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors in clonal rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). Both hPTHrp-(1-34) and [Tyr40]hPTHrp-(1-40) showed full agonist activity in stimulating cyclic AMP accumulation in ROS cells; human PTHrp-(1-34) was approximately 2.5-fold as potent as hPTH-(1-34). Both [Tyr-40]hPTHrp-(3-40) and hPTH-(3-34) inhibited the cyclic AMP increase induced by either hPTHrp or PTH with parallel dose-inhibition curves. Binding to intact ROS cells of a 125I-labeled [Tyr40]hPTHrp-(1-40) (125I-[Tyr40]hPTHrp-(1-40)) which retains full biological activity was time- and temperature-dependent and reversible. Binding of 125I-[Tyr40]hPTHrp-(1-40) and 125I-labeled [Nle8, Nle18, Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)NH2 to ROS cells was competed for, to the same extent and with the comparable potency, by either unlabeled hPTHrp or PTH peptides. The binding capacity and affinity of receptors in ROS cells were strikingly similar for hPTHrp and PTH. Affinity cross-linking with either radioligand resulted in high affinity, specific labeling of an apparently identical macromolecule centering at Mr = 80,000, which was detected in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in both reducing and nonreducing conditions. The data indicate that hPTHrp and PTH, their amino-terminal fragments at least, interact with the identical receptors with regard to affinity, capacity, specificity, and physicochemical characteristics in osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells."

The purification procedure included Triton X-100 solubilization of microsomal membranes, DE-52 chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, octyl-Sepharose chromatography, and two consecutive Mono Q chromatographies. The procedure resulted in the isolation of a protein with a subunit molecular weight of 35,000 that was 96% of homogeneity as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphatidylinositol kinase activity was associated with the purified Mr 35,000 subunit. Maximum phosphatidylinositol kinase activity was dependent on magnesium ions and Triton X-100 at pH 8. The true Km values for phosphatidylinositol and MgATP were 70 microM and 0.3 mM, and the true Vmax was 4,750 nmol/min/mg. The turnover number for the enzyme was 166 min-1. Results of kinetic and isotopic exchange reactions indicated that phosphatidylinositol kinase catalyzed a sequential Bi Bi reaction mechanism. The enzyme bound to phosphatidylinositol prior to ATP and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was the first product released in the reaction. The equilibrium constant for the reaction indicated that the reverse reaction was favored in vitro. The activation energy for the reaction was 31.5 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was thermally labile above 30 degrees C. Phosphatidylinositol kinase activity was inhibited by calcium ions and thioreactive agents. Various nucleotides including adenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine did not affect phosphatidylinositol kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1489659797,"We used Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor and HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into macrophages or neutrophils to study the regulation of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Addition of platelet-derived growth factor to quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts led within 4 h to a dramatic and preferential increase in prostacyclin synthesis from endoperoxide prostaglandin H2, and microsomal assays showed a strong platelet-derived growth factor-dependent increase in the maximal velocities (Vmax) of both prostaglandin H synthase and prostacyclin synthase. In contrast, addition of phorbol ester to HL-60 cells to induce differentiation into macrophages led within 4 h to a strong and preferential increase in thromboxane synthesis from prostaglandin H2, and microsomal assays disclosed a major rise in Vmax for both prostaglandin H synthase and thromboxane synthase. No comparable changes occurred in HL-60 cells that were differentiating into neutrophils, though upregulation of 5-lipoxygenase pathway enzymes occurred in both differentiation systems. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide prevented the appearance of all of these enzymes of eicosanoid synthesis in all three model systems. Thus, the distinctive patterns of eicosanoid synthesis that are seen in replicating fibroblasts and in differentiating macrophages and neutrophils appear to depend on a coordinate, selective upregulation of several enzymes of eicosanoid biosynthesis that is specific for each cell system."
https://openalex.org/W1518460318,"Abstract This paper demonstrates and characterizes inactivation by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) of Rb+ and Na+ occlusion in pig kidney (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Rb+ and Na+ occlusion dependent on oligomycin are measured with a manual assay. Parallel measurement of phosphorylation (by Pi plus ouabain) and Na+ or Rb+ occlusion lead to stoichiometries of 3 Na+ or 2 Rb+ per pump molecule. Inactivation of cation occlusion by DCCD shows the following features: (a) Rb+ and Na+ occlusion are inactivated with identical rates and (b) DCCD concentration dependence shows first-order kinetics and also proportionality to the ratio of DCCD to protein, (c) Rb+ and Na+ occlusion are equally protected from DCCD, by Rb+ ions with high affinity (or Na+ ions with lower affinity), (d) inactivation is only slightly pH-dependent between 6 and 8.5 but (e) is significantly accelerated by several hydrophobic amines while a water-soluble nucleophile, glycine ethyl ester has no effect, and (f) inactivation is exactly correlated with inactivation of (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity of ATP-dependent Na+/K+ exchange in reconstituted vesicles and with the magnitude of E1Na+----E2(Rb+) conformational transitions measured with fluorescence probes. The simplest hypothesis to explain the results is that DCCD modifies one (or a small number of) critical carboxyl residues in a non-aqueous cation binding domain and so blocks occlusion of 2 Rb+ or 3 Na+ ions. The results suggest further that Na+ and K+(Rb+) bind to the same sites and are transported sequentially on the same trans-membrane segments. A second effect of the DCCD treatment is a 4-8-fold shift of the conformational equilibrium E2(Rb+)----E1Rb+ toward E1Rb+. This is detected by (a) reduction in apparent Rb+ affinity for Rb+ occlusion or Rb+/Rb+ exchange in vesicles and (b) direct demonstration of an increased rate of E2(K+)----E1Na+ and decreased rate of E1Na+----E2(K+). This effect is not protected against by Rb+ ions and probably reflects modification of a second group of residues. Modification of (Na+,K+)-ATPase by carbodiimides is complex. Depending on the nature of the carbodiimide (water- or lipid-soluble), ratio of carbodiimide to protein, and perhaps source of the enzyme, inactivation might result either from modification of critical carboxyls, as suggested by this work, or from internal cross-linking as proposed by Pedemonte, C. H. and Kaplan, J. H. ((1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3632-3639)."
https://openalex.org/W1520499963,"We have investigated the interaction of nuclear factors with the regulatory region of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) growth factor gene, which is induced upon activation of T lymphocytes. The regulatory region of IL-2 has been defined previously on the basis of transient transfection experiments and DNase I hypersensitive site analyses. This region of about 275 base pairs contains both tissue-specific as well as activation-dependent elements. Here we demonstrate nuclear factors which bind in this region. Some of these interactions are cell type-specific and several depend on prior activation of cells. This suggests that multiple activation responsive elements reside in the IL-2 promoter region. The inducible DNA binding activity of one of the factors is dependent also on protein synthesis. We have established an in vitro transcription assay to assess functional requirements for these DNA binding proteins. The possible involvement of some of these factors in regulating other genes expressed in T cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1534953238,"The autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) results in the generation of kinase activity that is largely Ca2+/CaM-independent. We report that continued Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation of CaM-KII results in the generation of distinct phosphopeptides as identified by high performance liquid chromatography and enzymatic properties that are different than those observed for Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation. These Ca2+/CaM-independent properties include (a) increased catalytic activity, (b) higher substrate affinity for the phosphorylation of synapsin I, and (c) decreased CaM-binding to both CaM-KII subunits as analyzed by gel overlays. Our results indicate that the autophosphorylation of only one subunit per holoenzyme is required to generate the Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KII. We suggest a two-step process by which autophosphorylation regulates CaM-KII. Step I requires Ca2+/CaM and underlies initial kinase activation. Step II involves continued autophosphorylation of the Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase and results in increased affinity for its substrate synapsin I and decreased affinity for calmodulin. These results indicate a complex mechanism through which autophosphorylation of CaM-KII may regulate its activity in response to transient fluctuations in intracellular calcium."

We have also shown that a thrombospondin promoter-bovine growth hormone fusion gene is transcribed in transiently transfected cells.

The final preparation of the enzyme showed a single major band on the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretogram. The content of purified enzyme was 12 nmol/mg of protein, and the specific activity was 431 nmol/min/mg of protein. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as 52,500. The absorption spectra of the purified enzyme and that of the dithionite-reduced CO complex showed peaks at 417 and 450 nm, respectively, indicating the enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P-450 family. Upon reconstitution with the electron-transferring system of the adrenal (adrenodoxin and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase), the enzyme showed high activity hydroxylating 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha-12-triol at position 27 with a turnover number of 35.5 min-1 and Km of 6.3 microM. The enzyme activity was completely lost when the electron-transferring system was replaced by that of microsomes (NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase purified from rat liver microsomes), confirming that the P-450 enzyme was of the mitochondrial type, but not of the microsomal. The omission of cytochrome P-450, adrenodoxin, or NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. The specific activity toward 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol was less than one-half that toward cholestanetriol and that toward cholesterol was about one-fiftieth. The enzyme showed no activity toward xenobiotics such as benzphetamine, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and benzo[a]pyrene. Its activity was not inhibited by metyrapone and slightly inhibited by aminoglutethimide. The enzyme activity was markedly lowered in an atmosphere of CO/O2/N2, 40/20/40."
https://openalex.org/W1482008361,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) binds to cell surface receptors and promotes selective removal of excess cholesterol from intracellular pools. The activity of this receptor is up-regulated when cells become loaded with cholesterol, but the relative degree of up-regulation depends on the growth state of the cells. The current study demonstrates that treatment of proliferating fibroblasts with gamma-interferon (IFN) increases the activity of the HDL receptor in association with a decrease in the rate of cell proliferation. Addition of IFN during the growth phase reduced the number of cells but had little effect on total cell protein, indicating that IFN inhibited cell proliferation but produced larger cells. IFN treatment increased the number of high affinity receptors for HDL on the surface of cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts, whether receptor binding was expressed per cell or per unit of cell surface area, cell protein, or cell cholesterol. IFN treatment also appeared to increase the amount of 110-kDa HDL binding protein in fibroblast membranes that has been postulated to represent the HDL receptor molecule. The IFN-induced increase in HDL receptor activity was associated with an enhanced ability of HDL3 to remove cholesterol from intracellular pools. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of cell proliferation increases HDL receptor-mediated transport of excess cholesterol from cells, possibly to rid cells of cholesterol that accumulates in response to a reduced rate of membrane synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1521713797,"The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase has a well-defined domain structure, and recombinant DNA techniques have been used to define further the functional properties that are associated with each domain. Our initial question was to define the minimal structural unit that is required for forming a stable complex with the catalytic subunit that will still bind and hence be dissociated by cAMP. To answer these questions, the entire second cAMP-binding domain was deleted using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to introduce a premature stop codon at Trp260. This mutation results in the expression of a stable protein with an Mr of 38,000 based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resulting mutant protein is a dimer; and like the native R-subunit, the two protomers of the dimer are cross-linked by disulfide bonds at the amino terminus. The mutant R-subunit binds 1 mol of cAMP/monomer based on equilibrium dialysis. The Kd(cAMP) was 25 nM, which is slightly higher than the Kd(cAMP) for the native R-subunit. The removal of the second cAMP domain does not prevent aggregation with the catalytic subunit, and the inactive holoenzyme complex that is formed in the absence of cAMP can still be dissociated and consequently activated by cAMP. In conjunction with previous results based on limited proteolysis, it is concluded that the region extending from Arg94 to Lys259 constitutes a structural unit that will be sufficient to interact with the catalytic subunit in a cAMP-dependent manner."

Following the covalent attachment of 125I-ANP-(102-126) to the recombinant ANP C-receptor, the protein exhibits an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the native ANP C-receptor of cultured vascular cells. Expression of the ANP C-receptor in heterologous cells does not affect ANP-stimulated cyclic GMP accumulation, confirming previous reports that this novel ANP receptor subpopulation is not coupled to cyclic GMP metabolism. Furthermore, specific antisera, generated by inoculating rabbits with living recombinant virus, block 125I-ANP binding to the ANP C-receptor but do not inhibit ANP stimulation of cyclic GMP, supporting the existence of two receptor subpopulations that are functionally and immunologically distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1548277630,"Abstract Lysine 32 has been previously implicated by chemical modification and modeling studies as a key component of the domain which controls recognition and binding of cytochrome c to its physiological partners, e.g. cytochrome b2, cytochrome c peroxidase, and cytochrome oxidase. In order to quantitate the importance of this residue, we have investigated the role of Lys-32 in the reactivity of cytochrome c in redox reactions in vitro and in vivo with protein partners by using a series of altered forms of iso-1-cytochrome c from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which Lys-32 is replaced by Leu-32, Gln-32, Trp-32, and Tyr-32. Leu-32 and Gln-32 represent substitutions which change charge without seriously affecting the steric bulk of the side chain or the stability of the protein. For the Leu-32- and Gln-32-altered proteins, steady state kinetic studies with cytochrome c peroxidase, cytochrome b2, and cytochrome oxidase showed that neither of the steady state kinetic parameters, Km nor Vmax, were substantially modified by mutation. Studies of single turnover kinetics with a small molecule (ascorbate) or within bound complexes with either cytochrome b5 or cytochrome c peroxidase demonstrated that redox kinetics are only slightly affected by these substitutions. NMR experiments demonstrated that the Gln-32-altered protein can still bind strongly to a physiological partner, cytochrome c peroxidase. Growth in lactate medium demonstrated that the activity in vivo compared with the normal value was reduced to only 85% with the Gln-32- and Leu-32-altered proteins and to 65% with the Trp-32- and Tyr-32-altered proteins. These findings suggest that the evolutionary invariance of Lys-32 reflects only small quantitative changes in the binding and reactivity of cytochrome c."

These modified ferricytochromes c were guanidine denatured, and the unfolding thermodynamics were determined by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. Thermal unfolding was also monitored by absorbance measurements. The guanidine denaturation midpoints for the altered proteins are smaller than the wild type, while the orders of stability from unfolding free energy changes are: Lys-32 (wild type) approximately Leu-32 approximately Gln-32 (circular dichroism), greater than Gln-32 (fluorescence) greater than Tyr-32 approximately Trp-32. Midpoints and differences in free energy changes for thermal unfolding parallel the fluorescence free energy changes for guanidine-induced unfolding. Thus, the blocked Leu-32 and Lys-32 proteins are equally stable with respect to both chemical and thermal denaturation. The reported data indicate that single replacements may significantly modify protein stability, and that substitution for an evolutionarily retained residue in normal cytochrome c structures does not always destabilize the protein. In addition, in vitro thermal stabilities approximately correlate with in vivo specific activities."
https://openalex.org/W1643792176,"Abstract Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate is a highly selective method for probing the cAMP-binding sites of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and for identifying specific residues that are in close proximity to the cAMP-binding sites. The cAMP-binding site of a mutant RI-subunit has been characterized here and contrasted to the native RI-subunit. This mutant RI-subunit was generated by oligonucleotide-directed muta-genesis and lacks the entire second cAMP-binding domain which includes both of the residues, Trp260 and Tyr371, that are photolabeled in the native RI-subunit. The mutant RI-subunit, nevertheless, is photoaffinity-labeled with high efficiency, and the residue covalently modified was identified as Tyr244. The position of Tyr244 based on a computer graphic model of cAMP-binding site A is proposed and correlated with the presumed locations of Tyr371 and Trp260 in the native R-subunit. Photoaffinity labeling also can be used to detect functional cAMP-binding sites following electrophoretic transfer of the denatured protein to nitrocellulose. Labeling of the immobilized protein on nitrocellulose required a functional cAMP-binding site A that can be photoaffinity-labeled in solution based on the following criteria. 1) The type I R-subunit is photolabeled, whereas the type II R-subunit is not. A primary feature which distinguishes these two R-subunits is that the RI-subunit is photolabeled at both sites A and B, whereas covalent modification of the RII-subunit occurs only at site B. 2) The truncated mutant of the RI-subunit which lacks the entire second cAMP-binding domain can be photolabeled on nitrocellulose. 3) A mutant RI-subunit which can no longer be photolabeled in site B is still photolabeled on nitrocellulose. 4) A mutation which abolished cAMP binding to site A also abolished photoaffinity labeling after transfer to nitrocellulose."

The various properties investigated decreased monoexponentially with radiation dose, and the decay constants, gamma, were independent of the presence of other proteins and of sucrose concentrations above 0.25 M. The temperature factor was the same as described by others. Irradiation of four proteins of known molecular mass, m, showed that gamma for protein integrity was proportional to m with a proportionality factor about 20% higher than that conventionally used. By this standard curve, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity used as internal standard gave a radiation inactivation size of 110 +/- 5 kDa, very close to m = 104-108 kDa for the dimer, as expected. For Na+/K+-transporting ATPase the following target sizes and radiation inactivation size values were very close to m = 112 kDa for the alpha-peptide: peptide integrity of alpha, 115 kDa; unmodified binding sites for ATP and vanadate, 108 kDa; K+-activated p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity, 106 kDa. There was thus no sign of dimerization of the alpha-peptide or involvement of the beta-peptide. In contrast, optimal Na+/K+-transporting ATPase activity had a radiation inactivation size = 189 +/- 7 kDa, and total nucleotide binding capacity corresponded to 72 +/- 3 kDa. These latter results will be extended and discussed in a forthcoming paper."

Treatment of canine hepatic membranes with buffers containing Lubrol and NaCl, followed by gel filtration of soluble material on Sepharose CL-6B and subsequent fractionation of proteins by use of (NH4)2SO4, resulted in a 50-fold purification of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the solubilized protease under conditions of linear initial rate (by use of glucagon as substrate and high performance liquid chromatography to separate and quantitate the products) revealed its minimal dependency on pH between values of 7 and 9, its relative preference for glucagon as substrate, and its sensitivity to the presence of salt. Initial rates and the ratio Vmax/Km typically increased 5- to 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, in the presence of 1 M NaCl. Identification by amino acid analysis of peptide fragments resulting from the incubation of glucagon with the partially purified enzyme and analysis of related time courses for hormone processing demonstrated that the glucagon Tyr13-Leu14 peptide bond is the primary site for proteolytic cleavage by the receptor-linked protease.

https://openalex.org/W1555857230,"We demonstrate here that rat lung membrane vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors can be extracted in the active state using digitonin. Sepharose 4B gel filtration chromatography was utilized to demonstrate the formation of specific binding complexes between 125I-VIP and solubilized receptors. A rapid soluble receptor assay was established to separate 125I-VIP-receptor complexes from free 125I-VIP, which entailed differential precipitation of the 125I-VIP-receptor complex with polyethylene glycol and bovine gamma-globulin. Using this assay, several detergents were tested for their suitability to extract active VIP receptors, and most favorable results were obtained with digitonin, as judged by specific binding of 125I-VIP to the solubilized receptors. Time course studies indicated that the binding of 125I-VIP to digitonin extract was more rapid than to rat lung membranes. Scatchard analyses of competitive binding data indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites in the digitonin extract, as in the membrane. The values for the dissociation constants (Kd) were 200 pM for Class I and 8 nM for Class II receptors while the values for binding capacity (Bmax) were 200 and 2300 fmol/mg for Class I and II sites, respectively. Although the binding parameters of the two classes were similar to those in the membrane, the pharmacological properties were different, as evidenced by the inability of rat growth hormone releasing factor, a potent VIP agonist in the membrane, to displace specifically bound 125I-VIP from solubilized receptors. The ability to solubilize active VIP receptors represents an important step toward purification of the functional protein."

Vesicular transport coupled with membrane fusion has been demonstrated for rough endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and Golgi to plasma membrane transport as well as receptor mediated endocytosis and receptor recycling. Recent studies with inhibitors suggest that metalloendoproteases may mediate a wide variety of intracellular fusion events. Thus, in order to examine the potential role of metalloendoproteases in both transport/secretion and endocytosis/recycling we have used selected dipeptide substrates to probe these processes in human HepG2 cells. Using pulse-chase labeling, immunoprecipitation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we show that transport and secretion of newly synthesized proteins along the exocytotic route were completely inhibited by substrate dipeptides (e.g. Cbz-Gly-Phe-amide, where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl) but not by irrelevant dipeptides (e.g. Cbz-Gly-Gly-amide). The effect was rapid, reversible, and specific. The secretory pathway was blocked between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi as well as Golgi and plasma membrane as judged by the status of N-glycosylation intermediates. In addition, these inhibitors specifically inhibited protein synthesis without alterations in cellular ATP concentrations. However, cell-free amino acid incorporation was not inhibited. Receptor-mediated uptake of asialoglycoproteins was specifically and reversibly inhibited by dipeptide substrates. This effect appears to be secondary to inhibition of recycling as neither ligand binding nor internalization were affected. Thus the present observations suggest that metalloendoprotease activity may be involved in the regulation of multiple intracellular pathways perhaps at the level of vesicular fusion events."
https://openalex.org/W1488751472,"Abstract Infection of HeLa cells with poliovirus results in a decrease in the level of RNA polymerase IIO, the transcriptionally active form of the enzyme, and a shutdown of host transcription (Rangel, L. M., Fernandez-Tomas, C., Dahmus, M. E., and Gariglio, P. (1987) J. Virol. 61, 1002-1006). The effect of cycloheximide on poliovirus-induced modification of host RNA polymerase IIO was investigated. The inhibition of protein synthesis, at sequential stages during viral replication, prevents the modification of both total and chromatin-bound RNA polymerase IIO. Furthermore, the inclusion of zinc at a concentration that inhibits the proteolytic post-translational processing of viral polyprotein also prevents the modification of RNA polymerase IIO. These results suggest that host cell enzyme modification depends on the synthesis and processing of protein(s) encoded by the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1538570255,"Nuclear poly(A) polymerase was isolated from [35S]methionine-labeled hepatoma McA-RH 7777 cells and subjected to DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Flow-through and low salt wash fractions containing poly(A) polymerase activity were pooled and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-tumor type poly(A) polymerase antibodies and a biotinylated second antibody. The immune complex contained a single 48-kDa polypeptide band corresponding to the tumor-type enzyme. When immunoprecipitations were carried out using the same fraction and antibodies, at least five 35S-methionine-labeled proteins with approximate molecular masses of 74, 48, 35, 30, and 22 kDa were observed. Pulse-chase studies did not indicate a precursor-product relationship between the immunoprecipitated proteins. Preimmune sera did not react with poly(A) polymerase or other components in the protein complex. These data show that poly(A) polymerase exists as part of a complex with at least four other polypeptides and suggest that these polypeptides may be involved in the cleavage and/or polyadenylation reactions."
