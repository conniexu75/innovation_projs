https://openalex.org/W2018520623,"THE characteristics of the laser beam which are of great interest and importance from the biomedical aspect are the ability to direct and to focus, intense energy density and some selectivity1. Since the laser beam is a light beam, it can be focused most accurately by using lens systems. Energy density is intense. In these experiments, the energy density was approximately 9,000 joules/cm2 in the target area. Selectivity indicates that materials which are coloured absorb more of the incident beam of the lasers now available than uncoloured materials. In addition to these properties, of interest to the dentist is the fact that the duration of the impact is in the order of a millisecond."

Phosphate or fructose-1,6-diphosphate prevents inactivation of the dehydrogenase, but phosphate and other compounds cannot be substituted for the fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for activity. Lactic dehydrogenases of other species of Streptococcus show a similar requirement for fructose-1,6-diphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2012547281,A temporary inhibition of RNA synthesis leads to a corresponding delay in the formation of all puffs which are stimulated by ecdysone in the salivary gland chromosomes of Chironomus tentans. Inhibition of protein synthesis does not influence the induction of those puffs which appear shortly after injection of ecdysone. Puffs which develop after a longer period are delayed in appearance. It is concluded that early reacting genes are involved in those processes leading to the sequential activation of the puffs which appear later.
https://openalex.org/W1999215124,Inanimate objects may exhibit distributions of temperature similar to those of reptiles in the field. The uncontrolled field methods of collecting body temperatures of reptiles have resulted in the accumulation of much inconclusive data. A return to more comprehensive study is called for.
https://openalex.org/W2062513729,"Deficiency of cystathioninie synthetase activity results in the clinical syndrome of homocystinuria. In both parents of a patient with homocystinuria, the hepatic cystathionine synthetase activity was 40 percent of that in unrelated control patients. These findings demonstrate that the metabolic error is inherited and suggest that the parents, although clinically normal, represent the heterozygous. state. A second case of homocystinuria also is shown to be associated with cystathionine synthetase deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2052391789,Dialysis of cerebral venous blood was performed on rabbits during sleep induced by electrical stimulation of the hypnogenic thalamic system or during sustained wakefulness elicited by stimulation of the activating reticular system. The injection of dialysate from a sleeping donor elicited in a normal recipient a moderate sleep which did not differ from normal sleep according to the behavior of the animal and the pattern of the electroencephalogram. The action of the dialysate obtained from sleeping donors was significantly different from that obtained from control donors after sham-stimulation of the thalamus. Injection of dialysate from alert donors elicited a behavioral and electrographic arousal with rhinodiencephalic activation symptoms. These results suggest that dialyzable humoral factors play a role in the mediation of sleep and wakeleness.
https://openalex.org/W2059932489,There is enhanced incorporation of leucine-C(14) into proteins in cell-free preparations from livers of young rats force-fed a threonine-devoid diet for 3 days. This increased protein synthesis in the liver is related predominantly to enhanced activity of ribosomes. The aggregates of liver ribosomes (ergosonmes or polysomes) as measured in a sucrose gradient indicated a shift from lighter toward heavier ergosomes with a decrease in monomers.
https://openalex.org/W1986852026,Subcellular fractions of mouse brain were prepared by differential and sucrose density-gradient centrifugation at intervals up to 130 hours after intracerebral injection of C14-labeled leucine. The specific activity of the nerve ending fraction continued to rise during this period. Between 2 and 130 hours after injection there was a fivefold rise in the specific activity of the soluble protein prepared by lysing the nerve ending particles with water while the specific activity of the soluble protein from the whole homogenate concomitantly fell almost by a factor of three. The data are interpreted as being consistent with the appearance of protein in nerve endings by axoplasmic flow.
https://openalex.org/W2029135380,The finding that attraction is a function of attitude similarity has been interpreted as a special case of the effect of positive and negative reinforcements on attraction. A simple discrimination learning task was employed in which the reinforcements were attitude statements similar and dissimilar to the opinions of the subject. The presentation of similar attitude statements after each correct response and dissimilar attitude statements after each incorrect response significantly changed response probability. The hypothesis that such statements could be used as reinforcers in a learning situation was thus confirmed.

https://openalex.org/W2024329177,Puromycin synergizes the lethal action of streptomycin and related antibiotics. This is interpreted to mean that puromycin action uncovers a sensitive site (or sites) on the 30S ribosome. The streptomycinoid antibiotics can then associate more readily with the ribosome and inhibit further synthesis of valid protein.
https://openalex.org/W2050869411,"The staphylolytic enzyme recently isolated from cultures of a Chalaropsis species by Hash is shown to be an acetylmurainidase that cleaves all the glycosidic linkages of N-acetylmuramic acid and N,O-diacetylmuramic acid in the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus strain Copenhagen. It is similar in specificity to the ""32 enzyme"" from Streptomyces albus but it differs from egg-white lysozyme whose activity is inhibited by the presence of O-acetyl groups."

https://openalex.org/W1970247516,A brief exposure of Escherichia coli cells to an inducer for β-galactosidase results in the production of a messenger RNA which subsequently expresses itself as β-galactosidase. Ultraviolet irradiation of cells after exposure to the inducer results in a decrease in the amount of β-galactosidase formed. The messenger RNA formed during the brief exposure to inducer is evidently inactivated by the ultraviolet radiation. The decay of messenger RNA activity in irradiated cells has the same kinetics as that observed in unirradiated cells.
https://openalex.org/W2053475874,Uric acid is stored in the utriculi majores of the accessory sex glands of the German cockroach. Most of the uric acid is eliminated during copulation by being poured over the spermatophore. Mating appears to be an important means of excretion in this cockroach.

The virus grown in B. subtilis is biologically identical to polyoma virus produced by animal cells. Quantitative parameters of the system have been established, and fluctuation tests indicate that viral replication occurs within the infected bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2025480889,"DURING the course of the Himalayan Scientific and Mountaineering Expedition 1960–61 (ref. 1) the members sorted cards three times, a practice at a height not much above sea-level, and then two tests at 19,000 ft. Before the first test the average stay at 19,000 ft. had been 2 weeks, with an additional 6 weeks at 15,000 ft. Between the two tests an additional average of 9 weeks had been spent at 19,000 ft., plus 2 weeks at 15,000 ft. Adequate data were available for only three members of the expedition, whose ages ranged from 23 to 32 years. A comparable group of eleven research scientists from the Applied Psychology Research Unit was therefore collected, covering the same range of ages and academic experience. These men sorted cards with the same card-sorter three times in Cambridge, separated by the same average time-intervals. Table 1 shows that the number of delayed responses increased after acclimatization at 19,000 ft., whereas it fell slightly at about sea-level."

https://openalex.org/W2060828150,"The intravenous infusion of 600 milligrams of glucose over 30 minutes caused a 17 percent fall in the concentration of free fatty acids in arterial blood of subjects who had fasted overnight. This response to glucose was abolished in subjects treated previously with ganglionic or adrenergic blocking agents. Small amounts of insulin were secreted in response to these glucose infusions, but in insulin-dependent diabetics incapable of altering plasma insulin to any great extent, the effect of glucose upon free fatty acids could be obtained provided the subjects were primed with long-acting insulin before the infusions were begun. The response of free fatty acids to doses of glucose which elevated the concentration of glucose in arterial blood by only 3 mg percent and the blockade of this response by autonomic and adrenergic blocking agents suggest that centers in the central nervous system exist which are capable of responding to elevations of arterial glucose by inhibiting the sympathetic tone partially responsible for sustaining lipolysis in fasting."

https://openalex.org/W2148967137,"LITTLE is known of the transfer of peptides between the maternal and fœtal circulation. In their exhaustive review, Hagermann and Villee1 mention the results of the work of Krzysztoporski2, who showed that simple peptides cross the placental barrier, and those of Knobil and Josimovitch3 that insulin crosses the mono-layered placenta of the rat. Other information on the placental penetration of peptide hormones is sparse and contradictory. High concentrations of oxytocin in maternal blood during parturition have been reported4 and it seemed therefore of interest to investigate the possibility that oxytocin in the maternal circulation might reach the fœtus."
https://openalex.org/W2045922332,"FROM recent work1 it would seem that L-serine ethanol-amine phosphodiester (L-SEP) is found only in the tissues of fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds. D-SEP, on the other hand, appears to be confined to earthworms2, where it is the biological precursor of lombricine3. The status of the work on both isomers has been summarized by Ennor and Rosenberg4. These authors had previously shown1 that dinitrophenol (3 × 10−4 M) completely inhibited the biosynthesis of L-SEP and that cytidine triphosphate (CTP) appeared to be required. Thus it was shown that chicken kidney homogenates, supplemented by CTP, incorporated more inorganic phosphorus-32 into L-SEP than when this nucleotide was omitted."
https://openalex.org/W1981863694,"Tremorine, injected intraperitoneally into rats, induces the same kind of calcium release in the motor end-plates as that induced by acetylcholine-like agents. Since the same effect results even if the appropriate motor nerve has previously been transected, it is concluded that this myoneural action of Tremorine is not due to a e entral excitation but rather to a peripheral stimulatory property of the drug."

Typical atheromasic changes of the aorta, coronary and pulmonary arteries have been demonstrated in ‘Triton’-treated dogs5. These findings are of some interest, since dogs are usually less susceptible to atherosclerosis, and the atheromasic changes have been obtained in aimals fed with a normal diet."

https://openalex.org/W2042226411,"THE dispersion of radioactive contamination in the environment by mobile organisms has been reported by several authors. Davis1 noted significant amounts of radioactivity in caddis flies and midges (Orthocladiinae) attracted to lights from the nearby Columbia River. As the result of aquaria investigations on the uptake of radio -nuclides by aquatic insects, Peredelskii and Bogatyrev2 concluded that a bioecological purification of contaminated reservoirs would occur as the consequence of emergent insects flying to the surrounding watershed. Auerbach3 questioned their conclusions because the quantities of radioactivity transported by insects were less than that accumulated from fall-out. However, it was noted that lack of data on emergent insects biomass made it difficult to test the general applicability of the hypothesis. The purpose of this communication is to assess the role of emergent Chironomidae as vectors of strontium-90 and freshwater clams as reservoirs of strontium-90 in the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers."
https://openalex.org/W2080587657,"So far, sixteen electrophoretically distinguishable transferrin variants have been distinguished by means of starch-gel electrophoresis1,2. Observations on the frequency and distribution of the variants have been recently summarized by Giblett3. In all populations examined transferrin C is by far the most frequently encountered. Those variants which occur in a measurable gene frequency are usually restricted to certain populations. Transferrin D1 is widely distributed and has been reported most frequently in American and African Negroes. It has also been reported as occurring in New Guinea, Fiji, New Hebrides, Malaya, Thailand, Philippines, Formosa, Ceylon, India, Central and South America and Sweden."
https://openalex.org/W1970251308,"Incubated mixtures of PR8 influenza virus and Rauscher leukemia virus retained the egg infectivity and hemagglutinin of the influenza virus and the ability of the Rauscher virus to induce splenomegaly in mice. Density-gradient centrifugation on potassium citrate gradients revealed a new interviral product with an intermediate density as the principal constituent of such mixtures. Chicken erythrocytes adsorbed the Rauscher virus components as well as the influenza virus components of the interviral product from such mixtures at 4 degrees C, whereas the Rauscher virus alone was little adsorbed. The adsorbed interviral product was eluted from the erythrocyte complex after incubation at 37 degrees C."

Four serums could not be classified because their transferrin apparently did not bind iron-59, possibly owing to saturation. A difference was observed in the electrophoretic migration and pattern of the transferrins in these monkeys compared with those of other primates."

N-ethylmaleimide, on the other hand, enhances both the lethal and mutagenic effects of radiation on bacteria7–9, but has not been reported to affect higher organisms. Indeed, it was shown to be quite ineffective in enhancing radiation damage to red blood corpuscles in contrast to iodoacetic acid10."
