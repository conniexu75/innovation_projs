https://openalex.org/W4206898072,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant with increased fitness is spreading rapidly worldwide. Analysis of cryo-EM structures of the spike (S) from Omicron reveals amino acid substitutions forging interactions that stably maintain an active conformation for receptor recognition. The relatively more compact domain organization confers improved stability and enhances attachment but compromises the efficiency of the viral fusion step. Alterations in local conformation, charge, and hydrophobic microenvironments underpin the modulation of the epitopes such that they are not recognized by most NTD- and RBD-antibodies, facilitating viral immune escape. Structure of the Omicron S bound with human ACE2, together with the analysis of sequence conservation in ACE2 binding region of 25 sarbecovirus members, as well as heatmaps of the immunogenic sites and their corresponding mutational frequencies, sheds light on conserved and structurally restrained regions that can be used for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4220873173,"Metastatic progression is the main cause of death in cancer patients, whereas the underlying genomic mechanisms driving metastasis remain largely unknown. Here, we assembled MSK-MET, a pan-cancer cohort of over 25,000 patients with metastatic diseases. By analyzing genomic and clinical data from this cohort, we identified associations between genomic alterations and patterns of metastatic dissemination across 50 tumor types. We found that chromosomal instability is strongly correlated with metastatic burden in some tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and HR+/HER2+ breast ductal carcinoma, but not in others, including colorectal cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where copy-number alteration patterns may be established early in tumor development. We also identified somatic alterations associated with metastatic burden and specific target organs. Our data offer a valuable resource for the investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread and highlight the complex role of chromosomal instability in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4205497912,"Although infections among vaccinated individuals lead to milder COVID-19 symptoms relative to those in unvaccinated subjects, the specificity and durability of antibody responses elicited by breakthrough cases remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that breakthrough infections induce serum-binding and -neutralizing antibody responses that are markedly more potent, durable, and resilient to spike mutations observed in variants than those in subjects who received only 2 doses of vaccine. However, we show that breakthrough cases, subjects who were vaccinated after infection, and individuals vaccinated three times have serum-neutralizing activity of comparable magnitude and breadth, indicating that an increased number of exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s) enhance the quality of antibody responses. Neutralization of SARS-CoV was moderate, however, underscoring the importance of developing vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity for pandemic preparedness."

Here, we use structure-guided mutagenesis to engineer opsins that exhibit very high potency while retaining fast kinetics. These new opsins enable large-scale, temporally and spatially precise control of population neural activity. We extensively benchmark these new opsins against existing optogenetic tools and provide a detailed biophysical characterization of a diverse family of opsins under two-photon illumination. This establishes a resource for matching the optimal opsin to the goals and constraints of patterned optogenetics experiments. Finally, by combining these new opsins with optimized procedures for holographic photostimulation, we demonstrate the simultaneous coactivation of several hundred spatially defined neurons with a single hologram and nearly double that number by temporally interleaving holograms at fast rates. These newly engineered opsins substantially extend the capabilities of patterned illumination optogenetic paradigms for addressing neural circuits and behavior."

However, Env structure and organization in its native virion context has eluded detailed characterization. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to analyze Env in mature and immature HIV-1 particles. Immature particles showed distinct Env positioning relative to the underlying Gag lattice, providing insights into long-standing questions about Env incorporation. A 9.1-Å sub-tomogram-averaged reconstruction of virion-bound Env in conjunction with structural mass spectrometry revealed unexpected features, including a variable central core of the gp41 subunit, heterogeneous glycosylation between protomers, and a flexible stalk that allows Env tilting and variable exposure of neutralizing epitopes. Together, our results provide an integrative understanding of HIV assembly and structural variation in Env antigen presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4210404056,"Infection by the SARS-Cov-2 virus produces in humans a disease of highly variable and unpredictable severity. The presence of frequent genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the population might lead to a greater susceptibility to infection or an exaggerated inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 requires the presence of the ACE2 protein to enter in the cell and ACE2 is a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, we studied the associations between 8 SNPs from AGTR1, ACE2 and ACE genes and the severity of the disease produced by the SARS-Cov-2 virus.318 (aged 59.6±17.3 years, males 62.6%) COVID-19 patients were grouped based on the severity of symptoms: Outpatients (n = 104, 32.7%), hospitalized on the wards (n = 73, 23.0%), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (n = 84, 26.4%) and deceased (n = 57, 17.9%). Comorbidity data (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, lung disease and cancer) were collected for adjustment. Genotype distribution of 8 selected SNPs among the severity groups was analyzed.Four SNPs in ACE2 were associated with the severity of disease. While rs2074192 andrs1978124showed a protector effectassuming an overdominant model of inheritance (G/A vs. GG-AA, OR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.12-0.82; p = 0.016 and A/G vs. AA-GG, OR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.14-0.96; p = 0.038, respectively); the SNPs rs2106809 and rs2285666were associated with an increased risk of being hospitalized and a severity course of the disease with recessive models of inheritance (C/C vs. T/C-T/T, OR = 11.41, 95% CI: 1.12-115.91; p = 0.012) and (A/A vs. GG-G/A, OR = 12.61, 95% CI: 1.26-125.87; p = 0.0081). As expected, an older age (OR = 1.47), male gender (OR = 1.98) and comorbidities (OR = 2.52) increased the risk of being admitted to ICU or death vs more benign outpatient course. Multivariable analysis demonstrated the role of the certain genotypes (ACE2) with the severity of COVID-19 (OR: 0.31, OR 0.37 for rs2074192 and rs1978124, and OR = 2.67, OR = 2.70 for rs2106809 and rs2285666, respectively). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in hospitalized group for I/D SNP in ACE was not showed (p<0.05), which might be due to the association with the disease. No association between COVID-19 disease and the different AGTR1 SNPs was evidenced on multivariable, nevertheless the A/A genotype for rs5183 showed an higher hospitalization risk in patients with comorbidities.Different genetic variants in ACE2 were associated with a severe clinical course and death groups of patients with COVID-19. ACE2 common SNPs in the population might modulate severity of COVID-19 infection independently of other known markers like gender, age and comorbidities."

https://openalex.org/W4210575217,"Predictive coding is an important candidate theory of self-supervised learning in the brain. Its central idea is that sensory responses result from comparisons between bottom-up inputs and contextual predictions, a process in which rates and synchronization may play distinct roles. We recorded from awake macaque V1 and developed a technique to quantify stimulus predictability for natural images based on self-supervised, generative neural networks. We find that neuronal firing rates were mainly modulated by the contextual predictability of higher-order image features, which correlated strongly with human perceptual similarity judgments. By contrast, V1 gamma (γ)-synchronization increased monotonically with the contextual predictability of low-level image features and emerged exclusively for larger stimuli. Consequently, γ-synchronization was induced by natural images that are highly compressible and low-dimensional. Natural stimuli with low predictability induced prominent, late-onset beta (β)-synchronization, likely reflecting cortical feedback. Our findings reveal distinct roles of synchronization and firing rates in the predictive coding of natural images."
https://openalex.org/W4220818544,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, and there is a pressing need to identify disease-modifying factors and devise interventional strategies. The circadian clock, our intrinsic biological timer, orchestrates various cellular and physiological processes including gene expression, sleep, and neuroinflammation; conversely, circadian dysfunctions are closely associated with and/or contribute to AD hallmarks. We previously reported that the natural compound Nobiletin (NOB) is a clock-enhancing modulator that promotes physiological health and healthy aging. In the current study, we treated the double transgenic AD model mice, APP/PS1, with NOB-containing diets. NOB significantly alleviated β-amyloid burden in both the hippocampus and the cortex, and exhibited a trend to improve cognitive function in these mice. While several systemic parameters for circadian wheel-running activity, sleep, and metabolism were unchanged, NOB treatment showed a marked effect on the expression of clock and clock-controlled AD gene expression in the cortex. In accordance, cortical proteomic profiling demonstrated circadian time-dependent restoration of the protein landscape in APP/PS1 mice treated with NOB. More importantly, we found a potent efficacy of NOB to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and inflammasome formation in the cortex, and immunostaining further revealed a specific effect to diminish astrogliosis, but not microgliosis, by NOB in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results underscore beneficial effects of a clock modulator to mitigate pathological and cognitive hallmarks of AD, and suggest a possible mechanism via suppressing astrogliosis-associated neuroinflammation."

https://openalex.org/W4210252826,"The COVID-19 disease burden continues to be high worldwide and vaccines continue to be developed to help combat the pandemic. Acceptance and risk perception for COVID-19 vaccines is unknown in Botswana despite the government's decision to roll out the vaccine nationally.This study aims to assess the acceptance rate and risk perception of COVID-19 vaccines amongst the general population in Botswana.We interviewed 5300 adults in Botswana from 1-28 February 2021 using self-administered questionnaires. The main outcomes of the study were vaccine acceptance and hesitancy rates. Demographic, experiential and socio-cultural factors were explored for their association with outcome variables.Two-thirds of the participants were females (3199), with those aged 24-54 making the highest proportion (61%). The acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccine was 73.4% (95% CI: 72.2%-74.6%) with vaccine hesitancy at 31.3% (95% CI: 30.0%-32.6%). When the dependent variable was vaccine acceptance, males had higher odds of accepting the vaccine compared to females (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4). Individuals aged 55-64 had high odds of accepting the vaccine compared to those aged 65 and above (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.6, 2.5). The odds of accepting the vaccine for someone with primary school education were about 2.5 times that of an individual with post graduate level of education. Finally, individuals with comorbidities had higher odds (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.5) of accepting the vaccine compared to those without any underlying conditions.This study demonstrated a high acceptance rate for the COVID-19 vaccine and a low risk perception in Botswana. In order to achieve a high vaccine coverage and ensure a successful vaccination process, there is need to target populations with high vaccine hesitancy rates. A qualitative study to assess the factors associated with vaccine acceptance and hesitancy is recommended to provide an in-depth analysis of the findings."
https://openalex.org/W4210791415,"Many mammalian neurons release multiple neurotransmitters to activate diverse classes of postsynaptic ionotropic receptors. Entopeduncular nucleus somatostatin (EP Sst+) projection neurons to the lateral habenula (LHb) release both glutamate and GABA, but it is unclear whether these are packaged into the same or segregated pools of synaptic vesicles. Here, we describe a method combining electrophysiology, spatially patterned optogenetics, and computational modeling designed to analyze the mechanism of glutamate/GABA co-release in mouse brain. We find that the properties of postsynaptic currents elicited in LHb neurons by optogenetically activating EP Sst+ terminals are only consistent with co-packaging of glutamate/GABA into individual vesicles. Furthermore, presynaptic neuromodulators that weaken EP Sst+ to LHb synapses maintain the co-packaging of glutamate/GABA while reducing vesicular release probability. Our approach is applicable to the study of multi-transmitter neurons throughout the brain, and our results constrain the mechanisms of neuromodulation and synaptic integration in LHb."
https://openalex.org/W4210662995,"In marine environments, organisms are confronted with numerous microbial challenges, although the differential regulation of xenophagy in response to different pathogenic bacterial species remains relatively unknown. Here, we addressed this issue using Apostichopus japonicus as a model. We identified 39 conserved autophagy-related genes by genome-wide screening, which provided a molecular basis for autophagy regulation in sea cucumbers. Furthermore, xenophagy of two Gram-negative bacteria, Vibrio splendidus and Escherichia coli, but not a Gram-positive bacteria, Micrococcus luteus, was observed in different autophagy assays. Surprisingly, a significantly higher autophagy capacity was found in the E. coli–challenged group than in the V. splendidus–challenged group. To confirm these findings, two different lipopolysaccharides, LPSV. splendidus and LPSE. coli, were isolated; we found that these LPS species differentially activated coelomocyte xenophagy. To explore the molecular mechanism mediating differential levels of xenophagy, we used an siRNA knockdown assay and confirmed that LPSV. splendidus-mediated xenophagy was dependent on an AjTLR3-mediated pathway, whereas LPSE. coli-mediated xenophagy was dependent on AjToll. Moreover, the activation of different AjTLRs resulted in AjTRAF6 ubiquitination and subsequent activation of K63-linked ubiquitination of AjBeclin1. Inversely, the LPSV. splendidus-induced AjTLR3 pathway simultaneously activated the expression of AjA20, which reduced the extent of K63-linked ubiquitination of AjBeclin1 and impaired the induction of autophagy; however, this finding was no t evident with LPSE. coli. Our present results provide the first evidence showing that xenophagy could be differentially induced by different bacterial species to yield differential autophagy levels in echinoderms.

Our present results provide the first evidence showing that xenophagy could be differentially induced by different bacterial species to yield differential autophagy levels in echinoderms. Autophagy is a highly conserved and mostly selective intracellular degradation pathway in eukaryotes that is mainly involved the regulation of essential physiological processes (1de Duve C. The origin of eukaryotes: A reappraisal.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 395-403Google Scholar, 2Scott R.C. Schuldiner O. Neufeld T.P. Role and regulation of starvation-induced autophagy in the drosophila fat body.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 167-178Google Scholar, 3He C. Klionsky D. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Google Scholar). For autophagy activation, a portion of the cytoplasmic component is first surrounded by a cup-shaped structure called the phagophore (4Puri C. Vicinanza M. Rubinsztein D.C. Phagophores evolve from recycling endosomes.Autophagy. 2018; 14: 1475-1477Google Scholar, 5Yu L. Chen Y. Tooze S.A. Autophagy pathway: Cellular and molecular mechanisms.Autophagy. 2018; 14: 207-215Google Scholar), and this phagophore then extends, closes, and forms a double-membrane autophagosome (6Reggiori F. Ungermann C. Autophagosome maturation and fusion.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 486-496Google Scholar). Subsequently, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in metazoan cells) or vacuoles (in yeast and plant cells) to degrade cytoplasm-derived materials by lysosomal/vacuolar hydrolases. Various autophagy-related genes and multiple signaling pathways are involved in these processes (7Mizushima N. The ATG conjugation systems in autophagy.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 63: 1-10Google Scholar). Among these core sets of proteins, LC3/Atg8 are widely adopted as molecular markers to determine the occurrence of autophagy (8Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that autophagy can selectively degrade specific cargoes via processes referred to as “selective autophagy,” which aim to maintain cellular homeostasis, regulate inflammatory responses, and eliminate invasive pathogens (9Zaffagnini G. Martens S. Mechanisms of selective autophagy.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 1714-1724Google Scholar, 10Stolz A. Ernst A. Dikic I. Cargo recognition and trafficking in selective autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 495-501Google Scholar). Special terms have been coined to describe selective autophagy according to the types of targeted cargoes, and these terms include mitophagy (mitochondria), pexophagy (peroxisomes), lipophagy (lipid droplets), aggrephagy (protein aggregates), and xenophagy (invading microorganisms) (10Stolz A. Ernst A. Dikic I. Cargo recognition and trafficking in selective autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 495-501Google Scholar). Xenophagy, a unique type of selective autophagy, has received extensive attention and plays a central role in innate immunity by targeting foreign entities, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites and protecting host cells from fatal damage (11Cong Y. Kumar N.D. Mauthe M. Verlhac P. Reggiori F. Manipulation of selective macroautophagy by pathogens at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133jcs240440Google Scholar). In mammals, different types of pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella enterica (12Thurston T.L. Ryzhakov G. Bloor S. Muhlinen N. Randow F. The TBK1 adaptor and autophagy receptor NDP52 restricts the proliferation of ubiquitin-coated bacteria.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1215-1221Google Scholar), Listeria monocytogenes (13Mostowy S.

Jones N.L. Modulation of autophagy by Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastric carcinogenesis.Trends Microbiol. 2013; 21: 602-612Google Scholar), distinctly lose the “battle” in different models and reportedly induce xenophagy. Interestingly, nearly all invading microbe-induced xenophagy is dependent on an interaction between the bacterial cell wall components and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in host cells, which provides the missing link between pathogen recognition and the initiation of autophagy (16Tang D.

Toll-like receptors in control of immunological autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 976-983Google Scholar). For instance, Khan et al. (19Khan A. Mann L. Papanna R. Lyu M.A. Singh C.R. Olson S. Eissa N.T. Cirillo J. Das G. Hunter R.L. Mesenchymal stem cells internalize Mycobacterium tuberculosis through scavenger receptors and restrict bacterial growth through autophagy.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 15010Google Scholar) demonstrated that two types of scavenger receptors, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) and scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1), in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could mediate xenophagy and enhance the intracellular killing of the pathogen by binding to lipoglycans from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Travassos et al. (20Travassos L.H. Carneiro L.A. Ramjeet M. Hussey S. Kim Y.G. Magalhes J.G. Yuan L. Soares F. Chea E. Bourhis L.L. Boneca I.G. Allaoui A. Jones N.L. Nuñez G. Girardin S.E. et al.Nod1 and Nod2 direct autophagy by recruiting ATG16L1 to the plasma membrane at the site of bacterial entry.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 55-62Google Scholar) found that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 of the family of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in human epithelial HeLa cells activate xenophagy after specifically binding to peptidoglycan (PGN) from S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes. Toll/Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are considered the most important PRRs in mediating xenophagy. Delgado et al. (18Delgado M.A. Deretic V. Toll-like receptors in control of immunological autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 976-983Google Scholar) screened a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) ligand library for effects on xenophagy in murine macrophage cell lines and found that different TLRs could identify different ligands from bacteria or viruses (i.e., TLR3 can identify polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], TLR2 can identify zymosan, and TLR4 can identify LPS) to active xenophagy. However, lipopeptides such as Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 ligands), flagellin (TLR5 ligand), or CpG oligonucleotides (TLR9 ligand) cannot induce xenophagy. Moreover, TLR ligands induce xenophagy in a mainly cell-type-dependent manner, and the degradation mechanism of the cargoes might also differ among various species. For instance, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) serves as a ligand for murine TLR7 and human TLR8 but is not recognized by human TLR7 (21Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford C. Wagner H. Bauer S. Species-specific recognition of single-stranded RNA via toll-like receptor 7 and 8.Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Google Scholar) or murine TLR8 (22Gorden K.K. Qiu X.X. Binsfeld C.C.A. Vasilakos J.P. Alkan S.S. Cutting edge: Activation of murine TLR8 by a combination of imidazoquinoline immune response modifiers and polyT oligo-deoxynucleotides.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6584-6658Google Scholar) in macrophages; thus, ssRNA cannot induce autophagy. In contrast, the same ligands from different bacteria might bind to different receptors to mediate xenophagy. In Drosophila primary hemocytes and S2 cells, two types of PGNs derived from different types of cells, DAP-type (from Lactobacillus plantarum) and lysine-type (from Staphylococcus epidermidis), can induce autophagy, but the receptor of peptidoglycan-recognition protein-LE (PGRP-LE) was responsible only for the induction of autophagy stimulated by DAP-type PGN, which suggests that cytoplasmic sensors other than PGRP-LE detect invading bacteria with cell walls containing lysine-type PGN (23Yano T. Mita S. Ohmori H. Oshima Y. Fujimoto Y. Ueda R. Takada H. Goldman W.E. Fukase K. Silverman N. Yoshimori T. Kurata S.

Extracellular and intracellular pathogen recognition by Drosophila PGRP-LE and PGRP-LC.Int. Immunol. 2010; 22: 143-148Google Scholar). Although the fundamental mechanism linking one pathogen with the autophagy machinery has been well studied, the mechanism through which host cells use distinct sensors to induce xenophagy in response to two or more microbes is largely unknown. After the specific binding between PAMPs from microbes and PRRs from the host, the ubiquitination of some key autophagy-related proteins and cargoes is an important step for the formation of autophagosomes and subsequent autophagic degradation via xenophagy (7Mizushima N. The ATG conjugation systems in autophagy.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 63: 1-10Google Scholar). TRAF6, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is widely involved in autophagy induction due to its autoubiquitination and heteroubiquitination activities (25Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. TRAF6 and A20 regulate lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin-1 to control TLR4-induced autophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 3: 1-10Google Scholar). The stimulation of TLR4 and TLR3 with LPS and poly(I:C), respectively, triggers autophagy in lung cancer cells, which enhances the production of various cytokines by promoting TRAF6 ubiquitination and thus facilitates immune defense against pathogens (26Zhan Z.Z. Xie X.F. Cao H. Zhou X. Xu D.Z. Autophagy facilitates TLR4- and TLR3-triggered migration and invasion of lung cancer cells through the promotion of TRAF6 ubiquitination.Autophagy. 2014; 10: 257-268Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that Beclin1 is the principal substrate of the ubiquitin ligases that regulate the autophagy machinery (27Grumati P. Dikic I. Ubiquitin signaling and autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 5404-5413Google Scholar). K63-ubiquitination of Beclin1 promotes autophagy induction (28Fusco C. Mandriani B. Rienzo M.D. Micale L. Malerba N. Cocciadiferro D. Sjøttem E. Augello B. Squeo G. Pellico M.T. Jain A. Johansen T. Fimia G.M. Merla G. TRIM50 regulates Beclin 1 proautophagic activity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol.

Upon TLR engagement, TRAF6 promotes the K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin1, Beclin1 is a core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3), and the K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin1 modulates the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC3 and thereby induces autophagy (25Shi C.S.

Getting ready for building: Signaling and autophagosome biogenesis.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 839-852Google Scholar). More importantly, the engagement of TLRs also triggers a signaling pathway that leads to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and promotes the expression of A20. A20 contains an N-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) deubiquitinase domain that removes K63-polyubiquitin chains from TRAF6 to turn off the activation of autophagy (25Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H.

A20 at the crossroads of cell death, inflammation, and autoimmunity.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2020; 12a036418Google Scholar), which indicates that A20 negatively regulates TLR-induced autophagy in human cells. Aquatic organisms are confronted with numerous microbial challenges in their living environments, including pathogenic, nonpathogenic, and beneficial challenges. Despite the importance of xenophagy in innate immunity, which directly captures pathogens or indirectly mediates immune responses to control foreign microbe infection (16Tang D. Kang R. Coyne C.B. Zeh H.J. Lotze M.T. PAMPs and DAMPs: Signals that spur autophagy and immunity.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 49: 158-175Google Scholar, 33Shu D.G. Morris S.C. Han J. Zhang Z.F. Liu J.N. Ancestral echinoderms from the Chengjiang deposits of China.Nature. 2004; 430: 422-428Google Scholar), the mechanism regulating xenophagy in response to different bacterial infections in the same species is largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap between xenophagy and host innate immune responses in aquatic organisms, we used Apostichopus japonicus, an economically important marine species, as a model. The sea cucumber A. japonicus is a marine invertebrate belonging to the Echinodermata and widely distributed in China, Korea, and other Asian countries. These species play important roles in ecology and aquaculture, they provide commodity or medicine valued by humans, including food resources (34Han Q. Keesing J.K. Liu D. A review of sea cucumber aquaculture, ranching, and stock enhancement in China.Rev. Fish. Sci. Aquac. 2016; 24: 326-341Google Scholar). In China, the gross production of A. japonicus reached as high as 196,564 tons in 2020 and obtained remarkable economic. Moreover, they occupy a taxonomic position that is believed to be important for understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostomes. Considering the important role of xenophagy in resisting microorganisms, we decided to investigate the different bacteria in the regulation of sea cucumber autophagy. In this study, we confirmed that two Gram-negative bacteria, Vibrio splendidus and Escherichia coli, showed differential capacity to regulate xenophagy via different TLR cascades, whereas the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus could not activate autophagy activity. The molecular basis for the different autophagy levels induced by the two Gram-negative bacteria was also elucidated. The findings obtained in this study will provide valuable insights into the autophagy mechanisms through which xenophagy and innate immunity pathways intersect and their contribution to cell survival in marine invertebrate species. The occurrence of autophagy in vertebrates involves four main successive steps, namely autophagy initiation, phagophore elongation, autophagosome formation, and lysosome fusion, and many key proteins and adaptors are involved in these processes (35Parzych K.R. Klionsky D.J. An overview of autophagy: Morphology, mechanism, and regulation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20: 460-473Google Scholar). In our previous study, we found that the mRNA expression of several autophagy-related genes, such as AjULK, AjAtg13, AjBeclin1, and AjLC3, was significantly changed after V. splendidus challenge, which indicates that sea cucumbers might regulate autophagy-related genes and activate autophagy to resist pathogen invasion (36Chen K.Y. Shao Y.N. Li C.H. ULK induces autophagy by targeting Beclin-1 in Vibrio splendidus challenged Apostichopus japonicus.Aquaculture. 2021; 532: 736022Google Scholar). However, whether the complete machinery needed for the autophagy process exists in A. japonicus is largely unknown. To understand whether sea cucumber has the molecular basis for the autophagy machinery, key proteins encoding genes involved in autophagy regulation were screened from sea cucumber transcriptome (37Zhang P.J. Li C.H. Zhu L. Su X.R. Li Y. Jin C.H. Li T.W. De novo assembly of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus hemocytes transcriptome to identify miRNA targets associated with skin ulceration syndrome.PLoS One. 2013; 8e73506Google Scholar) and genomes (38Li Y.L.

Jin S. et al.The sea cucumber genome provides insights into morphological evolution and visceral regeneration.PLoS Biol. 2017; 15e2003790Google Scholar), and the sequences were used for in silico analysis and sequence alignment. In our study, we ultimately identified 39 Atgs in A. japonicus that belong to the five complexes implicated in the four major steps, namely initiation, elongation, completion, and fusion of the autophagosome (Table S1). The results in Figure 1 show the key proteins involved in the core molecular mechanism of autophagy in A. japonicus, and their amino acid sequences were conserved compared with those of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Among these autophagy-related proteins, LC3 plays an important role in the elongation of the autophagosome because its cleavage and its lipidation protein product (LC3-II) decorate autophagosomes. Animal LC3 proteins comprise two subfamilies: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3A/B/C), gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor–associated protein (GABARAP)/Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE16) (8Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Google Scholar). Our sequence data for sea cucumber included four homologous genes, AjLC3, AjLC3C, AjGABARAP, and AjGABARAPL2 (Table S1), and we found that all four proteins contain an ATG8 domain and a highly conserved glycine residue in C-terminal, which suggests that the sea cucumber LC3 conjugation system might have a function similar to that of other conserved LC3 proteins in eukaryotes (Fig. 1 and Table S1). The sequence alignment revealed that AjLC3 exhibited 70% identity with H. sapiens LC3B, and AjLC3C exhibited 56.7% identity with H. sapiens LC3C. In addition, autophagy receptors initiate isolation membrane formation by bridging ubiquitinated substrates and LC3 via their ubiquitin-binding region (UBR) and ATG8/LC3-interacting region (LIR), respectively. In our case, the two primary receptors Ajp62/SQSTM1 and AjNBR1 contained a UBR domain with an LIR motif at the C terminus (Fig. 1). In general, these results indicated that sea cucumbers possess the complete autophagy machinery and could be able to respond to bacterial infection. Selective autophagy is a homeostatic regulation system that can specifically recognize substrates and play an antibacterial role in the immune response of the host (40Verheye S. Martinet W. Kockx M.M. Knaapen M.W.M. Salu K. Timmermans J. Ellis J.T. Kilpatrick D.L. De Meyer G.R.Y. Selective clearance of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques by autophagy.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2007; 49: 706-715Google Scholar). However, the xenophagy mechanism in response to other specific microbes found in aquatic environments is relatively unknown. Therefore, sea cucumber coelomocyte was challenged with three types of bacteria, V. splendidus, E. coli, and M. luteus, and the autophagy levels were detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At 24 h after introduction of three bacteria into sea cucumbers, we observed double-membraned autophagosomes enclosed V. splendidus and E. coli within coelomocyte under Bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) treatment, but not in M. luteus–challenged group (Fig. 2A). The percentage of intracellular bacteria in autophagosomes reached 7.8 ± 1.8% in V. splendidus group and 10.2 ± 2.7% in E. coli group when compared with control (0 h) group. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis indicated that the AjLC3-II/I level was significantly increased at 12 (1.41-fold and 1.65-fold, p < 0.01) and 24 h (1.67-fold, p < 0.01 and 2.22-fold, p < 0.01) after challenge with V. splendidus and E. coli compared with the level in the 0 h (control) (Fig. 3, B and C), but M. luteus did not trigger an elevation in the lipidation of AjLC3 (Fig. 3A). An autophagy receptor protein of Ajp62 exhibited significant decreases at 24 h post E. coli (0.69-fold, p < 0.01) and V. splendidus (0.76-fold, p < 0.05) challenge compared with the level in the 0 h (Fig. 3, B and C), but this change was not detected in M. luteus–challenged sea cucumber coelomocyte (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we found that the AjLC3-II/I ratio in three bacteria challenged groups was significantly increases for Baf-A1 treatments, and the Ajp62 proteins were also measured and showed increased levels for Baf-A1 (Fig. 3). Besides, an immunofluorescence analysis indicated a significant increase in LC3 green fluorescence at 24 h after V. splendidus and E. coli challenge, but no significantly vivid spots were observed in M. luteus–challenged coelomocyte (Fig. 2B). The LC3-positive signal was significantly increased by 14.6- (p < 0.01) and 36.5-fold (p < 0.01) in the V. splendidus and E. coli groups, respectively. What is more, we found that the fluorescence intensity was clearly increased by Chloroquine (CQ) (Fig. 2C) in bacteria-infected sea cucumber coelomocyte and in the control group compared with that obtained without the injection of CQ (Fig. 2B), which suggested that bacteria induce functional degradative autophagy in A. japonicus. Moreover, to further verify the occurrence of autophagic flux in coelomocyte of A. japonicus, the accumulate LC3-positive puncta (AjLC3) induced by CQ or Baf-A1 was detected by immunofluorescence observation. Double-staining analysis indicated that the red fluorescence representing lysosomal membranes and the green signal representing autophagosomal membranes were colocalized at 24 h post V. splendidus and E. coli challenge (Fig. 2, D and E). The quantitative results showed that the LC3-positive signal was markedly upregulated by 23.6-fold (p < 0.01) and 73.5-fold (p < 0.01) in the V. splendidus and E. coli groups based on CQ treatments (Fig. 2D). And the LC3 green fluorescence was significantly increased by 35.2-fold (p < 0.01) in the V. splendidus group and 47.0-fold (p < 0.01) in the E. coli group under Baf-A1 treatments compared with that in the control group (Fig. 2E). All these results supported the conclusion that two Gram-negative bacteria, V. splendidus and E. coli, but not M. luteus, could induce xenophagy. Interestingly, the autophagy levels induced by E. coli were significantly higher than those induced by V. splendidus according to the number of autophagosomes, LC3 punctum formation, LC3-II/I ratio, and protein levels of two autophagy receptors (Figs. 2 and 3).Figure 3Characterization of A. japonicus coelomocyte xenophagy after challenge with M. luteus, V. splendidus, and E. coli by Western blotting analysis.

Liu J.X. Yang W.Q. Ling W.H. Lipopolysaccharide mediates hepatic stellate cell activation by regulating autophagy and retinoic acid signaling.Autophagy. 2017; 13: 1813-1827Google Scholar). To address the differential autophagy levels induced by V. splendidus and E. coli depending on their different LPS sources, we isolated the LPSs from V. splendidus and E. coli. Equal final concentrations of LPS (10 μg ml−1) were added to cultured coelomocyte followed by Baf-A1 treatments, and we found that both LPSs could promote autophagosome formation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the AjLC3-II/I level was significantly increased at 6 and 12 h after LPSE. coli exposure, and the protein level of Ajp62 was markedly decreased under the same condition, respectively (Fig. 4B). Similarity, the AjLC3-II/I level was also markedly increased after LPSV. splendidus stimulation, following with decreased expression of Ajp62 (Fig. 4B). What is more, significant increases in AjLC3-II/I and Ajp62 were both observed after Baf-A1 exposures, with the higher magnitudes in LPSE. coli group (Fig. 4B). To confirm whether autophagic flux occurred after LPS stimulation, the accumulated LC3 green signal was also measured by immunofluorescence following CQ or Baf-A1 treatment. Our results showed that the fluorescence intensity of AjLC3 was significantly increased at 12 h after the exposure of the coelomocyte to LPSE. coli following CQ (23.5-fold, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4C) and Baf-A1 (29.7-fold, p < 0.01) treatments (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the LC3 fluorescence intensity in LPSV. splendidus stimulation group was also observably increased by 3.66-fold (p < 0.01) with CQ (Fig. 4C) and 6.8"

https://openalex.org/W4210253724,"p53 is known to modulate metabolism and FDXR is required for steroidogenesis. Given that FDXR is a target/regulator of p53, the FDXR-p53 axis may play a unique role in lipid metabolism. Here, we found that expression of ABCA1, a cholesterol-efflux pump, was suppressed by loss of FDXR and/or p53, leading to activation of master lipogenic regulators SREBP1/2. Accordingly, lipid droplets, cholesterol, and triglycerides were increased by loss of FDXR or p53, which were further increased by loss of both FDXR and p53. To explore the biological significance of the FDXR-p53 axis, we generated a cohort of mice deficient in Fdxr and/or Trp53. We found that Fdxr+/-, Trp53+/-, and Fdxr+/-;Trp53+/- mice had a short life span and were prone to spontaneous tumors and liver steatosis. Moreover, the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly increased in Fdxr+/- and Trp53+/- mice, which were further increased in Fdxr+/-;Trp53+/- mice. Interestingly, loss of Fdxr but not p53 led to accumulation of serum low-density lipoprotein. Together, our findings reveal that the FDXR-p53 axis plays a critical role in lipid homeostasis and tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W4210501510,"The secreted form of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which catalyzes a key reaction in intracellular NAD biosynthesis, acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern triggering Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory responses. However, the precise mechanism of interaction is unclear. Using an integrated approach combining bioinformatics and functional and structural analyses, we investigated the interaction between NAMPT and TLR4 at the molecular level. Starting from previous evidence that the bacterial ortholog of NAMPT cannot elicit the inflammatory response, despite a high degree of structural conservation, two positively charged areas unique to the human enzyme (the α1-α2 and β1-β2 loops) were identified as likely candidates for TLR4 binding. However, alanine substitution of the positively charged residues within these loops did not affect either the oligomeric state or the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The kinetics of the binding of wildtype and mutated NAMPT to biosensor-tethered TLR4 was analyzed. We found that mutations in the α1-α2 loop strongly decreased the association rate, increasing the KD value from 18 nM, as determined for the wildtype, to 1.3 μM. In addition, mutations in the β1-β2 loop or its deletion increased the dissociation rate, yielding KD values of 0.63 and 0.22 μM, respectively. Mutations also impaired the ability of NAMPT to trigger the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway in human cultured macrophages. Finally, the involvement of the two loops in receptor binding was supported by NAMPT-TLR4 docking simulations. This study paves the way for future development of compounds that selectively target eNAMPT/TLR4 signaling in inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4210513891,"Xylan is the most common hemicellulose in plant cell walls, though the structure of xylan polymers differs between plant species. Here, to gain a better understanding of fungal xylan degradation systems, which can enhance enzymatic saccharification of plant cell walls in industrial processes, we conducted a comparative study of two glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3) β-xylosidases (Bxls), one from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcBxl3), and the other from the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei (TrXyl3A). A comparison of the crystal structures of the two enzymes, both with saccharide bound at the catalytic center, provided insight into the basis of substrate binding at each subsite. PcBxl3 has a substrate-binding pocket at subsite -1, while TrXyl3A has an extra loop that contains additional binding subsites. Furthermore, kinetic experiments revealed that PcBxl3 degraded xylooligosaccharides faster than TrXyl3A, while the KM values of TrXyl3A were lower than those of PcBxl3. The relationship between substrate specificity and degree of polymerization of substrates suggested that PcBxl3 preferentially degrades xylobiose (X2), while TrXyl3A degrades longer xylooligosaccharides. Moreover, docking simulation supported the existence of extended positive subsites of TrXyl3A in the extra loop located at the N-terminus of the protein. Finally, phylogenetic analysis suggests that wood-decaying basidiomycetes use Bxls such as PcBxl3 that act efficiently on xylan structures from woody plants, whereas molds use instead Bxls that efficiently degrade xylan from grass. Our results provide added insights into fungal efficient xylan degradation systems."
https://openalex.org/W4210281082,"Advances in eye tracking technology have enabled the development of interactive experimental setups to study social attention. Since these setups differ substantially from the eye tracker manufacturer's test conditions, validation is essential with regard to the quality of gaze data and other factors potentially threatening the validity of this signal. In this study, we evaluated the impact of accuracy and areas of interest (AOIs) size on the classification of simulated gaze (fixation) data. We defined AOIs of different sizes using the Limited-Radius Voronoi-Tessellation (LRVT) method, and simulated gaze data for facial target points with varying accuracy. As hypothesized, we found that accuracy and AOI size had strong effects on gaze classification. In addition, these effects were not independent and differed in falsely classified gaze inside AOIs (Type I errors; false alarms) and falsely classified gaze outside the predefined AOIs (Type II errors; misses). Our results indicate that smaller AOIs generally minimize false classifications as long as accuracy is good enough. For studies with lower accuracy, Type II errors can still be compensated to some extent by using larger AOIs, but at the cost of more probable Type I errors. Proper estimation of accuracy is therefore essential for making informed decisions regarding the size of AOIs in eye tracking research."

However, at present, machine learning based approaches of the analysis of this kind of images are highly relied on manual labeling of images for training. Fully automated processing of HE-stained images remains a challenging task due to the high degree of color intensity, size and shape uncertainty of the stained cells. For this problem, we propose a fully automatic pixel-wise semantic segmentation method based on pseudo-labels, which concerns to significantly reduce the manual cell sketching and labeling work before machine learning, and guarantees the accuracy of segmentation. First, we collect reliable training samples in a unsupervised manner based on K-means clustering results; second, we use full mixup strategy to enhance the training images and to obtain the U-Net model for the nuclei segmentation from the background. The experimental results based on the meningioma pathology image dataset show that the proposed method has good performance and the pathological features obtained statistically based on the segmentation results can be used to assist in the clinical grading of meningiomas. Compared with other machine learning strategies, it can provide a reliable reference for clinical research more effectively."

Detailed structural information is available for these soluble protein–FA complexes, but the structure of the protein conformation responsible for FA exchange at the membrane is unknown. Staphylococcus aureus FakB1 is a prototypical bacterial FA transfer protein that binds palmitate within a narrow, buried tunnel. Here, we define the conformational change from a “closed” FakB1 state to an “open” state that associates with the membrane and provides a path for entry and egress of the FA. Using NMR spectroscopy, we identified a conformationally flexible dynamic region in FakB1, and X-ray crystallography of FakB1 mutants captured the conformation of the open state. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations show that the new amphipathic α-helix formed in the open state inserts below the phosphate plane of the bilayer to create a diffusion channel for the hydrophobic FA tail to access the hydrocarbon core and place the carboxyl group at the phosphate layer. The membrane binding and catalytic properties of site-directed mutants were consistent with the proposed membrane docked structure predicted by our molecular dynamics simulations.

Lipids are hydrophobic molecules with limited water solubility and must be transferred between membrane organelles or to soluble enzymes by specialized transfer proteins that are able to sequester their apolar cargo and facilitate their transport through the cytosol (1Wong L.H.

The mammalian fatty acid-binding protein multigene family: Molecular and genetic insights into function.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Google Scholar). There are five essential steps common to all lipid transfer processes (Fig. 1A). First, the transfer protein ferries its enclosed cargo to the membrane. Second, it collides with the membrane bilayer surface via an electrostatic attraction or by exploiting a specific membrane ligand such as the phospholipid head group. Third, a conformational change occurs that opens the protein interior, exposes the buried lipid, and allows for its exchange with another lipid in the membrane. A ligand-free binding protein is an obligatory intermediate in the exchange process, and some binding proteins deposit their cargo and disengage from the membrane without loading a new ligand. Fourth, the conformational change reverses and the new protein–lipid complex dissociates from the membrane. Fifth, the complex moves through the cytosol to its destination. There are detailed crystal structures of the lipid transfer proteins in solution that reveal how they sequester lipids from solvent (4Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H.

In contrast, structures of the open exchange state of transfer proteins at the membrane interface remain elusive. The mammalian fatty acid (FA)-binding protein (FABP) family has a common β barrel fold formed by ten antiparallel β-strands that create a large internal cavity to accommodate many different FA structures (3Hertzel A.V.

The current model posits that the cap exists in an “open” state when an FABP is bound to the bilayer to allow FA exchange, but the conformation of the bilayer-associated FABP has not been described. The bacterial class of FA transfer proteins is called FakB, and the bound acyl chains are completely enclosed within the protein interior. However, they are structurally distinct from mammalian FABPs and have restricted internal cavities that are tailored to bind only selected FA structures (19Parsons J.B. Broussard T.C. Bose J.L.

The FA is integral to the stability of FakB proteins, and mutation of the hydrogen bond network that holds the FA carboxyl in place results in structurally unstable proteins (20Broussard T.C.

Chem. 2019; 294: 16416-16428Google Scholar). Like FABPs, the protein conformation that allows the FA to escape into the membrane is unknown. Despite their dissimilar folds, the mammalian and bacterial FA transfer proteins face an identical topological challenge. Namely, a conformational change must occur to create a diffusion channel for the FA to freely exchange between its position in the membrane bilayer and the interior of the transfer protein. Here, we use a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, MD simulations, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional biochemical assays to characterize the membrane-bound conformation of FakB. This study focuses on FakB1, an FA transfer protein from S. aureus that binds palmitic acid (16:0) before presenting it to FakA for phosphorylation and exchange with the membrane. NMR dynamics measurements detect a dynamic 23-residue region covering the FakB1 FA binding tunnel. We captured crystal structures of the open FakB1 conformation by introducing point mutations that insert bulky residues into the narrow FA tunnel. The open conformation arises from a conformational change in the dynamic region that rotates helix α8 outward to uncover the FA-binding tunnel and reorganizes the adjacent α8-β9 loop into a new amphipathic helix. MD simulations reveal how the newly formed helix α8′ inserts into the phospholipid bilayer to create a diffusion path for the FA to exit into the membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis coupled with biochemical assays corroborates the roles of key residues in this process. These data provide an understanding of how a conformational change in FakB1 facilitates the exchange of FA between the protein interior and the membrane that provides key insights into how this process occurs in mammalian FA binding proteins. FakB crystal structures show that the FA is completely buried within the protein interior with only the FA carboxylate group exposed for phosphorylation (20Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6292-6303Google Scholar, 21Cuypers M.G.

A fatty acid binding protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae facilitates the acquisition of host polyunsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 16416-16428Google Scholar). The structures also suggest a potential focal point for the conformational exchange that must occur to release the enclosed FA. The bulk of FakB1 forms the acyl chain binding pocket with the region between Asp164 and Lys186 forming a lid over the first eight carbons of the FA chain (Fig. 1B). Residues 175 to 186 are generally poorly resolved in the many deposited FakB structures, and in FakB1, this region has the highest B-factors (21Cuypers M.G. Subramanian C. Gullett J.M. Frank M.W. White S.W. Rock C.O. Acyl chain selectivity and physiological roles of Staphylococcus aureus fatty acid binding proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 38-49Google Scholar) suggesting that these residues are conformationally flexible. This region is connected to the rest of the protein by a hydrophobic interface and terminates at the bound FA with two hydrogen-bonding interactions between the side chains of Arg173 and Ser171 and the backbone carbonyl of Ile94 and the Nδ1 of His270, respectively (Fig. 1B). We used NMR spectroscopy to independently identify the dynamic regions of FakB1 in solution. The 2D [15N,1H] TROSY spectrum of [15N,13C]FakB1 at 293 K showed well-dispersed resonances, and all but four residues were assigned with the aid of spectra collected at 293 K using [2H,15N,13C]FakB1 (Fig. S1). The secondary structure calculated from TALOS analysis of the NMR spectra correlates well with the secondary structural elements observed in the FakB1 crystal structure (Fig. S2A) with the exception of helix α1 and sheet β5 that are not apparent from the TALOS analysis. Also, residues 178 to 181 within the α8-β9 loop are in an α-helical conformation based on the NMR spectra but have a less pronounced helical nature in the crystal structure. Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill relaxation dispersion (CPMG-RD) spectra were acquired using [2H,15N,13C]FakB1, at two different field strengths (81.1 MHz and 60.8 MHz) at 293 K to map the mobility within the FakB1 structure. The 15N relaxation dispersion profiles revealed that FakB1 is stably folded but ten residues adjacent to the bound FA are clearly dynamic (Fig. 1C). Four of these residues are within the Asp164-Lys186 region and include the central Arg173 and Leu165 at the amino-terminus of the region. The datasets were a close fit to a two-state exchange model using the equation of Carver and Richards (25Carver J.P. Richards R.E. General 2-site solution for chemical exchange produced dependence of T2 upon Carr-Purcell Pulse separation.J. Magn. Reson. 1972; 6: 89-105Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Data from all ten residues were used to fit a global two-state model with forward (kf) and reverse (kr) exchange rate constants 12.0 ± 1.0 s−1 and 753.0 ± 53.0 s−1, respectively, yielding an exchange rate constant (kex = kf + kr) of 764.2 ± 53.0 s−1. A Gibbs free energy barrier of 2.41 ± 0.07 kcal/mol is calculated from the exchange rates for the FakB1 conformational change. The major (98.5%) and the minor (1.5%) conformations exchange on the millisecond timescale. The rotation of the dynamic Arg173 residue away from the protein is predicted to expose and promote the opening of a portal to the buried FA. We determined the X-ray structure of FakB1(R173A) to determine if this was the case (Fig. 1E), but its overall structure was identical to that of FakB1 (RMSD = 0.210 Å) (Fig. S3A). The hydrophobic interface and the Ser171-His270 interaction are apparently sufficient to maintain the connection between the dynamic region and the body of FakB1 even though the absence of Arg173 does expose the first eight carbons of the FA to solvent as predicted (Fig. 1E). FakB1(R173A) is a few degrees less stable than FakB1 consistent with the loss of the hydrogen bond connection to Ile94 (Fig. S3B), and as expected (20Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6292-6303Google Scholar), FakB1(R173A) was catalytically inactive. Unlike the mammalian FABPs, FakB1 has a tight binding tunnel that presents an alternative opportunity to induce the conformational change by using site-directed mutagenesis to modulate the optimal packing of the FA into its binding site. We identified two alanine residues (121 and 158) in the tunnel and mutated them to bulkier residues to partially occlude the FA-binding pocket and push the FA out of its pocket to destabilize the fully closed FakB1 conformation (Fig. S3C). The FakB1(A121I) and FakB1(A158L) mutant proteins were fully active in FA kinase assays with the same apparent affinity for FakA (Fig. 1F), and analytical ultracentrifugation verified that both continue to form tight complexes with FakA (Table S1). However, the mutations did alter two key properties of FakB1. First, compared with the wild-type protein, the thermal stabilities of FakB1(A121I) and FakB1(A158L) were reduced by 6 °C and 4 °C, respectively (Fig. 1G), showing that the mutations indeed prevent FakB1 from adopting its most stable conformation. Second, the mutations altered the FA selectivity of FakB1 in a physiological setting. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the total amount of FA incorporated by the FakB1 mutant proteins was the same as the wild-type protein, but FakB1 only supported the incorporation of palmitic acid (16:0), whereas both mutant proteins were less specific and also incorporated oleate (18:1) and linoleate (18:2) (Fig. 1H). These data show that the tunnel mutations alter the stability and selectivity of FakB1, but do not impair the overall function of FakB1 in vivo or in vitro. The crystal structure of FakB1(A121I) was determined at 2.02 Å resolution (Table 1). We observed two molecules (molA and molB) in different conformational states in the asymmetric unit. The prototypical FakB1 closed conformation was exemplified by molB, but in molA, the dynamic region undergoes a significant structural rearrangement (Fig. 2A). Specifically, Arg173 disengages from the FA and Ile94, helix α8 (Leu165 to Ser171) moves away from the protein, and residues 175 to 186 form a new α-helix that rotates away from the protein by ∼180° in concert with the movement of helix α8. Excluding the structural rearrangements observed in FakB1(A121I), the open and closed structures superimpose with an RMSD of 0.356 Å showing that the conformational change is confined to these residues (Fig. 2A). Notably, the conformational change occurs precisely in the region of the protein revealed by NMR spectroscopy to exhibit dynamic properties (Fig. 1C). The surface rendering of FakB1(A121I) shows that the conformational change exposes the ligand-binding cavity and creates a portal to the FA (Fig. 2B).Table 1X-ray crystallography data collection, refinement, and validation statisticsComplexFakB1(A121I)-palmitate (open)FakB1(A158L)-myristate (open)FakB1(R173A)-palmitate (closed)FakB1(A121I, A158L)-Palmitate (open)PDB codes6MH96NM17SCL7SG3Data collection Beamline (APS)SER-CAT 22-IDSER-CAT 22-IDSER-CAT 22-IDSER-CAT 22-ID Temperature (K)100100100100 Space groupP1P1P1P1 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)33.5, 53.9, 86.033.4, 53.5, 86.233.2, 53.9, 84.433.2, 53.6, 85.9α, β, γ (°)103.7, 90.4, 107.376.9, 89.4, 72.3104.3, 90.7, 107.5104.2, 90.5, 107.0 Resolution (Å)83.29–2.0283.74–2.3349.60–1.6049.46–2.35 Rsym or Rmerge0.066 (0.726)aValues in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.0.086 (0.813)0.056 (0.596)0.069 (0.492) Rpim0.039 (0.438)0.051 (0.475)0.033 (0.351)0.042 (0.298) Unique reflections34,458 (2509)23,124 (2250)63,745 (2951)20,941 (1997) Redundancy3.8 (3.7)3.9 (3.9)3.8 (3.8)3.6 (3.6) CC (1/2)0.997 (0.724)0.998 (0.748)0.998 (0.841)0.997 (0.867) Mean I/σI12.3 (1.9)10.2 (1.9)7.0 (2.0)6.9 (1.9) Completeness (%)94.4 (91.3)98.2 (97.7)89.7 (83.5)92.0 (90.7) Wilson B-factor (Å−2)34.838.024.042.3Model quality Rwork/Rfree20.7/25.823.7/28.816.19/19.3121.17/25.09 No. atomsProtein4539448344264188Ligand/ion36324836Water20713435969 B-factorsProtein41.753.639.958.2Fatty acid36.048.735.161.3Water46.351.448.053.6 R.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0020.0020.0080.003Bond angles (°)0.4490.4771.0220.500 Ramachandran plotFavored (%)97.092.196.897.2Allowed (%)2.76.02.52.0Outliers (%)0.41.90.71.3Clashscore5.77.85.46.7a Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell. Open table in a new tab We also determined the 2.33 Å crystal structure of FakB1(A158L) (Table 1), which was structurally identical to FakB1(A121I). The open FakB1(A158L) molA structure superimposes on the FakB1(A121I) molA structure with an RMSD of 0.265 Å (Fig. 2C). In FakB1(A121I), the bulkier side chain displaces the middle of the aliphatic chain of the FA by 0.9 Å and its distal end by ∼1.4 Å that, in turn, shifts the tunnel residues Val162, Leu191, and Leu271 and pushes against the dynamic region. A similar process occurs in FakB1(A158L). The 2.35 Å crystal structure of the FakB1(A121I, A158L) double mutant was also determined (Table 1), and superposition of the FakB1(A121I) and FakB1(A121I, A158L) structures shows that they are basically identical with an RMSD = 0.241 Å (Fig. S3D). Thus, three independent mutants generated the identical conformational change. The FakB1(A121I) is the highest-resolution crystal structure and was used as the representative open conformation for further analysis. The dynamic region between residues 177 and 186 is generally poorly resolved or not present in many FakB structures deposited in the PDB. In our FakB1 structure (21Cuypers M.G. Subramanian C. Gullett J.M. Frank M.W. White S.W. Rock C.O. Acyl chain selectivity and physiological roles of Staphylococcus aureus fatty acid binding proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 38-49Google Scholar), residues 180 to 183 have the highest B-factors in the crystal structure, but the positions of the residues in the α8-β9 loop can be located in the 2Fo-Fc and SA-OMIT electron density maps (Fig. S4A). In the FakB1(A121I) structure, the α8-β9 loop residues become helix α8′, and the residues within this helix have lower B-factors than in the FakB1 structure (Fig. S4B). This allows the conformation of the new 12-residue helix α8′ to be clearly defined in the 2Fo-Fc and SA-OMIT maps (Fig. S4B). In the closed conformation, Trp180 is tightly packed against the hydrophobic interior of the protein, and Arg173 is packed onto the bound FA (Fig. 2D, left panel). There is also a hydrogen bond network consisting of Thr62, Ser95, Ser171, His270, and the FA carboxylate that appears to balance the negative charge on the FA (Fig. 2D, right panel). In the open conformation, Arg173 becomes disengaged from FakB1 (Fig. 2E, left panel), and the newly formed 12-residue helix that we designate as α8′ has a distinct exposed hydrophobic surface consisting of Ala177, Trp180, Val181, Leu184, and Leu185. We suggest that the low dielectric constant within the FakB1(A121I) crystal lattice coupled with the location of Phe38 and Ile44 on the neighboring molecule that is only available to molA create an apolar environment for the relocation and stabilization of helix α8′ (Fig. S5A). We also note that the disengagement of Arg173 from the FA and the outward movements of α8 and α8′ disrupt the hydrogen bond network surrounding the FA carboxylate by breaking the key Ser171-His270 hydrogen bond and exposing His270 to solvent (Fig. 2E, right panel). FakB1(A121I) was analyzed by NMR to determine how the mutation impacts protein dynamics. The 2D [15N,1H] TROSY spectrum of FakB1(A121I) was similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. S5B) with the largest chemical shift differences localized to the area adjacent to the Ala121 mutation (Fig. S5C). CPMG-RD data for [2H,15N,13C]FakB1(A121I) collected at two field strengths at 293 K revealed 12 residues with 15N relaxation dispersion profiles that mapped to the same locations as the ten dynamic residues in FakB1 (Fig. S5D). These residues are more mobile than in FakB1(121I) as exemplified by Arg173 and Leu165 (compare Figs. S5E and 1D). The global exchange rate was kex = 757.3"
https://openalex.org/W4210423012,"Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS) is a medically refractory neurotological disorder characterized by persistent oscillating vertigo that follows a period of entrainment to oscillating motion such as experienced during sea or air travel. Fronto-occipital hypersynchrony may correlate with MdDS symptom severity.Individuals with treatment refractory MdDS lasting at least 6 months received single administrations of three fronto-occipital transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) protocols in an ""n-of-1"" double-blind randomized design: alpha frequency anti-phase, alpha-frequency in-phase, and gamma frequency control. Baseline assessments were made on Day 1. The treatment protocol that led to the most acute reduction in symptoms during a test session on Day 2 was administered for 10-12 stacked sessions given on Days 3 through 5 (20-minutes at 2-4mA). Pre to post symptom changes were assessed on Day 1 and Day 5. Participants who could clearly choose a preferred protocol on Day 2 did better on Day 5 than those who could not make a short-term determination on Day 2 and either chose a protocol based on minimized side effects or were randomized to one of the three protocols. In addition, weekly symptom assessments were made for four baseline and seven post stimulation points for the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), MdDS Balance Rating Scale (MBRS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Of 24 participants, 13 chose anti-phase, 7 chose in-phase, and 4 chose control stimulation. Compared to baseline, 10/24 completers noted ≥ 25% reduction, 5/24 ≥50% reduction, and 2/24 ≥75% reduction in oscillating vertigo intensity from Day 1 to Day 5. Stimulating at a frequency slightly higher than the individual alpha frequency (IAF) was better than stimulating at exactly the IAF, and slightly better than stimulating with a strategy of standardized stimulation at 10Hz. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA of weekly DHI, MBRS, and HADS measurements showed significant reductions immediately after treatment with improvement increasing through post-treatment week 6.Fronto-occipital tACS may be effective in reducing the oscillating vertigo of MdDS and serve as a portable neuromodulation alternative for longer-term treatment. Stimulation frequency relative to the IAF may be important in determining the optimum treatment protocol [ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT02540616. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02540616]."

Feasibility (attendance, adherence, retention) and acceptability (program satisfaction ratings) were assessed. Treatment groups were compared on weight change, mindfulness, distress tolerance, stress, affect, and self-compassion at 6 months. Initial WL (3-mo WL) was evaluated as a potential moderator.Attendance, retention, and program satisfaction ratings of yoga were high. Treatment groups did not differ on WL or psychological constructs (with exception of one mindfulness subscale) at 6 months. However, among those with high initial WL (≥5%), YOGA lost significantly more weight (-9.0kg vs. -6.7kg) at 6 months and resulted in greater distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion and lower negative affect, compared to CON.Study findings provide preliminary support for yoga as a potential strategy for improving long-term WL among those losing ≥5% in standard behavioral treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4210576087,"A multienzyme metabolic assembly for human glucose metabolism, namely the glucosome, has been previously demonstrated to partition glucose flux between glycolysis and building block biosynthesis in an assembly size-dependent manner. Among three different sizes of glucosome assemblies, we have shown that large-sized glucosomes are functionally associated with the promotion of serine biosynthesis in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, due to multifunctional roles of EGF in signaling pathways, it is unclear which EGF-mediated signaling pathways promote these large glucosome assemblies in cancer cells. In this study, we used Luminex multiplexing assays and high-content single-cell imaging to demonstrate that EGF triggers temporal activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in Hs578T cells. Subsequently, we found that treatments with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK1/2, SCH772984, or short-hairpin RNAs targeting ERK1/2 promote the dissociation of large-sized assemblies to medium-sized assemblies in Hs578T cells. In addition, our Western blot analyses revealed that EGF treatment does not increase the expression levels of enzymes that are involved in both glucose metabolism and serine biosynthesis. The observed spatial transition of glucosome assemblies between large and medium sizes appears to be mediated by the degree of dynamic partitioning of glucosome enzymes without changing their expression levels. Collectively, our study demonstrates that EGF-ERK1/2 signaling pathways play an important role in the upregulation of large-sized glucosomes in cancer cells, thus functionally governing the promotion of glycolysis-derived serine biosynthesis."

In this paper, the critical meteorological conditions of icy bridge deck were predicted by multiple linear regression and BP neural network respectively. Firstly, the main parameters affecting the bridge pavement temperature were determined by Pearson partial correlation analysis based on the three-year winter meteorological data of the traffic meteorological monitoring station on the bridge in Shandong province. Secondly, the bridge pavement temperature is selected as the dependent variable, while air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, dew point temperature, wet bulb temperature and wind cold temperature were selected as independent variables, and the bridge pavement temperature prediction models of linear regression and 5-layer hidden layer classical BP neural network regression were established respectively based on whether the variables are linear or not. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the above models was compared by using the measured data. The results show that the linear regression model could be established only with air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, owing to collinearity problem. Compared with multiple linear regression model, the predicted value of the BP neural network has a higher degree of fitting with the measured data, and the coefficient of determination reaches 0.7929. Using multiple linear regression and BP neural network, the critical meteorological conditions of bridge deck icing in winter can be effectively predicted even when the sample size is insufficient."
https://openalex.org/W4210324498,"Many human connexin50 (Cx50) mutants have been linked to cataracts including two carboxyl terminus serine mutants that are known phosphorylation sites in the lens (Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y). To examine the behavior of these mutants and the role of phosphorylation at these positions, we stably transfected HeLa cells with cataract-linked and phosphorylation-mimicking (Cx50S258D and Cx50S259D) Cx50 mutants. We observed that gap junctional plaques were rarely detected in Cx50S258F-expressing and Cx50S259Y-expressing cells compared with wild-type cells. In contrast, gap junction abundance and size were greatly increased for Cx50S258D and Cx50S259D mutants. Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y supported very low levels of gap junctional coupling, whereas Cx50S258D and Cx50S259D supported extensive intercellular communication. Furthermore, Cx50 levels as detected by immunoblotting were lower in Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y mutants than in the wild-type or the aspartate substitution mutants, and chloroquine or ammonium chloride treatment significantly increased Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y protein levels, implying participation of the lysosome in their increased degradation. Alanine substitution of amino acids within a predicted tyrosine-based sorting signal in Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y increased levels of gap junctional plaques and intercellular transfer of neurobiotin. These results suggest that the absence of phosphorylatable serines at these positions exposes a sorting signal leading to lysosomal degradation of Cx50, whereas phosphorylation at these sites conceals this signal and allows targeting of Cx50 to the plasma membrane and stabilization of gap junction plaques. We propose that in the lens, degradation of Cx50S258F and Cx50S259Y decreases Cx50 levels at the plasma membrane and consequently Cx50 function, leading to cataracts."
https://openalex.org/W4210495249,"Genome integrity requires complete and accurate DNA replication once per cell division cycle. Replication stress poses obstacles to this process that must be overcome to prevent replication fork collapse. An important regulator of replication fork stability is the RAD51 protein, which promotes replication fork reversal and protects nascent DNA strands from nuclease-mediated degradation. Many regulatory proteins control these RAD51 activities, including RADX, which binds both ssDNA and RAD51 at replication forks to ensure that fork reversal is confined to stalled forks. Many ssDNA-binding proteins function as hetero- or homo-oligomers. In this study, we addressed whether this is also the case for RADX. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we found that RADX acts as a homo-oligomer to control replication fork stability. RADX oligomerizes using at least two different interaction surfaces, including one mapped to a C-terminal region. We demonstrate that mutations in this region prevent oligomerization and prevent RADX function in cells, and that addition of a heterologous dimerization domain to the oligomerization mutants restored their ability to regulate replication. Taken together, our results demonstrate that like many ssDNA-binding proteins, oligomerization is essential for RADX-mediated regulation of genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W4210664350,"Human AlkB homolog 6, ALKBH6, plays key roles in nucleic acid damage repair and tumor therapy. However, no precise structural and functional information are available for this protein. In this study, we determined atomic resolution crystal structures of human holo-ALKBH6 and its complex with ligands. AlkB members bind nucleic acids by NRLs (nucleotide recognition lids, also called Flips), which can recognize DNA/RNA and flip methylated lesions. We found that ALKBH6 has unusual Flip1 and Flip2 domains, distinct from other AlkB family members both in sequence and conformation. Moreover, we show that its unique Flip3 domain has multiple unreported functions, such as discriminating against double-stranded nucleic acids, blocking the active center, binding other proteins, and in suppressing tumor growth. Structural analyses and substrate screening reveal how ALKBH6 discriminates between different types of nucleic acids and may also function as a nucleic acid demethylase. Structure-based interacting partner screening not only uncovered an unidentified interaction of transcription repressor ZMYND11 and ALKBH6 in tumor suppression but also revealed cross talk between histone modification and nucleic acid modification in epigenetic regulation. Taken together, these results shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying ALKBH6-associated nucleic acid damage repair and tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4210372353,"A 65-day growth trial was conducted to investigate the dietary protein requirements for Culter mongolicus fingerlings. Isolipidic and isoenergetic diets were formulated with five dietary protein levels (32%, 37%, 42%, 47%, and 52%). Each diet was assigned to triplicate groups of 70 C. mongolicus fingerlings (0.99±0.08 g). The results indicated that weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) increased with increasing dietary protein levels up to 47%. The activities of intestinal trypsin and lipase were the lowest in the 32% protein and 52% protein groups, while amylase activity reduced markedly in the 47% protein group. These results suggest that different dietary protein levels may cause different transformations of nutrients. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lysozyme were not affected by varying dietary protein levels, except for those in the 32% protein group. In contrast, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased with increasing dietary protein levels and reaching a maximum in the 52% protein group, suggesting that MDA accumulation depends on the protein concentration and the potential oxidative stress. Taken together, based on the broken-line analysis of SGR, we recommended the optimum dietary protein for C. mongolicus fingerlings to be 48.97%~49.31%."
https://openalex.org/W4210757157,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is over-expressed in various human cancer. The over-expression of EGFR in tumors is an excellent target for the development of cancer imaging agents. In the present study, we developed Tc-99m SYPIPDT-GHEG-ECG-K-tetramethylrhodamine (SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA) as a molecular imaging agent targeting wild-type EFGR (wtEGFR)-positive tumor cells, and verified its feasibility as molecular imaging agent. SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA was synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. The radiolabeling of SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA with Tc-99m was accomplished using ligand exchange via tartrate. Cellular uptake and binding affinity studies were performed. In vivo gamma camera imaging, ex vivo imaging and biodistribution studies were performed using NCI-H460 and SW620 tumor-bearing murine models. After radiolabeling procedures with Tc-99m, Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA complexes were prepared at high yield (> 95%). The binding affinity value (Kd) of Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA for NCI-H460 cells was estimated to be 76.5 ± 15.8 nM. In gamma camera imaging, the tumor to normal muscle uptake ratios of Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA increased with time (2.7 ± 0.6, 4.0 ± 0.9, and 6.2 ± 1.0 at 1, 2, and 3 h, respectively). The percentage injected dose per gram of wet tissue for the NCI-H460 tumor was 1.91 ± 0.11 and 1.70 ± 0.22 at 1 and 3 h, respectively. We developed Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA, which is dual-labeled with both radioisotope and fluorescence. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated specific uptake of Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA into wtEGFR-positive NCI-H460 cells and tumors. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that Tc-99m SYPIPDT-ECG-TAMRA is a potential dual-modality imaging agent targeting wtEGFR."

This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of the HEart failure Palliative care Training program for comprehensive care providers (HEPT), a physician education program on primary palliative care in HF. We performed a pre- and post-test survey to evaluate HEPT outcomes. Physician-reported practices, difficulties and knowledge were evaluated using the Palliative Care Self-Reported Practices Scale in HF (PCPS-HF), Palliative Care Difficulties Scale in HF (PCDS-HF), and Palliative care knowledge Test in HF (PT-HF), respectively. Structural equation models (SEM) were used to estimate path coefficients for PCPS-HF, PCDS-HF, and PT-HF. A total of 207 physicians participated in the HEPT between February 2018 and July 2019, and 148 questionnaires were ultimately analyzed. The total PCPS-HF, PCDS-HF, and PT-HF scores were significantly improved 6 months after HEPT completion (61.1 vs 67.7, p<0.001, 54.9 vs 45.1, p<0.001, and 20.8 vs 25.7, p<0.001, respectively). SEM analysis showed that for pre-post difference (Dif) PCPS-HF, ""clinical experience of more than 14 years"" and pre-test score had significant negative effects (-2.31, p = 0.048, 0.52, p<0.001, respectively). For Dif PCDS-HF, ≥ ""28 years old or older"" had a significant positive direct effect (13.63, p<0.001), although the pre-test score had a negative direct effect (-0.56, p<0.001). For PT-HF, ""involvement in more than 50 HF patients' treatment in the past year"" showed a positive direct effect (0.72, p = 0.046), although the pre-test score showed a negative effect (-0.78, p<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W4210262930,"The study used Quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) on a nationally representative household level data set to estimate the effect of alcohol consumption expenditure on a set of expenditure proportions of other commodities. The results indicate that, the low-income, including the rural population, spent proportionately more on alcohol than their well-off and urban counterparts. Furthermore, the consumption of alcohol crowded-out expenditures on consumer non-durable (food and beverages), durable (housing) and essential services (education). The crowding out of these expenditures clearly has negative impacts on the wellbeing of individuals within households and communities through misallocated household resources. The strong, unequivocal message coming out of the results obtained in this study is that certainly for poorer countries alcohol consumption is inimical to household poverty reduction."

The Norwegian version of the Multicomponent Training Distress Scale (MTDS-N) was completed by 608 student athletes (M age = 17.29 ± .94). Univariate and multivariate techniques were used in data analyses. Results revealed significant differences in weekly training volume between sport types. No significant differences in weekly training volume were found for gender, school year, or school program. However, a multivariate effect was found for gender, with females perceiving higher levels of training distress than males. A multivariate interaction effect between school year and training volume was also observed. We recommend that practitioners use a conceptual framework to periodize training and monitor training distress in student athletes, particularly in females, to preserve physiological and psychological well-being and ensure a progressive training overload leading to positive performance development."
https://openalex.org/W4210305911,"Corneal grafts are the imperative clinical treatment for canine corneal blindness. To serve the growing demand, this study aimed to generate tissue-engineered canine cornea in part of the corneal epithelium and underlying stroma based on canine limbal epithelial stem cells (cLESCs) seeded silk fibroin/gelatin (SF/G) film and canine corneal stromal stem cells (cCSSCs) seeded SF/G scaffold, respectively. Both cell types were successfully isolated by collagenase I. SF/G corneal films and stromal scaffolds served as the prospective substrates for cLESCs and cCSSCs by promoting cell adhesion, cell viability, and cell proliferation. The results revealed the upregulation of tumor protein P63 (P63) and ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2 (Abcg2) of cLESCs as well as Keratocan (Kera), Lumican (Lum), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A1 (Aldh3a1) and Aquaporin 1 (Aqp1) of differentiated keratocytes. Moreover, immunohistochemistry illustrated the positive staining of tumor protein P63 (P63), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A1 (Aldh3a1), lumican (Lum) and collagen I (Col-I), which are considerable for native cornea. This study manifested a feasible platform to construct tissue-engineered canine cornea for functional grafts and positively contributed to the body of knowledge related to canine corneal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W4210365304,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene NR3C1 have been associated with an altered sensitivity to glucocorticoids, and thus may alter the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids. We investigated the prevalence of adrenal suppression after treatment with glucocorticoids and evaluated whether GR SNPs were associated with altered risks of adrenal suppression and metabolic disorders in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).In an observational prospective cohort study, we recruited 78 patients with severe COPD receiving 5 days glucocorticoid treatment for an exacerbation of COPD. In total, 55% of these patients were also receiving regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Adrenal function was evaluated with a corticotropin test 30 days after the exacerbation. Patients were genotyped for Bcl1, N363S, ER22/23EK, and 9β SNPs.The prevalence of adrenal suppression (corticotropin-stimulated plasma-cortisol ≤ 420 nmol/L) 30 days after glucocorticoid treatment was 4/78 (5%). There was no difference between carriers and non-carriers of the polymorphisms (Bcl1, 9β, ER22/23K, and N363S) in corticotropin stimulated plasma-cortisol concentrations. In the haplotype analyses, we included the 50 patients who had a high-sensitivity (76%), a low-sensitivity (4%), or a wild-type (20%) GR haplotype. There was no difference in the frequency of adrenal suppression or metabolic disorders between the two stratified groups: (a) high-sensitivity (Bcl1 and/or N363S) haplotypes vs. (b) low-sensitivity (9β and/or ER22/23K) plus wild-type haplotypes (p > 0.05). Carriers of the high-sensitivity GR gene haplotype exhibited a steeper decline in stimulated P-cortisol with increased ICS dose (slope, -1.35 vs. 0.94; p = 0.17), compared to the group with low-sensitivity or wild-type haplotypes, respectively.In total, 5% of patients exhibited insufficient adrenal function. The Bcl1 and N363S polymorphisms did not seem to increase the risk of glucocorticoid suppression or metabolic disorders in adults treated with glucocorticoids for COPD exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W4210477745,"In post-stroke patients, muscle synergy (the coordination of motor modules during walking) is impaired. In some patients, the muscle synergy termed module 1 (hip/knee extensors) is merged with module 2 (ankle plantar flexors), and in other cases, module 1 is merged with module 4 (knee flexors). However, post-stroke individuals with a merging pattern of module 3 (hip flexor and ankle dorsiflexor) and module 4, which is the swing-muscle synergy, have not been reported. This study aimed to determine the muscle-synergy merging subtypes of post-stroke during comfortable walking speed (cws). We also examined the effect of experimental lower-limb angle modulation on the muscle synergy patterns of walking in each subtype. Forty-one participants were assessed under three conditions: cws, long stepping on the paretic side (p-long), and long stepping on the non-paretic side (np-long). Lower-limb flexion and extension angles and the electromyogram were measured during walking. Subtype classification was based on the merging pattern of the muscle synergies, and we examined the effect of different lower-limb angles on the muscle synergies. We identified three merging subtypes: module 1 with module 2 (subtype 1), module 1 with module 4 (subtype 2), and module 3 with module 4 (subtype 3). In the cws condition, the lower-limb flexion angle was reduced in subtype 3, and the lower-limb extension angle was decreased in subtype 1. A more complex muscle synergy was observed only in subtype 3 in the p-long condition versus cws (p = 0.036). This subtype classification of walking impairments based on the merging pattern of the muscle synergies could be useful for the selection of a rehabilitation strategy according to the individual's particular neurological condition. Rehabilitation with increased lower-limb flexion may be effective for the training of patients with merging of modules 3 and 4 in comfortable walking."
https://openalex.org/W4210492713,"As blood-derived miRNAs (c-miRNAs) are modulated by exercise and nutrition, we postulated that they might be used to monitor the effects of a lifestyle intervention (LI) to prevent diabetes development. To challenge this hypothesis, obese Asian Indian pre-diabetic patients were submitted to diet modifications and physical activity for 4 months (LI group) and compared to a control group which was given recommendations only. We have considered 2 periods of time to analyze the data, i . e .; a first one to study the response to the intervention (4 months), and a second one post-intervention (8 months). At basal, 4 months and 8 months post-intervention the levels of 17 c-miRNAs were quantified, selected either for their relevance to the pathology or because they are known to be modulated by physical activity or diet. Their variations were correlated with variations of 25 metabolic and anthropometric parameters and cytokines. As expected, fasting-glycaemia, insulin-sensitivity, levels of exercise- and obesity-induced cytokines were ameliorated after 4 months. In addition, the levels of 4 miRNAs ( i . e .; miR-128-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-133a-3p) were changed only in the LI group and were correlated with metabolic improvement (insulin sensitivity, cytokine levels, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure). However, 8 months post-intervention almost all ameliorated metabolic parameters declined indicating that the volunteers did not continue the protocol on their own. Surprisingly, the LI positive effects on c-miRNA levels were still detected, and were even more pronounced 8 months post-intervention. In parallel, MCP-1, involved in tissue infiltration by immune cells, and Il-6, adiponectin and irisin, which have anti-inflammatory effects, continued to be significantly and positively modified, 8 months post-intervention. These data demonstrated for the first time, that c-miRNA correlations with metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity are in fact only indirect and likely associated with the level systemic inflammation. More generally speaking, this important result explains the high variability between the previous studies designed to identify specific c-miRNAs associated with the severity of insulin-resistance. The results of all these studies should take into account the level of inflammation of the patients. In addition, this finding could also explain why, whatever the pathology considered ( i . e .; cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory diseases) the same subset of miRNAs is always found altered in the blood of patients vs healthy subjects, as these pathologies are all associated with the development of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4210581561,"Sulfite oxidase (SOX) is a homodimeric molybdoheme enzyme that oxidizes sulfite to sulfate at the molybdenum center. Following substrate oxidation, molybdenum is reduced and subsequently regenerated by two sequential electron transfers (ETs) via heme to cytochrome c. SOX harbors both metals in spatially separated domains within each subunit, suggesting that domain movement is necessary to allow intramolecular ET. To address whether one subunit in a SOX dimer is sufficient for catalysis, we produced heterodimeric SOX variants with abolished sulfite oxidation by replacing the molybdenum-coordinating and essential cysteine in the active site. To further elucidate whether electrons can bifurcate between subunits, we truncated one or both subunits by deleting the heme domain. We generated three SOX heterodimers: (i) SOX/Mo with two active molybdenum centers but one deleted heme domain, (ii) SOX/Mo_C264S with one unmodified and one inactive subunit, and (iii) SOX_C264S/Mo harboring a functional molybdenum center on one subunit and a heme domain on the other subunit. Steady-state kinetics showed 50% SOX activity for the SOX/Mo and SOX/Mo_C264S heterodimers, whereas SOX_C264S/Mo activity was reduced by two orders of magnitude. Rapid reaction kinetics monitoring revealed comparable ET rates in SOX/Mo, SOX/Mo_C264S, and SOX/SOX, whereas in SOX_C264S/Mo, ET was strongly compromised. We also combined a functional SOX Mo domain with an inactive full-length SOX R217W variant and demonstrated interdimer ET that resembled SOX_C264S/Mo activity. Collectively, our results indicate that one functional subunit in SOX is sufficient for catalysis and that electrons derived from either Mo(IV) or Mo(V) follow this path."
https://openalex.org/W4210739044,"Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has the potential to resolve structural details of biological samples at the nanometer length scale. Compared to room temperature experiments, SMLM performed under cryogenic temperature achieves higher photon yields and, hence, higher localization precision. However, to fully exploit the resolution it is crucial to account for the anisotropic emission characteristics of fluorescence dipole emitters with fixed orientation. In case of slight residual defocus, localization estimates may well be biased by tens of nanometers. We show here that astigmatic imaging in combination with information about the dipole orientation allows to extract the position of the dipole emitters without localization bias and down to a precision of 1 nm, thereby reaching the corresponding Cramér Rao bound. The approach is showcased with simulated data for various dipole orientations, and parameter settings realistic for real life experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4210250111,"This study aimed to explore the perspective of nurses, therapists and stroke survivors on the performance of upper limb self-exercise and use outside therapy during early inpatient stroke rehabilitation.A descriptive qualitative approach was used in focus groups with nurses (n = 21) and therapists (n = 8), as well as in-depth semi-structured interviews with stroke survivors (n = 8) who were undergoing subacute inpatient stroke rehabilitation. Inductive thematic analysis of data was performed according to participant group.Nurses and therapists perceived that stroke survivors played a central role in determining the success of a self-directed upper limb program. Nurses perceived that stroke survivors needed a lot of prompting to be motivated to perform self-directed upper limb therapy outside therapy. Therapists perceived that not all stroke survivors would be able to perform self-directed upper limb therapy and deemed it important to consider stroke survivor factors before commencing a program. Although some stroke survivors expressed initial reservations with performing self-practice, many indicated that they would participate in the self-directed upper limb program because they wanted to recover faster.A difference between the perspective of nurses/therapists and stroke survivors towards self-directed upper limb performance outside therapy was found. Deeper stroke survivor engagement and a shift in rehabilitation culture to encourage stroke survivor autonomy are important considerations for a self-directed upper limb program. Teamwork amongst healthcare professionals and families is essential to support stroke survivors to participate in a self-directed upper limb program during early inpatient stroke rehabilitation."

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) with cognitive function in patients with lacunar infarction. We included records of consecutive patients with their first-ever acute stroke and a diagnosis of lacunar infarction through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018. We excluded patients diagnosed with dementia, including strategic single-infarct dementia, before or after stroke onset. Moreover, we excluded patients with one or more microbleeds, severe white matter lesions, or severe medial temporal atrophy on MRI. For ABI, we used the lower ankle side and divided the results into ABI < 1.0 and ABI ≥ 1.0. For baPWV, we used the higher ankle side and divided the results into two groups based on the median value of the participants. We analyzed 176 patients with stroke (age 72.5 ± 11.4 years, 67 females). The median score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 27. The number of patients with ABI < 1.0 was 19 (10.8%). Univariate analysis revealed that the MMSE score was associated with age, body mass index, education, chronic kidney disease, periventricular hyperintensity, and ABI < 1.0 (p < 0.10), but not baPWV. Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index (p = 0.039) and ABI < 1.0 (p = 0.015) were independently associated with the MMSE score. For patients with lacunar infarction, a lower ABI, but not a higher PWV, was associated with cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W4210557937,"The symport of lactose and H+ is an important physiological process in E. coli, for it is closely related to cellular energy supply. In this paper, we review, extend and analyse a newly proposed cotransport model that takes the ""leakage"" phenomenon (uncoupled particle translocation) into account and also satisfies the static head equilibrium condition. Then, we use the model to study the equilibrium properties, including equilibrium solution and the time required to reach equilibrium, of the symport process of E. coli LacY protein, when varying the parameters of the initial state of cotransport system. It can be found that in our extended model, H+ and lactose will reach their equilibrium state separately, and when ""leakage"" exists, it linearly affects the equilibrium solution, which is a useful property that the original model does not have. We later investigated the effect of the volume of periplasm and cytoplasm on the equilibrium properties. For a certain E. coli cell, as it continues to lose water and contract, the time for cytoplasm pH to be stabilized by symport increases monotonically when the cell survives. Finally, we reproduce the experimental data from a literature to verify the validity of the extension in this symport process. The above phenomena and other findings in this paper may help us to not only further validate or improve the model, but also deepen our understanding of the cotransport process of E. coli LacY protein."
https://openalex.org/W4210288836,"Heart failure (HF) is an increasing global concern. Despite evidence-based pharmacotherapy, morbidity and mortality remain high in HF. Medication non-adherence is a crucial factor in optimising clinical outcomes. A growing number of smartphone applications (apps) assist management. While evidence support their use to promote treatment adherence, apps alone may not be the solution. The objective of this pilot study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a tiered intervention added to the NPS MedicineWise dose reminder app (MedicineWise app) in supporting medication adherence in HF.This prospective, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial will recruit 55 Australian patients with HF to be randomly assigned to either intervention (MedicineWise app + usual care) or control (usual care alone) arm. Control participants will remain unaware of the intervention throughout the study. At baseline, intervention participants will be instructed in the MedicineWise app. A reminder will then prompt medication administration at each dosing interval. If non-adherence is suggested from 24 hourly reports (critical medications) or 72 hours (non-critical medications), the individual/s will be escalated through a tiered, pharmacist-led intervention. The primary outcome will be the acceptability and feasibility of this approach in supporting adherence. Between-group comparison of the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS) at baseline, 3 and 6 months will be used to measure the app's value in supporting adherence. Secondary outcome measures include self-reported medication adherence and knowledge, health-related quality of life, psychological wellbeing, signs and symptoms of HF, and medication and HF knowledge.The protocol received ethics approval from Central Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number R20190302) and University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number 202450).

https://openalex.org/W4210553844,"A constant blood supply to the brain is required for mental function. Research with Doppler ultrasonography has important clinical value and burgeoning potential with machine learning applications in studies predicting gestational age and vascular aging. Critically, studies on ultrasound metrics in school-age children are sparse and no machine learning study to date has used color duplex ultrasonography to predict age and classify age-group. The purpose of our study is two-fold: first to document cerebrovascular hemodynamics considering age, gender, and hemisphere in three arteries; and second to construct machine learning models that can predict and classify the age and age-group of a participant using ultrasonography metrics. We record peak systolic, end-diastolic, and time-averaged maximum velocities bilaterally in internal carotid, vertebral, and middle cerebral arteries from 821 participants. Results confirm that ultrasonography values decrease with age and reveal that gender and hemispheres show more similarities than differences, which depend on age, artery, and metric. Machine learning algorithms predict age and classifier models distinguish cerebrovascular hemodynamics between children and adults. Blood velocities, rather than blood vessel diameters, are more important for classifier models, and common and distinct variables contribute to age classification models for males and females."
https://openalex.org/W4210699504,"Hal E. Broxmeyer died December 8, 2021 at the age of 77. He was an outstanding experimental hematologist who likely will be most remembered scientifically as a pioneer in identifying human umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a source of transplantable hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). He further translated this knowledge to cryopreserve and provide the first UCB unit for transplantation and successful engraftment in a patient with Fanconi anemia in Paris in 1988 under the guidance of Dr. Eliane Gluckman. The field of UCB transplantation expanded worldwide upon publication of the outcome of this first transplantation and an estimated 40,000 patients have subsequently received UCB transplants worldwide for hematologic disorders and malignancies. Such an impactful contribution early in his faculty career (8th year) may have been met with considerable distractions in deciding where to focus his laboratories’ future research efforts next. But not for Hal. He understood that to fully achieve the benefits of UCB for transplantation, scientists would need to deeply interrogate and understand the developmental and comparative biological properties of the UCB HSPCs in comparison with adult bone marrow HSPCs. He pursued such investigations in a strategic, passionate, and tenacious fashion. Over his career, Hal not only became a leader in UCB biology but was also valued as an advisor for stem cell research institutes, cancer centers, and biotechnology companies for his expert knowledge in the broader areas of leukemic stem cell biology and pluripotent stem cells. Hal was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 27, 1944. He is known for his loyalty to the Brooklyn Dodgers and it is said that he never cheered for another baseball team when the Dodgers left for Los Angeles in 1957. Hal enrolled in Brooklyn College as a math major but became intrigued with science and upon graduation obtained an MS degree from Long Island University Brooklyn Campus. He was awarded his PhD at New York University in 1973 and then completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Queens University, Kingston, Ontario before accepting an Assistant Professor position at Sloan Kettering Institute in New York. He began his research career focused on identifying negative regulators of hematopoiesis. However, in 1982, Dr. Edward Boyse called Hal into his office to discuss the idea of potentially using UCB in some clinical fashion; perhaps collecting the mature granulocytes, red blood cells, or platelets as a transfusion product. Hal was aware of published papers suggested UCB may contain hematopoietic progenitor cells and perhaps even stem cells, but whether UCB could possess potential for clinical stem cell transplantation remained a curiosity. Thus began a collaboration that would grow to include Drs. Judith Bard, Lewis Thomas, Harvey Cantor, Gordon Douglas, Arleen Auerbach, and Elian Gluckman (among others) and that would coalesce around the idea of using UCB for transplantation. Details of this story are intriguing for the interested reader (Ballen et al., 2013Ballen K.K. Gluckman E. Broxmeyer H.E. Umbilical cord blood transplantation: the first 25 years and beyond.Blood. 2013; 122: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In 1983, Hal was recruited to Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he pursued critical feasibility studies to demonstrate UCB possessed sufficient HSPCs for clinical transplantation. These experiments launched an astonishing career of investigation into the role of growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines on the proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, homing, and mobilization of HSPCs that would culminate in >830 peer-reviewed publications, hundreds of book chapters, and numerous edited books and editorials. Such productivity would make one think Hal was fiercely independent and laser-focused with no time for administration, mentoring, or teaching. But, in fact, he was a model faculty member and collaborator with an intense interest in promoting the development of students, post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty members. Hal served as the first director of the Walther Oncology Center and chair of Microbiology and Immunology for many years. At the time of his death, he was an IU Distinguished Professor, Mary Margaret Walther Professor Emeritus, and professor of Microbiology and Immunology at IU School of Medicine and senior advisor to the director of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. For many years, Hal was principal investigator on multiple training grants in hematopoiesis and cell and gene therapy for PhD students and post-doctoral fellows. He was also the lead principal investigator on several hematopoiesis program project and cancer grants. He was an inspiring teacher who won many teaching awards from the PhD students. He served his research colleagues as an editor or on the editorial board of numerous journals and on many National Institutes of Health study sections as a member or chair, and he led several societies as president. These societies include the American Society of Hematology and the International Society for Experimental Hematology. In sum, “Hal was a force of nature,” recalls his colleague and friend, Dr. Patrick (Pat) Loehrer. In Hal’s own words, he would tell you he loved research and that is why even while serving on all the School of Medicine and national and international society administrative positions he continued to work in his laboratory daily. His favorite and somewhat exclusive task was to score the colony counts in the hematopoietic progenitor cell colony forming assays for the lab. It was not uncommon to have an appointment with Hal and, upon entering his office, find him surrounded by columns of Lux culture dishes stacked on tissue culture incubator shelves. He would be peering through his 40-year-old Olympus microscope counting the numbers and types of colonies formed. He always wanted to see the results of the studies before anyone else in the lab. He would comment that he enjoyed seeing how the results addressed or refuted the hypotheses posed and this would stimulate him to ask the next set of questions and set up more experiments. Hal was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2013. He kept his illness from nearly everyone but his family and his lab members. He recuperated quickly and was soon back to his high level of activity. Then he had a recurrence that affected his vocal cords and required tracheostomy, radiation therapy, and other treatments. The combination of treatments made him very tired. He did not waste time decrying his ailment or retreating into privacy but continued to give lectures (with much effort). He noted to his colleague Pat several weeks before his death, “Today, I feel better than I have for weeks. I hope it lasts, but I am thankful for each good day that I have.” As another colleague, Dr. Christi Orschell, commented upon considering Hal’s legacy, “So much good about that man.” The author wishes to thank Dr. Patrick Loehrer and Dr. Christi Orschell from Indiana University School of Medicine for their contributions to this tribute."

There has also been widespread recognition that people are predictably irrational when making shopping decisions. In this work, we combine these two facts to propose a new type of predicable irrational behavior that has important implications for comparison-shopping applications that now utilize crowdsourcing to increase the information provided about sellers in these electronic marketplaces. In a series of three studies we demonstrate that, even after controlling for relative and absolute savings, the number of items in a shopping trip is an important consideration in the decision to make a trip to more than one store. This is true of both actual trips in physical shopping in the real world, and virtual trips to other vendors in online shopping. We term this effect quantity bias."
https://openalex.org/W4210742328,"Health inequalities based on race are well-documented, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Despite the advances in modern medicine, access to health care remains a primary determinant of health outcomes, especially for communities of color. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately at risk for infection with COVID-19, but this problem extends beyond access alone. This study sought to identify trends in race-based disparities in COVID-19 in the setting of universal access to care. Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) is a Department of Defense Military Treatment Facility (DoD-MTF) that provides full access to healthcare to active duty military members, beneficiaries, and veterans. We evaluated the characteristics of individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at TAMC in a retrospective, case-controlled (1:1) study. Most patients (69%) had received a COVID-19 test within 3 days of symptom onset. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with testing positive and to estimate adjusted odds ratios. African-American patients and patients who identified as ""Other"" ethnicities were two times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 relative to Caucasian patients. Other factors associated with testing positive include: younger age, male gender, previous positive test, presenting with >3 symptoms, close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient, and being a member of the US Navy. African-Americans and patients who identify as ""Other"" ethnicities had disproportionately higher rates of positivity of COVID-19. Although other factors contribute to increased test positivity across all patient populations, access to care does not appear to itself explain this discrepancy with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4210799776,"3D protein structures can be analyzed using a distance matrix calculated as the pairwise distance between all Cα atoms in the protein model. Although researchers have efficiently used distance matrices to classify proteins and find homologous proteins, much less work has been done on quantitative analysis of distance matrix features. Therefore, the distance matrix was analyzed as gray scale image using KAZE feature extractor algorithm with Bag of Visual Words model. In this study, each protein was represented as a histogram of visual codewords. The analysis showed that a very small number of codewords (~1%) have a high relative frequency (> 0.25) and that the majority of codewords have a relative frequency around 0.05. We have also shown that there is a relationship between the frequency of codewords and the position of the features in a distance matrix. The codewords that are more frequent are located closer to the main diagonal. Less frequent codewords, on the other hand, are located in the corners of the distance matrix, far from the main diagonal. Moreover, the analysis showed a correlation between the number of unique codewords and the 3D repeats in the protein structure. The solenoid and tandem repeats proteins have a significantly lower number of unique codewords than the globular proteins. Finally, the codeword histograms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were used to classify solenoid and globular proteins. The result showed that the SVM classifier fed with codeword histograms correctly classified 352 out of 354 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4225463533,"The last decades have seen an increasing interest in the phenomenon of yawning and the dynamics of its modulation, yet no widespread consensus exists on its origins and potential functions. Although most scholars have focused on its potential physiological functions, e.g., related to thermoregulation, arousal modulation or cortisol levels and distress, an emerging line of research has been also investigating the social implications of yawning, including its hypothesized relationship with empathy. In order to explore the dynamics of yawning modulation in infants, we investigated whether a social perturbation-like the one induced by the Face to Face Still Face paradigm, a procedure designed to assess socio-emotional regulation in infants-affects yawning and self-touch hand movements behavior in three-months old infants. As the Still Face episode represents a source of mild distress, we hypothesized that during this phase yawns would be more frequent. Moreover, through the use of path analysis, we investigated potential dynamics of facilitation, inhibition or covariance between the frequencies of these behavioral patterns. Our results showed a sharp increase in self-touch hand movements as well as in the likelihood of yawning during the stressful phase of the procedure (still-face) compared with the two minutes of face-to-face interaction and the reunion episode. Regressions also showed a higher incidence of yawns among girls, consistently with the hypothesis that the analysis of yawning behavior might capture subtle differences in regulatory strategies of infants, possibly related to the transient sex-specific activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis known as mini-puberty. The path analysis showed a greater consistency between the frequencies of self-touch hand movements during the three episodes of the procedure, compared with yawning. This finding could be a result of distinct yawning-regulating mechanisms being at play in different conditions, e.g., a modulation related to stress and one to social interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that human yawning regulation is an irreducibly complex and multifaceted phenomenon since early age. Moreover, the gender differences highlighted might suggest an early diversification in yawning modulation."
