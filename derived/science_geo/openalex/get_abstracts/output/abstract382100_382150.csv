https://openalex.org/W2110620844,"Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2045373134,"Autophagy, the process by which proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation, provides a primary route for turnover of stable and defective cellular proteins. Defects in this system are linked with numerous human diseases. Although conserved protein kinase, lipid kinase and ubiquitin-like protein conjugation subnetworks controlling autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment have been defined, our understanding of the global organization of this system is limited. Here we report a proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells under conditions of ongoing (basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409 candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among subnetworks. Many new autophagy interaction network components have roles in vesicle trafficking, protein or lipid phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination, and affect autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The six ATG8 orthologues in humans (MAP1LC3/GABARAP proteins) interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. These studies provide a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein homeostasis pathway. Autophagy is the cellular process by which proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and delivered to the lysosome for degradation. A proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells reveals a network of 751 interactions among 409 candidate interacting proteins, with extensive connectivity among subnetworks. This study provides a global view of the mammalian autophagy pathway and an important resource for future mechanistic understanding of this important protein homeostasis pathway. Autophagy is a cellular process by which proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Here the authors present a proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells. Their results reveal a network of signalling modules and extensive connectivity among subnetworks. This global view of the mammalian autophagy pathway will be an important resource for future mechanistic understanding of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2162650381,"The molecular clock maintains energy constancy by producing circadian oscillations of rate-limiting enzymes involved in tissue metabolism across the day and night. During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes, it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock and Bmal1 (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus."

Much less is clear in bacterial cells where the spatial distribution of mature mRNA remains ambiguous. Using a sensitive method based on quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show here that in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli, chromosomally expressed mRNAs largely display limited dispersion from their site of transcription during their lifetime. We estimate apparent diffusion coefficients at least two orders of magnitude lower than expected for freely diffusing mRNA, and provide evidence in C. crescentus that this mRNA localization restricts ribosomal mobility. Furthermore, C. crescentus RNase E appears associated with the DNA independently of its mRNA substrates. Collectively, our findings show that bacteria can spatially organize translation and, potentially, mRNA decay by using the chromosome layout as a template. This chromosome-centric organization has important implications for cellular physiology and for our understanding of gene expression in bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2062611303,"Background Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an important regulator of differentiation and morphogenesis that can also control stem cell fates. Our group has developed an efficient protocol to generate cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem (ES) cells via induction with activin A and BMP4. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the hypothesis that Wnt/β-catenin signals control both early mesoderm induction and later cardiac differentiation in this system. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a at the time of induction enhanced cardiac differentiation, while early inhibition of endogenous Wnt/β-catenin signaling with Dkk1 inhibited cardiac differentiation, as indicated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis for β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), Nkx2.5, and flow cytometry analysis for sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (sMHC). Conversely, late antagonism of endogenously produced Wnts enhanced cardiogenesis, indicating a biphasic role for the pathway in human cardiac differentiation. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we show that canonical Wnt ligand expression is induced by activin A/BMP4 treatment, and the extent of early Wnt ligand expression can predict the subsequent efficiency of cardiogenesis. Measurement of Brachyury expression showed that addition of Wnt3a enhances mesoderm induction, whereas blockade of endogenously produced Wnts markedly inhibits mesoderm formation. Finally, we show that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for Smad1 activation by BMP4. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that induction of mesoderm and subsequent cardiac differentiation from human ES cells requires fine-tuned cross talk between activin A/BMP4 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Controlling these pathways permits efficient generation of cardiomyocytes for basic studies or cardiac repair applications."
https://openalex.org/W1987704394,"Defining the three body axes is a central event of vertebrate morphogenesis. Establishment of left-right (L-R) asymmetry in development follows the determination of dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior (A-P) body axes, although the molecular mechanism underlying precise L-R symmetry breaking in reference to the other two axes is still poorly understood. Here, by removing both Vangl1 and Vangl2, the two mouse homologues of a Drosophila core planar cell polarity (PCP) gene Van Gogh (Vang), we reveal a previously unrecognized function of PCP in the initial breaking of lateral symmetry. The leftward nodal flow across the posterior notochord (PNC) has been identified as the earliest event in the de novo formation of L-R asymmetry. We show that PCP is essential in interpreting the A-P patterning information and linking it to L-R asymmetry. In the absence of Vangl1 and Vangl2, cilia are positioned randomly around the centre of the PNC cells and nodal flow is turbulent, which results in disrupted L-R asymmetry. PCP in mouse, unlike what has been implicated in other vertebrate species, is not required for ciliogenesis, cilium motility, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling or apical docking of basal bodies in ciliated tracheal epithelial cells. Our data suggest that PCP acts earlier than the unidirectional nodal flow during bilateral symmetry breaking in vertebrates and provide insight into the functional mechanism of PCP in organizing the vertebrate tissues in development."

https://openalex.org/W2062280978,"Prokaryotes thrive in spite of the vast number and diversity of their viruses. This partly results from the evolution of mechanisms to inactivate or silence the action of exogenous DNA. Among these, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are unique in providing adaptive immunity against elements with high local resemblance to genomes of previously infecting agents. Here, we analyze the CRISPR loci of 51 complete genomes of Escherichia and Salmonella. CRISPR are in two pairs of loci in Escherichia, one single pair in Salmonella, each pair showing a similar turnover rate, repeat sequence and putative linkage to a common set of cas genes. Yet, phylogeny shows that CRISPR and associated cas genes have different evolutionary histories, the latter being frequently exchanged or lost. In our set, one CRISPR pair seems specialized in plasmids often matching genes coding for the replication, conjugation and antirestriction machinery. Strikingly, this pair also matches the cognate cas genes in which case these genes are absent. The unexpectedly high conservation of this anti-CRISPR suggests selection to counteract the invasion of mobile elements containing functional CRISPR/cas systems. There are few spacers in most CRISPR, which rarely match genomes of known phages. Furthermore, we found that strains divergent less than 250 thousand years ago show virtually identical CRISPR. The lack of congruence between cas, CRISPR and the species phylogeny and the slow pace of CRISPR change make CRISPR poor epidemiological markers in enterobacteria. All these observations are at odds with the expectedly abundant and dynamic repertoire of spacers in an immune system aiming at protecting bacteria from phages. Since we observe purifying selection for the maintenance of CRISPR these results suggest that alternative evolutionary roles for CRISPR remain to be uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W1971616282,"Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway that functions in protein and organelle turnover in response to starvation and cellular stress. Autophagy is initiated by the formation of a complex containing Beclin 1 (BECN1) and its binding partner Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, class 3 (PIK3C3). Recently, BECN1 deficiency was shown to enhance the pathology of a mouse model of Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which BECN1 or autophagy mediate these effects are unknown. Here, we report that the levels of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its metabolites can be reduced through autophagy activation, indicating that they are a substrate for autophagy. Furthermore, we find that knockdown of Becn1 in cell culture increases the levels of APP and its metabolites. Accumulation of APP and APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTF) are accompanied by impaired autophagosomal clearance. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation causes a comparable accumulation of APP and APP-metabolites in autophagosomes. Becn1 reduction in cell culture leads to lower levels of its binding partner Pik3c3 and increased presence of Microtubule-associated protein 1, light chain 3 (LC3). Overexpression of Becn1, on the other hand, reduces cellular APP levels. In line with these observations, we detected less BECN1 and PIK3C3 but more LC3 protein in brains of AD patients. We conclude that BECN1 regulates APP processing and turnover. BECN1 is involved in autophagy initiation and autophagosome clearance. Accordingly, BECN1 deficiency disrupts cellular autophagy and autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation and alters APP metabolism. Together, our findings suggest that autophagy and the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex regulate APP processing and play an important role in AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1966135023,"Musical competence may confer cognitive advantages that extend beyond processing of familiar musical sounds. Behavioural evidence indicates a general enhancement of both working memory and attention in musicians. It is possible that musicians, due to their training, are better able to maintain focus on task-relevant stimuli, a skill which is crucial to working memory. We measured the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) activation signal in musicians and non-musicians during working memory of musical sounds to determine the relation among performance, musical competence and generally enhanced cognition. All participants easily distinguished the stimuli. We tested the hypothesis that musicians nonetheless would perform better, and that differential brain activity would mainly be present in cortical areas involved in cognitive control such as the lateral prefrontal cortex. The musicians performed better as reflected in reaction times and error rates. Musicians also had larger BOLD responses than non-musicians in neuronal networks that sustain attention and cognitive control, including regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, insula, and putamen in the right hemisphere, and bilaterally in the posterior dorsal prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. The relationship between the task performance and the magnitude of the BOLD response was more positive in musicians than in non-musicians, particularly during the most difficult working memory task. The results confirm previous findings that neural activity increases during enhanced working memory performance. The results also suggest that superior working memory task performance in musicians rely on an enhanced ability to exert sustained cognitive control. This cognitive benefit in musicians may be a consequence of focused musical training."
https://openalex.org/W2017639055,"Polyclonal T-cells can be directed against cancer using transmembrane fusion molecules known as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Although preclinical studies have provided encouragement, pioneering clinical trials using CAR-based immunotherapy have been disappointing. Key obstacles are the need for robust expansion ex vivo followed by sustained survival of infused T-cells in patients. To address this, we have developed a system to achieve selective proliferation of CAR+ T-cells using IL-4, a cytokine with several pathophysiologic and therapeutic links to cancer. A chimeric cytokine receptor (4αβ) was engineered by fusion of the IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) ectodomain to the βc subunit, used by IL-2 and IL-15. Addition of IL-4 to T-cells that express 4αβ resulted in STAT3/STAT5/ERK phosphorylation and exponential proliferation, mimicking the actions of IL-2. Using receptor-selective IL-4 muteins, partnering of 4αβ with γc was implicated in signal delivery. Next, human T-cells were engineered to co-express 4αβ with a CAR specific for tumor-associated MUC1. These T-cells exhibited an unprecedented capacity to elicit repeated destruction of MUC1-expressing tumor cultures and expanded through several logs in vitro. Despite prolonged culture in IL-4, T-cells retained specificity for target antigen, type 1 polarity, and cytokine dependence. Similar findings were observed using CARs directed against two additional tumor-associated targets, demonstrating generality of application. Furthermore, this system allows rapid ex vivo expansion and enrichment of engineered T-cells from small blood volumes, under GMP-compliant conditions. Together, these findings provide proof of principle for the development of IL-4-enhanced T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.

Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy is an exciting platform technology pioneered to treat hematologic malignancies and metastatic melanoma.

A key impediment to success has been poor T-cell survival following infusion (9Kershaw M.H. Westwood J.A. Parker L.L. Wang G. Eshhar Z. Mavroukakis S.A. White D.E. Wunderlich J.R. Canevari S.

Survival and growth of T-cells depend critically upon cytokines. The most potent of these for effector T-cells are IL-2 and IL-15, both of which signal using common βc and γc receptor subunits. IL-2 is licensed for administration to patients with some selected tumor types. However, systemic IL-2 stimulates lymphocytes in an indiscriminate manner and is frequently profoundly toxic (12Chavez A.R. Buchser W. Basse P.H. Liang X. Appleman L.J. Maranchie J.K. Zeh H. de Vera M.E. Lotze M.T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1182: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To refine this, we have developed a system whereby an IL-2/15-like signal can be selectively provided using IL-4, a cytokine with much weaker intrinsic mitogenic activity for T-cells (13Mitchell L.C. Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1548-1557PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 was chosen to provide this selective growth signal for two additional reasons. First, “endogenous” IL-4 plays a key albeit complex role in several tumor types. Second, administration of “exogenous” IL-4 has been tested clinically as a therapeutic option for metastatic cancer in man (see below). Endogenous IL-4 may be elaborated by cancer cells or by infiltrating leukocytes and exerts pleiotropic but variable actions upon the cellular components found in established tumors. First, IL-4 increases the proliferation of some cancer-derived cell lines (14Prokopchuk O. Liu Y. Henne-Bruns D. Kornmann M. Br. J.

Furthermore, IL-4 may antagonize tumor progression through local recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils (25Tepper R.I. Pattengale P.K. Leder P.

Despite the intricate relationship between endogenous IL-4 and cancer, administration of supraphysiologic amounts of this cytokine has been widely tested as an experimental therapy for several malignancies. Preclinical investigators have repeatedly demonstrated potent antitumor activity of exogenous IL-4 in several in vivo models (25Tepper R.I. Pattengale P.K. Leder P.

Although efficacy in clinical studies has been limited, these studies have allowed the identification of safe ceiling doses in man (32Majhail N.S. Hussein M. Olencki T.E. Budd G.T. Wood L. Elson P.

Together, this experience provides a platform for development of further immunotherapeutic approaches that involve the administration or harnessing of this cytokine. IL-4 interacts with two heterodimeric receptors. Both share a high affinity α subunit (IL-4Rα), which pairs with either γc (type 1 receptor) or IL-13Rα1 (type 2). Activated T-cells express the type 1 receptor, allowing IL-4 to support their survival and promote limited proliferation (13Mitchell L.C. Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1548-1557PubMed Google Scholar). To harness IL-4 binding to delivery of a potent mitogenic signal for T-cells, the ectodomain of IL-4Rα has been fused to the endodomain of the shared IL-2/15 βc subunit, thereby creating 4αβ (34Izuhara K.

Here, we show that IL-4 can be used to drive the selective expansion and sustained antitumor activity of T-cells in which a tumor-specific CAR is co-expressed with 4αβ. In 4αβ, cDNAs encoding the IL-4Rα ectodomain (amino acids 1–233) were fused to the transmembrane and endodomain of βc (amino acids 241–551; see Fig. 1A).

All tumor cell lines were obtained from authenticated stocks provided by the Cancer Research UK organization. PG13 retroviral packaging cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum. H29D retroviral packaging cells were a gift from Dr. Michel Sadelain (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and were propagated as described (2Maher J. Brentjens R.J. Gunset G. Rivière I.

Immunoblotting of HSC 70 was performed using the B6 mouse monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of phosphorylated and total STAT3, 5, and 6 was performed using antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (3 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in a 100-ml Cell Expansion Bag (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in AIM V medium (Invitrogen) containing paramagnetic anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen; 1 bead/cell). After 48 h, 100 units/ml IL-2 was added. After 72 h, retroviral transduction was performed using a VueLifeTM adherent FEP bag (187 cm2; American Fluoroseal Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD). The bag was precoated overnight at 4 °C with retronectin (5 μg/cm2; Takara, Shiga, Japan), which was replaced with PG13-derived vector (50 ml). Activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (20 × 106 in IL-2 (100 units/ml) were added after 1 h without centrifugation. Starting after 24 h, IL-4 (30 ng/ml) was added with each medium addition. Day 3 after transduction, T-cells were expanded in 250-ml Cell Differentiation bags (Miltenyi Biotec). Four-hour CTL assays were performed using a lactate dehydrogenase release assay (Roche Applied Science) (2Maher J. Brentjens R.J. Gunset G. Rivière I. Sadelain M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 40Vukmanovic-Stejic M. Vyas B. Gorak-Stolinska P. Noble A. Kemeny D.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 231-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor monolayers were visualized using crystal violet (0.5% in 25% methanol) after fixation with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. The one-tailed Student's t test was used. CTLL-2 cells are absolutely dependent upon IL-2 or IL-15 but are unresponsive to human IL-4. Consequently, these cells provide an excellent model to test the ability of 4αβ to deliver an IL-2/15-like signal in response to human IL-4. 4αβ was co-expressed in CTLL-2 cells with the MUC1-specific CAR, HOX (4αβ-HOX) or truncated control, HTr (4αβ-HTr) (Fig. 1). Cell surface expression of 4αβ was demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). To assess function, cells were stimulated using human IL-2 or IL-4. In 4αβ-expressing cells, both STAT5 and p42/44 ERKs underwent comparable phosphorylation in response to either cytokine. However, HOX+ or parental CTLL-2 cells only responded to IL-2 in these assays (Fig. 2B). We next compared the ability of human IL-2 and IL-4 to sustain proliferation of CTLL-2 cells. Both IL-2 and IL-4 elicited dose-dependent expansion of cells that express 4αβ (Fig. 2C). By contrast, IL-2 but not IL-4 could stimulate proliferation of parental or HOX+ cells. We anticipated that 4αβ mediates responsiveness to IL-4 following heterodimerization with γc. To confirm this, assays were also performed using two human IL-4 muteins. The T13D R121E mutein (IL-4DE) is an agonist of the type 1 but not type 2 IL-4 receptor (38Shanafelt A.B. Forte C.P. Kasper J.J. Sanchez-Pescador L. Wetzel M. Gundel R. Greve J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9454-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and also promoted proliferation of 4αβ-expressing CTLL-2 cells. By contrast, the R121D Y124D mutein (IL-4DD) is a complete antagonist of both IL-4 receptors (37Tony H.P. Shen B.J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is inactive when added to 4αβ-expressing CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when 4αβ was co-expressed with P28z (2Maher J. Brentjens R.J. Gunset G. Rivière I. Sadelain M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), a CAR specific for PSMA (data not shown). Next, human T-cells were engineered to co-express 4αβ-HOX or 4αβ-HTr. A representative flow cytometric analysis is shown in Fig. 3A. Stoichiometric co-expression of chimeric antigen and cytokine receptors was achieved using an intervening T2A peptide placed downstream of a furin cleavage site (Fig. 1B). To exclude inefficient ribosomal skipping using this system, Western blotting was performed (note absence of uncleaved precursor at top of 4αβ-HOX lane; Fig. 3B). We were unable to source a commercial IL-4Rα antibody that permitted detection of IL-4Rα or 4αβ by Western blotting, despite multiple attempts using antibodies marketed for this purpose (data not shown). To investigate signaling by 4αβ in human T-cells, phosphorylation of STATs 3, 5, and 6 were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). Comparison was made among the actions of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15 on T-cells that express HOX alone or 4αβ-HOX. In control T-cells, IL-2 and IL-15 elicited strong phosphorylation of STAT5 whereas IL-4 was weaker in this respect. Phosphorylation of STAT3 in engineered primary T-cells was very weakly evident in response to any cytokine. By contrast, in 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells, we observed potent phosphorylation of both STAT3 and STAT5 in response to IL-4. As expected, phosphorylation of STAT6 was also induced by IL-4 in all T-cells (Fig. 3C). Despite using freshly made reducing agents, we also consistently detected a second specific band in phospho-STAT6 immunoblots (arrowed). This is too small in mass to represent an intact dimer, but may be a cleaved dimeric derivative of this molecule (41Suzuki K. Nakajima H. Kagami S. Suto A. Ikeda K. Hirose K. Hiwasa T. Takeda K. Saito Y. Akira S. Iwamoto I. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, these data confirm that IL-4 can deliver both IL-2/15-like and IL-4 signals to 4αβ-expressing human T-cells. Previously, we have reported that HOX enables human T-cells to elicit MUC1-dependent destruction of several tumor monolayers, accompanied by production of IFN-γ (7Wilkie S. Picco G. Foster J. Davies D.M. Julien S. Cooper L. Arif S. Mather S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J.M. Maher J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that neither monolayer destruction (supplemental Fig. S1) or production of IFN-γ by HOX-expressing T-cells (supplemental Fig. S2A) was altered by co-expression of 4αβ. Similar results were observed when 4αβ was co-expressed with the PSMA-specific CAR, P28z (supplemental Fig. S2BB and data not shown). As expected, control 4αβ-HTr-expressing T-cells were inactive in these assays (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2A). Several reports have indicated that culture in IL-4 can impair T-cell cytotoxicity (22Olver S. Apte S. Baz A. Kienzle N. Tissue Antigens. 2007; 69: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which would clearly be undesirable for tumor immunotherapy. To examine tumor cell killing, T-cells were engineered to co-express 4αβ-HOX (or the indicated controls) (Fig. 4A), propagated in IL-2 or IL-4 for 1 week and then established in cytotoxicity assays. Using tumor cell targets that were discordant for MUC1 expression, we observed that HOX+ T-cells elicited MUC1-dependent cytotoxicity in 4-h assays, as previously described (7; Fig. 4B). However, tumor cell destruction was clearly impaired by pregrowth in IL-4 (Fig. 4B). This was more apparent in overnight assays in which equal numbers of T-cells and tumor cells were co-cultivated (Fig. 4C). By contrast, 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells elicited comparable tumor cell destruction, whether precultured in IL-2 or IL-4 (Fig. 4, B and C). We also observed that 4αβ-HOX T-cells underwent greater enrichment when cultured in IL-4 than IL-2 (compare Fig. 4, A and C). Next we examined the ability of IL-4 to maintain proliferation and antitumor activity of MUC1-targeted and control T-cells that co-express 4αβ. Fig. 5 shows long-term culture experiments in which engineered T-cells were cultured with three MUC1+ tumor cell lines. As described previously (7Wilkie S. Picco G. Foster J. Davies D.M. Julien S. Cooper L. Arif S. Mather S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J.M. Maher J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), T-cells that express HOX elicited repeated tumor cell destruction when cultured with IL-2. However, rapid loss of antitumor activity was observed when HOX+ T-cells were cultured with IL-4. Control 4αβ-HTr+ T-cells did not elicit any meaningful antitumor activity, irrespective of whether they were maintained in IL-2 or IL-4. By contrast, 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells repeatedly destroyed tumor monolayers and underwent exponential T-cell expansion. The magnitude of T-cell expansion and the number of tumor restimulation cycles achieved were consistently greater when 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells were cultured in IL-4 than IL-2. Indeed, 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells expanded up to 7 logs when repeatedly exposed to tumor targets (e.g. MUC1-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 5C). Comparable T-cell expansion was achieved using IL-4 or the hematopoietic-selective IL-4DE mutein (supplemental Fig. S3), in agreement with data obtained using CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when 4αβ-HOX T-cells were cultivated with two other MUC1+ tumor cell lines, ZR75 and MCF7 (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B, respectively). Importantly, following culture in the sustained presence of IL-4, the cytolytic activity of 4αβ-HOX+ T-cells remained target antigen-specific (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, T-cells that co-express 4αβ-HOX remained absolutely dependent upon exogenous IL-4 for sustained expansion. When deprived of IL-4, increased apoptotic cell death was observed within 24 h (supplemental Fig. S5), leading to loss of ≥95% viable cells within 10 days. To assess generality of application, 4αβ has also been co-expressed with a CAR targeted against PSMA (P28z) (2Maher J. Brentjens R.J. Gunset G. Rivière I. Sadelain M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). When 4αβ-P28z T-cells were repeatedly cultured with PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumor cells, T-cell expansion was greater in the presence of IL-4 than IL-2. By contrast, the conv"
https://openalex.org/W2159974149,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine, which may block apoptosis during inflammation to protect cells under very toxic conditions. However, IL-6 also activates STAT3 in many types of human cancer. Recent studies demonstrate that high levels of IL-6 are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer. Here we reported that IL-6 promoted survival of human liver cancer cells through activating STAT3 in response to doxorubicin treatment. Endogenous IL-6 levels in SNU-449 cells were higher than in Hep3B cells. Meanwhile, SNU-449 cells were more resistant to doxorubicin than Hep3B cells. Addition of IL-6 induced STAT3 activation in Hep3B cells and led to protection against doxorubicin. In contrast, neutralizing IL-6 with anti-IL-6 antibody decreased survival of SNU-449 cells in response to doxorubicin. To elucidate the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic function of IL-6, we investigated if STAT3 mediated this drug resistance. Targeting STAT3 with STAT3 siRNA reduced the protection of IL-6 against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, indicating that STAT3 signaling contributed to the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6. Moreover, we further explored if a STAT3 small molecule inhibitor could abolish this anti-apoptotic effect. LLL12, a STAT3 small molecule inhibitor, blocked IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, resulting in attenuation of the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-6. Finally, neutralization of endogenous IL-6 with anti-IL-6 antibody or blockade of STAT3 with LLL12 lowered the recovery in SNU-449 cells after doxorubicin treatment. Therefore, our results demonstrated that targeting STAT3 signaling could interrupt the anti-apoptotic function of IL-6 in human liver cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022613179,"In actinomycetes, the onset of secondary metabolite biosynthesis is often triggered by the quorum-sensing signal γ-butyrolactones (GBLs) via specific binding to their cognate receptors. However, the presence of multiple putative GBL receptor homologues in the genome suggests the existence of an alternative regulatory mechanism. Here, in the model streptomycete Streptomyces coelicolor, ScbR2 (SCO6286, a homologue of GBL receptor) is shown not to bind the endogenous GBL molecule SCB1, hence designated “pseudo” GBL receptor. Intriguingly, it could bind the endogenous antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin as ligands, leading to the derepression of KasO, an activator of a cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster. Likewise, JadR2 is also a putative GBL receptor homologue in Streptomyces venezuelae, the producer of chloramphenicol and cryptic antibiotic jadomycin. It is shown to coordinate their biosynthesis via direct repression of JadR1, which activates jadomycin biosynthesis while repressing chloramphenicol biosynthesis directly. Like ScbR2, JadR2 could also bind these two disparate antibiotics, and the interactions lead to the derepression of jadR1. The antibiotic responding activities of these pseudo GBL receptors were further demonstrated in vivo using the lux reporter system. Overall, these results suggest that pseudo GBL receptors play a novel role to coordinate antibiotic biosynthesis by binding and responding to antibiotics signals.

IntroductionActinomycetes are well known for their ability to produce a wide variety of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites (1Ikeda H. Ishikawa J. Hanamoto A. Shinose M. Kikuchi H. Shiba T.

Parkhill J. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations indicated that the antibiotic biosynthesis often involves a complex regulatory network that responds to environmental and nutritional factors; one of the initial steps is known as the quorum sensing process (3Bibb M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4Camilli A. Bassler B.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In bacteria, this process is often mediated by small molecule autoinducers and their cognate receptors to convert population density information into cellular responses (5Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 6Lazdunski A.M. Ventre I. Sturgis J.N. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the Gram-positive streptomycetes, a typical quorum-sensing mechanism to trigger the onset of secondary metabolism involves the γ-butyrolactones (GBLs) 4The abbreviations used are: GBLγ-butyrolactoneActactinorhodinRedundecylprodigiosinCmchloramphenicolJdjadomycinJdBjadomycin BJdAjadomycin Atsptranscription start pointWTwild typeETethanolSCBsStreptomyces coelicolor butyrolactones. autoinducers and their cognate GBL receptors (7Nishida H.

Cell. 2006; 125: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar).Several GBLs in actinomycetes have been identified so far, and they share a characteristic 2,3-disubstituted-γ-butyrolactone core but differ in the C2 side chains. In most cases, the GBL synthase gene locates next to the gene of its specific receptor (9Takano E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, genome analysis of sequenced Streptomyces indicated the presence of many GBL receptor paralogues in addition to the identified synthase-receptor pairs, raising the question of whether they also respond to GBLs and participate in the quorum-sensing cascade (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fact, only a few identified receptors have been proven to interact with their cognate GBL molecules: ScbR with SCBs in Streptomyces coelicolor, ArpA with A-factor in S. griseus, BarA with virginiae butanolides in Streptomyces virginiae, and FarA with IM-2 in Streptomyces lavendulae (9Takano E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). There are more examples of putative GBL receptor homologues that do not exhibit any GBLs binding ability (10Kitani S. Iida A. Izumi T.A. Maeda A. Yamada Y. Nihira T. Gene. 2008; 425: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For instance, BarB from S. virginiae was found not to bind virginiae butanolides (the GBLs in S. virginiae), thereby designated “pseudo” GBL receptor (11Matsuno K. Yamada Y. Lee C.K. Nihira T. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that putative GBL receptor homologues, FarR2 in S. lavendulae, AlpZ in Streptomyces ambofaciens, and SabR in Streptomyces acidiscabies, may bind ligands other than GBL compounds (10Kitani S. Iida A. Izumi T.A. Maeda A. Yamada Y. Nihira T. Gene. 2008; 425: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Bunet R. Mendes M.V. Rouhier N. Pang X. Hotel L. Leblond P. Aigle B. J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4786-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an earlier phylogenetic analysis of GBL receptor homologues has indicated considerable differences between genuine GBL receptors and BarB-like proteins (including BarB, JadR2, SCO6286, CprB, SAV3702, and Aur1R from different streptomycetes), particularly in the region corresponding to the ligand-binding domain (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is suspected that they may have developed a different ligand binding capacity, but so far, such a mechanism has not been elucidated.In this study, we characterized the functions of two BarB-like proteins, ScbR2 (SCO6286) and JadR2, and demonstrated that their ligands are endogenously produced and chemically distinct antibiotics. We further showed that, by responding to antibiotic signals, these pseudo GBL receptors play a novel role to coordinate antibiotic biosynthesis. ScbR2 locates in a cpk (cryptic polyketide synthase) gene cluster of S. coelicolor A3(2), a model streptomycetes that mainly produces two pigmented antibiotics: a blue polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin (Act) and a red prodiginine antibiotic undecylprodigiosin (Red) (14Kieser T.

JadR2 was previously identified as a repressor in the jadomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 (15Yang K. Han L. Vining L.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6111-6117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the producer of chloramphenicol (Cm) and the angucycline antibiotic jadomycin (Jd). Jd is cryptic, being produced only under stresses such as ethanol toxicity, whereas the production of Cm does not require stress stimulus (16He J. Magarvey N. Piraee M. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn Gram-negative bacteria, the LuxI-LuxR proteins are commonly involved in synthesis and detection of the quorum-sensing autoinducers. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the synthase-receptor elements in the LuxI-LuxR systems had evolved concomitantly (37Gray K.M. Garey J.R. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, in the GBL signaling cascade of streptomycetes, it is suggested that the GBL receptors had predated GBL synthases and later acquired GBL binding properties (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of many GBL receptor paralogues in one genome also suggests that their functions have diversified. Here, we demonstrate that pseudo GBL receptors serve a novel role to coordinate antibiotic biosynthesis by responding to antibiotic signals. As briefly summarized in Fig. 9, pseudo GBL receptors (like JadR2 and ScbR2) usually repress the expression of cryptic secondary metabolites (jadomycin and a type I polyketide synthase yellow compound) by directly inhibiting the transcription of cluster-situated activators (JadR1 and KasO). However, unlike genuine GBL receptors, which only bind specific GBL molecules, pseudo GBL receptors act as a signal coordinator to orchestrate antibiotic biosynthesis by binding and responding to disparate antibiotics. In S. venezuelae, JadR2 directly represses the transcription of jadR1, the determinant of an activator of the Jd biosynthetic genes, that is shown to repress Cm biosynthetic genes. These two different antibiotics could bind to JadR2, leading to the dissociation of this repression. Although in S. coelicolor, ScbR2 is the repressor of KasO, a key activator of a cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster. ScbR2 could also indirectly regulate the expression of Red and Act biosynthetic gene clusters. As expected, ScbR2 did not bind the GBL molecule SCB1 but could bind and respond to the endogenous Red and Act. Taken together, their capacity to bind and respond to disparate antibiotics helps them to fulfill a coordinator role in coordinating antibiotic biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first time the ligands for these pseudo GBL receptors are identified as antibiotics.Nevertheless, this antibiotic binding capacity is not unexpected. Sequence similarity and phylogenic studies suggested that ScbR2 and JadR2 belong to the TetR superfamily regulators. Because of the sequence diversity of the ligand-binding domain of this family, an extremely wide range of small molecules can serve as the effective ligands. For instance, crystal structures showed that QacR and TtgR are capable of binding and responding to many structurally diverse drugs (29Alguel Y. Meng C. Terán W. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Investigations of these proteins suggest that this ability is mainly ascribed to the richness of helices and a large cavity in their ligand-binding domains (32Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because ScbR2 and JadR2 were predicted to share significant similarity in secondary structure with them, it is likely that they have also developed this antibiotic binding capacity. Although TetR family regulators comprise a large proportion of prokaryotic transcriptional regulators (27Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), many of their functions and ligands remain unknown. However, those examples that have been characterized to date include a rich diversity of biologically relevant ligands; some were associated with antibiotic resistance in pathogens. Our results obtained here suggest that some regulators can also mediate secondary metabolism in Streptomyces by responding to antibiotic signals.Antibiotics are known to serve a general signaling role to induce global changes in gene transcription in a bacterial community (38Davies J. Spiegelman G.B. Yim G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which antibiotics trigger specific transcriptional responses are still not elucidated. Our work demonstrates that, just like quorum-sensing molecules, antibiotics can also act as intracellular signals to induce downstream responses, and the key receptors in streptomycetes are pseudo GBL receptors. In the case of ScbR2-KasO and JadR2-JadR1, upon binding to pseudo GBL receptors as ligands, antibiotic signals are transmitted toward cluster-situated regulators to influence specific antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. By dissecting the molecular mechanisms in two model streptomycetes, we speculate that this antibiotic signaling cascade might be widely employed in this genus. Moreover, because GBL receptor homologues are commonly found in actinomycetes, it is suspected that similar mechanisms might also be adopted by closely related actinomycetes or other antibiotic-producing bacteria.Previously, the understanding of antibiotics-mediated regulation in streptomycetes was limited to feedback autoregulation (19Wang L. Tian X. Wang J. Yang H. Fan K. Xu G. Yang K. Tan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Jiang H. Hutchinson C.R. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ability of ScbR2 and JadR2 to interact with end products of other biosynthetic pathways extends this understanding to antibiotic-mediated communication in which metabolites from a defined biosynthetic pathway indirectly elicit responses in other pathways. Previously, microarray analysis revealed transcription level cross-talk between disparate antibiotic pathways, which is shown to involve cluster-situated regulators (40Huang J. Shi J. Molle V. Sohlberg B. Weaver D. Bibb M.J. Karoonuthaisiri N. Lih C.J. Kao C.M. Buttner M.J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1276-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this study, we largely enriched the mechanism by addressing the direct participation of antibiotics and their corresponding receptors. In the regulation network of Jd and Cm biosynthesis, JadR1 is the low level regulator that directly controls their biosynthesis, although JadR2 is the higher level signal coordinator that senses the information from the metabolites and responds by regulating the transcription of jadR1. With the formation of this cross-regulation circuit, Jd and Cm are thus able to cross-regulate the biosynthesis of each other. Knowledge of this antibiotic-induced cross-talk mechanism could prove relevant to rational improvements in the yield of commercially important antibiotics.Strikingly, the top ten JadR2 homologues in BLAST search are exclusively located in or adjacent to gene clusters for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, most of which are not identified and might well be cryptic. This suggests a possible correlation of pseudo GBL receptors with silent antibiotic clusters, consistent with our findings that inactivation of JadR2 and ScbR2 led to the production of two cryptic metabolites, Jd and a yellow compound. Knowledge of this correlation will likely provide an effective strategy to isolate those novel but cryptic natural products. IntroductionActinomycetes are well known for their ability to produce a wide variety of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites (1Ikeda H. Ishikawa J. Hanamoto A. Shinose M. Kikuchi H. Shiba T.

Parkhill J. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations indicated that the antibiotic biosynthesis often involves a complex regulatory network that responds to environmental and nutritional factors; one of the initial steps is known as the quorum sensing process (3Bibb M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4Camilli A. Bassler B.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In bacteria, this process is often mediated by small molecule autoinducers and their cognate receptors to convert population density information into cellular responses (5Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 6Lazdunski A.M. Ventre I. Sturgis J.N. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the Gram-positive streptomycetes, a typical quorum-sensing mechanism to trigger the onset of secondary metabolism involves the γ-butyrolactones (GBLs) 4The abbreviations used are: GBLγ-butyrolactoneActactinorhodinRedundecylprodigiosinCmchloramphenicolJdjadomycinJdBjadomycin BJdAjadomycin Atsptranscription start pointWTwild typeETethanolSCBsStreptomyces coelicolor butyrolactones. autoinducers and their cognate GBL receptors (7Nishida H.

Cell. 2006; 125: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar).Several GBLs in actinomycetes have been identified so far, and they share a characteristic 2,3-disubstituted-γ-butyrolactone core but differ in the C2 side chains. In most cases, the GBL synthase gene locates next to the gene of its specific receptor (9Takano E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, genome analysis of sequenced Streptomyces indicated the presence of many GBL receptor paralogues in addition to the identified synthase-receptor pairs, raising the question of whether they also respond to GBLs and participate in the quorum-sensing cascade (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fact, only a few identified receptors have been proven to interact with their cognate GBL molecules: ScbR with SCBs in Streptomyces coelicolor, ArpA with A-factor in S. griseus, BarA with virginiae butanolides in Streptomyces virginiae, and FarA with IM-2 in Streptomyces lavendulae (9Takano E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). There are more examples of putative GBL receptor homologues that do not exhibit any GBLs binding ability (10Kitani S. Iida A. Izumi T.A. Maeda A. Yamada Y. Nihira T. Gene. 2008; 425: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For instance, BarB from S. virginiae was found not to bind virginiae butanolides (the GBLs in S. virginiae), thereby designated “pseudo” GBL receptor (11Matsuno K. Yamada Y. Lee C.K. Nihira T. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that putative GBL receptor homologues, FarR2 in S. lavendulae, AlpZ in Streptomyces ambofaciens, and SabR in Streptomyces acidiscabies, may bind ligands other than GBL compounds (10Kitani S. Iida A. Izumi T.A. Maeda A. Yamada Y. Nihira T. Gene. 2008; 425: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Bunet R. Mendes M.V. Rouhier N. Pang X. Hotel L. Leblond P. Aigle B. J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4786-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an earlier phylogenetic analysis of GBL receptor homologues has indicated considerable differences between genuine GBL receptors and BarB-like proteins (including BarB, JadR2, SCO6286, CprB, SAV3702, and Aur1R from different streptomycetes), particularly in the region corresponding to the ligand-binding domain (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is suspected that they may have developed a different ligand binding capacity, but so far, such a mechanism has not been elucidated.In this study, we characterized the functions of two BarB-like proteins, ScbR2 (SCO6286) and JadR2, and demonstrated that their ligands are endogenously produced and chemically distinct antibiotics.

In the regulation network of Jd and Cm biosynthesis, JadR1 is the low level regulator that directly controls their biosynthesis, although JadR2 is the higher level signal coordinator that senses the information from the metabolites and responds by regulating the transcription of jadR1. With the formation of this cross-regulation circuit, Jd and Cm are thus able to cross-regulate the biosynthesis of each other. Knowledge of this antibiotic-induced cross-talk mechanism could prove relevant to rational improvements in the yield of commercially important antibiotics.Strikingly, the top ten JadR2 homologues in BLAST search are exclusively located in or adjacent to gene clusters for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, most of which are not identified and might well be cryptic. This suggests a possible correlation of pseudo GBL receptors with silent antibiotic clusters, consistent with our findings that inactivation of JadR2 and ScbR2 led to the production of two cryptic metabolites, Jd and a yellow compound. Knowledge of this correlation will likely provide an effective strategy to isolate those novel but cryptic natural products. In Gram-negative bacteria, the LuxI-LuxR proteins are commonly involved in synthesis and detection of the quorum-sensing autoinducers. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the synthase-receptor elements in the LuxI-LuxR systems had evolved concomitantly (37Gray K.M. Garey J.R. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, in the GBL signaling cascade of streptomycetes, it is suggested that the GBL receptors had predated GBL synthases and later acquired GBL binding properties (7Nishida H. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of many GBL receptor paralogues in one genome also suggests that their functions have diversified. Here, we demonstrate that pseudo GBL receptors serve a novel role to coordinate antibiotic biosynthesis by responding to antibiotic signals. As briefly summarized in Fig. 9, pseudo GBL receptors (like JadR2 and ScbR2) usually repress the expression of cryptic secondary metabolites (jadomycin and a type I polyketide synthase yellow compound) by directly inhibiting the transcription of cluster-situated activators (JadR1 and KasO). However, unlike genuine GBL receptors, which only bind specific GBL molecules, pseudo GBL receptors act as a signal coordinator to orchestrate antibiotic biosynthesis by binding and responding to disparate antibiotics. In S. venezuelae, JadR2 directly represses the transcription of jadR1, the determinant of an activator of the Jd biosynthetic genes, that is shown to repress Cm biosynthetic genes. These two different antibiotics could bind to JadR2, leading to the dissociation of this repression. Although in S. coelicolor, ScbR2 is the repressor of KasO, a key activator of a cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster. ScbR2 could also indirectly regulate the expression of Red and Act biosynthetic gene clusters. As expected, ScbR2 did not bind the GBL molecule SCB1 but could bind and respond to the endogenous Red and Act. Taken together, their capacity to bind and respond to disparate antibiotics helps them to fulfill a coordinator role in coordinating antibiotic biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first time the ligands for these pseudo GBL receptors are identified as antibiotics. Nevertheless, this antibiotic binding capacity is not unexpected. Sequence similarity and phylogenic studies suggested that ScbR2 and JadR2 belong to the TetR superfamily regulators. Because of the sequence diversity of the ligand-binding domain of this family, an extremely wide range of small molecules can serve as the effective ligands. For instance, crystal structures showed that QacR and TtgR are capable of binding and responding to many structurally diverse drugs (29Alguel Y. Meng C. Terán W. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Investigations of these proteins suggest that this ability is mainly ascribed to the richness of helices and a large cavity in their ligand-binding domains (32Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because ScbR2 and JadR2 were predicted to share significant similarity in secondary structure with them, it is likely that they have also developed this antibiotic binding capacity. Although TetR family regulators comprise a large proportion of prokaryotic transcriptional regulators (27Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), many of their functions and ligands remain unknown. However, those examples that have been characterized to date include a rich diversity of biologically relevant ligands; some were associated with antibiotic resistance in pathogens. Our results obtained here suggest that some regulators can also mediate secondary metabolism in Streptomyces by responding to antibiotic signals. Antibiotics are known to serve a general signaling role to induce global changes in gene transcription in a bacterial community (38Davies J. Spiegelman G.B. Yim G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which antibiotics trigger specific transcriptional responses are still not elucidated. Our work demonstrates that, just like quorum-sensing molecules, antibiotics can also act as intracellular signals to induce downstream responses, and the key receptors in streptomycetes are pseudo GBL receptors. In the case of ScbR2-KasO and JadR2-JadR1, upon binding to pseudo GBL receptors as ligands, antibiotic signals are transmitted toward cluster-situated regulators to influence specific antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. By dissecting the molecular mechanisms in two model streptomycetes, we speculate that this antibiotic signaling cascade might be widely employed in this genus. Moreover, because GBL receptor homologues are commonly found in actinomycetes, it is suspected that similar mechanisms might also be adopted by closely related actinomycetes or other antibiotic-producing bacteria. Previously, the understanding of antibiotics-mediated regulation in streptomycetes was limited to feedback autoregulation (19Wang L. Tian X. Wang J. Yang H. Fan K. Xu G. Yang K. Tan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Jiang H. Hutchinson C.R. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ability of ScbR2 and JadR2 to interact with end products of other biosynthetic pathways extends this understanding to antibiotic-mediated communication in which metabolites from a defined biosynthetic pathway indirectly elicit responses in other pathways. Previously, microarray analysis revealed transcription level cross-talk between disparate antibiotic pathways, which is shown to involve cluster-situated regulators (40Huang J. Shi J. Molle V. Sohlberg B. Weaver D. Bibb M.J. Karoonuthaisiri N. Lih C.J. Kao C.M. Buttner M.J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1276-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2059566428,"Discussion surrounding the settlement of the New World has recently gained momentum with advances in molecular biology, archaeology and bioanthropology. Recent evidence from these diverse fields is found to support different colonization scenarios. The currently available genetic evidence suggests a ""single migration"" model, in which both early and later Native American groups derive from one expansion event into the continent. In contrast, the pronounced anatomical differences between early and late Native American populations have led others to propose more complex scenarios, involving separate colonization events of the New World and a distinct origin for these groups.USING LARGE SAMPLES OF EARLY AMERICAN CRANIA, WE: 1) calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under three different time divergence assumptions, and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions in each case; and 2) further tested three dispersal scenarios for the colonization of the New World by comparing the morphological distances among early and late Amerindians, East Asians, Australo-Melanesians and early modern humans from Asia to geographical distances associated with each dispersion model. Results indicate that the assumption of a last shared common ancestor outside the continent better explains the observed morphological differences between early and late American groups. This result is corroborated by our finding that a model comprising two Asian waves of migration coming through Bering into the Americas fits the cranial anatomical evidence best, especially when the effects of diversifying selection to climate are taken into account.We conclude that the morphological diversity documented through time in the New World is best accounted for by a model postulating two waves of human expansion into the continent originating in East Asia and entering through Beringia."
https://openalex.org/W2027159196,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromers are macromolecular complexes with unique functional properties different from those of its individual protomers. Little is known about what determines the quaternary structure of GPCR heteromers resulting in their unique functional properties. In this study, using resonance energy transfer techniques in experiments with mutated receptors, we provide for the first time clear evidence for a key role of intracellular domains in the determination of the quaternary structure of GPCR heteromers between adenosine A(2A), cannabinoid CB(1), and dopamine D(2) receptors. In these interactions, arginine-rich epitopes form salt bridges with phosphorylated serine or threonine residues from CK1/2 consensus sites. Each receptor (A(2A), CB(1), and D(2)) was found to include two evolutionarily conserved intracellular domains to establish selective electrostatic interactions with intracellular domains of the other two receptors, indicating that these particular electrostatic interactions constitute a general mechanism for receptor heteromerization. Mutation experiments indicated that the interactions of the intracellular domains of the CB(1) receptor with A(2A) and D(2) receptors are fundamental for the correct formation of the quaternary structure needed for the function (MAPK signaling) of the A(2A)-CB(1)-D(2) receptor heteromers. Analysis of MAPK signaling in striatal slices of CB(1) receptor KO mice and wild-type littermates supported the existence of A(1)-CB(1)-D(2) receptor heteromer in the brain. These findings allowed us to propose the first molecular model of the quaternary structure of a receptor heteromultimer."
https://openalex.org/W1982779431,"Background Dry eye has shown a marked increase due to visual display terminal (VDT) use. It remains unclear whether reduced blinking while focusing can have a direct deleterious impact on the lacrimal gland function. To address this issue that potentially affects the life quality, we conducted a large-scale epidemiological study of VDT users and an animal study. Methodology/Principal Findings Cross sectional survey carried out in Japan. A total of 1025 office workers who use VDT were enrolled. The association between VDT work duration and changes in tear film status, precorneal tear stability, lipid layer status and tear secretion were analyzed. For the animal model study, the rat VDT user model, placing rats onto a balance swing in combination with exposure to an evaporative environment was used to analyze lacrimal gland function. There was no positive relationship between VDT working duration and change in tear film stability and lipid layer status. The odds ratio for decrease in Schirmer score, index of tear secretion, were significantly increased with VDT working year (P = 0.012) and time (P = 0.005). The rat VDT user model, showed chronic reduction of tear secretion and was accompanied by an impairment of the lacrimal gland function and morphology. This dysfunction was recovered when rats were moved to resting conditions without the swing. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that lacrimal gland hypofunction is associated with VDT use and may be a critical mechanism for VDT-associated dry eye. We believe this to be the first mechanistic link to the pathogenesis of dry eye in office workers."
https://openalex.org/W2078207049,"Complex combinations of simultaneous stimuli control cellular responses, and cross-talk between signaling pathways makes it even more difficult to predict these responses. Chatterjee et al. demonstrate in human platelets that neural networks trained with measurements of pairwise stimuli can predict combinations of many signaling inputs. Prediction of cellular response to multiple stimuli is central to evaluating patient-specific clinical status and to basic understanding of cell biology. Cross-talk between signaling pathways cannot be predicted by studying them in isolation and the combinatorial complexity of multiple agonists acting together prohibits an exhaustive exploration of the complete experimental space. Here we describe pairwise agonist scanning (PAS), a strategy that trains a neural network model based on measurements of cellular responses to individual and all pairwise combinations of input signals. We apply PAS to predict calcium signaling responses of human platelets in EDTA-treated plasma to six different agonists (ADP, convulxin, U46619, SFLLRN, AYPGKF and PGE2) at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 × EC50). The model predicted responses to sequentially added agonists, to ternary combinations of agonists and to 45 different combinations of four to six agonists (R = 0.88). Furthermore, we use PAS to distinguish between the phenotypic responses of platelets from ten donors. Training neural networks with pairs of stimuli across the dose-response regime represents an efficient approach for predicting complex signal integration in a patient-specific disease milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1978052840,"Mounting evidence shows that contrasting selection pressures generate variability in dispersal patterns among individuals or populations of the same species, with potential impacts on both species dynamics and evolution. However, this variability is hardly considered in empirical works, where a single dispersal function is considered to adequately reflect the species-specific dispersal ability, suggesting thereby that within-species variation is negligible as regard to inter-specific differences in dispersal abilities. We propose here an original method to make the comparison of intra- and inter-specific variability in dispersal, by decomposing the diversity of that trait along a phylogeny of closely related species. We used as test group European butterflies that are classic study organisms in spatial ecology. We apply the analysis separately to eight metrics that reflect the dispersal propensity, the dispersal ability or the dispersal efficiency of populations and species. At the inter-specific level, only the dispersal ability showed the signature of a phylogenetic signal while neither the dispersal propensity nor the dispersal efficiency did. At the within-species level, the partitioning of dispersal diversity showed that dispersal was variable or highly variable among populations: intra-specific variability represented from 11% to 133% of inter-specific variability in dispersal metrics. This finding shows that dispersal variation is far from negligible in the wild. Understanding the processes behind this high within-species variation should allow us to properly account for dispersal in demographic models. Accordingly, to encompass the within species variability in life histories the use of more than one value per trait per species should be encouraged in the construction of databases aiming at being sources for modelling purposes."
https://openalex.org/W1969507003,"Background Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is common in women who have sex with women. While cross-sectional data support a role for sexual transmission, risks for incident BV have not been prospectively studied in this group. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied risks for BV acquisition in a prospective cohort study of women (age 16–35 years) who reported sex with other women (≥1 partner, prior year). Women were followed for one year with examinations at quarterly visits and for genital symptoms at any time. Species-specific 16S rRNA gene PCRs for BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) were applied to vaginal fluid obtained at enrollment. Sexual behaviors were ascertained by computer-assisted interview. Of 335 participants, 239 had no BV at baseline; 199 were seen in follow-up (median follow-up 355 days, 4.0 visits/subject). Forty women experienced ≥1 BV episode. Risks for incident BV were presentation ≤14 days since onset of menses (hazard ratio (HR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.2–4.7), report of new sex partner with BV history (HR 3.63 (1.1–11.9)), change in vaginal discharge (HR 2.6 (1.3–5.2)) and detection of any of several BVAB in vaginal fluid at enrollment, including BVAB1 (HR 6.3 (1.4–28.1)), BVAB2 (HR 18.2 (6.4–51.8)), BVAB3 (HR 12.6 (2.7–58.4)), G. vaginalis (HR 3.9 (1.5–10.4)), Atopobium vaginae (HR 4.2 (1.9–9.3)), Leptotrichia spp (9.3 (3.0–24.4)), and Megasphaera-1 (HR 11.5 (5.0–26.6)). Detection of Lactobacillus crispatus at enrollment conferred reduced risk for subsequent BV (HR 0.18 (0.08–0.4)). Detailed analysis of behavioral data suggested a direct dose-response relationship with increasing number of episodes of receptive oral-vulvovaginal sex (HR 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00–1.04). Conclusions/Significance Vaginal detection of several BVAB in BV-negative women predicted subsequent BV, suggesting that changes in vaginal microbiota precede BV by weeks or months. BV acquisition was associated with report of new partner with BV; associations with sexual practices – specifically, receptive oral sex – require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2044768889,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs predicted to regulate one third of protein coding genes via mRNA targeting. In conjunction with key transcription factors, such as the repressor REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor), miRNAs play crucial roles in neurogenesis, which requires a highly orchestrated program of gene expression to ensure the appropriate development and function of diverse neural cell types. Whilst previous studies have highlighted select groups of miRNAs during neural development, there remains a need for amenable models in which miRNA expression and function can be analyzed over the duration of neurogenesis. Principal Findings We performed large-scale expression profiling of miRNAs in human NTera2/D1 (NT2) cells during retinoic acid (RA)-induced transition from progenitors to fully differentiated neural phenotypes. Our results revealed dynamic changes of miRNA patterns, resulting in distinct miRNA subsets that could be linked to specific neurodevelopmental stages. Moreover, the cell-type specific miRNA subsets were very similar in NT2-derived differentiated cells and human primary neurons and astrocytes. Further analysis identified miRNAs as putative regulators of REST, as well as candidate miRNAs targeted by REST. Finally, we confirmed the existence of two predicted miRNAs; pred-MIR191 and pred-MIR222 associated with SLAIN1 and FOXP2, respectively, and provided some evidence of their potential co-regulation. Conclusions In the present study, we demonstrate that regulation of miRNAs occurs in precise patterns indicative of their roles in cell fate commitment, progenitor expansion and differentiation into neurons and glia. Furthermore, the similarity between our NT2 system and primary human cells suggests their roles in molecular pathways critical for human in vivo neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964239880,"Activation of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa2) channels can regulate neuronal firing and synaptic plasticity. They are characterized by their high sensitivity to the bee venom toxin apamin, but the mechanism of block is not understood. For example, apamin binds to both KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 with the same high affinity (KD ∼ 5 pm for both subtypes) but requires significantly higher concentrations to block functional current (IC50 values of ∼100 pm and ∼5 nm, respectively). This suggests that steps beyond binding are needed for channel block to occur. We have combined patch clamp and binding experiments on cell lines with molecular modeling and mutagenesis to gain more insight into the mechanism of action of the toxin. An outer pore histidine residue common to both subtypes was found to be critical for both binding and block by the toxin but not for block by tetraethylammonium (TEA) ions. These data indicated that apamin blocks KCa2 channels by binding to a site distinct from that used by TEA, supported by a finding that the onset of block by apamin was not affected by the presence of TEA. Structural modeling of ligand-channel interaction indicated that TEA binds deep within the channel pore, which contrasted with apamin being modeled to interact with the channel outer pore by utilizing the outer pore histidine residue. This multidisciplinary approach suggested that apamin does not behave as a classical pore blocker but blocks using an allosteric mechanism that is consistent with observed differences between binding affinity and potency of block.

KCa2 channels (formerly known as SK channels) are characterized by their sensitivity to the highly specific toxin apamin (1Blatz A.L. Magleby K.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This 18-amino acid peptide, which has been isolated from the honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom (2Vincent J.P. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2521-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), contains two disulfide bridges that provide a fairly rigid tertiary conformation (3Pease J.H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8491-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), with two arginine residues (Arg-13 and Arg-14) being critical for its biological activity (4Labbé-Jullié C. Granier C. Albericio F. Defendini M.L. Ceard B. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cloning of KCa2 channel subunits has revealed the existence of three subtypes (KCa2.1–KCa2.3, formerly SK1–SK3) (5Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) that bind apamin with very high affinity (KD ∼ 5–10 pm) (see Ref. 6Pedarzani P. Stocker M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3196-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar for a review). However, apamin is less potent at blocking KCa2 current and displays differential block of channel subtypes. For example, KCa2.2 (all species) displays the highest sensitivity, with IC50 values from 27 to 140 pm. Rat, human, and mouse KCa2.3-mediated currents show an intermediate sensitivity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.63 to 19 nm. Finally, human KCa2.1 is the least sensitive, with reported IC50 values ranging between 0.7 and 100 nm (6Pedarzani P. Stocker M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3196-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These differences between binding and electrophysiological results suggest that the mechanism of block by apamin is complex and that binding and block by the toxin are not identical phenomena. KCa2 channel subtypes are expressed throughout the CNS and periphery, displaying partially overlapping but distinct locations. This has led to the proposal that block of KCa2 channels may be a novel target for cognitive enhancement, depression, and dopamine-related disorders (7Liégeois J.F. Mercier F. Graulich A. Graulich-Lorge F. Scuvée- Moreau J. Seutin V. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 625-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, blockers would be required to display significant selectivity for particular KCa2 channel subtypes.

It is clear that understanding the mechanism of this differential block might contribute toward the synthesis of non-peptidic compounds that could selectively target a particular KCa2 subunit (7Liégeois J.F.

In this study, we have used a multidisciplinary approach, including binding, mutagenesis, structural modeling, and patch clamp experiments with KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 channels, to gain a comprehensive understanding of how apamin works. Taken together, our results demonstrate that apamin operates with a mechanism that is not consistent with classical pore block. Wild-type rat KCa2.2 (GenBankTM accession number NM_019314) and human KCa2.3 (GenBank accession number AF031815) channel DNAs were subcloned into the mammalian plasmid expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and pFLAGCMV2 (Sigma, Poole, UK), respectively. Point mutations in KCa2.2 (KCa2.2(H337N), KCa2.2(N337R), KCa2.2(N345G), and KCa2.2(N368H)) and KCa2.3 (KCa2.3(H522N) and KCa2.3(H491N)) were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene-Agilent, Stockport, UK) and subsequently confirmed by dye termination DNA sequencing. Channels were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. For each passage, cells were dissociated using an EDTA solution and maintained in modified essential medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. They were plated onto 35-mm dishes (Falcon) 48 h before transfection. For electrophysiology, transient transfections of HEK293 cells were made using polyethyleneimine (Alfa Aesar, Inc.) by combining channel plasmid DNA with enhanced green fluorescent protein DNA in ratio of 1:1 to 1:10 (maximal plasmid content: 1 μg). Cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein were used for electrophysiology 12–24 h after transfection. Membranes were prepared for binding experiments as follows. HEK293 cells were plated on a 100-mm dish for 2 days and then transfected with the corresponding plasmid using the polyethyleneimine method without enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cells were harvested after 48 h with cold PBS (4 °C) using 5 ml/dish and centrifuged twice for 10 min at 1000 × g (4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, BSA 1%, pH 7.4), mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g (4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged twice for 20 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in another buffer (5 mm Tris, 5.4 mm KCl, pH 8.5), using 1 ml/dish. Protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric protein assay with a bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). The absorbance was measured at 562 nm with a Multiskan Ascent (Thermo LabSystem, Waltham, MA) spectrophotometer. Glycerol (10%) was then added, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Expressed KCa2 currents recorded in either the whole-cell or the excised outside-out patch configurations were evoked in symmetrical high (∼170 mm) K+ conditions using an internal solution that contained 1 μm free Ca2+. Pipettes were fabricated from KG-33 glass (Friedrich & Dimmock, Inc.) or from code 1403513 glass (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) and filled with an internal solution composed of KCl (120 mm), HEPES (10 mm), EGTA (10 mm), Na2ATP (1.5 mm), CaCl2 (9.65 mm, calculated free [Ca2+]i 1 μm), MgCl2 (2.34 mm, calculated free [Mg2+]i 1 mm), pH 7.4, with ∼40 mm KOH. Cells were bathed in a control external solution that consisted of KCl (120 mm), HEPES (10 mm), EGTA (10 mm), CaCl2 (6.19 mm, calculated free [Ca2+]i 60 nm), MgCl2 (1.44 mm, calculated free [Mg2+]i 1 mm), pH 7.4, with ∼40 mm KOH. Some experiments were carried out using a physiological K+ external solution composed of NaCl (140 mm), KCl (5 mm), HEPES (10 mm), CaCl2 (2.5 mm), MgCl2 (1.2 mm), d-glucose (10 mm), pH 7.4 with NaOH. For kinetic experiments, solutions were rapidly exchanged using an RSC200 rapid switcher (Biologic, Claix, France) or a BPS-8 system from ALA Science (ALA Scientific Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). Apamin, d-tubocurarine (d-TC), 5The abbreviations used are:d-TCd-tubocurarineTEAtetraethylammoniumNMLN-methyl-laudanosine. and UCL1684 were purchased from Tocris Biosciences (Bristol, UK). Apamin and d-TC solutions were prepared on the day of experiments from a frozen stock of 100 μm and 1 mm in water, respectively. UCL 1684 (Tocris Biosciences) stock was prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 100 μm and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) (from Sigma) solutions were prepared from a 1 m stock solution in water. The reversible KCa blocker N-methyl-laudanosine (NML) (9Scuvee-Moreau J. Liegeois J.F. Massotte L. Seutin V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was synthesized in-house. d-tubocurarine tetraethylammonium N-methyl-laudanosine. Saturation binding was carried out in a 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer solution containing 5.4 mm KCl and 0.1% BSA. 125I-apamin was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Zaventem, Belgium), with a specific activity of 81.4 TBq/mmol. Glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C, Maidstone, Kent, UK) used in these experiments were coated for 1 h in 0.5% polyethyleneimine (to prevent apamin from binding to the filter) and then washed with 2.5 ml of the ice-cold buffer just before use. Membrane preparations (final protein concentration: 10 μg/ml) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-apamin for 1h at 0 °C. Binding experiments were terminated as follows: aliquots were filtered under reduced pressure through Whatman filters. Filters were rapidly washed twice with 2.5 ml of ice-cold buffer and placed into a vial containing Ecoscint A (7.5 ml) (National Diagnostics U.S.A, Atlanta, GA). The radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured using a Packard Tri-Carb 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer with an efficacy of 69%. Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel experiments in the presence of an excess of unlabeled apamin (0.1 μm) and subtracted from the total binding to obtain the specific binding. Where 125I-apamin binding was not detected with some mutant channels, positive controls were carried out in tandem on wild-type channels. All binding data were obtained from a minimum of two batches of membranes. A homology model of KCa2.2 was created as described previously (10Goodchild S.J. Lamy C. Seutin V. Marrion N.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Docking was performed using the software suite Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Docking simulations were produced by energy-minimizing the ligand using the MMF94s force field in Sybyl (Tripos) and then docking the ligand into the KCa2.2 tetramer model using the Surflex or FlexX docking modules in Sybyl. Interactions were accepted from the lowest energy binding mode. The NMR solved solution structure of apamin was donated by Dr. D. Wemmer (University of California, Berkeley). For saturation binding experiments, data were fit with a Hill equation of the formwith KD being the dissociation constant of the peptide and nh the Hill coefficient. Curve fitting was carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For all experiments, a 1/Y (where Y-Bound/total bound) weighting procedure was used, which gave more weight to the smaller values of radioactivity (i.e. those that are close to the KD). For concentration-response relationships in electrophysiological experiments, data points representing current block were fit with a variable slope Hill equation of the formwhere Icont is the amplitude of current in the absence of drug, I is the amplitude of current observed at a given concentration of blocker ([X], expressed in logarithmic units), IC50 is the concentration of blocker that blocks 50% of sensitive current, and nh is the Hill coefficient (expressed as negative values, but its absolute value is used in the text). Analysis of kinetic electrophysiological experiments is described under “Results.” All numerical values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.02 (GraphPad Software). Data were analyzed with a parametric or non-parametric test where appropriate. The affinity of binding (KD) of apamin to KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 channels was assessed in saturation experiments on membranes prepared from transiently transfected HEK293 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Binding of 125I-apamin was saturable, with KD values of 7.5 ± 2.3 and 8.4 ± 1.7 pm for KCa2.2 and KCa2.3, respectively (n = 7) (Fig. 1, A and B). These values were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.77) and were consistent with previously published values (11Finlayson K. McLuckie J. Hern J. Aramori I. Olverman H.J. Kelly J.S. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Obtained Hill coefficients were close to unity (0.87 ± 0.03 and 0.8 ± 0.1, respectively), indicating that binding was not cooperative. Expression of either KCa2.2 or KCa2.3 subunits produced inwardly rectifying whole-cell currents in the presence of 1 μm intracellular Ca2+ (10Goodchild S.J. Lamy C. Seutin V. Marrion N.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Soh H. Park C.S. Biophys.

Aldrich R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). Both KCa2.2-mediated and KCa2.3-mediated currents were blocked by the addition of apamin, but block was incomplete despite the addition of a supramaximal concentration of the bee venom toxin (15Dale T.J. Cryan J.E. Chen M.X. Trezise D.J. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C–E). Expressed KCa2.2 current was more sensitive to block by apamin than KCa2.3 current. Fig. 1E shows the fractional block of KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 currents measured at −80 mV in response to increasing concentrations of apamin. The data were fit with the Hill equation, giving the following for KCa2.2: IC50 = 107 ± 31 pm, nh = 1.8 ± 0.4 (n = 10), and giving the following for KCa2.3: IC50 = 6.1 ± 1.6 nm, nh = 1.4 ± 0.1 (n = 12) (6Pedarzani P. Stocker M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3196-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The fitted Hill slope was significantly greater than unity for KCa2.3 (p < 0.02), but not for KCa2.2 (p < 0.08), although a trend was observed. These data suggested that some cooperativity might be utilized to achieve block. Finally, block of expressed KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 current was assessed under physiological K+ conditions to determine whether the concentration of external K+ affected the potency of block. KCa2.2 current was blocked by apamin with an IC50 = 70 ± 30 pm, nh = 0.91 ± 0.2 (n = 5), whereas KCa2.3 was blocked with an IC50 = 2.6 ± 0.4 nm, nh = 1.2 ± 0.1 (n = 9) under physiological conditions. These values were not significantly different from those obtained in symmetrical K+ conditions (KCa2.2, p = 0.16; KCa2.3, p = 0.25), indicating that the potency of block was not significantly affected by the concentration of external K+. Particular amino acid residues within the outer pore have been reported to influence the sensitivity of KCa2 channel currents to block by apamin (16Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We reported previously that the protonation of an outer pore histidine residue common to both KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 channels inhibited macroscopic current using an allosteric mechanism (10Goodchild S.J. Lamy C. Seutin V. Marrion N.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It was possible that this His residue may interact with apamin to cause block. The sensitivity to block by apamin of the mutant channels KCa2.2(H337N) and KCa2.3(H491N) was investigated to examine this possibility, in which the common basic His residue had been replaced with an uncharged asparagine. Fig. 2, A and B, show representative KCa2.2(H337N) and KCa2.3(H491N) currents in symmetrical high K+ solutions before and after the application of 100 nm apamin. Currents were not significantly blocked by 100 nm apamin (Fig. 2D; KCa2.2(H337N) p = 0.22, KCa2.3(H491N) p = 0.11, n = 5). These data suggested that this common His residue located in the S5-PHelix loop was crucial to the inhibitory interaction of apamin with the channel. Radioligand binding experiments showed no specific binding of 125I-apamin (up to 300 pm) to either KCa2.2(H337N) or KCa2.3(H491N) channels (n = 3 for both mutants, data not shown). These data indicated that the His residue located in the S5-PHelix loop was critically required for the binding and subsequent block of KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 channels by apamin. It is possible that the proton acceptor property of the outer pore His residue, rather than the possibility of the residue possessing a net positive charge, was required for binding of apamin and subsequent channel block. Mutation of the His-337 residue to the positive arginine to yield KCa2.2(H337R) produced a channel current that was also resistant to inhibition by 100 nm apamin (Fig. 2, C and D; p = 0.43). These data indicated that binding and block by apamin required the electrostatic features of the un-ionized basic His residue in the channel outer pore. The structural features of apamin proposed to confer high affinity binding have been used to design organic molecule blockers of KCa2 channels, providing a pharmacophore for KCa2 channel blockers (17Dilly S. Graulich A. Farce A. Seutin V. Liegeois J.F. Chavatte P. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2005; 20: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Sørensen U.S. Strøbaek D. Christophersen P. Hougaard C. Jensen M.L. Nielsen E.Ø. Peters D. Teuber L. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 7625-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A number of small organic molecule blockers of KCa2 channels, including dequalinium, d-TC, and several cyclic bis-quinolinium cyclophanes derived from dequalinium (e.g. UCL1684), possess two positively charged quinolinium groups that are spatially separated to be analogous to the separation of the positive guanidinium groups of the two arginine residues in apamin. These organic molecules displace 125I-apamin binding and are proposed to interact with the apamin binding site (19Cook N.S. Haylett D.G. J. Physiol. 1985; 358: 373-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Morgan J.M. Jenkinson D.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 236: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This would suggest that like block by apamin, block by these organic compounds would also require the outer pore His residue. This was tested by determining the sensitivity of KCa2.2(H337N)-mediated current to block by supramaximal concentrations of UCL1684 (21Rosa J.C. Galanakis D. Ganellin C.R. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (20 nm) and d-TC (100 μm) (Fig. 2E). The mutant channel was insensitive to both blockers (Fig. 2E; UCL1684 p = 0.47 n = 3, d-TC p = 0.12 n = 4). These data were consistent with binding displacement studies and indicated that the outer pore His residue in the S5-PHelix loop that is common to all KCa2 channel subtypes was essential to the binding and block by apamin and organic blockers. It is possible that the lack of block by apamin, UCL1684, and d-TC of KCa2.2(H337N) and KCa2.3(H491N) channel currents resulted from the mutation affecting pore structure. We used TEA ions to probe for any inner pore structural changes that might have been caused by these mutations. TEA acts as a classic pore blocker, interacting at the extracellular mouth of the selectivity filter in K+ channels to obstruct K+ flux (22Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Monaghan A.S. Benton D.C. Bahia P.K. Hosseini R. Shah Y.A. Haylett D.G. Moss G.W. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2006; 128: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TEA can therefore be used as a “molecular caliper” to probe the dimensions of the inner pore under different conditions. Different sensitivities are proposed to indicate differences in pore structure and dynamics (26Molina A. Castellano A.G. López-Barneo J. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Bretschneider F. Wrisch A. Lehmann-Horn F. Grissmer S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2351-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B, show current traces from outside-out patches recorded in low external K+ (to allow the iso-osmotic addition of TEA to the bath solution), showing that both WT and mutant KCa2.2 channel currents were blocked by TEA. A plot of the fractional current (I/Icont) measured at −40 mV against the concentration of TEA was fit with the Hill equation and revealed a sensitivity to block for KCa2.2 of IC50 = 1.9 ± 0.24 mm with a Hill slope nh = 1.1 ± 0.1 and for KCa2.2(H337N), IC50 = 7.7 ± 0.6 mm, nh = 0.9 ± 0.1 (Fig. 3C). These data showed that KCa2.2(H337N) was significantly less sensitive to TEA than WT KCa2.2 (p < 0.001, n = 3). The Hill slopes for both channels were not significantly different from unity (p > 0.05, n = 3), consistent with a one-to-one binding interaction that would be expected for a pore-blocking mechanism (28Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 539-574Google Scholar). The block of KCa2.2(H337N)-mediated current by TEA indicated that the general architecture of the inner pore was maintained by this mutation. However, it is likely that the ∼4-fold reduction in sensitivity to TEA suggests that the mutation of the outer pore His residue caused a slight change in the structure of the inner pore mouth where TEA is predicted to bind (see below). Despite significant differences in functional properties, KCa2 channels are likely to share pore architecture with Kv channels (29Jäger H. Grissmer S. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mutation of an outer pore valine (Val-342) residue in KCa2.2 to the glycine that confers sensitivity of Kv channels to charybdotoxin created a charybdotoxin-sensitive KCa2.2 channel (29Jäger H. Grissmer S. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The similarities in the effect of these mutations on KCa2.2 and Kv channels indicated that both the inner pore architecture and the outer pore architecture are similar in these two channel classes. We used our previously published homology model (10Goodchild S.J. Lamy C. Seutin V. Marrion N.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), based on the crystal structure of Kv1.2 (Protein Data Bank code 2a79B), to model the interactions of apamin and TEA with the KCa2.2 channel (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 4, A and B, show the results of a docking simulation of apamin targeted to the S5-PHelix loop region of the KCa2.2 pore region homology model that contains the important His-337 residue. Fig. 4A shows a top down view of the channel displayed in ribbon form and the apamin molecule in stick form. The loop regions of the outer pore are indicated by arrows. Apamin was found to interact with a number of the residues in the S5-PHelix loop, specifically forming H-bonds between the toxin residue Asn-2 and channel residue His-337, Arg-14 of apamin, and channel residues Gln-339 and Gln-340, the C1 thiol group of apamin and Asp-338 in the channel outer pore, Gln-17 residue of the toxin and Asn-345 of the channel and His-18 of the toxin, and Ser-344 of KCa2.2 (highlighted blue in the pore region sequence displayed). Other residues with electrostatic interactions are highlighted in red. Fig. 4B shows a transverse view of the interaction. The most striking feature of the docking simulation was the large distance between apamin and the conduction pathway for K+ ions. Targeting residues that have been shown to affect TEA sensitivity through mutational studies in KCa2 (23Monaghan A.S. Benton D.C. Bahia P.K. Hosseini R. Shah Y.A. Haylett D.G. Moss G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1003-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Kv channels (30Heginbotham L. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1992; 258: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) allowed the interaction between the quaternary ammonium ion and KCa2.2 to be modeled (Fig. 4, C and D). Fig. 4C shows a top down view of the channel displayed in ribbon form and the TEA molecule in space-filled mode for display, with TEA modeled to interact directly above the selectivity filter (Fig. 4, C and D). TEA was modeled to interact within the channel pore by electrostatic interactions with the C=O group of Tyr-362, whereas the ethyl groups of TEA interact via van der Waals contacts with Gly-363 and Asp-364 within the selectivity sequence and Val-366 (highlighted red in the sequence displayed below the docking). These data suggested that apamin does not traverse the pore to cause block by occluding the passage of K+ ions through the selectivity filter, whereas TEA is likely to act as a pore blocker. A mutational approach was used to determine whether the modeled interaction of KCa2.2 and apamin was accurate. The Gln-17 residue of apamin was modeled to interact with Asn-345 by formation of a hydrogen bond. This channel pore residue was mutated to the small uncharged glycine residue to neutralize the polar nature of the wild-type asparagine residue. Fig. 5A displays the concentration-response relationship for block of the KCa2.2(N345G) mutant by apamin. The data were fit with the Hill equation and gave values of IC50 = 4.5 ± 0.8 nm, nh = 1.30 ± 0.06 (n = 10), showing that mutation of Asn-345 significantly reduced sensitivity to apamin in comparison with WT KCa2.2 (mean IC50: 107 pm) (p < 0.001, Student's t test for unpaired values). The value of the Hill coefficient was significantly larger than 1 (p < 0.001, Student's t test). In contrast, TEA sensitivity was not significantly altered by this mutation (KCa2.2 IC50 = 2.2 ± 0.3 mm, nh = 0.97 ± 0.05 (n = 3), KCa2.2(N345G) IC50 = 3.8 ± 1 mm, nh = 0.99 ± 0.09 (n = 4, p = 0.84 for IC50 and p = 0.24 for Hill slope) (Fig. 5B), indicating that the inner pore region was unaltered. Binding affinity of apamin for the KCa2.2(N345G) mutant (KD 8.9 ± 4.1 pm, n = 4) was not significantly different from binding to WT KCa2.2 channels (p = 0.75, Student's t test for unpaired values, data not shown). The Hill coefficient was 1.01 ± 0.13. These data supported the modeled interaction of apamin and KCa2.2 channel and suggested that the interaction of apamin with Asn-345 was involved in the translation between binding and channel block. The evidence presented so far suggested that apamin may not act as a classic pore blocker as is proposed for TEA. As both interact in the pore region, it was pertinent to further address the question of whether the binding sites for TEA and"

This mutation elicits an internal deletion of 50 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminus of prelamin A. The truncated protein, progerin, retains a farnesylated cysteine at its carboxyl terminus, a modification involved in HGPS pathogenesis. Inhibition of protein farnesylation has been shown to improve abnormal nuclear morphology and phenotype in cellular and animal models of HGPS. We analyzed global gene expression changes in fibroblasts from human subjects with HGPS and found that a lamin A-Rb signaling network is a major defective regulatory axis. Treatment of fibroblasts with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor reversed the gene expression defects. Our study identifies Rb as a key factor in HGPS pathogenesis and suggests that its modulation could ameliorate premature aging and possibly complications of physiological aging."

https://openalex.org/W1997235434,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes chronic enteritis in a wide range of animal species. In cattle, MAP causes a chronic disease called Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis, that is not treatable and the efficacy of vaccine control is controversial. The clinical phase of the disease is characterised by diarrhoea, weight loss, drop in milk production and eventually death. Susceptibility to MAP infection is heritable with heritability estimates ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. There have been several studies over the last few years that have identified genetic loci putatively associated with MAP susceptibility, however, with the availability of genome-wide high density SNP maker panels it is now possible to carry out association studies that have higher precision.The objective of the current study was to localize genes having an impact on Johne's disease susceptibility using the latest bovine genome information and a high density SNP panel (Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip) to perform a case/control, genome-wide association analysis. Samples from MAP case and negative controls were selected from field samples collected in 2007 and 2008 in the province of Lombardy, Italy. Cases were defined as animals serologically positive for MAP by ELISA. In total 966 samples were genotyped: 483 MAP ELISA positive and 483 ELISA negative. Samples were selected randomly among those collected from 119 farms which had at least one positive animal.THE ANALYSIS OF THE GENOTYPE DATA IDENTIFIED SEVERAL CHROMOSOMAL REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE STATUS: a region on chromosome 12 with high significance (P<5x10(-6)), while regions on chromosome 9, 11, and 12 had moderate significance (P<5x10(-5)). These results provide evidence for genetic loci involved in the humoral response to MAP. Knowledge of genetic variations related to susceptibility will facilitate the incorporation of this information into breeding programmes for the improvement of health status."

Thus, nucleosome dynamics in certain regions of chromatin may provide the exposure time and space needed for efficient repair of buried DNA lesions. We have used FRET and restriction enzyme accessibility to study nucleosome dynamics following DNA damage by UV radiation. We find that FRET efficiency is reduced in a dose-dependent manner, showing that the presence of UV photoproducts enhances spontaneous unwrapping of DNA from histones. Furthermore, this UV-induced shift in unwrapping dynamics is associated with increased restriction enzyme accessibility of histone-bound DNA after UV treatment. Surprisingly, the increased unwrapping dynamics is even observed in nucleosome core particles containing a single UV lesion at a specific site. These results highlight the potential for increased ""intrinsic exposure"" of nucleosome-associated DNA lesions in chromatin to repair proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2094438297,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, like many other Gram-positive bacteria, assembles long filamentous pili on their surface through which they adhere to host cells. Pneumococcal pili are formed by a backbone, consisting of the repetition of the major component RrgB, and two accessory proteins (RrgA and RrgC). Here we reconstruct by transmission electron microscopy and single particle image reconstruction method the three dimensional arrangement of two neighbouring RrgB molecules, which represent the minimal repetitive structural domain of the native pilus. The crystal structure of the D2-D4 domains of RrgB was solved at 1.6 Å resolution. Rigid-body fitting of the X-ray coordinates into the electron density map enabled us to define the arrangement of the backbone subunits into the S. pneumoniae native pilus. The quantitative fitting provide evidence that the pneumococcal pilus consists uniquely of RrgB monomers assembled in a head-to-tail organization. The presence of short intra-subunit linker regions connecting neighbouring domains provides the molecular basis for the intrinsic pilus flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2002250627,"It has been known for a long time that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can assimilate α-methylglucopyranoside and isomaltose. We here report the identification of 5 genes (YGR287c, YIL172c, YJL216c, YJL221c and YOL157c), which, similar to the SUCx, MALx, or HXTx multigene families, are located in the subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes. They share high nucleotide sequence identities between themselves (66–100%) and with the MALx2 genes (63–74%). Comparison of their amino acid sequences underlined a substitution of threonine by valine in region II, one of the four highly conserved regions of the α-glucosidase family. This change was previously shown to be sufficient to discriminate α-1,4- to α-1,6-glucosidase activity in YGR287c (Yamamoto, K., Nakayama, A., Yamamoto, Y., and Tabata, S. (2004) Eur. J. Biochem. 271, 3414–3420). We showed that each of these five genes encodes a protein with α-glucosidase activity on isomaltose, and we therefore renamed these genes IMA1 to IMA5 for IsoMAltase. Our results also illustrated that sequence polymorphisms among this family led to interesting variability of gene expression patterns and of catalytic efficiencies on different substrates, which altogether should account for the absence of functional redundancy for growth on isomaltose. Indeed, deletion studies revealed that IMA1/YGR287c encodes the major isomaltase and that growth on isomaltose required the presence of AGT1, which encodes an α-glucoside transporter. Expressions of IMA1 and IMA5/YJL216c were strongly induced by maltose, isomaltose, and α-methylglucopyranoside, in accordance with their regulation by the Malx3p-transcription system.

IntroductionGene duplication, one of the main driving forces in genome evolution, generates paralogous genes that can acquire specificities by sequence divergence. These redundant genes are defined as multigene families, the most often located within subtelomere sequences. Very recently, Brown and co-workers demonstrated that the extraordinary instability of these regions supports rapid adaptation to novel niches. These multigene families, which evolve and expand much faster than families that do not contain subtelomeric genes, indeed reflect the organism's lifestyle (2Brown C.A. Murray A.W. Verstrepen K.J. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 strain contains about 30% of ORFs that belong to multigene families comprising between 3 and over 20 members (3Blandin G. Durrens P. Tekaia F. Aigle M. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Bon E. Casarégola S. de Montigny J. Gaillardin C. Lépingle A. Llorente B. Malpertuy A. Neuvéglise C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Perrin A. Potier S. Souciet J. Talla E. Toffano-Nioche C. Wésolowski-Louvel M. Marck C. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Relevant examples can be found in enzymatic systems for sugar uptake and assimilation. The hexose transporters are encoded by a family of 17 genes (HXT1–HXT17) (4Leandro M.J. Fonseca C. Gonçalves P. FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose expression is dependent on growth conditions, sugar availability, or stress (6Greatrix B.W. van Vuuren H.J. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Rintala E. Wiebe M.G. Tamminen A. Ruohonen L. Penttilä M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The assimilation of sucrose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-fructofuranose), maltose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-d-glucopyranose), melibiose (α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-glucopyranose), and starch is also dependent on the expression of SUCx, MALx, MELx, and STAx multigene families, respectively. These families are not always present in all Saccharomyces species, as for instance in the laboratory strain BY4741, derived from S288c, which does not hydrolyze starch, because STAx genes are absent (8Tamaki H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 205-209Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This strain also harbors only the SUC2 encoding invertase, whereas SUCx genes belong to a multigene family encompassing six unlinked loci (SUC1 through SUC5 and SUC7) (9Carlson M. Botstein D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The overall organization of the MALx gene family appears to be similar to that of the SUCx gene family. However each of the five MAL loci (MAL1 through MAL4 and MAL6) is a complex locus, which includes three genes that are all required for maltose utilization (10Needleman R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MALx1 encodes the permease (11Cheng Q. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MALx2, the maltase (12Dubin R.A. Needleman R.B. Gossett D. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 605-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MALx3, the Malx3p-transactivator required for the expression of the two previous genes (13Chang Y.S. Dubin R.A. Perkins E. Forrest D. Michels C.A. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1988; 14: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MAL loci are also located in the subtelomeric regions (14Charron M.J. Read E. Haut S.R. Michels C.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Yeasts are also able to ferment α-methylglucopyranoside (methyl α-d-glucopyranoside or αMG), 2The abbreviations used are: αMGα-methylglucopyranoside or methyl α-d-glucopyranosideSGDSaccharomyces Genome DatabaseGH13glycoside hydrolase 13 familyid. toidentical to. an analogue of natural substrates like isomaltose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-glucopyranose). Hawthorne (15Hawthorne D.C. Heredity. 1958; 12: 273-283Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) first studied and highlighted the complex genetic situation conferring yeast with the capacity to ferment this substrate. Later on, ten Berge (16ten Berge A.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Naumov (17Naumov G.I. Bashkrova E.V. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1985; 279: 1496-1499Google Scholar) identified five complementary MGLx genes (MGLa–e) in other genetic lines of Saccharomyces. This genetic complexity was nicely discussed in a previous study (18Han E.K. Cotty F. Sottas C. Jiang H. Michels C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which underlined the difficulty to unravel which of these genes could be associated with transport, cleavage, or regulatory function. From a biochemical view, isomaltase activity was first measured in a commercial yeast maltase preparation (19Hutson D.H. Manners D.J. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thereafter, an α-methylglucosidase was purified, showing activity on both αMG and isomaltose (20Khan N.A. Eaton N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 146: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Khan and Haynes showed that the products of the MGL1 and MGL3 genes have the same phenotypic function, molecular weight, and substrate specificity (isomaltose and αMG), but differ with respect to their specific activity and Michaelis constant (21Khan N.A. Haynes R.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 118: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently, the group of Tabata associated this isomaltase activity with the product of YGR287c and showed that Val-216 in the catalytic site is an important residue to discriminate the α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of substrates (1Yamamoto K. Nakayama A. Yamamoto Y. Tabata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3414-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The in vivo function of YGR287c gene, as well as the function of other homologous ORFs encoding putative glucosidases in the S. cerevisiae genome has not been investigated yet. Our results showed that yeast is endowed with the presence of five genes encoding four distinct isomaltases, all located in the subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes. We report here a complete functional genomic analysis of these five genes, including their respective role in isomaltose and αMG assimilation, their regulation by carbon sources, and their substrate specificities. We have renamed these genes IMAx (IMA1 through IMA5) for IsoMAltase.DISCUSSIONAfter the release of the complete S. cerevisiae genome in 1996 (44Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 563-567Crossref Scopus (3208) Google Scholar), there were still in 2007 over 1000 uncharacterized yeast genes (45Peña-Castillo L. Hughes T.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For years, the fermentation of α-methylglucopyranoside or isomaltose has been genetically attributed to several unlinked MGLx genes (15Hawthorne D.C. Heredity. 1958; 12: 273-283Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16ten Berge A.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Naumov G.I. Bashkrova E.V. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1985; 279: 1496-1499Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidences that these MGLx genes correspond to a new multigene family that is composed of five members, YGR287c, YIL172c, YJL216c, YJL221c/FSP2, and YOL157c. They are all located in the subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes, as is the case for the SUCx, MALx, and MELx gene families involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources (46Pryde F.E. Gorham H.C. Louis E.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As was particularly well illustrated for the large PAUx (47Luo Z. van Vuuren H.J. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 4036-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), DUPx (48Despons L. Wirth B. Louis V.L. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 10-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), or HXTx (5Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) multigene families, this chromosomal localization clearly provides an adaptive advantage to the cells in terms of easier functional diversification through faster gene duplications and specialization (2Brown C.A. Murray A.W. Verstrepen K.J. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 49Brown C.J. Todd K.M. Rosenzweig R.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 50Codón A.C. Benítez T. Korhola M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 51Fabre E. Muller H. Therizols P. Lafontaine I. Dujon B. Fairhead C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 856-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Relative to these five genes from S. cerevisiae, only one ORF, YGR287c, was previously reported to encode for a protein with α-1,6-glucosidase activity (1Yamamoto K. Nakayama A. Yamamoto Y. Tabata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3414-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The other four were only assigned to putative α-glucosidases in the SGD. Although these five genes present very high pairwise identity scores within the family, they share less than 75% sequence identity with MALx2 genes. This divergence was further verified in this work at the functional level: biochemical data indeed showed that these genes code for α-glucosidases, which preferentially act on isomaltose. We therefore renamed these genes IMA1–IMA5 for IsoMAltase genes.The first clues toward understanding the structure-function relationship of α-glucosidases were recently provided by the group of Tabata (1Yamamoto K. Nakayama A. Yamamoto Y. Tabata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3414-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). While studying YGR287c, these authors demonstrated that Val-216 from the consensus region II, which is one of the four regions conserved in GH13 family proteins, is an important residue discriminating the α-1,4- and 1,6-glucosidic linkages of substrates. This result suggested that this new protein family from S. cerevisiae exhibits an isomaltase activity. This hypothesis was validated in this work through constitutive expression of each of the five IMAx open reading frames, but the significant differences of activity between the five proteins pointed out large efficacy disparities in hydrolyzing the α-1,6-glucoside substrates. Under the standard conditions of the in vitro assay, we nevertheless observed a cross-reactivity on α-1,4-linkages for some of these proteins. This functional diversity may therefore rely on some of the few amino acid residues that differentiate these highly similar proteins. The consensus III sequence is the only one that shows some variability between the five Imax proteins. Whether this consensus brings differences in hydrolysis efficiencies and substrate specificities of the proteins awaits further work.The fact that overexpression of any one of the five IMAx genes restored growth on isomaltose in the ima1Δ mutant, further provided functional evidence that these five genes encode isomaltase. Our results nevertheless allowed understanding of the absence of functional redundancy within this new gene family for growth on isomaltose, which was illustrated by the fact that the single deletion of IMA1 totally abolished growth on this carbon source, as well as on αMG. Because these α-glucosidase enzymes are likely to be intracellular like maltase, in contrast to other extracellular systems such as the invertase (52Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) or the Ath1p trehalase (53He S. Bystricky K. Leon S. François J.M. Parrou J.L. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5432-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), transport systems are required for α-glucoside uptake. Han and co-workers reported that the AGT1 gene encodes an α-glucoside permease with broad substrate specificity, including isomaltose and αMG (18Han E.K. Cotty F. Sottas C. Jiang H. Michels C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We confirmed in this work that Agt1p is essential for growth on isomaltose. This implied that the two other α-glucoside transporters also present in the CEN.PK strain, MPH2 and MPH3 (33Vidgren V. Ruohonen L. Londesborough J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7846-7857Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), are probably not expressed. This expression defect may be due to the impossibility to bind the Mal23p transcriptional activator to their promoters (see below), even if these genes have been shown to allow functional complementation when expressed in the W303 strain transformed with a plasmid expressing the Mal63p transcriptional activator (32Day R.E. Higgins V.J. Rogers P.J. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Altogether, our results showed that the isomaltose assimilation pathway is dependent on the coupling between the Agt1p active transporter and the major α-1,6-glucosidase protein encoded by IMA1.As for the maltose assimilation pathway, we found that isomaltose assimilation is under the control of the Malx3p transcriptional activator, which is constitutively expressed from the MAL2–8c allele of MAL23 in the CEN.PK strain. This regulatory protein was indeed necessary to induce the transcription of the two essential genes of the pathway, AGT1 (32Day R.E. Higgins V.J. Rogers P.J. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and IMA1 (this study). We nevertheless observed a wide heterogeneity in the transcriptional regulatory patterns of the different members of this new gene family, thus highlighting another level of polymorphism complexity in multigene families. With glucose repression, the only marked, albeit moderate response as compared with MALx genes, was observed for IMA2, which is the only gene harboring a Mig1p-binding site in its promoter. Glucose also acts at the post-translational level by decreasing the activity and stability of enzymes and transporters, including maltose permease, leading to their inactivation and/or degradation (54Holzer H. Revis. Biol. Cell. 1989; 21: 305-319Google Scholar, 55Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Brondijk T.H. van der Rest M.E. Pluim D. de Vries Y. Stingl K. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15352-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 57Jiang H. Medintz I. Zhang B. Michels C.A. J.

However, preliminary results indicated that, like for maltase (56Brondijk T.H. van der Rest M.E. Pluim D. de Vries Y. Stingl K. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15352-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), yeast isomaltase is not the target of catabolite inactivation, because no significant drop of activity was observed after the addition of glucose to yeast cultivated on αMG (not shown). Similarly to glucose repression, transcriptional activation in response to the addition isomaltose (or αMG) could not be generalized to all the members of this gene family. Three of these IMAx genes (IMA2, IMA3, and IMA4) were insensitive to maltose, probably because of the lack of the Malx3p-binding motif in their promoter. Curiously, however, these three genes contain one copy of the Msn2/4p binding site (CCCCT, or STRE motif) together with a well identified TATA box, which were not found in the two maltose-responsive genes IMA1 and IMA5. Only 20% of the yeast genes contain a TATA box, and these TATA box-containing genes are more prevalent in the subtelomeric regions than elsewhere in the genome (59Kellis M. Patterson N. Endrizzi M. Birren B. Lander E.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 60Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), are highly regulated, and are generally associated with responses to stress. Wapinski and co-workers showed that duplicated genes diversify most frequently at the level of regulation and rarely diverge with respect to biochemical function (61Wapinski I. Pfeffer A. Friedman N. Regev A. Nature. 2007; 449: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Altogether, our results supported this view in showing that divergence of nucleotide sequences in the IMAx gene family, both in coding and 5′-uncoding regions, led to interesting variability of expression even if all proteins exhibited isomaltase activity.However, the function of isomaltase still remains enigmatic, especially when expressed under stress conditions, but it might be important under conditions that are not common in laboratory assays. Starch is the major carbohydrate in dough and its partial hydrolysis during malting generates mainly maltose but also a significant amount of isomaltose and a mixture of dextrin, large fragments made up of glucose molecules joined by α-1,4- and α-1,6- linkages (62Dale C.J. J. Inst. Brew. 1991; 97: 187-195Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 63Allosio-Ouarnier N. Quemener B. Bertrand D. Boivin P. J. Inst. Brew. 2000; 106: 45-52Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, this α-1,6-glucosidase activity could be an asset in brewing fermentation for S. cerevisiae strains in agreement with the fact that some yeast strains can assimilate isomaltose from the wort. From a phylogeny viewpoint, we also searched for IMAx orthologs in the genomes of closely related Saccharomyces and in several yeast species, which diverged from Saccharomyces prior to the whole genome duplication. We could not find any orthologs by using the yeast gene order browser (64Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (database issue): D452-D455Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 65Gordon J.L. Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000485Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), probably because the dynamic turnover of these subtelomeric regions breaks down the synteny. However, by using the fungal sequence alignment in SGD, homologous sequences were found in Saccharomyces paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, and S. kudriavzevii. No homologous sequence of the IMAx genes was found in S. castellii, the more distantly related species existing after the whole genome duplication. While searching for homologous genes in the genomes of ancient yeast species that existed before the whole genome duplication (Génolevures-3 consortium, available on-line), we identified 21 genes constituting the GL3C0220 family that includes the 2 MALx and 5 IMAx from S. cerevisiae. This family also contains 5 genes from Saccharomyces kluyveri, 4 from Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, 3 from Kluyveromyces lactis, and 2 from Debaryomyces hansenii. A sound phylogenetic analysis of three gene families linked with maltose metabolism was also very recently reported by Brown and co-workers (2Brown C.A. Murray A.W. Verstrepen K.J. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that the evolutionary rate at which these changes have taken place is exceptional, with wide differences in copy number within different species and even strains. Very interestingly, we found that the Val residue in consensus II, attributed to isomaltase activity, was also present in KLTH0B00308p from K. thermotolerans, and in SAKL0A00154p and SAKL0C00176p from S. kluyveri, raising the possibility of isomaltase expression in these ancient yeasts. Their presence in all these species and polymorphism indicate that these genes may have evolved to give yeast cells advantages in adapting to novel niches (2Brown C.A. Murray A.W. Verstrepen K.J. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 51Fabre E. Muller H. Therizols P. Lafontaine I. Dujon B. Fairhead C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 856-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Growth screening on isomaltose to S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus yeast collections (Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project), will probably be relevant to explore the natural gene diversity and obtain an accurate view of the overall function of this gene family.

The sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 strain contains about 30% of ORFs that belong to multigene families comprising between 3 and over 20 members (3Blandin G. Durrens P. Tekaia F. Aigle M.

FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose expression is dependent on growth conditions, sugar availability, or stress (6Greatrix B.W. van Vuuren H.J. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Rintala E. Wiebe M.G. Tamminen A. Ruohonen L. Penttilä M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The assimilation of sucrose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-fructofuranose), maltose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-d-glucopyranose), melibiose (α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-glucopyranose), and starch is also dependent on the expression of SUCx, MALx, MELx, and STAx multigene families, respectively. These families are not always present in all Saccharomyces species, as for instance in the laboratory strain BY4741, derived from S288c, which does not hydrolyze starch, because STAx genes are absent (8Tamaki H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 205-209Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This strain also harbors only the SUC2 encoding invertase, whereas SUCx genes belong to a multigene family encompassing six unlinked loci (SUC1 through SUC5 and SUC7) (9Carlson M. Botstein D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The overall organization of the MALx gene family appears to be similar to that of the SUCx gene family. However each of the five MAL loci (MAL1 through MAL4 and MAL6) is a complex locus, which includes three genes that are all required for maltose utilization (10Needleman R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MALx1 encodes the permease (11Cheng Q. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MALx2, the maltase (12Dubin R.A. Needleman R.B. Gossett D. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 605-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MALx3, the Malx3p-transactivator required for the expression of the two previous genes (13Chang Y.S. Dubin R.A. Perkins E. Forrest D. Michels C.A. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1988; 14: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MAL loci are also located in the subtelomeric regions (14Charron M.J. Read E. Haut S.R. Michels C.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Yeasts are also able to ferment α-methylglucopyranoside (methyl α-d-glucopyranoside or αMG), 2The abbreviations used are: αMGα-methylglucopyranoside or methyl α-d-glucopyranosideSGDSaccharomyces Genome DatabaseGH13glycoside hydrolase 13 familyid. toidentical to. an analogue of natural substrates like isomaltose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-glucopyranose). Hawthorne (15Hawthorne D.C. Heredity. 1958; 12: 273-283Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) first studied and highlighted the complex genetic situation conferring yeast with the capacity to ferment this substrate. Later on, ten Berge (16ten Berge A.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Naumov (17Naumov G.I. Bashkrova E.V. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1985; 279: 1496-1499Google Scholar) identified five complementary MGLx genes (MGLa–e) in other genetic lines of Saccharomyces. This genetic complexity was nicely discussed in a previous study (18Han E.K. Cotty F. Sottas C. Jiang H. Michels C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which underlined the difficulty to unravel which of these genes could be associated with transport, cleavage, or regulatory function. From a biochemical view, isomaltase activity was first measured in a commercial yeast maltase preparation (19Hutson D.H. Manners D.J. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thereafter, an α-methylglucosidase was purified, showing activity on both αMG and isomaltose (20Khan N.A. Eaton N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 146: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Khan and Haynes showed that the products of the MGL1 and MGL3 genes have the same phenotypic function, molecular weight, and substrate specificity (isomaltose and αMG), but differ with respect to their specific activity and Michaelis constant (21Khan N.A. Haynes R.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 118: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently, the group of Tabata associated this isomaltase activity with the product of YGR287c and showed that Val-216 in the catalytic site is an important residue to discriminate the α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of substrates (1Yamamoto K. Nakayama A. Yamamoto Y. Tabata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3414-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The in vivo function of YGR287c gene, as well as the function of other homologous ORFs encoding putative glucosidases in the S. cerevisiae genome has not been investigated yet. Our results showed that yeast is endowed with the presence of five genes encoding four distinct isomaltases, all located in the subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes. We report here a complete functional genomic analysis of these five genes, including their respective role in isomaltose and αMG assimilation, their regulation by carbon sources, and their substrate specificities. We have renamed these genes IMAx (IMA1 through IMA5) for IsoMAltase."
https://openalex.org/W2168238670,"Background PB1-F2 is a proapoptotic influenza A virus protein of approximately 90 amino acids in length that is located in the nucleus, cytosol and in the mitochondria membrane of infected cells. Previous studies indicated that the molecule destabilizes planar lipid bilayers and has a strong inherent tendency for multimerization. This may be correlate with its capacity to induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we investigated whether PB1-F2 is able to form ion channels within planar lipid bilayers and microsomes. For that purpose, a set of biologically active synthetic versions of PB1-F2 (sPB1-F2) derived from the IAV isolates A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (IAVPR8), from A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1) (IAVSF2) or the H5N1 consensus sequence (IAVBF2) were used. Electrical and fluorimetric measurements show that all three peptides generate in planar lipid bilayers or in liposomes, respectively, a barely selective conductance that is associated with stochastic channel type fluctuations between a closed state and at least two defined open states. Unitary channel fluctuations were also generated when a truncated protein comprising only the 37 c-terminal amino acids of sPB1-F2 was reconstituted in bilayers. Experiments were complemented by extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the truncated fragment in a lipid bilayer. The results indicate that the c-terminal region exhibits a slightly bent helical fold, which is stable and remains embedded in the bilayer for over 180 ns. Conclusion/Significance The data support the idea that PB1-F2 is able to form protein channel pores with no appreciable selectivity in membranes and that the c-terminus is important for this function. This information could be important for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2026757366,"Sensorimotor cortex has a role in procedural learning. Previous studies suggested that this learning is subserved by long-term potentiation (LTP), which is in turn maintained by the persistently active kinase, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMζ). Whereas the role of PKMζ in animal models of declarative knowledge is established, its effect on procedural knowledge is not well understood. Here we show that PKMζ inhibition, via injection of zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into the rat sensorimotor cortex, disrupts sensorimotor memories for a skilled reaching task even after several weeks of training. The rate of relearning the task after the memory disruption by ZIP was indistinguishable from the rate of initial learning, suggesting no significant savings after the memory loss. These results indicate a shared molecular mechanism of storage for declarative and procedural forms of memory."
https://openalex.org/W2136928104,"Background Honey bees are complex eusocial insects that provide a critical contribution to human agricultural food production. Their natural migration has selected for traits that increase fitness within geographical areas, but in parallel their domestication has selected for traits that enhance productivity and survival under local conditions. Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of these local adaptive processes is a key goal of evolutionary biology. Proteomics provides tools unique among the major ‘omics disciplines for identifying the mechanisms employed by an organism in adapting to environmental challenges. Results Through proteome profiling of adult honey bee midgut from geographically dispersed, domesticated populations combined with multiple parallel statistical treatments, the data presented here suggest some of the major cellular processes involved in adapting to different climates. These findings provide insight into the molecular underpinnings that may confer an advantage to honey bee populations. Significantly, the major energy-producing pathways of the mitochondria, the organelle most closely involved in heat production, were consistently higher in bees that had adapted to colder climates. In opposition, up-regulation of protein metabolism capacity, from biosynthesis to degradation, had been selected for in bees from warmer climates. Conclusions Overall, our results present a proteomic interpretation of expression polymorphisms between honey bee ecotypes and provide insight into molecular aspects of local adaptation or selection with consequences for honey bee management and breeding. The implications of our findings extend beyond apiculture as they underscore the need to consider the interdependence of animal populations and their agro-ecological context."
https://openalex.org/W2013854283,"The family of trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) comprises 9 mammalian TAAR subtypes, with intact gene and pseudogene numbers differing considerably even between closely related species. To date the best characterized subtype is TAAR1, which activates the G(s) protein/adenylyl cyclase pathway upon stimulation by trace amines and psychoactive substances like MDMA or LSD. Recently, chemosensory function involving recognition of volatile amines was proposed for murine TAAR3, TAAR4 and TAAR5. Humans can smell volatile amines despite carrying open reading frame (ORF) disruptions in TAAR3 and TAAR4. Therefore, we set out to study the functional and structural evolution of these genes with a special focus on primates. Functional analyses showed that ligands activating the murine TAAR3, TAAR4 and TAAR5 do not activate intact primate and mammalian orthologs, although they evolve under purifying selection and hence must be functional. We also find little evidence for positive selection that could explain the functional differences between mouse and other mammals. Our findings rather suggest that the previously identified volatile amine TAAR3-5 agonists reflect the high agonist promiscuity of TAAR, and that the ligands driving purifying selection of these TAAR in mouse and other mammals still await discovery. More generally, our study points out how analyses in an evolutionary context can help to interpret functional data generated in single species."
https://openalex.org/W2070384108,"We have studied the motor abilities and associative learning capabilities of adult mice placed in different enriched environments. Three-month-old animals were maintained for a month alone (AL), alone in a physically enriched environment (PHY), and, finally, in groups in the absence (SO) or presence (SOPHY) of an enriched environment. The animals' capabilities were subsequently checked in the rotarod test, and for classical and instrumental learning. The PHY and SOPHY groups presented better performances in the rotarod test and in the acquisition of the instrumental learning task. In contrast, no significant differences between groups were observed for classical eyeblink conditioning. The four groups presented similar increases in the strength of field EPSPs (fEPSPs) evoked at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse across classical conditioning sessions, with no significant differences between groups. These trained animals were pulse-injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to determine hippocampal neurogenesis. No significant differences were found in the number of NeuN/BrdU double-labeled neurons. We repeated the same BrdU study in one-month-old mice raised for an additional month in the above-mentioned four different environments. These animals were not submitted to rotarod or conditioned tests. Non-trained PHY and SOPHY groups presented more neurogenesis than the other two groups. Thus, neurogenesis seems to be related to physical enrichment at early ages, but not to learning acquisition in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2076102986,"The phenotype of large diameter sensory afferent neurons changes in several models of neuropathic pain. We asked if similar changes also occur in ""functional"" pain syndromes.Acidic saline (AS, pH 4.0) injections into the masseter muscle were used to induce persistent myalgia. Controls received saline at pH 7.2. Nocifensive responses of Experimental rats to applications of Von Frey Filaments to the masseters were above control levels 1-38 days post-injection. This effect was bilateral. Expression of c-Fos in the Trigeminal Mesencephalic Nucleus (NVmes), which contains the somata of masseter muscle spindle afferents (MSA), was above baseline levels 1 and 4 days after AS. The resting membrane potentials of neurons exposed to AS (n = 167) were hyperpolarized when compared to their control counterparts (n = 141), as were their thresholds for firing, high frequency membrane oscillations (HFMO), bursting, inward and outward rectification. The amplitude of HFMO was increased and spontaneous ectopic firing occurred in 10% of acid-exposed neurons, but never in Controls. These changes appeared within the same time frame as the observed nocifensive behaviour. Ectopic action potentials can travel centrally, but also antidromically to the peripheral terminals of MSA where they could cause neurotransmitter release and activation of adjacent fibre terminals. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that annulospiral endings of masseter MSA express the glutamate vesicular transporter VGLUT1, indicating that they can release glutamate. Many capsules also contained fine fibers that were labelled by markers associated with nociceptors (calcitonin gene-related peptide, Substance P, P2X3 receptors and TRPV1 receptors) and that expressed the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5. Antagonists of glutamatergic receptors given together with the 2(nd) injection of AS prevented the hypersensitivity observed bilaterally but were ineffective if given contralaterally.Low pH leads to changes in several electrical properties of MSA, including initiation of ectopic action potentials which could propagate centrally but could also invade the peripheral endings causing glutamate release and activation of nearby nociceptors within the spindle capsule. This peripheral drive could contribute both to the transition to, and maintenance of, persistent muscle pain as seen in some ""functional"" pain syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W1969331430,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) has been shown to decrease clinical malaria by approximately 30% in the first year of life and is a promising malaria control strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa which can be delivered alongside the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). To date, there have been limited data on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy using sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) and no published data on cost-effectiveness using other antimalarials. Methods We analysed data from 5 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using a total of 5 different IPTi drug regimens; SP, mefloquine (MQ), 3 days of chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD), SP plus 3 days of artesunate (SP-AS3) and 3 days of amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ3-AS3).The cost per malaria episode averted and cost per Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) averted were modeled using both trial specific protective efficacy (PE) for all IPTi drugs and a pooled PE for IPTi with SP, malaria incidence, an estimated malaria case fatality rate of 1.57%, IPTi delivery costs and country specific provider and household malaria treatment costs. Findings In sites where IPTi had a significant effect on reducing malaria, the cost per episode averted for IPTi-SP was very low, USD 1.36–4.03 based on trial specific data and USD 0.68–2.27 based on the pooled analysis. For IPTi using alternative antimalarials, the lowest cost per case averted was for AQ3-AS3 in western Kenya (USD 4.62) and the highest was for MQ in Korowge, Tanzania (USD 18.56). Where efficacious, based only on intervention costs, IPTi was shown to be cost effective in all the sites and highly cost-effective in all but one of the sites, ranging from USD 2.90 (Ifakara, Tanzania with SP) to USD 39.63 (Korogwe, Tanzania with MQ) per DALY averted. In addition, IPTi reduced health system costs and showed significant savings to households from malaria cases averted. A threshold analysis showed that there is room for the IPTi-efficacy to fall and still remain highly cost effective in all sites where IPTi had a statistically significant effect on clinical malaria. Conclusions IPTi delivered alongside the EPI is a highly cost effective intervention against clinical malaria with a range of drugs in a range of malaria transmission settings. Where IPTi did not have a statistically significant impact on malaria, generally in low transmission sites, it was not cost effective."
https://openalex.org/W1978374163,"Recent evidence supports a role of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) in redox-controlled remodeling of the exofacial domains of α(IIb)β(3) in blood platelets. The aim of this study was to explain whether Ero1α can be responsible for extracellular reoxidation of the PDI active site. We showed that Ero1α can be found on platelets and is rapidly recruited to the cell surface in response to platelet agonists. It is physically associated with PDI and α(IIb)β(3), as suggested by colocalization analysis in confocal microscopy and confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. Apart from monomeric oxidized Ero1α, anti-α(IIb)β(3) immunoprecipitates showed the presence of several Ero1α-positive bands that corresponded to the complexes α(IIb)β(3)-PDI-Ero1α, PDI-Ero1α, and Ero1α-Ero1α dimers. It binds more efficiently to the activated α(IIb)β(3) conformer, and its interaction is inhibited by RGD peptides. Ero1α appears to be involved in the regulation of α(IIb)β(3) receptor activity because of the following: (a) blocking the cell surface Ero1α by antibodies leads to a decrease in platelet aggregation in response to agonists and a decrease in fibrinogen and PAC-1 binding, and (b) transfection of MEG01 with Ero1α increases α(IIb)β(3) receptor activity, as indicated by increased binding of fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W2065533760,"The development of a topical microbicide blocking the sexual transmission of HIV-1 is urgently needed to control the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The actinomycete-derived lectin actinohivin (AH) is highly specific to a cluster of high-mannose-type glycans uniquely found on the viral envelope (Env). Here, we evaluated AH's candidacy toward a microbicide in terms of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity, potential side effects, and recombinant producibility. Two validated assay systems based on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (hPBMC) infection with primary isolates and TZM-bl cell infection with Env-pseudotyped viruses were employed to characterize AH's anti-HIV-1 activity. In hPMBCs, AH exhibited nanomolar neutralizing activity against primary viruses with diverse cellular tropisms, but did not cause mitogenicity or cytotoxicity that are often associated with other anti-HIV lectins. In the TZM-bl-based assay, AH showed broad anti-HIV-1 activity against clinically-relevant, mucosally transmitting strains of clades B and C. By contrast, clade A viruses showed strong resistance to AH. Correlation analysis suggested that HIV-1′s AH susceptibility is significantly linked to the N-glycans at the Env C2 and V4 regions. For recombinant (r)AH expression, we evaluated a tobacco mosaic virus-based system in Nicotiana benthamiana plants as a means to facilitate molecular engineering and cost-effective mass production. Biochemical analysis and an Env-mediated syncytium formation assay demonstrated high-level expression of functional rAH within six days. Taken together, our study revealed AH's cross-clade anti-HIV-1 activity, apparent lack of side effects common to lectins, and robust producibility using plant biotechnology. These findings justify further efforts to develop rAH toward a candidate HIV-1 microbicide."

Transgenic mice that have podocyte-specific overexpression of sdk-1 develop gradually progressive heavy proteinuria and severe FSGS. We also show that sdk-1 associates with the slit diaphragm linker protein MAGI-1, which is already known to interact with several critical podocyte proteins including synaptopodin, α-actinin-4, nephrin, JAM4, and β-catenin. This interaction is mediated through a direct interaction between the carboxyl terminus of sdk-1 and specific PDZ domains of MAGI-1.

Eggers P. Kopp J.B. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2004; 44: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In fact, the frequency of this disease has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, making it the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in adults (1Kitiyakara C. Eggers P. Kopp J.B. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2004; 44: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Multiple cohort studies show progression to end-stage renal disease in 50–70% of cases at 10 years, giving FSGS one of the worst prognoses among primary glomerular diseases (2Rydel J.J. Korbet S.M. Borok R.Z. Schwartz M.M. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 534-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 3Korbet S.M. Schwartz M.M. Lewis E.J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1994; 23: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).The diagnosis of FSGS is based on the clinical findings of proteinuria and specific histopathological changes that include glomerular sclerosis, glomerular tuft collapse, and synechia formation. In the early stages, these changes are both focal, affecting a subset of glomeruli, and segmental, involving a portion of the glomerular tuft. Although the idiopathic form of FSGS is the most common, secondary FSGS occurs in association with other underlying conditions including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), among others.Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease are poorly understood, the podocyte, the visceral epithelial cell of the glomerulus, plays a central role. Multiple genetic studies using both human and murine models demonstrate that the development of FSGS is initiated by podocyte dysfunction (4Pollak M.R. Semin.

In the current work, we first demonstrate that sdk-1 up-regulation in podocytes also occurs in idiopathic FSGS. We then validate the physiological relevance of this up-regulation by generating novel transgenic mice that develop severe FSGS when sdk-1 is expressed specifically in podocytes. Next, we begin to dissect the mechanisms by which sdk-1 up-regulation contributes to disease. We show that sdk-1 directly interacts with the podocyte linker protein MAGI-1 and that this interaction is necessary for sdk-1 overexpression to induce podocyte dysfunction. MAGUK with inverted domain structure-1 (MAGI-1) is localized specifically at the slit diaphragm in podocytes and is composed of one guanylate kinase, two WW domains, and six PDZ domains (18Dobrosotskaya I.

We conclude that the up-regulation of sdk-1 in podocytes is an important pathogenic factor in the development of FSGS and that the mechanism involves alterations in the actin cytoskeleton possibly mediated by changes in MAGI-1 scaffolding.DISCUSSIONIn the current work, we have identified a novel mouse model of chronic FSGS mediated by a unique cellular mechanism that is relevant to human disease. De novo expression of sdk-1 in podocytes was sufficient to induce slowly progressive glomerulosclerosis in transgenic mice. Affected animals develop relatively late onset proteinuria, without renal failure, that does not begin until well into adulthood and then progresses over many months. This is in stark contrast to existing models of FSGS that typically involve early onset proteinuria with rapid progression to kidney failure and death. These rapidly progressive FSGS models include knock-out models (CD2AP (27Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S.

Overexpression of sdk-1 in podocytes also induced changes that are typical for the collapsing variant of FSGS including podocyte hyperplasia, hypertrophy, pseudocrescent formation, and expression of the cell cycle marker Ki-67. Several other mouse models of collapsing glomerulopathy have been described including: α-actinin-4 knock-in and knock-out models (34Henderson J.M. Al-Waheeb S. Weins A. Dandapani S.V. Pollak M.R.

Again, these other FSGS models are characterized by relatively rapid disease progression. The late onset and more gradual disease progression evident in the sdk-1 transgenic model are more consistent with the usual clinical course of human FSGS patients. We propose our model to be one of the first genetic models of chronic, slowly progressive FSGS.We do note significant differences in the relative amounts of observed glomerulosclerosis between animals and some differences in age of onset of proteinuria and rapidity of progression; this is likely explained by observed differences in expression levels of sdk-1 both between animals and even in different glomeruli within a given animal. The reason for these differences is uncertain but seems to be related to variable expression of cre recombinase between glomeruli.To investigate the mechanisms by which sdk-1 up-regulation in the podocyte contributes to FSGS pathogenesis, we began to investigate how sdk-1 interacts with other important podocyte proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of sdk-1 and sdk-2 contain no clear signaling domains other than a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding domain. In fact, the six terminal amino acids (GFSSFV) are completely conserved in all sidekicks in all available species from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, suggesting that binding to this conserved domain is critical to sidekick function. In this way, we identified the slit diaphragm linker protein MAGI-1 as binding specifically to this conserved motif.The MAGI proteins, with their multiple protein-protein interacting domains, have a large number of known binding partners. In podocytes, for example, MAGI-1 is known to interact with synaptopodin via its WW domain (21Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Welihinda A. Mundel P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30183-30190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with α-actinin-4 via PDZ domain 5 (21Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Welihinda A. Mundel P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30183-30190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with nephrin via PDZ domains 2 and 3 (22Hirabayashi S. Mori H. Kansaku A. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Shimizu F. Kawachi H. Hata Y. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar),with JAM4 via PDZ domains 1 and 4 (20Hirabayashi S. Tajima M. Yao I. Nishimura W. Mori H. Hata Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4267-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and with β-catenin via PDZ domain 5 (38Dobrosotskaya I.Y. James G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Presumably, MAGI-1 functions to stabilize and organize this complex of proteins at the slit diaphragm and to link them to the actin cytoskeleton. Because the phenotype of MAGI-1 null mice has not yet been reported, the importance of MAGI-1 as a stabilizing or signaling molecule in the podocyte has not been fully established. Furthermore, at this time, no human familial nephrotic syndrome cases have been linked to mutations in MAGI-1.In this work, we show that the interaction between sdk-1 and MAGI-1 is promiscuous in that three different PDZ domains of MAGI-1 are each capable of binding to the PDZ binding domain of sdk-1. Expression of sdk-1 was also able to change the subcellular localization of MAGI-1 by inducing dramatic recruitment to the cell membrane. Furthermore, a truncated version of sdk-1 that lacks its terminal four amino acids is unable to interact with MAGI-1 and does not induce podocyte dysfunction when overexpressed. These data imply, but do not definitively prove, that the interaction between the two proteins is important for induction of disease. It is possible that sdk-1 interacts with other molecules besides MAGI-1 and that these other interactions are also important in inducing podocyte dysfunction. Ongoing work is focused on clarifying these possibilities.The interaction between sdk-1 and MAGI-1 may also be important to the process of neuronal synapse formation. In brain development, both proteins are highly expressed specifically at neurological synapses, and both affect the processes of synaptic connectivity and neuronal migration (13Yamagata M. Weiner J.A. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2002; 110: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Yamagata M. Sanes J.R.

These findings suggest that the up-regulation of sdk-1 by podocytes in FSGS is a maladaptive response to injury that is independently capable of leading to progressive podocyte dysfunction and ultimately to glomerular sclerosis.

Eggers P. Kopp J.B. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2004; 44: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In fact, the frequency of this disease has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, making it the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in adults (1Kitiyakara C. Eggers P. Kopp J.B. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2004; 44: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Multiple cohort studies show progression to end-stage renal disease in 50–70% of cases at 10 years, giving FSGS one of the worst prognoses among primary glomerular diseases (2Rydel J.J. Korbet S.M. Borok R.Z. Schwartz M.M. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 534-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 3Korbet S.M. Schwartz M.M. Lewis E.J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1994; 23: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).The diagnosis of FSGS is based on the clinical findings of proteinuria and specific histopathological changes that include glomerular sclerosis, glomerular tuft collapse, and synechia formation. In the early stages, these changes are both focal, affecting a subset of glomeruli, and segmental, involving a portion of the glomerular tuft. Although the idiopathic form of FSGS is the most common, secondary FSGS occurs in association with other underlying conditions including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), among others.Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease are poorly understood, the podocyte, the visceral epithelial cell of the glomerulus, plays a central role. Multiple genetic studies using both human and murine models demonstrate that the development of FSGS is initiated by podocyte dysfunction (4Pollak M.R. Semin.

https://openalex.org/W1988632220,"Background Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a major complication for lupus patients, which often leads to cognitive disturbances and memory loss and contributes to a significant patient morbidity and mortality. The presence of anti-neuronal autoantibodies (aAbs) has been identified; as examples, anti-NMDA receptors and anti-Ribsomal P aAbs have been linked to certain pathophysiological features of NPSLE. Methods and Findings In the current study, we used a proteomic approach to identify an intermediate neurofilament alpha-internexin (INA) as a pathogenetically relevant autoantigen in NPSLE. The significance of this finding was then validated in an expanded of a cohort of NPSLE patients (n = 67) and controls (n = 270) by demonstrating that high titers of anti-INA aAb was found in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ∼50% NPSLE. Subsequently, a murine model was developed by INA immunization that resulted in pronounced cognitive dysfunction that mimicked features of NPSLE. Histopathology in affected animals displayed cortical and hippocampal neuron apoptosis. In vitro studies further demonstrated that anti-INA Ab mediated neuronal damage via inhibiting axonal elongation and eventually driving the cells to apoptosis. Conclusions Taken together, this study identified a novel anti-neurofilament aAb in NPSLE, and established a hitherto undescribed mechanism of aAb-mediated neuron damage that could have relevance to the pathophysiology of NPSLE."
https://openalex.org/W2121507081,"The hearing of tetrapods including humans is enhanced by an active process that amplifies the mechanical inputs associated with sound, sharpens frequency selectivity, and compresses the range of responsiveness. The most striking manifestation of the active process is spontaneous otoacoustic emission, the unprovoked emergence of sound from an ear. Hair cells, the sensory receptors of the inner ear, are known to provide the energy for such emissions; it is unclear, though, how ensembles of such cells collude to power observable emissions.We have measured and modeled spontaneous otoacoustic emissions from the ear of the tokay gecko, a convenient experimental subject that produces robust emissions. Using a van der Pol formulation to represent each cluster of hair cells within a tonotopic array, we have examined the factors that influence the cooperative interaction between oscillators.A model that includes viscous interactions between adjacent hair cells fails to produce emissions similar to those observed experimentally. In contrast, elastic coupling yields realistic results, especially if the oscillators near the ends of the array are weakened so as to minimize boundary effects. Introducing stochastic irregularity in the strength of oscillators stabilizes peaks in the spectrum of modeled emissions, further increasing the similarity to the responses of actual ears. Finally, and again in agreement with experimental findings, the inclusion of a pure-tone external stimulus repels the spectral peaks of spontaneous emissions. Our results suggest that elastic coupling between oscillators of slightly differing strength explains several properties of the spontaneous otoacoustic emissions in the gecko."
https://openalex.org/W1988446380,"Background While protease-activated-receptor 1 (PAR1) plays a central role in tumor progression, little is known about the cell signaling involved. Methodology/Principal Findings We show here the impact of PAR1 cellular activities using both an orthotopic mouse mammary xenograft and a colorectal-liver metastasis model in vivo, with biochemical analyses in vitro. Large and highly vascularized tumors were generated by cells over-expressing wt hPar1, Y397Z hPar1, with persistent signaling, or Y381A hPar1 mutant constructs. In contrast, cells over-expressing the truncated form of hPar1, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, developed small or no tumors, similar to cells expressing empty vector or control untreated cells. Antibody array membranes revealed essential hPar1 partners including Etk/Bmx and Shc. PAR1 activation induces Etk/Bmx and Shc binding to the receptor C-tail to form a complex. Y/A mutations in the PAR1 C-tail did not prevent Shc-PAR1 association, but enhanced the number of liver metastases compared with the already increased metastases obtained with wt hPar1. We found that Etk/Bmx first binds via the PH domain to a region of seven residues, located between C378-S384 in PAR1 C-tail, enabling subsequent Shc association. Importantly, expression of the hPar1-7A mutant form (substituted A, residues 378-384), which is incapable of binding Etk/Bmx, resulted in inhibition of invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Similarly, knocking down Etk/Bmx inhibited PAR1-induced MDA-MB-435 cell migration. In addition, intact spheroid morphogenesis of MCF10A cells is markedly disrupted by the ectopic expression of wt hPar1. In contrast, the forced expression of the hPar1-7A mutant results in normal ball-shaped spheroids. Thus, by preventing binding of Etk/Bmx to PAR1 -C-tail, hPar1 oncogenic properties are abrogated. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration that a cytoplasmic portion of the PAR1 C-tail functions as a scaffold site. We identify here essential signaling partners, determine the hierarchy of binding and provide a platform for therapeutic vehicles via definition of the critical PAR1-associating region in the breast cancer signaling niche."
https://openalex.org/W1979685705,"We investigated the characteristics of a lambdoid prophage, nicknamed Lula, contaminating E. coli strains from several sources, that allowed it to spread horizontally in the laboratory environment. We found that new Lula infections are inconspicuous; at the same time, Lula lysogens carry unusually high titers of the phage in their cultures, making them extremely infectious. In addition, Lula prophage interferes with P1 phage development and induces its own lytic development in response to P1 infection, turning P1 transduction into an efficient vehicle of Lula spread. Thus, using Lula prophage as a model, we reveal the following principles of survival and reproduction in the laboratory environment: 1) stealth (via laboratory material commensality), 2) stability (via resistance to specific protocols), 3) infectivity (via covert yet aggressive productivity and laboratory protocol hitchhiking). Lula, which turned out to be identical to bacteriophage phi80, also provides an insight into a surprising persistence of T1-like contamination in BAC libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2029196830,"The Spalt-like family of zinc finger transcription factors is conserved throughout evolution and is involved in fundamental processes during development and during embryonic stem cell maintenance. Although human SALL1 is modified by SUMO-1 in vitro, it is not known whether this post-translational modification plays a role in regulating the activity of this family of transcription factors. Here, we show that the Drosophila Spalt transcription factors are modified by sumoylation. This modification influences their nuclear localization and capacity to induce vein formation through the regulation of target genes during wing development. Furthermore, spalt genes interact genetically with the sumoylation machinery to repress vein formation in intervein regions and to attain the wing final size. Our results suggest a new level of regulation of Sall activity in vivo during animal development through post-translational modification by sumoylation. The evolutionary conservation of this family of transcription factors suggests a functional role for sumoylation in vertebrate Sall members."
https://openalex.org/W2047809510,"Streptococcus pyogenes expresses the LPXTG motif-containing cell envelope serine protease SpyCep (also called ScpC, PrtS) that degrades and inactivates the major chemoattractant interleukin 8 (IL-8), thereby impairing host neutrophil recruitment. In this study, we identified a novel function of SpyCep: the ability to mediate uptake into primary human endothelial cells. SpyCep triggered its uptake into endothelial cells but not into human epithelial cells originating from pharynx or lung, indicating an endothelial cell-specific uptake mechanism. SpyCep mediated cellular invasion by an endosomal/lysosomal pathway distinct from the caveolae-mediated invasion pathway of S. pyogenes. Recombinant expression and purification of proteolytically active SpyCep and a series of subfragments allowed functional dissection of the domains responsible for endothelial cell invasion and IL-8 degradation. The N-terminal PR domain was sufficient to mediate endothelial cell invasion, whereas for IL-8-degrading activity, the protease domain and the flanking A domain were required. A polyclonal rabbit serum raised against the recombinant protease efficiently blocked the invasion-mediating activity of SpyCep but not its proteolytic function, further indicating that SpyCep-mediated internalization is independent from its enzymatic activity. SpyCep may thus specifically mediate its own uptake as secreted protein into human endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091108262,"Wnt/Wg genes play a critical role in the development of various organisms. For example, the Wnt/β-catenin signal promotes heart formation and cardiomyocyte differentiation in mice. Previous studies have shown that RGS19 (regulator of G protein signaling 19), which has Gα subunits with GTPase activity, inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signal through inactivation of Gαo. In the present study, the effects of RGS19 on mouse cardiac development were observed. In P19 teratocarcinoma cells with RGS19 overexpression, RGS19 inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation by blocking the Wnt signal. Additionally, several genes targeted by Wnt were down-regulated. For the in vivo study, we generated RGS19-overexpressing transgenic (RGS19 TG) mice. In these transgenic mice, septal defects and thin-walled ventricles were observed during the embryonic phase of development, and the expression of cardiogenesis-related genes, BMP4 and Mef2C, was reduced significantly. RGS19 TG mice showed increased expression levels of brain natriuretic peptide and β-MHC, which are markers of heart failure, increase of cell proliferation, and electrocardiogram analysis shows abnormal ventricle repolarization. These data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that RGS19 influenced cardiac development and had negative effects on heart function.

The mammalian regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) 3The abbreviations used are: RGSregulator of G protein signalingα-MHCα-myosin heavy chaincTnTcardiac troponin TTGtransgenic. family consists of >20 members (1De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). RGS proteins have been grouped into subfamilies (RZ, R4, R7, R12, and RA) based on sequence conservation in the RGS domain (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). RGS proteins possess GTPase functions and interact with GTP-Gα subunits to limit their lifespan and terminate downstream signaling (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 3Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). RGS19, one of the first discovered RGS members, is a small protein with 216 residues (mouse). RGS19 interacts selectively with α subunits of most inhibitory G proteins (Gαi, Gαq) and enhances their GTPase activity (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). regulator of G protein signaling α-myosin heavy chain cardiac troponin T transgenic. Wnt/Wg genes, which are related to the wingless genes in Drosophila, encode a number of secreted proteins that play critical roles in the development of various organisms, via cell fate and patterning (5Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). During early embryogenesis, Wnt signaling is essential for primitive streak formation and mesoderm induction. Later, the Wnt signal is necessary for patterning of the anterior-posterior body plan, trunk/tail development, and specification of posterior mesodermal fates. However, Wnt inhibition is required in head formation (6Kimelman D. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 360-372Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi T.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G-proteins are necessary to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (8Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang Hy Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Gαo and Gαq are required for Wnt-stimulated target gene activation. During the inactivation stage, the GDP-Gα subunit complexes with the Gβ-Gγ dimer. G-proteins activated by the G-protein-coupled receptor are exchanged for GTP by the Gα subunit, and dissociation of the Gβ-Gγ dimer occurs (9Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Both the GTP-Gα subunits and the free Gβ-Gγ dimers activate downstream signaling molecules. In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, cytosolic levels of β-catenin are regulated by a protein complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase 3β, Axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (10Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Within the complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation by the proteasome pathway in unstimulated cells (11Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). In stimulated cells, Wnt binds to the Frizzled (Fz) family receptors and activates an associated downstream component, Dishevelled, which leads to inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, thereby stabilizing β-catenin. Accumulated β-catenin in the cytosol enters the nucleus, thereby leading to the interaction with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor transcription factors and transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Presently, there is contradictory evidence regarding the role of Wnt signaling in heart formation and cardiomyocyte differentiation, depending on the model organism used. In chick and Xenopus, the Wnt/β-catenin signal inhibits cardiac development, because expression of Wnt inhibitors in the tissues adjacent to cardiac mesoderm is necessary for cardiogenesis (12Tzahor E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Schneider V.A. Mercola M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Wnt/β-catenin signal promotes heart formation in Drosophila (14Park M. Wu X. Golden K. Axelrod J.D. Bodmer R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and induces cardiomyocyte differentiation in a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line, P19CL6 (15Nakamura T. Sano M. Songyang Z. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibits cardiogenesis in chick and Xenopus, whereas it enhances cardiogenesis in Drosophila and a mouse teratocarcinoma cell line. In previous study, RGS19 inhibits Gαo subunit activation by the Wnt signal. Expression of RGS19 attenuates Dvl phosphorylation, β-catenin accumulation, and Wnt-responsive gene transcription and blocks Wnt-induced differentiation of mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells by inactivation of Gαo. However, the knockdown of RGS19 expression also suppresses the Wnt signal (16Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the potential mechanisms involved in attenuating Wnt signaling during cardiac muscle differentiation. Transgenic mice that overexpressed RGS19 were produced to elucidate the role of RGS19 mouse cardiac development. Cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro and analysis of cardiac development and ventricle repolarization in mice were performed to examine the roles of RGS19. The murine RGS19 gene was amplified from mouse embryo RNA. An EcoRI, BamHI fragment containing the full length of the mouse RGS19 cDNA was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector driven by the CMV promoter. This expression cassette was prepared by digesting the recombinant vector with DraIII for transfection or microinjection. Plasmid DNA was purified using a midi-prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were grown on 10-cm dishes in α-modified essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin. The subculture was a ratio of 1:10 every 2–3 days and freshly replaced every 3 days. For the Wnt3a treatment experiment, recombinant mouse Wnt3a proteins were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cells (5.0 × 105) were seeded in a culture dish, and Wnt3a protein was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. After 24 h, cells were harvested for RNA extraction. To induce differentiation, cells were seeded in a 1:40 dilution with α-modified essential medium, 10% FBS, and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide into bacterial grade Petri dishes for 4 days, after which the aggregates were plated back gently onto tissue culture dishes in growth media. For each experiment, cardiomyocyte differentiation was verified in the control cultures as spontaneous beating, starting at 9∼10 days. Cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), and a stable cell line was maintained in a medium containing 400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). A day before transfection, 5 × 105 of the P19 cells were plated in 2 ml of the medium/well. For each well, 5 μl of Lipofectamine reagent was mixed with 2 μg of the RGS19 vector in serum-free Opti-MEM® (Invitrogen) to allow the DNA-Lipofectamine reagent complexes to form. The complexes were added to each well and mixed by gently rocking the plate back and forth. After 12 h, the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h in α-modified essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. To establish stable P19 cell lines, cells were selected in a medium containing 800 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I, amplification grade, at a concentration of 1 unit/mg RNA. The first strand of cDNA synthesis was performed using an RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with 1 μg of total RNA. Reverse transcription was performed in the presence of an oligo(dT)-primer with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 60 min. Following 42 °C incubation, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and stored at −20 °C until use. Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan) was used to perform with 32 cycles of PCR (94 °C, 57–64 °C, and 72 °C; all for 30 s). The amount of first strand reaction added to the PCR was titrated for each set of primers (Table 1). Primers were as follows for GAPDH: forward 5′-AATGCATCCTGCACCACCAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTAGCCATATTCATTGTCATA-3′ (cycling profile: 94 °C, 57 °C, and 72 °C all for 30 s and 28 cycles).TABLE 1PCR primers used in RT-PCRGenePrimer sequenceAmplicon sizeBrachyury T (NM_009309)Forward, 5′-tctgacagccagtatgacac-3′; reverse, 5′-atataggaccctacctagca-3′378 bpWnt3a (NM_009522)Forward, 5′-ggcaaggcttcactgaagac-3′; reverse, 5′-aggcaacatctctgaggcat-3′531 bpGATA4 (NM_008092)Forward, 5′-tcctgaagaacaactgggta-3′; reverse, 5′-aagtagacaccctgctcaga-3′329 bpPax3 (NM_008781)Forward, 5′-acctcagtcagatgaaggct-3′; reverse, 5′-agtcccattacctgaggtga-3′591 bpBMP4 (NM_007554)Forward, 5′-aaccgaatgctgatggtcgt-3′; reverse, 5′-acctcattctctgggatgct-3′446 bpMyogenin (NM_031189)Forward, 5′-agcatcacggtggaggatat-3′; reverse, 5′-agaagaggatgctctctgct-3′285 bpMyoD1 (NM_010866)Forward, 5′-tccaactgctctgatggcat-3′; reverse, 5′-tgctgctgcagtcgatctct-3′370 bpα-MHC (NM_010856)Forward, 5′-tgctcgaggagatgcgagat-3′; reverse, 5′-tcttgagctctgagcactca-3′540 bpcTnT (NM_011619)Forward, 5′-tacagactctgatcgaggct-3′; reverse, 5′-ttggtcttcattcaggtggt-3′371 bpMef2C (NM_025282)Forward, 5′-acagcaatcctgtcagcaca-3′; reverse, 5′-actgatggcatcgtgttctt-3′340 bpAxin2 (NM_015732)Forward, 5′-tggacttctggtttgcttgt-3′; reverse, 5′-acgtccactcctcttcttca-3′385 bpDkk1 (NM_010051)Forward, 5′-tggcttgcaggatacagaaa-3′; reverse, 5′-acaggtaagtgccacactga-3′302 bpc-Myc (NM_010849)Forward, 5′-agctgtttgaaggctggatt-3′; reverse, 5′-tctcctccaagtaactcggt-3′387 bpANP (NM_008725)Forward, 5′-aacctgctagaccacctgga-3′; reverse, 5′-aagctgcgtgacacaccaca-3′420 bpBNP (NM_008726)Forward, 5′-aagacaccagtgcacaagct-3′; reverse, 5′-agccaggaggtcttcctaca-3′462 bpβ-MHC (NM_080728)Forward, 5′-tgaccagctgatcaagaaca-3′; reverse, 5′-agcttcttctgcagctgact-3′599 bp Open table in a new tab To detect β-catenin, phospho-β-catenin, phospho-AKT, RGS19 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), and P19 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of Wnt3a for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer. As a loading control, whole-cell lysates were blotted with anti-β-actin antibody. In RGS19 TG mice, β-catenin, phospho-AKT (Abcam) and RGS19 were observed to regulate Wnt signaling. C57BL/6 mice were used as a control. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and cultured with dimethyl sulfoxide for 12 or 15 days. Immunostaining for cardiac troponin T (cTnT), α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibody. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. To detect cTnT, cTnT antibody was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) Also, α-MHC antibody was used (Abcam). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. A diagram illustrating the DNA cassette used to generate TG mice is shown below (see Fig. 4). The murine RGS19 gene was amplified from the mouse embryo RNA by PCR with two pairs of primers encompassing the open reading frame region. The forward primer had an EcoRI site, and the reverse primer has a BamHI site for cloning. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector to generate the pRGS19 construct, which was verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNA for microinjection was purified using the plasmid midi-prep kit (Qiagen). The expression cassette was prepared by digesting the recombinant vector DNA with DraIII. RGS19 transgenic (RGS19 TG) mice were generated using a standard procedure (17Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1986Google Scholar). All mice were raised and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. Genomic DNA was extracted from biopsied offspring tails, and the RGS19 transgene was identified by PCR followed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used were, forward 5′-CGTGTACGGTGGGAGGTCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGTGCAGATGAACTTCAGG-3′. Amplification was carried out with a thermal cycler (Takara Bio) applying the following cycles: 94 °C for 30 s; 57 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products (970 bp) were identified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. We examined isolated hearts from postnatal and 12-week-old mice to check for cell proliferation and apoptosis. For cell proliferation, Ki67 antibody was used to detect the M phase in the cell cycle. A TUNEL assay was used to identify double-stranded DNA fragmentation, and characteristics of DNA degradation by apoptosis. The TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen). Cardiac muscle section were excised from normal and RGS19 TG mice hearts, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 1 day, and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 7-μm sections and mounted onto glass slides. The slides were deparaffinized and incubated in a graded series of alcohol before the staining procedure. The sectioned heart samples were stained with H&E and then examined under a light microscope. Mice were anesthetized with avertin (10 g of tribromoethanol alcohol and 10 ml of tert-amyl alcohol stored at 4 °C as a stock solution). After complete induction of anesthesia, a three-lead electrocardiogram was taken. The leads were placed on the right foreleg, left foreleg, and left hind leg. The data were recorded for analysis using chart and scope software. To reduce tissue damage, the electrode was kept on the tissue for <1 or 2 min and repositioned at approximately the same location when subsequent recordings were necessary. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Groups were compared by analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. After transfection into P19 cells, cells were treated with 800 μg/ml geneticin for selection. Colonies formed after 10 days and were transferred to 96-well plates. Among 150 colonies, five were sorted by genomic PCR (Fig. 1A). One colony was determined to have the highest expression levels and was therefore selected among those sorted. The mRNA expression level of RGS19 in RGS19 overexpression stable cells was highly expressed, compared with the control cell (Fig. 1B). Also, protein of RGS19 was increased (Fig. 1C). A differentiation test on cardiomyocytes was performed using P19 cells. During the early stages of differentiation, expression changes in Brachyury T, a mesoderm early marker, were not visible. After 3 days of differentiation, Wnt3a expression in RGS19-overexpressing cells was not remarkably different than in control cells. However, measurements of GATA4 and BMP4, which are expressed during the middle stages of differentiation and are regulated by Wnt signaling, confirmed that expression was inhibited. Additionally, Pax3 expression was delayed versus the control. During the late stages of differentiation, MyoD1 and Myogenin expression were noticeably decreased (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that RGS19 overexpression inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation. Expression patterns of differentiation-related genes were observed to determine how many cells are involved in heart function and which genes are related to contraction. Specifically, expression levels of the α-MHC and cTnT genes were quantified. We found that α-MHC and cTnT expression was inhibited noticeably (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that contraction was inhibited. For immunocytochemistry, expression of α-MHC and cTnT was detected and confirmed within 12 days, when differentiation was completed. RGS19-overexpressing cells showed decreased cTnT expression levels, compared with the controls (Fig. 2B), and α-MHC expression levels decreased in RGS19-overexpressing cells, compared with the controls (Fig. 2C). Inthe preceding experiment, RGS19 was confirmed to inhibit cardiomyocyte differentiation. We hypothesized that differentiation was blocked due to Wnt signal inhibition by RGS19, consistent with previous reports (16Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with Wnt3a for 24 h, RGS19 should have inhibited Wnt signaling. Inactivation of β-catenin demonstrated that RGS19 overexpression induced phosphorylation of β-catenin Ser33, 37 residues as compared with Wnt3a treatment of control cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of the AKT Thr308 residue, which is the active form, was reduced by RGS19 overexpression as compared with Wnt3a treatment of control cells (Fig. 3A). Expression levels of Wnt downstream signals, such as Dkk1, Axin, and c-Myc, which are regulated by Wnt, were examined. When treated with Wnt3a, Dkk1 and Axin expression levels decreased significantly compared with the control (Fig. 3B; *, p < 0.05, ***, p < 0.001). Additionally, the expression of c-Myc, a transcription factor, also decreased significantly compared with the controls (Fig. 3B; **, p < 0.01). These data suggest that the Wnt signal was blocked during RGS19 inhibition of cardiomyocyte differentiation. To generate RGS19-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice, plasmids for transgene expression throughout the whole body were constructed. The CMV promoter was used to drive expression of the transgene (Fig. 4). The transgene construct was microinjected into mouse embryos. To identify transgenic mice, total genomic DNA was extracted from the biopsied tail of founder candidates, and PCR screening using specific primers was performed. As a result, two mouse lines were confirmed as transgenic (Fig. 4). When each founder mouse was mated with nontransgenic mice, all pups were able to produce offspring, and the transgene was inherited. RGS19 transgenic (RGS19 TG) mice gave birth to 5–8 offspring, compared with the wild-type mice, which produced 9–11 offspring. When the embryonic stage was examined between 13.5 and 16.5 days, it was noted that 10–12 embryos at 13.5 days survived. However, at 16.5 days, only 5–8 embryos were alive. Histological analysis of these RGS19 TG mice revealed abnormal ventricular development, including ventricular septal defect, a thin ventricular wall, and ventricular noncompaction (Fig. 5, A–E). Expression of numerous regulators of cardiogenesis, including BMP4 and Mef2C, were down-regulated in RGS19 TG mice (Fig. 5F; *, p < 0.05). RGS19 TG mice were examined after birth. To determine whether RGS19 TG mice possessed affected cardiac morphology, hearts were stained with H&E during the early postnatal days and in 12-week-old female mice. Some littermates of the RGS19 TG mice died immediately after birth. Severe defects were observed (Fig. 6, C and D), compared with WT mice (Fig. 6A). Some littermates of the RGS19 TG mice survived with only mild defects, such as decreased ventricular wall thickness (Fig. 6B). Expressed Ki67 cells decreased in the RGS19 TG mice as compared with WT mice 0–2 days old. Thus, cell proliferation decreased, but apoptosis did not (data not shown). In 12-week-old female mice, the ventricular wall was thinner in RGS19 TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 7B), as determined by transverse section, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 7A). Based on the cross-sectional area of the left ventricle, cardiomyocyte size decreased in the hearts of RGS19 TG mice (Fig. 7D). These conditioned mice appeared at a level of 23.5% (RGS19 TG offspring 8/34). Inactivation of β-catenin was induced in RGS19 TG mice in contrast to WT mice. Also, phosphorylation of AKT was elevated in RGS19 TG mice as compared with WT mice (Fig. 7E). The numbers of expressed cells of Ki67 increased in the RGS19 TG as compared with WT in 12-week-old mice. Thus, cell proliferation increased (Fig. 7F), but not apoptosis (data not shown). mRNA levels of BNP and β-MHC genes, pathological markers of heart failure, were elevated significantly in RGS19 TG mice (Fig. 7G; *, p < 0.05), but that of atrial natriuretic peptide genes was not. Electrocardiogram analysis was performed to examine heart function. In this experiment, three female mice were used. Electrocardiograms are shown separately (Fig. 8A). The RR, QT, and QRS intervals of transgenic female mice were increased, compared with wild-type female mice (Fig. 8B; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). These data showed that RGS19 affected heart function in TG mice. This study demonstrates that the overexpression of RGS19 by P19 cells inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, the genes regulated by Wnt3a in an RGS19-overexpressing cell line decreased, compared with control cells. Without treatment with Wnt3a, the cell line overexpressing RGS19 showed increased expression of Dkk1 and Axin as compared with controls. Two factors are well known negative regulators in the canonical Wnt pathway (18Jho E.H. Zhang T. Domon C. Joo C.K. Freund J.N. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 19Korol O. Gupta R.W. Mercola M. Dev. Biol. 2008; 324: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the increase in Dkk1 and Axin by overexpression of RGS19 may inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway. Moreover, activation of AKT and β-catenin, well known positive factors, was inhibited. This regulation also blocked the canonical Wnt pathway and inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation. In the case of RGS19 TG mice, morphologic cardiac abnormalities (ventricle wall thinning and ventricle septal defects) were present in the embryo. Expression of genes during cardiogenesis was also down-regulated. Moreover, adult mice demonstrated ventricular wall thinning, alteration of cell proliferation, and abnormal ventricle repolarization. An inactivated form of β-catenin was induced. As discussed earlier, the Wnt/β-catenin signal is important in cardiac development. In the most recent studies, gains and losses of β-catenin function have been analyzed in knock-out or knock-in mouse models. In gain of function models, abnormal phenotypes appear to have enlarged second heart field derivatives, due to enhanced proliferation of the second heart field (20Klaus A. Saga Y. Taketo M.M.

In our results, RGS19 TG mice exhibited ventricular wall thinning and ventricular septal defects, finding similar to those observed in β-catenin deletion mice. Furthermore, β-catenin was reported recently to regulate cardiac hypertrophy (27Qu J. Zhou J. Yi X.P. Dong B. Zheng H. Miller L.M. Wang X. Schneider M.D. Li F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 43: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Baurand A. Zelarayan L. Betney R. Gehrke C. Dunger S. Noack C. Busjahn A. Huelsken J. Taketo M.M. Birchmeier W. Dietz R. Bergmann M.W. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, RGS19 may affect cardiac hypertrophy in TG mice. BMP4, a secretion factor involved in cardiac development, was blocked by RGS19 expression. In the present study, the loss of BMP4 expression resulted in cushion remodeling and ventricular septal defects (29McCulley D.J. Kang J.O. Martin J.F. Black B.L. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results showed that expression of BMP4 decreased during heart development, and the same cardiac development defects were detected in RGS19 TG mice. This suggests that RGS19 regulates the expression of BMP4 and that this regulation affects embryonic cardiac development. In the differentiation method for this study in vitro, P19 cells generally differentiated into cardiomyocytes or skeletal muscle. We examined using methods differentiated into only cardiomyocyte, but not skeletal muscle (30Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is an early stage in cardiomyocyte differentiation of pluripotent P19 cells, as measured by Wnt3a. Wnt/β-catenin signals are essential for in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse P19 cells, a teratocarcinoma-derived pluripotent cell line (15Nakamura T. Sano M. Songyang Z. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Naito A.T. Akazawa H. Takano H. Minamino T. Nagai T. Aburatani H. Komuro I. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Inactivation of β-catenin demonstrated the same in vivo and in vitro expression, but activation of AKT resulted in different patterns environmental and regulatory factors vary between in vivo and in vitro models. In our study, activation of AKT was induced in RGS19 TG mice in contrast to WT mice. In this case, activation of AKT may confirm a role of compensation in heart defects. For example, cardiac hypertrophy research shows that the AKT signal is activated (32Braz J.C. Gill R.M. Corbly A.K. Jones B.D. Jin N. Vlahos C.J. Wu Q. Shen W. Eur. J. Heart Fail. 2009; 11: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Howes A.L. Miyamoto S. Adams J.W. Woodcock E.A. Brown J.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, cardiomyocyte proliferation is detected in hypertrophy. Our results showed that cell proliferation increased when heart defects were detected in 12-week-old mice, suggesting that heart defects resulting from RGS19 overexpression may be compensated by activation of the AKT signal. Thus, our results showed that the activation of AKT was induced in RGS19 TG mice. In RGS19 TG mice constructed using the CMV promoter, a previous study (44Schmidt E.V. Christoph G. Zeller R. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4406-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated various levels of expression in different tissues. This study showed that RGS19 is expressed in the heart. In a subsequent study, because CMV promoter activity and expression levels differ, we checked the expression levels of RGS19 in different cell types and organs and at different developmental stages. In further studies, because the Wnt signal pathway regulates the development and function of various organ systems, we need to search for its effect on other organs. In previous studies, deletion of β-catenin led to changes in osteoblastogenesis and chondrogenesis (34Day T.F. Guo X. Garrett-Beal L. Yang Y. Dev.

In addition to the systems mentioned, Wnt signaling plays a major role in many organs (41Liu F. Thirumangalathu S. Gallant N.M. Yang S.H. Stoick-Cooper C.L. Reddy S.T. Andl T. Taketo M.M.

Moreover, the effects of RGS19 down-regulation or knock-out need to be investigated in the Wnt signal. In summary, RGS19 negatively affects and plays an important role in cardiac development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2088357167,"High rates of esophageal cancer (EC) are found in people of the Henan Taihang Mountain, Fujian Minnan, and Chaoshan regions of China. Historical records describe great waves of populations migrating from north-central China (the Henan and Shanxi Hans) through coastal Fujian Province to the Chaoshan plain. Although these regions are geographically distant, we hypothesized that EC high-risk populations in these three areas could share a common ancestry. Accordingly, we used 16 East Asian-specific Y-chromosome biallelic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; Y-SNPs) and six Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci to infer the origin of the EC high-risk Chaoshan population (CSP) and the genetic relationship between the CSP and the EC high-risk Henan Taihang Mountain population (HTMP) and Fujian population (FJP). The predominant haplogroups in these three populations are O3*, O3e*, and O3e1, with no significant difference between the populations in the frequency of these genotypes. Frequency distribution and principal component analysis revealed that the CSP is closely related to the HTMP and FJP, even though the former is geographically nearer to other populations (Guangfu and Hakka clans). The FJP is between the CSP and HTMP in the principal component plot. The CSP, FJP and HTMP are more closely related to Chinese Hans than to minorities, except Manchu Chinese, and are descendants of Sino-Tibetans, not Baiyues. Correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining tree) all support close genetic relatedness among the CSP, FJP and HTMP. The network for haplogroup O3 (including O3*, O3e* and O3e1) showed that the HTMP have highest STR haplotype diversity, suggesting that the HTMP may be a progenitor population for the CSP and FJP. These findings support the potentially important role of shared ancestry in understanding more about the genetic susceptibility in EC etiology in high-risk populations and have implications for determining the molecular basis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2013106283,"In atrial and nodal cardiac myocytes, M2 muscarinic receptors activate inhibitory G-proteins (G(i/o)), which in turn stimulate G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels through direct binding of the Gbetagamma subunit. Despite also releasing Gbetagamma, G(s)-coupled receptors such as the beta-adrenergic receptor are not able to prominently activate this current. An appealing hypothesis would be if components were sequestered in membrane domains such as caveolae/rafts. Using biochemical fractionation followed by Western blotting and/or radioligand binding experiments, we examined the distribution of the components in stable HEK293 and HL-1 cells, which natively express the transduction cascade. The channel, M2 muscarinic, and A1 adenosine receptors were located in noncaveolar/nonraft fractions. G(i)alpha(1/2) was enriched in both caveolar/raft and noncaveolar/nonraft fractions. In contrast, G(s)alpha was only enriched in caveolar/raft fractions. We constructed YFP-tagged caveolin-2 (YFP-Cav2) and chimeras with the M2 (M2-YFP-Cav2) and A1 (A1-YFP-Cav2) receptors. Analysis of gradient fractions showed that these receptor chimeras were now localized to caveolae-enriched fractions. Microscopy showed that M2-YFP and A1-YFP had a diffuse homogenous membrane signal. YFP-Cav2, M2-YFP-Cav2, and A1-YFP-Cav2 revealed a more punctuate pattern. Finally, we looked at the consequences for signaling. Activation via M2-YFP-Cav2 or A1-YFP-Cav2 revealed substantially slower kinetics compared with M2-YFP or A1-YFP and was reversed by the addition of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Thus the localization of the channel signal transduction cascade in non-cholesterol rich domains substantially enhances the speed of signaling. The presence of G(s)alpha solely in caveolae may account for signaling selectivity between G(i/o) and G(s)-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2020589218,"Visual neglect is an attentional deficit typically resulting from parietal cortex lesion and sometimes frontal lesion. Patients fail to attend to objects and events in the visual hemifield contralateral to their lesion during visual search.The aim of this work was to examine the effects of parietal and frontal lesion in an existing computational model of visual attention and search and simulate visual search behaviour under lesion conditions. We find that unilateral parietal lesion in this model leads to symptoms of visual neglect in simulated search scan paths, including an inhibition of return (IOR) deficit, while frontal lesion leads to milder neglect and to more severe deficits in IOR and perseveration in the scan path. During simulations of search under unilateral parietal lesion, the model's extrastriate ventral stream area exhibits lower activity for stimuli in the neglected hemifield compared to that for stimuli in the normally perceived hemifield. This could represent a computational correlate of differences observed in neuroimaging for unconscious versus conscious perception following parietal lesion.Our results lead to the prediction, supported by effective connectivity evidence, that connections between the dorsal and ventral visual streams may be an important factor in the explanation of perceptual deficits in parietal lesion patients and of conscious perception in general."
https://openalex.org/W2094403955,"Expansion of an unstable GAA*TTC repeat in the first intron of the FXN gene causes Friedreich ataxia by reducing frataxin expression. Structure formation by the repeat has been implicated in both frataxin repression and GAA*TTC instability. The GAA*TTC sequence is capable of adopting multiple non-B DNA structures including Y*R*Y and R*R*Y triplexes. Lower pH promotes the formation of Y*R*Y triplexes by GAA*TTC. Here we used the bacterial transposon Tn7 as an in vitro tool to probe whether GAA*TTC repeats can attract a well-characterized recombinase.Tn7 showed a pH-dependent preference for insertion into uninterrupted regions of a Friedreich ataxia patient-derived repeat, inserting 48, 39 and 14 percent of the time at pH 7, pH 8 and pH 9, respectively. Moreover, Tn7 also showed orientation and region specific insertion within the repeat at pH 7 and pH 8, but not at pH 9. In contrast, transposon Tn5 showed no strong preference for or against the repeat during in vitro transposition at any pH tested. Y*R*Y triplex formation was reduced in predictable ways by transposon interruption of the GAA*TTC repeat. However, transposon interruptions in the GAA*TTC repeats did not increase the in vitro transcription efficiency of the templates.We have demonstrated that transposon Tn7 will recognize structures that form spontaneously in GAA*TTC repeats and insert in a specific orientation within the repeat. The conditions used for in vitro transposition span the physiologically relevant range suggesting that long GAA*TTC repeats can form triplex structures in vivo, attracting enzymes involved in DNA repair, recombination and chromatin modification."
