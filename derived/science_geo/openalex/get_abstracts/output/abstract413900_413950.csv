https://openalex.org/W4231356616,"Genome-wide mapping of oestrogen receptor-α binding sites in primary breast cancer tissues shows that oestrogen receptor binding is dynamically regulated and that the expression of genes near differentially bound regulatory regions is associated with clinical outcome. Most breast tumours express the oestrogen receptor-α (ER), and this transcription factor is seen as an important drug target for the treatment of breast cancer. Jason Carroll and colleagues have mapped ER binding sites in solid primary cancers for the first time, and find distinct ER-binding profiles that are mediated in part by the FoxA1 DNA-binding protein and are associated with better or worse clinical outcome. As well as providing a potentially useful method of prognosis, this work may help to answer one of the major questions in breast cancer biology: how some ER+ tumours become drug resistant. Oestrogen receptor-α (ER) is the defining and driving transcription factor in the majority of breast cancers and its target genes dictate cell growth and endocrine response, yet genomic understanding of ER function has been restricted to model systems1,2,3. Here we map genome-wide ER-binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcomes and in distant ER-positive metastases. We find that drug-resistant cancers still recruit ER to the chromatin, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER-binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired ER regulatory regions associated with poor clinical outcome observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER-positive disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER-binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FOXA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid timescale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FOXA1 binding events in drug-resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FOXA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription-factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER-binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2155826575,"This paper, which maps ERα binding via ChIP-seq in tumour tissue from twenty ER+ breast cancer patients, relies on a concurrently developed Bioconductor package, DiffBind, which provides a framework for quantitative differential analysis of protein/DNA binding events. Here we use DiffBind to identify ERα sites significantly differentially bound between those found in tumours from patients with good prognosis vs. those with poor prognosis and metastases. Gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER+ disease, validated in publically available breast cancer gene expression datasets, are derived from these sites. These signatures are enriched for genes with relevant proximal cis-regulatory events. Statistical characterization of differentially bound ERα sites enables further downstream analysis, including identification of a differentially enriched motif for the transcription factor FoxA1. Further differential analysis in five ER+ breast cancer cell lines shows how ERα binding is extensively shifted in tamoxifen-resistance, with the FoxA1 motif enriched proximal to ERα binding sites differentially bound in cells resistant to treatment. Analysis of FoxA1 binding at mitogen-induced ERα sites demonstrates that the observed differential ER binding program is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but rather to the FoxA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid time scale. Focusing our analysis on differential binding in primary tumour material allows us to show the plasticity of ERα binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes. These techniques are applicable to other cancers (and indeed other diseases) where master transcription factor regulators are known."

Despite the recent demonstration of partial HIV-1 vaccine efficacy in humans, the immune responses required to protect against acquisition of infection remain unclear. Here, Barouch et al. demonstrate vaccine protection against acquisition of a stringent strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus monkeys. Two candidate vaccines expressing the Gag, Pol and Env viral antigens were tested. They observe a delay in acquisition of SIV in vaccinated monkeys following repeated challenges with SIVMAC251. Protection against acquisition is correlated with Env-specific antibody responses, which the authors postulate may be critical for delaying infection, although whether the antibodies are surrogates for protection or causal correlates is not yet clear. Preclinical studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine candidates have typically shown post-infection virological control, but protection against acquisition of infection has previously only been reported against neutralization-sensitive virus challenges1,2,3. Here we demonstrate vaccine protection against acquisition of fully heterologous, neutralization-resistant simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenges in rhesus monkeys. Adenovirus/poxvirus and adenovirus/adenovirus-vector-based vaccines expressing SIVSME543 Gag, Pol and Env antigens resulted in an 80% or greater reduction in the per-exposure probability of infection4,5 against repetitive, intrarectal SIVMAC251 challenges in rhesus monkeys. Protection against acquisition of infection showed distinct immunological correlates compared with post-infection virological control and required the inclusion of Env in the vaccine regimen. These data demonstrate the proof-of-concept that optimized HIV-1 vaccine candidates can block acquisition of stringent, heterologous, neutralization-resistant virus challenges in rhesus monkeys."

Although low basal cerebral COX-2 expression has been reported, COX-2 is strongly induced by pro-inflammatory challenges, whereas COX-1 is constitutively expressed. However, the contribution of these enzymes in prostanoid formation varies depending on the stimuli and cell type. Astrocyte feet surround cerebral microvessels and release molecules that can trigger vascular responses. Here, we investigate the regulation of COX-2 induction and its role in prostanoid generation after a pro-inflammatory challenge with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in astroglia. Intracerebral administration of LPS in rodents induced strong COX-2 expression mainly in astroglia and microglia, whereas COX-1 expression was predominant in microglia and did not increase. In cultured astrocytes, LPS strongly induced COX-2 and microsomal prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) synthase-1, mediated by the MyD88-dependent NFκB pathway and influenced by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Studies in COX-deficient cells and using COX inhibitors demonstrated that COX-2 mediated the high production of PGE2 and, to a lesser extent, other prostanoids after LPS. In contrast, LPS down-regulated COX-1 in an MyD88-dependent fashion, and COX-1 deficiency increased PGE2 production after LPS. The results show that astrocytes respond to LPS by a COX-2-dependent production of prostanoids, mainly vasoactive PGE2, and suggest that the coordinated down-regulation of COX-1 facilitates PGE2 production after TLR-4 activation. These effects might induce cerebral blood flow responses to brain inflammation.

Cyclooxygenases (COX), 3The abbreviations used are: COXcyclooxygenasePGprostaglandincPLA2cytosolic phospholipase A2CBFcerebral blood flowTxB2thromboxane B2TxA2thromboxane A2PDTCpyrrolidinedithiocarbamateTSthromboxane synthaseGFAPglial fibrillary acidic protein. also known as prostaglandin G/H synthases, play a crucial role in inflammation and are targets of widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are two main COX enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, that participate in the metabolism of arachidonic acid generating the unstable product prostaglandin (PG) G2 that is reduced to PGH2. PGH2 is the substrate of prostaglandin isomerases that give rise to a family of vasoactive compounds called prostanoids, including molecules such as prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. There is cellular specificity for the production of certain prostanoids, and they exert different actions depending on the type of molecule produced and on the specific receptors that become activated (1.Hata A.N.

COX-2 is induced in brain cells under pathological conditions, but the role of the COX isoforms in brain diseases is not clearly established. Cox-2-deficient mice are protected against brain ischemia (2.Iadecola C. Niwa K. Nogawa S. Zhao X. Nagayama M. Araki E. Morham S. Ross M.E.

In contrast, in neurodegenerative diseases, COX-2 inhibitors are not protective in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (7.Choi J.K. Jenkins B.G. Carreras I. Kaymakcalan S. Cormier K. Kowall N.W.

Furthermore, COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pathology (10.Grosser T. Fries S. FitzGerald G.A.

Furthermore, COX-2 might contribute to neurovascular coupling because COX-2 inhibitors abrogate the increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by neuronal activation in rats (16.Matsuura T. Takuwa H. Bakalova R. Obata T. Kanno I. Effect of cyclooxygenase-2 on the regulation of cerebral blood flow during neuronal activation in the rat.Neurosci. Res. 2009; 65: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Exposure to LPS has been reported to induce vasodilation (17.Ruiz-Valdepeñas L. Martínez-Orgado J.A. Benito C. Millán A. Tolón R.M. Romero J. Cannabidiol reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular changes and inflammation in the mouse brain. An intravital microscopy study.J.

Neurovascular protection by ischemic tolerance. Role of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7083-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) through a mechanism involving inducible NOS and the NOX2 subunit of the superoxide-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase. Because LPS induces strong expression of COX-2 in the brain, it is feasible that vasoactive COX-2 products might also be involved in CBF regulation. In this study we examined the effect of intracerebral administration of LPS on the cellular expression of COX-2 and found strong up-regulation in microglia and astrocytes. Because astrocytes are recognized as important players in CBF regulation under physiological and pathological conditions (19.Gordon G.R. Mulligan S.J. MacVicar B.A. Astrocyte control of the cerebrovasculature.Glia. 2007; 55: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we then investigated the prostanoids induced by LPS and the COX isoforms involved in prostanoid generation in purified astrocyte cultures. The results show that the LPS challenge strongly induced COX-2 in astrocytes through a MyD88/NFκB-dependent mechanism, show the crucial role of COX-2 in prostanoid production after LPS, and show that PGE2 is the major product of arachidonic acid metabolism under these experimental conditions. Furthermore, we found that LPS down-regulates Cox-1 gene expression and that Cox-1-deficient cells produce more PGE2 than the WT, indicating some negative effect of COX-1 on the COX-2-dependent production of PGE2 in astrocytes after LPS. Animal work was authorized by the Ethical Committee of the University of Barcelona, and it was performed in agreement with the local regulations and in compliance with the Directives of the European Community. Four-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River (Lyon, France). MyD88 knock-out (KO) mice in a C57Bl/6 background were obtained from Oriental Bioservices, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). MyD88 KO mice (−/−) were crossed with wild type (WT) (+/+) C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River), and a colony of MyD88 heterozygous mice (+/−) was kept in the animal house of the University of Barcelona School of Medicine. Each individual animal born from the heterozygous progenitors was genotyped, and the MyD88 KO and the MyD88 WT animals were selected for the studies described below. COX-1 and COX-2 heterozygous mice were from Taconics Inc. (Hudson, NY). COX-2 or COX-1 heterozygous females (+/−) were crossed with homozygous (−/−) males; all had a mixed B6;129P2 background. We genotyped each animal of the offspring, and the KO animals were selected for the studies, although the corresponding WT animals were used as controls. Genotyping was carried out by doing PCR on DNA extracted from tail biopsies. The Extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma) was used for the extraction of DNA and preparation of PCRs according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with COX KO or WT cells, the following sets of primers (20.Loftin C.D. Trivedi D.B. Tiano H.F. Clark J.A. Lee C.A. Epstein J.A. Morham S.G. Breyer M.D. Nguyen M. Hawkins B.M.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were used for PCR: Cox-1 KO forward, 5′-GCAGCCTCTGTTCCACATACAC-3′; Cox-1 WT forward, 5′-AGGAGATGGCTGCTGAGTTGG-3′; Cox-1 reverse (common), 5′-AATCTGACTTTCTGAGTTGCC-3′; Cox-2 KO forward, 5′-ACGCGTCACCTTAATATGCG-3′; Cox-2 WT forward, 5′-ACACCTTCAACATTGAAGACC-3′; Cox-2 reverse (common), 5′-ATCCCTTCACTAAATGCCCTC-3′. Amplicon sizes were as follow: Cox-1 WT, 601 bp; Cox-1 KO, 646 bp; Cox-2 WT, 725 bp; Cox-2 KO, 905 bp. The cycling parameters were 94 °C, 5 min for initial denaturation, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 °C (Cox-1) or 57 °C (Cox-2) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The last cycle was followed by an additional extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. The supplemental material depicts an example of a genotyping reaction (supplemental Fig. 1). For experiments with MyD88 KO mice, the genotyping procedure has been reported previously (21.Gorina R. Font-Nieves M. Márquez-Kisinousky L. Santalucia T. Planas A.M. Astrocyte TLR4 activation induces a proinflammatory environment through the interplay between MyD88-dependent NFκB signaling, MAPK, and Jak1/Stat1 pathways.Glia. 2011; 59: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Rats and mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for injection of LPS or the vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) in the right striatum. For rats, LPS (5 μl of 1 μg/ml) or the same volume of vehicle was injected at the following coordinates according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (22.Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, New York1986Google Scholar) in relation to Bregma as follows: 0.5 mm antero-posterior, 3 mm lateral, and 5 mm ventral. For mice, LPS (0.7 μl of 1 μg/ml) or vehicle was injected at the following coordinates: 0.5 mm antero-posterior, 2 mm lateral, and 3 mm ventral. After 8 h, animals were anesthetized with isofluorane and perfused through the heart with saline to remove blood from the brain vessels, and brain tissue was obtained after dissection of the ipsilateral and contralateral striatum and was immediately frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. A different set of animals was processed for immunohistochemistry. Glial cell cultures enriched in astrocytes were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 1–2-day-old rats or mice as described previously (21.Gorina R. Font-Nieves M. Márquez-Kisinousky L. Santalucia T. Planas A.M. Astrocyte TLR4 activation induces a proinflammatory environment through the interplay between MyD88-dependent NFκB signaling, MAPK, and Jak1/Stat1 pathways.Glia. 2011; 59: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 23.Gorina R. Santalucia T. Petegnief V. Ejarque-Ortiz A. Saura J. Planas A.M. Astrocytes are very sensitive to develop innate immune responses to lipid-carried short interfering RNA.Glia. 2009; 57: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in culture medium (DMEM (Invitrogen) for rat astrocytes, and DMEM/F-12 nutrient (1:1) (Invitrogen) for mouse astrocytes). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 4 ml/liter of a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin 10,000 units, 10,000 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Cells were subcultured to obtain purified astroglia cultures, as follows. At confluence after 8–10 days in vitro, cells were treated with 4 μm antimitotic cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for 5 days to eliminate dividing cells, i.e. mostly microglia and progenitors. Flasks were shaken overnight, and the remaining astrocyte adherent monolayer was detached with trypsin 0.0125%, 0.2 mm EDTA and seeded at 10 × 104 cells/ml with incubation medium (as above). Purified astrocytes were treated when cells reached confluence at 4 days after subculturing. FBS was reduced to 1% 16 h prior to treatments. Rat astrocyte cultures contained only 2.01 ± 1.68% of contaminating microglia cells, as reported (21.Gorina R. Font-Nieves M. Márquez-Kisinousky L. Santalucia T. Planas A.M. Astrocyte TLR4 activation induces a proinflammatory environment through the interplay between MyD88-dependent NFκB signaling, MAPK, and Jak1/Stat1 pathways.Glia. 2011; 59: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Purified mouse astrocyte cultures also contained very little microglia, as estimated by immunofluorescence and by examining the expression of CD11b mRNA (see below for description of these methods). After immunofluorescence with an antibody against a microglial marker (Iba-1) and an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to label astrocytes (supplemental Fig. 2), we counted (n = 24 fields for two cultures, using ×20 magnification) the percentage of Iba-1 immunoreactive cells and estimated that the % of contaminating microglia in the astrocyte cultures was 0.77 ± 0.49%. Independently, we calculated the percentage of CD11b expression per culture by real time RT-PCR as a marker of microglia and used purified microglia cultures (obtained as reported previously (24.Saura J. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. High yield isolation of murine microglia by mild trypsinization.Glia. 2003; 44: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar)) as a reference for 100% CD11b expression. According to this procedure, CD11b expression (mean ± S.D., n = 5) in astroglia cultures was 1.41 ± 1.22%, supporting that contaminating microglia cells were very scarce in the purified astroglia cultures. For experiments with MyD88 KO, Cox-1 KO, and Cox-2 KO cells, individual astrocyte cultures were obtained from each newborn animal and, after genotyping, the −/− (KO) and +/+ (WT) cultures were selected for use in further experiments. Experiments in KO and WT cells were carried out in parallel. Cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) (Sigma) for times ranging from 4 to 24 h. Cells were treated with the following mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (Calbiochem): MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene (U0126) (1–25 μm) and PD98059 (1–40 μm); p38 MAPK inhibitor trans-4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxy-4-pyrimidinyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl]cyclohexanol (SB239063) (0.1–25 μm); and stress-activated SAPK/MAPK inhibitor anthra(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one (SP600125) (1–25 μm) that was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) and given 30 min prior to LPS. COX-2 inhibitor N-[cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl] methanesulfonamide (NS-398) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO), dissolved in saline, pH 13, and used at 3 μm. COX-1 inhibitor 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-trifluoromethylpyrazole (SC-560) was purchased from Calbiochem, dissolved in DMSO, and used at 10 nm. Treatment with COX inhibitors was carried within 30–60 min prior to LPS. The cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) was dissolved in DMSO and used at 2 μm 30 min before LPS. For all drugs, the corresponding vehicle was used to check for any nonspecific effects in all the experiments. The final concentrations of the vehicles, DMSO or saline, pH 13, did not exceed 0.25 and 0.3%, respectively. No effects of the vehicles on the parameters studied were detected. Twenty four hours after subculturing, rat astrocytes were transfected with specific siRNA sequences TARGETplusTM SMARTpool siRNA from Thermo Fisher Scientific Dharmacon Products (Lafayette, CO). TARGETplusTM SMARTpool siRNA directed against NFκB p65 (L-0800033-01, Rat RelA, NM_199267), NADPH oxidase flavocytochrome b558 gp91(phox) (J-093524), COX-1 (19224, PTGS1), and against the mouse MAPKs MAPK1 (26413, Erk2, NM_011949), MAPK10 (26414, JNK3, NM_009158), and MAPK14 (24416, p38, NM_011951). ON-TARGETplus nontargeting siRNA (D-001810-01) was used as a negative control (nonsilencing). These siRNAs were predesigned by the maker to minimize off-side effects (23.Gorina R. Santalucia T. Petegnief V. Ejarque-Ortiz A. Saura J. Planas A.M. Astrocytes are very sensitive to develop innate immune responses to lipid-carried short interfering RNA.Glia. 2009; 57: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and they were used at 100 nm and transfected with OligofectamineTM (Invitrogen), as described previously (23.Gorina R. Santalucia T. Petegnief V. Ejarque-Ortiz A. Saura J. Planas A.M. Astrocytes are very sensitive to develop innate immune responses to lipid-carried short interfering RNA.Glia. 2009; 57: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were used 4 days after siRNA transfection. The silencing effect was verified by RT-PCR and/or Western blotting. Astrocytes were lysed in buffer containing protease inhibitors. Twenty μg of protein extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used against the following: COX-2 (160126, Cayman Chemical) diluted 1:500; thromboxane synthase (TS) (ab39362, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:1,000; microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, PGES-1 (AS03 031, Agrisera, Vännas, Sweden) diluted 1:1,000; c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (J4500, Sigma), and p38 MAPK (M0800, Sigma) both diluted 1:10,000. A goat polyclonal antibody against COX-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used diluted 1:1,000. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used against ERK1/2 (610123, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:50,000 and against β-tubulin (T4026, Sigma) diluted 1:50,000, which was used as control for protein gel loading. Antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:1,000 or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) 1:2,000 for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were developed with the use of a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Western blotting Analysis System; Amersham Biosciences). Astrocytes were seeded on polylysine-coated coverslips. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 10% goat or horse serum in PBS for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following primary antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Iba-1 (019-19741, Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) diluted 1:1,000 or a monoclonal antibody against GFAP (G3893, Sigma) diluted 1,1000. The next day, cells were washed and incubated with green fluorescence Alexa Fluor® 488 dye-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Alexa Fluor® 546 goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1,1000 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, astrocytes were stained with Hoechst to visualize the nuclei. The coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using Mowiol mounting medium (Calbiochem, Merck). Observations were performed with an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. For immunohistochemistry in brain tissue, animals were perfused through the heart with saline followed by paraformaldehyde (4%) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brain was removed, post-fixed with paraformaldehyde overnight, and then kept in phosphate buffer before slicing it in a vibratome to obtain 30-μm-thick coronal sections. Brain sections were cryoprotected in a solution containing glycerol and were kept frozen at −20 °C. Immunohistochemistry was performed free-floating with vibratome sections, as reported previously (25.Friguls B. Petegnief V. Justicia C. Pallàs M. Planas A.M. Activation of ERK and Akt signaling in focal cerebral ischemia. Modulation by TGF-α and involvement of NMDA receptor.Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 10% methanol in PBS for 25 min. Sections were incubated for 2 h in 3% normal horse or goat serum for mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively, to block unspecific binding sites, washed in T-PBS (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either mouse monoclonal antibody against COX-1 (160110, Cayman Chemical) diluted 1:100, or rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody (160126, Cayman Chemical) diluted 1:500. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed in T-PBS and incubated for 1 h with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories), followed by incubation with 1% avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). The reaction was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine in 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in PBS. Double immunohistochemistry was carried out following the first immunoreaction with COX-1 or COX-2. The second primary antibodies used were as follows: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFAP (Z0334, DakoCytomation) diluted 1:500, which labels astroglia, or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Iba-1 (as above) diluted 1:500 to detect microglia. Sections were then incubated with the avidin-biotin complex, washed with 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, and preincubated for 10 min with 0.01% benzidine dihydrochloride and 0.025% sodium nitroferricyanide in 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6. The reaction was developed with this solution containing 0.005% H2O2. Immunoreaction controls included omission of the first or second primary antibodies. The induction of COX-2 in microglia and in astrocytes was assessed by counting the number of GFAP+ and of Iba-1+ cells expressing COX-2 in the ipsilateral striatum. Microscopic photographs (×20 objective) of three areas surrounding the injection site were taken per brain section in three brain sections per animal. The proportion of microglia (Iba-1+) and of astroglia (GFAP+) expressing COX-2 was calculated in each photograph, and the average value of all the photographs per animal was calculated. Values are expressed as the mean of four animals treated with LPS and three animals treated with PBS. Total RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA kit (Invitrogen). RNA quantity and purity were determined using ND-1000 microspectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a mixture of random primers (High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit, Applied Biosystems). Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out by SYBR Green I dye detection (11761500, Invitrogen) using the iCycler iQTM Multicolor real time detection system (Bio-Rad). PCR primers were designed with the aid of Primer3 software to bridge the exon-intron boundaries within the gene of interest to exclude amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. Several genes were assayed as loading controls (Hprt1, Sdha, Ywhaz, and Rpl14). Rpl14 was the control gene showing the best stability after LPS treatment and was chosen for normalization. Primers (see list in Table 1) were purchased from IDT (Conda, Spain). Optimized thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min at 50 °C, 8 min, and 30 s at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C in which an optical acquirement were performed. Data were collected after each cycle and were graphically displayed (iCycler iQTM real time detection system software, version 3.1, Bio-Rad). Melt curves were performed upon completion of the cycles to ensure absence of nonspecific products. Quantification was performed by normalizing cycle threshold (Ct) values with the Rpl14 control gene Ct, and analysis was carried out with the 2−ΔΔCT method (26.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

https://openalex.org/W2031748708,"Oxidative damage by myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been proposed to deprive HDL of its cardioprotective effects. In vitro studies reveal that MPO chlorinates and nitrates specific tyrosine residues of apoA-I, the major HDL protein. After Tyr-192 is chlorinated, apoA-I is less able to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. To investigate the potential role of this pathway in vivo, we used tandem mass spectrometry with selected reaction monitoring to quantify the regiospecific oxidation of apoA-I. This approach demonstrated that Tyr-192 is the major chlorination site in apoA-I in both plasma and lesion HDL of humans. We also found that Tyr-192 is the major nitration site in apoA-I of circulating HDL but that Tyr-18 is the major site in lesion HDL. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine strongly correlated with levels of 3-chlorotyrosine in lesion HDL, and Tyr-18 of apoA-I was the major nitration site in HDL exposed to MPO in vitro, suggesting that MPO is the major pathway for chlorination and nitration of HDL in human atherosclerotic tissue. These observations may have implications for treating cardiovascular disease, because recombinant apoA-I is under investigation as a therapeutic agent and mutant forms of apoA-I that resist oxidation might be more cardioprotective than the native form."
https://openalex.org/W2027980220,"Though it has been shown that immunological functions of CD4+ T cells are time of day-dependent, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely obscure. To address the question whether T cells themselves harbor a functional clock driving circadian rhythms of immune function, we analyzed clock gene expression by qPCR in unstimulated CD4+ T cells and immune responses of PMA/ionomycin stimulated CD4+ T cells by FACS analysis purified from blood of healthy subjects at different time points throughout the day. Molecular clock as well as immune function was further analyzed in unstimulated T cells which were cultured in serum-free medium with circadian clock reporter systems. We found robust rhythms of clock gene expression as well as, after stimulation, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ production and CD40L expression in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells. Further analysis of IFN-γ and CD40L in cultivated T cells revealed that these parameters remain rhythmic in vitro. Moreover, circadian luciferase reporter activity in CD4+ T cells and in thymic sections from PER2::LUCIFERASE reporter mice suggest that endogenous T cell clock rhythms are self-sustained under constant culture conditions. Microarray analysis of stimulated CD4+ T cell cultures revealed regulation of the NF-κB pathway as a candidate mechanism mediating circadian immune responses. Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that CD4+ T cell responses are regulated by an intrinsic cellular circadian oscillator capable of driving rhythmic CD4+ T cell immune responses."

Recent focus has been directed toward a group of naturally occurring anti-amyloidogenic polyphenols known as flavonoids. We orally administered the flavonoid tannic acid (TA) to the transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (bearing mutant human APP and presenilin-1 transgenes) and evaluated cognitive function and AD-like pathology. Consumption of TA for 6 months prevented transgene-associated behavioral impairment including hyperactivity, decreased object recognition, and defective spatial reference memory, but did not alter nontransgenic mouse behavior. Accordingly, brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits and abundance of various Aβ species including oligomers were mitigated in TA-treated PSAPP mice. These effects occurred with decreased cleavage of the β-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment, lowered soluble APP-β production, reduced β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 protein stability and activity, and attenuated neuroinflammation. As in vitro validation, we treated well characterized mutant human APP-overexpressing murine neuron-like cells with TA and found significantly reduced Aβ production associated with less amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that dietary supplementation with TA may be prophylactic for AD by inhibiting β-secretase activity and neuroinflammation and thereby mitigating AD pathology.

All mice were characterized by PCR genotyping for mutant human APP and PS1 transgenes as described elsewhere (35.Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. APP processing and amyloid deposition in mice haplo-insufficient for presenilin 1.Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We strictly used PSAPP and WT littermates obtained from this breeding strategy for all analyses. Thus, all mice used in this study are genetically comparable. TA was obtained from Sigma, resuspended in distilled water, and orally administered to 16 PSAPP mice (PSAPP-TA mice; 8 males and 8 females). As a vehicle control, 16 additional PSAPP mice received distilled water (PSAPP-V mice; 8 males and 8 females). In addition, 32 WT littermates received TA (WT-TA mice; 8 males and 8 females) or distilled water (WT-V mice, 8 males and 8 females). Beginning at 6 months of age, animals were gavaged with TA (30 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 6 months. In parallel, to examine if PSAPP mice were cognitively impaired at the initiation of dosing and whether TA treatment prevented versus delayed kinetics of disease progression, 12 untreated PSAPP mice (PSAPP-6M, 6 males and 6 females) and 12 untreated WT mice (WT-6M, 6 males and 6 females) at 6 months of age were included for analyses of behavior, β-amyloid pathology, and neuroinflammation. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility under a 12/12-h light-dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Use Ethics Committee of the Saitama Medical University and of the NIH. Two weeks prior to sacrifice, a battery of behavioral tests was conducted to assess exploratory activity, novel-object recognition and memory retention, and spatial learning and memory in the six groups of mice detailed above. Exploratory activity was evaluated by individually placing mice into a novel environment (the left corner of a white polyethylene chamber; 54 × 39 × 20 cm). Their activity was recorded for 20 min by an overhead video camera (BL-C131, Panasonic, Fukuoka, Japan) connected to a Windows PC, and horizontal locomotion and rearing scores were counted for each 2-min time bin (37.Laghmouch A.

Res. 2006; 83: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The next day, novel-object recognition and memory retention were assessed as described (39.De Rosa R. Garcia A.A. Braschi C. Capsoni S. Maffei L. Berardi N. Cattaneo A. Intranasal administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) rescues recognition memory deficits in AD11 anti-NGF transgenic mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, each mouse was habituated in a cage for 4 h, and then two different shaped objects were concurrently provided to the mouse for 10 min. The number of times that the mouse explored the object (defined as number of instances where a mouse directed its nose 2 cm or less distance from the object) that was later replaced by a novel object was counted for the initial 5 min of exposure (training phase). To test memory retention on the following day, one of the original objects was replaced with a different shaped novel object, and then the number of explorations of the novel object was counted for 5 min (retention test). The recognition index, taken as an index of memory, is reported as frequency (%) of explorations of the novel versus original objects. Subsequently, Morris water maze testing was performed essentially as previously described (40.Morris R.G. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N. O'Keefe J. Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions.Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar, 41.Good M. Honey R.C. Dissociable effects of selective lesions to hippocampal subsystems on exploratory behavior, contextual learning, and spatial learning.Behav. Neurosci. 1997; 111: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The water maze consisted of a circular pool (80 cm diameter) filled with water maintained at 23–26 °C. For the purpose of post hoc analyses, the pool was divided into quadrants (Q1 to Q4), and a 6-cm diameter plexiglass platform was located 1 cm above the water surface in the center of Q2. After a minimum of 20 min habituation to the room, mice naïve to the test were placed in the pool and allowed to search for the platform for 60 s. On the first 2 days (four trials were conducted per day with a 20-min inter-trial interval), a visible cue was placed on the platform and its location was randomly varied among four possible locations (counterbalanced across mice). The trial ended when a mouse climbed the platform, or in the allocated 60 s, whichever came first. After finding and climbing on the platform, each mouse was allowed to remain there for 20 s, and was then returned to its cage. Animals that did not locate the platform within 60 s were guided to it and allowed to remain there for 20 s before being returned to their cages. On the third day, submerged platform testing was conducted for five consecutive days (learning phase; four trials per day with a 20-min inter-trial interval). The location of the indiscernible platform remained in Q2, 1 cm below the water surface, and mice were placed into the pool in one of seven randomly selected locations (excluding the position immediately adjacent to the platform). One day after the conclusion of the learning phase, memory retention was determined in a single 60-s probe trial. The submerged platform was removed from the water maze, and mice were placed and released opposite the site where the platform had been located and time spent in each quadrant was recorded for the probe trial. All behavioral tests were performed in a room (6 m × 4.5 m) with indirect lighting and multiple visible cues on the walls. The examiner determined the time of swimming until the mouse reached the platform (latency) using a stopwatch. In addition, trials were recorded using an overhead video camera and were analyzed using customized macro software in Microsoft Excel. All trials were performed at the same time of day (±1 h), during the animals' light phase. So as not to interfere with behavioral testing, TA or vehicle treatment was carried out 1 h after behavioral testing. Tissue was processed according to our previously described methods (16.Tan J.

At 12 months of age, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and euthanized by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold physiological saline containing heparin (10 units/ml). Brains were isolated and quartered (sagittally at the level of the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, and then coronally at the level of the anterior commissure) using a mouse brain slicer (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan). Right anterior cerebral quarters were weighed and snap-frozen at −80 °C for α- or β-secretase activity analyses. Right posterior cerebral quarters were further divided into two pieces, and weighed and snap-frozen at −80 °C. One-half was sequentially extracted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), 2% SDS-, and guanidine-soluble fractions for Aβ sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The other half was used for holo-APP, β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (β-CTF: phospho-C99 and C99) Western blots. Left anterior cerebral quarters were weighed and immersed in RNA stabilization solution (RNAlater®, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and then snap-frozen at −80 °C for proinflammatory cytokine and BACE1 quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analyses. Left posterior cerebral quarters were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight, and routinely processed in paraffin for immunohistochemical analyses. For paraffin blocks, we sectioned five coronal sections (per set) with a 100 μm interval and a thickness of 5 μm for each brain region (for cingulate cortex (CC), bregma −0.10 to −0.82 mm; for hippocampus (H) and entorhinal cortex (EC), bregma −2.92 to −3.64 mm) (44.Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar). We prepared three sets of five sections in each separate region for analyses of Aβ deposits/β-amyloid plaques (for burden, plaque number, and maximum diameter morphometry) as well as ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1, to mark reactive microglia) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocytosis marker) burdens. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol using a Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) coupled with the diaminobenzidine reaction, except that the biotinylated secondary antibody step was omitted for Aβ immunohistochemical staining. The following primary antibodies were used: a biotinylated human Aβ monoclonal antibody (4G8; 1:200, Covance Research Products, Emeryville, CA), Iba1 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Wako, Osaka, Japan), and GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:500, Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Using additional sets of five sections, normal mouse or rabbit serum (isotype control) or phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4) was used instead of primary or secondary antibody or ABC reagent as negative controls. Quantitative image analysis was done based on previously validated methods (16.Tan J. Town T. Crawford F. Mori T. DelleDonne A. Crescentini R. Obregon D. Flavell R.A. Mullan M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2160923256,"Δ6-Desaturase (Fads2) is widely regarded as rate-limiting in the conversion of dietary α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3; ALA) to the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; DHA). However, increasing dietary ALA or the direct Fads2 product, stearidonic acid (18:4n-3; SDA), increases tissue levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3; EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3; DPA), but not DHA. These observations suggest that one or more control points must exist beyond ALA metabolism by Fads2. One possible control point is a second reaction involving Fads2 itself, since this enzyme catalyses desaturation of 24:5n-3 to 24:6n-3, as well as ALA to SDA. However, metabolism of EPA and DPA both require elongation reactions. This study examined the activities of two elongase enzymes as well as the second reaction of Fads2 in order to concentrate on the metabolism of EPA to DHA.The substrate selectivities, competitive substrate interactions and dose response curves of the rat elongases, Elovl2 and Elovl5 were determined after expression of the enzymes in yeast. The competitive substrate interactions for rat Fads2 were also examined. Rat Elovl2 was active with C(20) and C(22) polyunsaturated fatty acids and this single enzyme catalysed the sequential elongation reactions of EPA→DPA→24:5n-3. The second reaction DPA→24:5n-3 appeared to be saturated at substrate concentrations not saturating for the first reaction EPA→DPA. ALA dose-dependently inhibited Fads2 conversion of 24:5n-3 to 24:6n-3.The competition between ALA and 24:5n-3 for Fads2 may explain the decrease in DHA levels observed after certain intakes of dietary ALA have been exceeded. In addition, the apparent saturation of the second Elovl2 reaction, DPA→24:5n-3, provides further explanations for the accumulation of DPA when ALA, SDA or EPA is provided in the diet. This study suggests that Elovl2 will be critical in understanding if DHA synthesis can be increased by dietary means."
https://openalex.org/W1976420412,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major pathogens that cause hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks in young children in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. Human scavenger receptor class B 2 (SCARB2) is the main cellular receptor for EV71 on target cells. The requirements of the EV71-SCARB2 interaction have not been fully characterized, and it has not been determined whether SCARB2 serves as an uncoating receptor for EV71. Here we compared the efficiency of the receptor from different species including human, horseshoe bat, mouse, and hamster and demonstrated that the residues between 144 and 151 are critical for SCARB2 binding to viral capsid protein VP1 of EV71 and seven residues from the human receptor could convert murine SCARB2, an otherwise inefficient receptor, to an efficient receptor for EV71 viral infection. We also identified that EV71 binds to SCARB2 via a canyon of VP1 around residue Gln-172. Soluble SCARB2 could convert the EV71 virions from 160 S to 135 S particles, indicating that SCARB2 is an uncoating receptor of the virus. The uncoating efficiency of SCARB2 significantly increased in an acidic environment (pH 5.6). These studies elucidated the viral capsid and receptor determinants of enterovirus 71 infection and revealed a possible target for antiviral interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2014214934,"The WRKY family transcription factors regulate plant-specific reactions that are mostly related to biotic and abiotic stresses. They share the WRKY domain, which recognizes a DNA element (TTGAC(C/T)) termed the W-box, in target genes. Here, we determined the solution structure of the C-terminal WRKY domain of Arabidopsis WRKY4 in complex with the W-box DNA by NMR. A four-stranded β-sheet enters the major groove of DNA in an atypical mode termed the β-wedge, where the sheet is nearly perpendicular to the DNA helical axis. Residues in the conserved WRKYGQK motif contact DNA bases mainly through extensive apolar contacts with thymine methyl groups. The importance of these contacts was verified by substituting the relevant T bases with U and by surface plasmon resonance analyses of DNA binding."

Reported here is the crystal structure of AgAS at 2.3 Å resolution and molecular dynamics simulations of that structure with and without active site ligands. AgAS has three domains (α, β, and γ). The class I active site is within the C-terminal α domain, and the class II active site is between the N-terminal γ and β domains. The domain organization resembles that of monofunctional diterpene synthases and is consistent with proposed evolutionary origins of terpene synthases. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to determine the effect of substrate binding on enzymatic structure. Although such studies of the class I active site do lead to an enclosed substrate-Mg2+ complex similar to that observed in crystal structures of related plant enzymes, it does not enforce a single substrate conformation consistent with the known product stereochemistry. Simulations of the class II active site were more informative, with observation of a well ordered external loop migration. This “loop-in” conformation not only limits solvent access but also greatly increases the number of conformational states accessible to the substrate while destabilizing the nonproductive substrate conformation present in the “loop-out” conformation.

Terpenoids form the largest group of natural products, with some 50,000 known (1.Buckingham J. Dictionary of Natural Products (on-line web edition). Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2002Google Scholar). Underlying the observed diversity are the manifold hydrocarbon skeletal backbones produced by the cyclization and/or rearrangement of acyclic precursors catalyzed by the relevant terpene synthases (2.Christianson D.W. Structural biology and chemistry of the terpenoid cyclases.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3412-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). They are first subdivided based on the number of five-carbon isoprenoid repeats; with the ten-carbon monoterpenoids generally derived from geranyl diphosphate, the fifteen-carbon sesquiterpenoids from farnesyl diphosphate, the twenty-carbon diterpenoids from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), 3The abbreviations used are: GGPP(E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphateAgASabietadiene synthase from A. grandisAtCPSent-CPP synthase from Arabidopsis thalianaCPPcopalyl diphosphateTbTStaxadiene synthase from Taxus brevifolia. and the thirty-carbon triterpenoids from squalene (3.Croteau R.

As might be suspected from the composition of their precursors, the skeletal backbone structures of the lower (mono-, sesqui-, and di-) terpenes are generally produced by cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions initiated by ionization of the substrate allylic diphosphate ester bond, whereas triterpenes are cyclized via a protonation-initiated reaction (i.e. of a terminal C=C double bond or the oxido-ring of the derived oxido-squalene). The corresponding enzymes have been termed classes I and II, respectively (4.Wendt K.U. Schulz G.E. Isoprenoid biosynthesis. Manifold chemistry catalyzed by similar enzymes.Structure. 1998; 6: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Notably, biosynthesis of the large superfamily of labdane-related diterpenoids (∼7,000 known) combines both types of reactions (5.Peters R.J. Two rings in them all. The labdane-related diterpenoids.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 1521-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), in which GGPP is bicyclized by a class II diterpene cyclase (EC 5.5.1.x) prior to further cyclization and/or rearrangement catalyzed by a class I diterpene synthase (EC 4.2.3.x). The labdane-related diterpenoids include many important plant natural products, such as the gibberellin phytohormones and others that act in defense (e.g. the ubiquitous conifer resin acids (6.Keeling C.I. Bohlmann J. Diterpene resin acids in conifers.Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2415-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)). Indeed, it has been suggested that the diterpene synthases involved in gibberellin biosynthesis are the ancestral progenitors to the extensive family of lower (i.e. class I) terpene synthases found in plants (7.Trapp S.C. Croteau R.B. Genomic organization of plant terpene synthases and molecular evolutionary implications.Genetics. 2001; 158: 811-832PubMed Google Scholar). This is possible because, while catalyzing mechanistically distinct reactions, the corresponding class II ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase and subsequently acting class I ent-kaurene synthase are clearly homologous. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the plant lower terpene synthases are significantly smaller than these diterpene synthases (8.Bohlmann J. Meyer-Gauen G. Croteau R. Plant terpenoid synthases.

In particular, this clearly is derived from the ancestral diterpene synthases, although these enzymes further contain an additional N-terminal large sequence element as well (8.Bohlmann J.

Here we report the crystal structure of AgAS at 2.3 Å resolution and use it along with molecular dynamics simulations to correct and clarify previous hypotheses, via derived site-directed mutagenesis, regarding the structure-function relationships underlying both class I and II reactions. For crystallization the Δ84 pseudo-mature form of AgAS was recombinantly expressed using a previously described pSBET construct (38.Peters R.J. Flory J.E. Jetter R. Ravn M.M. Lee H.J. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Abietadiene synthase from grand fir (Abies grandis).

For selenomethionine labeling, AgAS was expressed in B834(DE3) methionine auxotrophic E. coli (Novagen) grown in selenomethionine medium base plus nutrient mix (Molecular Dimensions) with the addition of l-selenomethionine (Fisher). AgAS was then purified much as previously described (38.Peters R.J. Flory J.E. Jetter R. Ravn M.M. Lee H.J. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Abietadiene synthase from grand fir (Abies grandis). Characterization and mechanism of action of the “pseudomature” recombinant enzyme.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15592-15602Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, clarified bacterial lysates were initially fractionated over type II ceramic hydroxyapatite, and AgAS was purified over Mono Q and type II ceramic hydroxyapatite again using a BioLogic LP system (Bio-Rad), before a final polishing purification step over a Mono Q column on an ÄKTAfplc system (GE Healthcare). The resulting AgAS (>98% pure by SDS-PAGE) was then dialyzed against protein storage buffer (10 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT), following which it could be stored at −80 °C for several months without significant loss of activity. Initial crystallization trials were carried out at the Hauptman-Woodward Institute. Promising conditions were replicated in our lab by the hanging drop vapor diffusion methods at both 4 and 18 °C. Typically, a 2-μl drop of AgAS in storage buffer was mixed with a 1.6-μl drop of precipitant solution (24% (v/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.1, 0.1 m dibasic ammonium phosphate), as well as with 0.4 μl of additional 0.1 m l-proline or 0.1 m phenol from an additive screen (Hampton Research), and equilibrated against 1 ml of precipitant solution in the well. Plate-shaped crystals with maximal dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm appeared within a week. Crystals were briefly transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (25% PEG 8000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.1, 0.1 m dibasic ammonium phosphate, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and then flash-frozen. One selenomethionine labeled crystal (crystal I) was soaked in 5.5 mm tantalum bromide (Ta6Br122+; Jena Bioscience) prior to flash-freezing. Although this derivative was not successfully used for phasing, it appears to have altered the crystal lattice (from P21 to P21212), which facilitated localization of the selenium for phasing. This crystal, which diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution, belonged to space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 100.14 Å, b = 190.175 Å, and c = 92.932 Å (two molecules in the asymmetric unit). The data also were collected for another selenomethionine-labeled crystal (crystal II), which diffracted to 2.3 Å, and belonged to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 92.84 Å, b = 189.09 Å, and c = 99.90 Å, β = 91.45° (four molecules in the asymmetric unit). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, that for crystal I on Beamline 24-ID-D, and that for crystal II on Beamline 19-ID, using λ = 0.9792 Å, corresponding to the absorption peak of selenium. All of the diffraction data were indexed and merged using HKL-3000 (44.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. HKL-3000.

The figures of protein structure were generated using PyMOL.

The latter double mutants (AgAS:R356A/D621A and AgAS:N451A/D621A) enabled separate analysis of class II activity, as the D621A mutation selectively abrogates AgAS class I activity (21.Peters R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2153792118,"Bats receive increasing attention in infectious disease studies, because of their well recognized status as reservoir species for various infectious agents. This is even more important, as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species. Nevertheless, infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. But the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date.Between 2002 and 2009, 486 deceased bats of 19 European species (family Vespertilionidae) were collected in different geographic regions in Germany. Most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments. The bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically, bacteriologically and virologically. Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats. Comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases, with fatal bacterial, viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated.Our data demonstrate the importance of diseases and infectious agents as cause of death in European bat species. The clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates indicate that maternity colonies are more susceptible to infectious agents, underlining the possible important role of host physiology, immunity and roosting behavior as risk factors for infection of bats."
https://openalex.org/W1967955344,"To ensure genome stability, cells have evolved a robust defense mechanism to detect, signal, and repair damaged DNA that is generated by exogenous stressors such as ionizing radiation, endogenous stressors such as free radicals, or normal physiological processes such as DNA replication. Homologous recombination (HR) repair is a critical pathway of repairing DNA double strand breaks, and it plays an essential role in maintaining genomic integrity. Previous studies have shown that BRIT1, also known as MCPH1, is a key regulator of HR repair. Here, we report that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a novel BRIT1 binding partner that regulates the HR repair process. The BRCA1 C-terminal domains of BRIT1 are required for its interaction with CHD4. Depletion of CHD4 and overexpression of the ATPase-dead form of CHD4 impairs the recruitment of BRIT1 to the DNA damage lesions. As a functional consequence, CHD4 deficiency sensitizes cells to double strand break-inducing agents, reduces the recruitment of HR repair factor BRCA1, and impairs HR repair efficiency. We further demonstrate that CHD4-depleted cells are more sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatment. In response to DNA damage induced by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, CHD4 deficiency impairs the recruitment of DNA repair proteins BRIT1, BRCA1, and replication protein A at early steps of HR repair. Taken together, our findings identify an important role of CHD4 in controlling HR repair to maintain genome stability and establish the potential therapeutic implications of targeting CHD4 deficiency in tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2159175636,"Current prognostic gene signatures for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and have limited value in triple-negative (TNBC) cancers. The identification of prognostic signatures from TNBC cohorts was limited in the past due to small sample sizes.We assembled all currently publically available TNBC gene expression datasets generated on Affymetrix gene chips. Inter-laboratory variation was minimized by filtering methods for both samples and genes. Supervised analysis was performed to identify prognostic signatures from 394 cases which were subsequently tested on an independent validation cohort (n = 261 cases).Using two distinct false discovery rate thresholds, 25% and <3.5%, a larger (n = 264 probesets) and a smaller (n = 26 probesets) prognostic gene sets were identified and used as prognostic predictors. Most of these genes were positively associated with poor prognosis and correlated to metagenes for inflammation and angiogenesis. No correlation to other previously published prognostic signatures (recurrence score, genomic grade index, 70-gene signature, wound response signature, 7-gene immune response module, stroma derived prognostic predictor, and a medullary like signature) was observed. In multivariate analyses in the validation cohort the two signatures showed hazard ratios of 4.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-9.48; P = 0.001) and 4.08 (95% CI 1.79-9.28; P = 0.001), respectively. The 10-year event-free survival was 70% for the good risk and 20% for the high risk group. The 26-gene signatures had modest predictive value (AUC = 0.588) to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, the combination of a B-cell metagene with the prognostic signatures increased its response predictive value. We identified a 264-gene prognostic signature for TNBC which is unrelated to previously known prognostic signatures."

Recently, our group reported that one of the four GSTO genes in Drosophila, CG6781, is the structural gene of the Drosophila eye color mutant, sepia, which encodes pyrimidodiazepine synthase, a key enzyme in the drosopterin biosynthetic pathway (8.Kim J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported that expression of Drosophila melanogaster GST Sigma 1 (DmGSTS1), which is another member of the GST family in Drosophila, suppresses the phenotypes of parkin mutants and α-synuclein-expressing mutants. To elucidate the protective role of GSTO in neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated the biological function of D. melanogaster GSTO (DmGSTO) in a Drosophila model of PD. We found that one of the DmGSTOs, DmGSTO1, is able to rescue some phenotypes of parkin mutants, including the degeneration of DA neurons and muscle. The ability of DmGSTO1 to rescue these phenotypes was dependent on the catalytic activity of DmGSTO1. Furthermore, tubulin accumulation and ER stress caused by the parkin mutation were also significantly reduced by ectopic expression of DmGSTO1. We discovered that the Drosophila ATP synthase β subunit (14.Peña P. Garesse R. The β subunit of the Drosophila melanogaster ATP synthase. cDNA cloning, amino acid analysis, and identification of the protein in adult flies.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is a novel target of DmGSTO1, and up-regulation of DmGSTO1 restored glutathionylation levels of the ATP synthase β subunit in parkin mutants. The mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase is a membrane protein complex that couples the synthesis of ATP to the hydrogen ion gradient generated by the respiratory chain (15.Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R.

The up-regulation of DmGSTO1 also restored ATP synthase activity, complex assembly, and ATP levels in parkin mutants. Our findings suggest that DmGSTO1 plays a protective role in parkin mutants by regulating mitochondrial ATP synthase activity. To generate DmGSTO1 mutants, we obtained the GE26508 P-element insertion line from the GenExel Drosophila library (KAIST, Daejeon, Korea). The P-element was mobilized using transposase, and GE26508 was imprecisely excised to generate DmGSTO1null (supplemental Fig. S1A). The UAS-mitGFP line was a gift from H. J.

We generated four transgenic lines: DmGSTO1A, DmGSTO1B, DmGSTO1AC31A, and CG6662. The coding sequences for these four genes were amplified by PCR. The four PCR products were ligated into the pUAST expression vector and introduced into the germ line by microinjection. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Drosophila stocks were maintained in standard food conditions at 25 °C. The parkin null mutant line, park1, and PINK1B9 were gifts from J. Chung (Seoul National University) (18.Cha G.H. Kim S.

The Tub-Gal4 fly line and the 24B-Gal4 line were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. We obtained the ATP synthase β subunit RNAi lines, CG11154R-1 and R-3, from the NIG-FLY stock center (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). One- to two-day-old male flies were starved for 5 h and then kept in vials with 3M filter paper soaked with 20 mm paraquat (Methyl Viologen, Sigma-Aldrich) in 5% sucrose. Flies were kept in the dark at all times. Protein extracts for immunoblot analysis were prepared by homogenizing 10 fly thoraces from 3-day-old male flies in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1×; Calbiochem-Merck4Biosciences). Total protein (20 μg) was separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked by Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 4% nonfat dry milk or 4% BSA for 1 h. We used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (1:1,000; Promega), rabbit anti-JNK (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), rabbit anti-β-actin (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:4,000; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-β-tubulin (1:3,000; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α Ser-51 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-eIF2α (1:200; Abcam), rabbit anti-HSP60 (1:1,000; Stressgen Bioreagents, Kampenhout, Belgium), mouse anti-HSP/HSC70 (1:1,000; Stressgen Bioreagents), mouse anti-ATP synthase α subunit (1:20,000; Mitosciences), rabbit anti-prohibitin (1:500; Abcam), and rabbit anti-Drosophila ATP synthase β subunit (1:20,000; a kind gift from Rafael Garesse, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid). Detection of the primary antibodies was carried out with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL-Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila GSTO1A were produced by immunizing rabbits with a C-terminal synthetic peptide, 231EFQKSKTLGNPQY243, as the antigen (Abfrontier). Muscle section analysis was carried out as described previously (21.Pesah Y. Pham T. Burgess H. Middlebrooks B. Verstreken P. Zhou Y. Harding M. Bellen H. Mardon G. Drosophila parkin mutants have decreased mass and cell size and increased sensitivity to oxygen radical stress.Development. 2004; 131: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For muscle tissue analyses, whole thoraces from 3-day-old male flies were fixed with 4% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. After fixation, the samples were oxidized with 1% OsO4 for 2 h at room temperature and then dehydrated in a series of acetone/water mixtures of increasing acetone concentration (50, 70, 80, 90, and 100% acetone). The samples were embedded in Spurr's resin. The thoraces were then trimmed and sectioned from the transverse side of the thorax. The sections were stained with a toluidine blue dye and observed by light microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Axio Imager A1). Adult brains and thoraces of 1-, 3-, 5-, and 20-day-old male flies were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in a fixative buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9) and blocked in a wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 6.8) with 10 mg/ml BSA. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-TH (1:100; Pel-freeze), mouse anti-TH (1:100; Immunostar), rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (1:100; Promega), mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Roche Applied Science), and mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:100; Invitrogen) was used to identify mitochondria. Rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used to visualize actin. All images were obtained on a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope (DE/LSM510 NLO). For the TUNEL assay, apoptosis in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of 3-day-old flies was detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The PCRs were performed using Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) and TaqDNA polymerase (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) with a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research). We used the previously reported Drosophila GSTO primers for CG6776, CG6662, DmGSTO1A, and DmGSTO1B (8.Kim J. Suh H. Kim S. Kim K. Ahn C. Yim J. Identification and characteristics of the structural gene for the Drosophila eye color mutant sepia, encoding PDA synthase, a member of the Omega class glutathione S-transferases.Biochem.

The following dparkin and dPINK1 primers were used: dparkin-For (CAT ATG AGT TTT ATT TTT AAA TTT ATT GCC ACT TTT GTA C), dparkin-Rev (CTC GAG TTA GCC GAA CCA GTG GG), dPINK1-For (TTC TGC CAC CAC CGC CCC CAC ACT TC), and dPINK1-Rev (CCG CAG CAC ATT GGC AGC GGT GG). The comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was adapted to estimate transcript levels using an ABI7300 system (Applied Biosystems). The transcript levels were calculated as the relative -fold change over rp49 mRNA. We used the following primers for α-tubulin, and β-tubulin: α-tubulin-For (ACA ACG AGG CTA TCT ACG ACA TCT), α-tubulin-Rev (TTT TCA GTG TTG CAG TGA ATT TTT) (22.Hoopfer E.D. Penton A. Watts R.J.

McDonald J.F. LTR retrotransposons and the evolution of dosage compensation in Drosophila.BMC Mol. Biol. 2008; 9: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The DmGSTO1AC31A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Cosmo Genetech, Seoul, Korea). Cysteine 31 at the active site was mutated to alanine by changing the TGC codon encoding cysteine 31 to GCC. Mutated DNA was sequenced to confirm the single codon change. The DmGSTO1AC31A mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 after cloning the cDNA into a pET15b expression vector (Novagen-Merck4Biosciences). Recombinant ATP synthase β subunit (5 μg) was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), and 10 mm GSH in the presence of either recombinant DmGSTO1A or DmGSTO1B protein. After 30 min, the samples were placed on ice, and 5× non-reducing SDS loading buffer was added to the mixtures. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred, and probed with mouse anti-GSH (1:1,000; ViroGen Corp.) and rabbit anti-Drosophila ATP synthase β subunit (1:4,000) antibodies. Thoraces from 3-day-old male flies were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem-Merck4Biosciences). Thorax lysates were incubated with mouse anti-GSH antibodies (ViroGen) for 2 h at 4 °C and incubated overnight with 60 μl of a solution of 50% protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The resins were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 20 s. Bound proteins, which were glutathionylated, were eluted by boiling in a 2× non-reducing SDS loading buffer for 5 min. Materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue or silver staining. After immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-GSH antibodies (ViroGen), proteins bound to resins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) for the glutathionylation assay. Western blot analysis was carried out with rabbit anti-Drosophila ATP synthase β subunit antibodies (1:4,000). Signals were detected by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. To isolate mitochondria from fly thoraces, a mitchondria isolation kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Freshly prepared total mitochondrial protein was used for the ATP synthase activity assay. ATP synthase activity was measured by ATP hydrolysis using a spectrophotometric method described previously (24.Rosing J. Harris D.A. Kemp Jr., A. Slater E.C. Nucleotide-binding properties of native and cold-treated mitochondrial ATPase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 376: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ATP synthase was assayed in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCN, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), 15 units of pyruvate kinase (Sigma-Aldrich), 15 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich), 300 μm NADH (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 μg of total mitochondrial proteins. After 2 min of preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP. The initial velocity of the reaction was followed for 2 min at 340 nm at 37 °C. The molar extinction coefficient of NADH is 6220 m−1. Five thoraces from 3-day-old male flies were homogenized in 100 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) on ice. The homogenized samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen to inhibit ATP synthase activity. The frozen samples were boiled for 8 min to destroy endogenous ATP synthase and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. ATP was quantified in the supernatant using the ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mitochondria were isolated from 3-day-old male fly thoraces using the mitochondrial isolation kit (Pierce). Mitochondrial proteins (10 μg) were dissolved in NativePAGETM sample buffer (Invitrogen), 1% digitonin (Invitrogen), and 2% dodecylmaltoside (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min. Blue native electrophoresis was performed on NativePAGETM Novex 3–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). We previously reported that there are four different GSTO genes in D. melanogaster: CG6781 (sepia), CG6776, CG6673, and CG6662. CG6781 is the structural gene for sepia, which encodes pyrimidodiazepine synthase and is expressed exclusively in Drosophila heads (8.Kim J. Suh H. Kim S. Kim K. Ahn C. Yim J. Identification and characteristics of the structural gene for the Drosophila eye color mutant sepia, encoding PDA synthase, a member of the Omega class glutathione S-transferases.Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CG6673 is also called D. melanogaster GSTO1 (DmGSTO1) and has the highest thiol transferase and DHA reductase activity among the GSTO genes, reminiscent of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (8.Kim J. Suh H. Kim S. Kim K. Ahn C. Yim J. Identification and characteristics of the structural gene for the Drosophila eye color mutant sepia, encoding PDA synthase, a member of the Omega class glutathione S-transferases.Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CG6776 responds to heat stress in Drosophila (25.Sørensen J.G. Nielsen M.M. Kruhøffer M. Justesen J. Loeschcke V. Full genome gene expression analysis of the heat stress response in Drosophila melanogaster.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although the function of CG6662 is not known, CG6662 transcripts are primarily expressed in the ovary and testes (26.Walters K.B. Grant P. Johnson D.L. Evolution of the GST Omega gene family in 12 Drosophila species.J. Hered. 2009; 100: 742-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused our study on CG6673 (DmGSTO1) and excluded other Drosophila GSTO genes. We generated both loss-of-function and gain-of-function DmGSTO1 mutant flies. Because DmGSTO1 encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts, A and B, we created both DmGSTO1A- and DmGSTO1B-overexpressing fly lines. Loss-of-function mutant DmGSTO1null was generated by imprecise P-element excision, which resulted in partial deletion of the DmGSTO1 gene (supplemental Fig. S1A). The DmGSTO1null mutant was viable and fertile, and it exhibited no obvious defects in adult morphology. In the DmGSTO1 null mutant fly, there were no detectable levels of either DmGSTO1A or DmGSTO1B transcripts (supplemental Fig. S1B). GSTO enzymes exhibit higher glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activity than any other class of GSTs (27.Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. Identification, characterization, and crystal structure of the Omega class glutathione transferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). We have shown that DmGSTO1B has much higher DHAR activity than DmGSTO1A in vitro (8.Kim J. Suh H. Kim S. Kim K. Ahn C. Yim J. Identification and characteristics of the structural gene for the Drosophila eye color mutant sepia, encoding PDA synthase, a member of the Omega class glutathione S-transferases.Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DHAR activity in DmGSTO1null flies was dramatically decreased to ∼5% of the DHAR activity found in wild type flies (supplemental Fig. S1C). Furthermore, DmGSTO1null mutants were sensitive to paraquat, an oxidative stress inducer (Fig. 1A). Using a ubiquitous driver, Tub-Gal4, we directed expression of DmGSTO1A or DmGSTO1B in the DmGSTO1null mutant background. The paraquat sensitivity was rescued by expression of DmGSTO1B, which exhibited more oxidative stress protection than DmGSTO1A (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the paraquat-sensitive phenotype in the DmGSTO1null mutant is primarily due to the loss of DmGSTO1B function. Because DHAR catalyzes the conversion of dehydroascorbate (DHA) to ascorbate (AsA) using glutathione as a reducing agent, we investigated the level of DHA and AsA in the mutant flies. As shown in Fig. 1B, only the overexpression of DmGSTO1B rescued the AsA/DHA ratio in DmGSTO1null mutants. These results indicate that DmGSTO1B has a protective role in response to paraquat-induced stress and plays an important role in the in vivo conversion of DHA to AsA. Although it has been reported that GSTs are involved in neurodegenerative disease (13.Trinh K. Moore K. Wes P.D. Muchowski P.J. Dey J. Andrews L. Pallanck L.J.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the molecular function of GSTOs remains unknown. To investigate the biological function of DmGSTO1 in PD, we conducted genetic studies with park1 mutants. As reported previously (18.Cha G.H. Kim S. Park J. Lee E. Kim M. Lee S.B. Kim J.M. Chung J. Cho K.S. Parkin negatively regulates JNK pathway in the dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10345-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19.Park J.

Mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila PINK1 mutants is complemented by parkin.Nature. 2006; 441: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), park1 mutants showed collapsed thorax and downturned wing phenotypes. Surprisingly, increasing DmGSTO1A expression using the muscle-specific 24B-Gal4 driver significantly suppressed both thorax and wing phenotypes in park1 mutants, whereas increased DmGSTO1B expression showed no effects (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Of the GSTO genes, only the transcriptional expression of DmGSTO1, (CG6673) was decreased in park1 mutants (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1D). Because the level of DmGSTO1 mRNA decreased in park1 mutants (Fig. 2B), we investigated whether the protein levels were also decreased in park1 mutants. We generated a specific antibody against DmGSTO1A. As shown in Fig. 2C, the DmGSTO1A protein level was dramatically decreased in park1 mutants compared with wild type flies. These results indicate that parkin regulates transcriptional expression of the DmGSTO1 gene. We further examined the genetic interactions between parkin and DmGSTO1 by introducing a DmGSTO1 null mutation in the park1 mutants. We found that the loss of function of DmGSTO1 further enhanced the downturned wing and collapsed thorax phenotypes in the one-day-old park1 mutants (Fig. 2D). In the DmGSTO1null mutant, neither DmGSTO1 nor CG6662 transcripts were detected (supplemental Fig. S1B). We could eliminate the possibility that CG6662 played a role in suppressing the park1 mutant phenotype by demonstrating that CG6662 overexpression in park1 mutants had no effect on the park1 mutant phenotype (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that CG6662 is not involved in the suppression of parkin mutant phenotypes. The downturned wing and thorax disruption phenotypes of parkin mutant flies are caused by the degeneration of the IFMs (21.Pesah Y. Pham T. Burgess H. Middlebrooks B. Verstreken P. Zhou Y. Harding M.

https://openalex.org/W2046066026,"The PAX6 gene plays a crucial role in development of the eye, brain, olfactory system and endocrine pancreas. Consistent with its pleiotropic role the gene exhibits a complex developmental expression pattern which is subject to strict spatial, temporal and quantitative regulation. Control of expression depends on a large array of cis-elements residing in an extended genomic domain around the coding region of the gene. The minimal essential region required for proper regulation of this complex locus has been defined through analysis of human aniridia-associated breakpoints and YAC transgenic rescue studies of the mouse smalleye mutant. We have carried out a systematic DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) analysis across 200 kb of this critical region of mouse chromosome 2E3 to identify putative regulatory elements. Mapping the identified HSs onto a percent identity plot (PIP) shows many HSs correspond to recognisable genomic features such as evolutionarily conserved sequences, CpG islands and retrotransposon derived repeats. We then focussed on a region previously shown to contain essential long range cis-regulatory information, the Pax6 downstream regulatory region (DRR), allowing comparison of mouse HS data with previous human HS data for this region. Reporter transgenic mice for two of the HS sites, HS5 and HS6, show that they function as tissue specific regulatory elements. In addition we have characterised enhancer activity of an ultra-conserved cis-regulatory region located near Pax6, termed E60. All three cis-elements exhibit multiple spatio-temporal activities in the embryo that overlap between themselves and other elements in the locus. Using a deletion set of YAC reporter transgenic mice we demonstrate functional interdependence of the elements.

Several marine invertebrate species have invaded the U.S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast from the Caribbean and this poleward range expansion has been termed 'Caribbean Creep'. While models have predicted the continued decline of global biodiversity over the next 100 years due to global climate change, few studies have examined the episodic impacts of prolonged cold events that could impact species range expansions.A pronounced cold spell occurred in January 2010 in the U.S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast and resulted in the mortality of several terrestrial and marine species. To experimentally test whether cold-water temperatures may have caused the disappearance of one species of the 'Caribbean Creep' we exposed the non-native crab Petrolisthes armatus to different thermal treatments that mimicked abnormal and severe winter temperatures. Our findings indicate that Petrolisthes armatus cannot tolerate prolonged and extreme cold temperatures (4-6 °C) and suggest that aperiodic cold winters may be a critical 'reset' mechanism that will limit the range expansion of other 'Caribbean Creep' species.We suggest that temperature 'aberrations' such as 'cold snaps' are an important and overlooked part of climate change. These climate fluctuations should be accounted for in future studies and models, particularly with reference to introduced subtropical and tropical species and predictions of both rates of invasion and rates of unidirectional geographic expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2023922838,"Stalled biogenesis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) complex results in degradation of subunits containing redox cofactors. The conserved Oma1 metalloproteinase mediates facile Cox1 degradation in cells lacking the Coa2 assembly factor, but not in a series of other mutants stalled in CcO maturation. Oma1 is activated in coa2Δ cells, but the selective Cox1 degradation does not arise merely from its activation. Oma1 is also active in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria and cox11Δ cells impaired in CcO maturation, but this activation does not result in Oma1-mediated Cox1 degradation. The facile and selective degradation of Cox1 in coa2Δ cells, relative to other CcO assembly mutants, is likely due to impaired hemylation and subsequent misfolding of the subunit. Specific Cox1 proteolysis in coa2Δ cells arises from a combination of Oma1 activation and a susceptible conformation of Cox1."
https://openalex.org/W2098334414,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that promotes angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and other critical aspects of cancer biology. The four-and-a-half LIM domain (FHL) proteins are a family of LIM domain-only proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation and suppression of tumor growth. Here we describe functional interactions between the FHL proteins and HIF-1. FHL1-3 inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity and HIF-1α transactivation domain function by oxygen-independent mechanisms. FHL2 directly interacts with HIF-1α to repress transcriptional activity. FHL1 binds to the p300/CBP co-activators and disrupts binding with HIF-1α. FHL3 does not bind to HIF-1α or p300, indicating that it regulates transactivation by a novel molecular mechanism. Expression of the FHL proteins increased upon HIF-1α induction, suggesting the existence of a feedback loop. These results identify FHL proteins as negative regulators of HIF-1 activity, which may provide a mechanism by which they suppress tumor growth."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of apoptosis-related biological markers such as p53, bcl-2, bax, and c-myc, and clinicopathological features and their prognostic value.From 1996 to 2007, 4426 patients had undergone curative D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Among 501 patients, the expression levels of p53, bcl-2, bax, and c-myc were examined by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of biological markers and the correlation between biological markers and other clinicopathological factors were investigated.There were 339 males and 162 females with a mean age of 57. The percentages of positive expression of p53, bcl-2, bax, and c-myc were 65%, 22%, 43%, and 58%, respectively. There was a strong correlation between p53, bax, and c-myc expression (P=0.00). There was significant association between bcl-2, and bax expression (P<0.05). p53 expression correlated with histological grade (P=0.01); bcl-2 expression with pathological stage (P=0.00); bax expression with male (P=0.02), histological grade (P=0.01), Borrmann type (P=0.01), tumor location (P=0.00), lymph node metastasis (P=0.03), and pathological stage (P=0.03); c-myc expression with Borrmann type (P=0.00). bcl-2 expression was related with good survival in univariate analysis (P=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that bcl-2 expression and pathological stage were defined as independent prognostic factors. There were significant differences of overall 5-year survival rates according to bcl-2 expression or not in stage IIB (P=0.03).The expression of bcl-2 was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer; it might be a candidate for the gastric cancer staging system."
https://openalex.org/W1986835504,"Background Young men with mutations in the gene for the INSL3 receptor (Relaxin family peptide 2, RXFP2) are at risk of reduced bone mass and osteoporosis. Consistent with the human phenotype, bone analyses of Rxfp2−/− mice showed decreased bone volume, alterations of the trabecular bone, reduced mineralizing surface, bone formation, and osteoclast surface. The aim of this study was to elucidate the INSL3/RXFP2 signaling pathways and targets in human osteoblasts. Methodology/Principal Findings Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production, protein phosphorylation, intracellular calcium, gene expression, and mineralization studies have been performed. INSL3 induced a significant increase in ALP production, and Western blot and ELISA analyses of multiple intracellular signaling pathway molecules and their phosphorylation status revealed that the MAPK was the major pathway influenced by INSL3, whereas it does not modify intracellular calcium concentration. Quantitative Real Time PCR and Western blotting showed that INSL3 regulates the expression of different osteoblast markers. Alizarin red-S staining confirmed that INSL3-stimulated osteoblasts are fully differentiated and able to mineralize the extracellular matrix. Conclusions/Significance Together with previous findings, this study demonstrates that the INSL3/RXFP2 system is involved in bone metabolism by acting on the MAPK cascade and stimulating transcription of important genes of osteoblast maturation/differentiation and osteoclastogenesis."

Overexpression of FLAG-tagged wild type MLCK in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells enhanced interaction and co-localization between cortactin and p47phox at the cell periphery and ROS production, whereas abrogation of MLCK using specific siRNA significantly inhibited the above. Furthermore, HO stimulated phosphorylation of MLC and recruitment of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated cortactin, MLC, Src, and p47phox to caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM), whereas silencing nmMLCK with siRNA blocked recruitment of these components to CEM and ROS generation. Exposure of nmMLCK−/− null mice to HO (72 h) reduced ROS production, lung inflammation, and pulmonary leak compared with control mice.

In phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils, oxidase activity is known to co-sediment with the heavy plasma membrane fraction that contains actin and fodrin. Furthermore, the labile oxidase can be stabilized by chemical cross-linking that cannot be extracted by Triton X-100, suggesting interaction between the NADPH oxidase complex and actin filaments (11.El Benna J.

More recently, we observed increased recruitment of phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) to CEMs by hyperoxia; however, the role of myosin phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in endothelial NADPH oxidase activation is unclear. In endothelial cells, non-skeletal muscle (nm) MLCK exists as a high molecular mass (∼210 kDa) protein compared with the low molecular mass (∼130–160 kDa) isoform that is present in smooth muscle cells (22.Gallagher P.J.

Our results demonstrate that (i) hyperoxia-induced ROS/O2̇̄ production is attenuated by down-regulation or inhibition of nmMLCK in lung ECs, (ii) nmMLCK is essential for the translocation and association of cortactin and p47phox, (iii) down-regulation of nmMLCK expression with siRNA blocks recruitment of Src, cortactin, and p47phox and phosphorylated Src, cortactin, and MLC to CEMs, and (iv) nmMLCK knock-out mice show decreased ROS production, phosphorylation of Src, cortactin, and MLC and pulmonary leak. These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of ∼214-kDa non-muscle MLCK in the assembly and activation of non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase and ROS/(O2̇̄) production in response to hyperoxia in lung endothelium.DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here demonstrate a novel role of EC nmMLCK in regulating hyperoxia-induced ROS generation by enhancing the recruitment of cortactin, p47phox, and MLC to CEM. Our data indicate that the association between nmMLCK and cortactin and between nmMLCK and p47phox at the cell periphery was enhanced in human lung endothelial cells. Moreover, our results on regulation of hyperoxia-mediated ROS production by nmMLCK in HPAECs are consistent with the adult in vivo model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury wherein nmMLCK−/− mice exhibited less inflammation, ROS production, and pulmonary leak compared with nmMLCK wild type mice. Together these studies indicated a critical role for nmMLCK in the assembly of NADPH oxidase components in CEMs and ROS production in the endothelium.Accumulating evidence supports a role for cytoskeletal proteins including actin and cortactin in the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells (5.Touyz R.M.

In this study we demonstrate for the first time a novel and essential role for EC MLCK in modulating ROS generation in response to hyperoxia. Both smooth muscle MLCK and nmMLCK are ATP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of the regulatory 20-kDa MLC that is essential for generating cellular contractile force through an ATP-dependent actomyosin motor activity (34.Garcia J.G.

An emerging concept from our work and that of others is the requirement of a protein platform consisting of a number of cytoskeletal proteins including cortactin, Rac1, dynamin, and Src family kinases to assemble the NADPH oxidase components in response to a stimulus such as hyperoxia (9.Usatyuk P.V.

We earlier demonstrated that hyperoxia-induced ROS generation required c-Abl-mediated dynamin phosphorylation for p47phox recruitment to CEMs of the endothelium (16.Singleton P.A. Pendyala S.

In this study we have identified that nmMLCK-dependent MLC phosphorylation as part of the regulatory mechanism of hyperoxia-mediated assembly of cortactin, Src, and p47phox in CEMs of endothelial cells. Furthermore, our results also suggest that association of nmMLCK with cortactin and p47phox in response to hyperoxia is critical for ROS generation as down-regulation of nmMLCK by siRNA blocks hyperoxia-induced ROS production and enrichment of phospho-MLC, phospho-cortactin, cortactin, phospho-Src, Src, and p47phox in CEMs of human lung ECs. These results are in concurrence with a requirement of caveolin-1/lipid rafts in angiotensin type 1 receptor-mediated ROS production in vascular smooth muscle cells (47.Parton R.G. Simons K. The multiple faces of caveolae.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar).Although the precise domain interactions between nmMLCK, cortactin, and p47phox remain unknown, it has been demonstrated that the cortactin SH3 domain interaction with nmMLCK is essential for S1P-induced MLC phosphorylation in ECs (9.Usatyuk P.V.

Interestingly, nmMLCK is not only essential for hyperoxia-induced interaction between cortactin and p47phox (Fig. 4) but also for the recruitment and phosphorylation of Src and cortactin in CEMs (Fig. 7). Because Src phosphorylates cortactin, p47phox (13.Chowdhury A.K. Watkins T. Parinandi N.L. Saatian B. Kleinberg M.E. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V.

In addition to Src, nmMLCK and cortactin are tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl (9.Usatyuk P.V. Romer L.H. He D. Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.E. Zhan S. Jacobson J.R. Dudek S.M. Pendyala S. Garcia J.G.

Chem. 2009; 284: 34964-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of NADPH oxidase activation in ECs by various cytoskeletal proteins and Src family of kinases, our results provide strong evidence that nmMLCK is an important intracellular target regulating the interactions between the cytoskeleton and NADPH oxidase components and ROS generation mediated by hyperoxia.The potential role of nmMLCK and its interaction with cortactin and Src in NADPH oxidase assembly, activation, and ROS generation was investigated in an in vivo model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Utilizing nmMLCK knock-out mice, our data indicate that hyperoxia-mediated pulmonary ROS production and barrier dysfunction, as determined by influx of cells into alveolar space, BAL protein concentration, and lung inflammation as measured by proinflammatory cytokines in BAL fluid, are dependent on nmMLCK expression. Exposure of nmMLCK−/− null mice to hyperoxia resulted in less ROS, protein in BAL fluids, and inflammation in the lung. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed decreased phosphorylation of MLC, Src, and cortactin in lung tissues from nmMLCK−/− null mice compared with the nmMLCK wild type mice, suggesting a potential link between nmMLCK, phosphorylation of cortactin, and Src and ROS generation in vivo. These results from a murine model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury indicate nmMLCK knock-out mice are protected from oxidant-induced lung injury due to a deficiency in the assembly of NADPH oxidase components that require phosphorylation of cortactin, Src, and MLC in the lung. As nmMLCK−/− mice lack expression of nmMLCK in various vascular cell types, the role of lung endothelial nmMLCK in hyperoxia-induced ROS production and cytoskeletal redistribution to cell periphery was investigated. Our results show that mouse lung ECs deficient in nmMLCK exhibited reduced ROS/O2̇̄ production and redistribution of p-Src and p-cortactin to the cell periphery in response to hyperoxia. However, expression of human nmMLCK+/+ in nmMLCK-deficient mouse lung ECs resulted in restoration of hyperoxia-induced ROS/O2̇̄ generation and translocation of p-Src and p-cortactin to the cell periphery, indicating a definite role for EC nmMLCK in hyperoxia response. However, these studies do not rule out the participation of nmMLCK in other vascular cell types and non-hemopoietic cells in hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Further investigation on nmMLCK involvement from other cell types is necessary to determine their role in hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and injury.In summary, we have demonstrated a novel role for nmMLCK in hyperoxia-induced translocation of cortactin, Src, and p47phox to CEMs and generation of ROS. Furthermore, nmMLCK-mediated phosphorylation of MLC and interactions between nmMLCK, cortactin, Src, and p47phox suggest an essential requirement of a protein platform consisting of several cytoskeletal proteins including actin and myosin for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase in the endothelium (Fig. 11). Hyperoxia-induced lung injury is clinically relevant in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm babies exposed to high oxygen tension and in ventilator-induced lung injury of critically ill patients requiring ventilation in the intensive care unit. Thus, targeting of nmMLCK1 and other splice variants may provide a new therapeutic intervention in the management of acute lung injury in preterm babies and critically ill patients.

As one of the many potential sources of ROS, vascular NADPH oxidase plays a significant role in basal as well as agonist-mediated ROS/(O2̇̄) generation (2.Pendyala S. Usatyuk P.V. Gorshkova I.A.

Activation of phagocytic NADPH oxidase requires the assembly of the cytosolic p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac2 with membrane-associated cytochrome b558 reductase, which consists of p22phox and gp91phox also known as Nox2 (2.Pendyala S.

In phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils, oxidase activity is known to co-sediment with the heavy plasma membrane fraction that contains actin and fodrin. Furthermore, the labile oxidase can be stabilized by chemical cross-linking that cannot be extracted by Triton X-100, suggesting interaction between the NADPH oxidase complex and actin filaments (11.El Benna J.

However, the mechanism(s) involving cytoskeletal proteins in the regulation NADPH-oxidase function is not completely understood.We recently demonstrated that hyperoxia induces recruitment of cortactin, p47phox, Rac1, and dynamin2 to caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM), and silencing of dynamin2 with siRNA attenuated hyperoxia-induced ROS/O2̇̄ production and recruitment of p47phox to CEMs (16.Singleton P.A.

Our results demonstrate that (i) hyperoxia-induced ROS/O2̇̄ production is attenuated by down-regulation or inhibition of nmMLCK in lung ECs, (ii) nmMLCK is essential for the translocation and association of cortactin and p47phox, (iii) down-regulation of nmMLCK expression with siRNA blocks recruitment of Src, cortactin, and p47phox and phosphorylated Src, cortactin, and MLC to CEMs, and (iv) nmMLCK knock-out mice show decreased ROS production, phosphorylation of Src, cortactin, and MLC and pulmonary leak. These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of ∼214-kDa non-muscle MLCK in the assembly and activation of non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase and ROS/(O2̇̄) production in response to hyperoxia in lung endothelium."

The biological outcome of TNFα treatment is determined by the balance between survival factors and Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, which promotes cell death. Here, we show that TRAF7, the most recently identified member of the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) family of proteins, is essential for activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation. We also show that TRAF6 and TRAF7 promote unconventional polyubiquitination of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIPL and demonstrate that degradation of c-FLIPL also occurs through a lysosomal pathway. RNA interference-mediated depletion of TRAF7 correlates with increased c-FLIPL expression level, which, in turn, results in resistance to TNFα cytotoxicity. Collectively, our results indicate an important role for TRAF7 in the activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation and clearly point to an involvement of this protein in regulating the turnover of c-FLIP and, consequently, cell death.

Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), also known as Casper, iFLICE, FLAME-1, CASJ, CLARP, MRIT, or usurpin, is known as a crucial inhibitor of death receptor-mediated apoptosis by interfering with caspase-8 activation at the DISC signaling (6.Micheau O. Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein: an attractive therapeutic target?.Exp. Opin. Ther.

As a characteristic feature, c-FLIP proteins contain tandem death effector domains, and all three isoforms of c-FLIP can be recruited to the DISC through an interaction of their tandem death effector domains with the adaptor protein FADD. Due to its structural similarity to caspase-8 and caspase-10, c-FLIP can therefore remain bound to FADD and inhibit complete caspase-8 processing and activation (8.Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S.

Consistent with its role of crucial negative regulator of the apoptotic pathway, c-FLIP has been found overexpressed in different types of cancer. Increased levels of c-FLIP have been observed in a large number of tumor cell lines of various type, including carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma (10.Shirley S.

Generally, a high level of c-FLIP expression correlates with a more aggressive form of the tumor and with a poor prognosis (18.Djerbi M. Screpanti V. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. The inhibitor of death receptor signaling, FLICE-inhibitory protein defines a new class of tumor progression factors.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). For this, c-FLIP represents a promising target for cancer therapy, and a large amount of work is currently underway to validate c-FLIP as a therapeutic target to restore and/or increase an apoptotic response in cancer cells (10.Shirley S.

However, in addition to transcriptional regulation, c-FLIP expression level is also greatly regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. In fact, c-FLIP expression is regulated by heat stress (22.Tran S.E. Meinander A. Holmström T.H. Rivero-Müller A. Heiskanen K.M. Linnau E.K. Courtney M.J. Mosser D.D. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Lentiviral vectors expressing shTRAF7 RNAs were obtained from Sigma and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids encoding mutant ubiquitins were a kind gift of Dr. C. Sasakawa, University of Tokyo. Sources of antisera and monoclonal antibodies were the following: anti-c-FLIP and anti-Fas from Alexis; anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin from Sigma; anti-phosho-Jun, anti-phosho-p38, anti-p38, and anti-JNK1/3 (anti-JNK) from Cell Signaling; and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1), anti-phosho-JNK, and anti-HA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TNFα, MG132, leupeptin, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Cell lysates were made in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and immunocomplexes were bound to protein A/G (Roche Applied Science), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot assay. To assess AP1 activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmidic DNAs together with pAP-1-luc (Clontech) in 6-well plates. 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Plasmids expressing RSV-β-galactosidase or TK-Renilla were used in transfection mixtures to normalize for efficiency of transfection. In vitro kinase assay was performed as reported by Herr et al. (35.Herr I. Krilleke D. Debatin K.M.

Briefly, following stimulation, cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated with protein A-Sepharose beads. Then, samples were spun down and washed to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of nonradioactive ATP and GST-c-JUN 1–79 fusion protein for 25 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli buffer, and samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. After blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane, phosphorylated c-Jun protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically raised against phosphorylated Ser-73. Signals were developed by ECL. A total of 8 × 103 cells per well was cultured in a flat-bottom 96-well plate in quadruplicates in 10% FBS/DMEM medium. Cell viability was determined using an ATPLiteTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. from a number of samples as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance of two-group comparisons. Multiple comparisons statistical significance was verified by analysis of variance with a one-tailed F-test, the posthoc Tukey honestly significant difference test, and Bonferroni and Dunnett corrections. We and others have previously reported that ectopic expression of TRAF7 induces activation of AP1 transcription factor (28.Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K.

To verify whether TRAF7 plays a physiological role in TNFR1 signaling, we determined the effect of RNA interference-mediated depletion of TRAF7 on TNFα-induced AP1 activation, as assessed by an AP1-luciferase reporter assay. For this, HEK293 cells, transfected with a vector encoding for a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to target human TRAF7 (30.Zotti T. Vito P. Stilo R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) or a scramble shRNA, were exposed to TNFα for 6 h, and luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, depletion of TRAF7 reduces AP1 transcriptional activity induced by TNFα exposure. This effect was specific for the TNFR1 signaling, because AP1 activity induced by a constitutively active mutant of MEKK7 was not altered by TRAF7 depletion in the same cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined whether induction of AP1 activity due to TRAF7 expression occurs through activation of JNK. To this end, HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression vector empty or encoding for TRAF7, and the activation state of JNK was monitored by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, TRAF7 expression induces activation of JNK, independently of TNFα stimulation. Activation of JNK following TRAF7 expression was confirmed by immunoblot assays probed with anti phospho-JNK antibodies (Fig. 1C). Finally, we determined whether TRAF7 function is required for JNK activation following TNFα stimulation. Thus, HEK293 cells depleted of TRAF7 were exposed to TNFα. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays. The result of the experiment, shown in Fig. 1D, indicates that depletion of TRAF7 reduces activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation. Overall, from these experiments we concluded that TRAF7 expression is sufficient for JNK activation, and its function is required for complete activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation. It is known that TNFα-mediated JNK activation accelerates turnover of c-FLIPL via induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which specifically polyubiquitinates c-FLIPL, thereby inducing its proteasomal degradation (23.Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. The E3 ubiquitin ligase itch couples JNK activation to TNFα-induced cell death by inducing c-FLIP(L) turnover.Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that TRAF7 mediates polyubiquitination events that play a key role in regulating cellular functions (31.Zotti T. Uva A. Ferravante A. Vessichelli M. Scudiero I. Ceccarelli M. Vito P. Stilo R. TRAF7 protein promotes Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination of IkB kinase (IKKγ)/NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO) and p65/RelA protein and represses NF-kB activation.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 22924-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we examined whether TRAF7 influences the ubiquitination state of c-FLIP. For this, we transfected HEK293 cells with TRAF7 and assessed the ubiquitination state of endogenous c-FLIPL by immunoblot experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, TRAF7 expression promotes polyubiquitination of endogenous c-FLIPL and correlates with a reduction in the expression level of c-FLIPL (Fig. 2B). Because ubiquitin possesses seven lysines (Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48 and Lys-63), and the fate of ubiquitinated proteins depends on the K-type of ubiquitin linkage, we used a series of ubiquitin mutants possessing single lysine residues to investigate the nature of TRAF7-mediated polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL. In the presence of TRAF7, c-FLIPL was polyubiquitinated by Lys-29-, Lys-33-, Lys-63-, and, to a lesser extent, by Lys-48-linked ubiquitin mutants (Fig. 2C). Given this result, we examined whether also TRAF6, another member of the TRAF family that promotes polyubiquitination (36.Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Activation of the IkB kinase complex by TRAF6 requires a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex and a unique polyubiquitin chain.Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar), was capable of inducing polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2D, TRAF6 induced polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL, although with a pattern different than that used by TRAF7. Indeed, TRAF6 triggered Lys-27-, Lys-29-, and, to a lesser extent, Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL. Interestingly, TRAF6, but not TRAF7, also promoted a weak polyubiquitination of JNK (Fig. 2E). It is known that, although Lys-48 polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, unconventional Lys-29 polyubiquitination promotes lysosomal protein degradation (37.Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. Itch/AIP4 mediates Deltex degradation through the formation of K29-linked polyubiquitin chains.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, we tried to determine whether, in addition to proteasomal degradation, also lysosomal mechanisms regulate the expression level of c-FLIPL. To do this, we used a very sensitive cellular experimental system, the EFs from TRAF2−/− mice. In fact, these cells are particularly sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of TNFα, because they express very low levels of c-FLIPL due to a rapid degradation of this protein (38.Guiet C. Silvestri E. De Smaele E. Franzoso G. Vito P. c-FLIP efficiently rescues TRAF-2−/− cells from TNF-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we monitored the expression levels of c-FLIPL in TRAF2−/− EFs untreated or treated with lysosomal (leupeptin + NH4Cl) or proteasomal (MG132) inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, TRAF2−/− EFs express almost undetectable levels of c-FLIPL. Treatment with MG132 restores c-FLIPL expression, confirming the existence of a proteasomal-mediated degradation of the protein (24.Fukazawa T. Fujiwara T. Uno F. Teraishi F. Kadowaki Y. Itoshima T. Takata Y. Kagawa S. Roth J.A. Tschopp J. Tanaka N. Accelerated degradation of cellular FLIP protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in p53-mediated apoptosis of human cancer cells.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5225-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36.Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Activation of the IkB kinase complex by TRAF6 requires a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex and a unique polyubiquitin chain.Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-FLIPL expression was also restored in cells exposed to lysosomal inhibitors. Significantly, also treatment with cycloheximide, which inhibits the lysosomal proteases cathepsins, restores c-FLIPL expression in TRAF2−/− EFs. Collectively, these results show, for the first time, that degradation of c-FLIPL also occurs through a lysosomal pathway, which, together with the proteasomal pathway, regulates the expression level of this protein. The recovery of c-FLIPL due to proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors is functionally relevant, because TRAF2−/− EFs treated with these inhibitors are considerably resistant to TNFα cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B) and show a lower level of caspase-8 activation following TNFα stimulation (Fig. 3C). To verify that the protective effect exerted by lysosomal inhibitors was not limited to the TRAF2−/− murine EFs, we depleted TRAF2 from the human cell line HEK293 via infection with a retroviral vector encoding a shRNA targeting human TRAF2. As shown in Fig. 3D, also in this experimental system lysosomal inhibitors confer resistance to TNFα cytotoxicity. Lysosomal inhibitors treatment induces accumulation of c-FLIPL also in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 (Fig. 3E). Next, we examined whether TRAF7 was involved in the degradation of c-FLIP in TRAF2−/− EFs. To do this, we abrogated TRAF7 expression in TRAF2−/− EFs via infection with a retroviral vector encoding two different shRNA designed to target murine TRAF7. As shown in Fig. 4A, depletion of TRAF7 in TRAF2−/− EFs correlated with an increase in the level of c-FLIPL expression, which, in turn, correlated with resistance to the cytotoxic activity of TNFα (Fig. 4B). The same result (Fig. 4C) was obtained using p65−/− EFs, which, similarly to the TRAF2−/− EFs, are sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of TNFα (39.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. An essential role for NF-kB in preventing TNF-α-induced cell death.Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). We also determined whether the resistance to TNFα cytotoxicity observed following abrogation of TRAF7 is due to the positive effect that TRAF7 plays on JNK activation. For this, we used EFs derived from mice deficient for both JNK1 and JNK2 (JNK−/− double knock out), which do not display TNFα-inducible c-FLIPL proteasomal degradation (23.Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. The E3 ubiquitin ligase itch couples JNK activation to TNFα-induced cell death by inducing c-FLIP(L) turnover.Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Normally, these cells are more resistant than normal EFs to the cytotoxic action of TNFα, yet cell death can be observed following exposure to TNFα in the presence of cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 5, TRAF7 depletion resulted in increased survival of JNK−/− DKO EFs following treatment with TNFα, indicating that resistance to apoptosis due to TRAF7 deficiency is independent of JNK function. Finally, we examined whether the observation obtained using cell lines derived from knockout mice was extensible to other cell types. For this, we used two well known cellular systems, namely Jurkat cells and HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, Jurkat cells depleted of TRAF7 were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic activity of both anti-Fas and TNFα. In addition, TRAF7-depleted Jurkat cells showed a remarkable accumulation of c-FLIPL following TNFα stimulation (Fig. 6B). Similarly, TRAF7-depleted HeLa cells showed an increased expression level of both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS following TNFα stimulation (Fig. 6C). There are several aspects that make particularly interesting the finding we report herein. The first one is the demonstration that TRAF7 is required for activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation. It is well established that, following TNFα stimulation, the balance between NF-κB and JNK activities determines the outcome of TNFR1 signaling, such that NF-κB promotes cell survival, whereas JNK activation enhances TNFα-induced death (40.Karin M. Lin A. NF-kB at the crossroads of life and death.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). Therefore, the discovery here that TRAF7 has an essential role in activation of JNK following TNFα stimulation is, per se, valuable information that adds a further element in the map of knowledge we have about TNFR1 signaling. At least in part, JNK activity controls TNFα-induced death through the proteasomal processing of c-FLIPL via activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch (23.Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. The E3 ubiquitin ligase itch couples JNK activation to TNFα-induced cell death by inducing c-FLIP(L) turnover.Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This brings us to the second important finding contained in this report: i.e., the evidence for a lysosomal pathway that controls c-FLIPL turnover. This discovery is significant and potentially of great consequence, because many in vitro studies have demonstrated the importance of the role of c-FLIPL in resistance to apoptosis induced by death receptors and to conventional chemotherapy (10.Shirley S. Micheau O.T. Cancer Lett. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Yang J.K. FLIP as an anti-cancer therapeutic target.Yonsei Med. J. 2008; 29: 19-27Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of c-FLIP is often identified in malignant cancers, and it strongly correlates with a poor prognosis (10.Shirley S. Micheau O.T. Cancer Lett. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Yang J.K. FLIP as an anti-cancer therapeutic target.Yonsei Med. J. 2008; 29: 19-27Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, preclinical data clearly indicate that selective inhibitors of c-FLIP, in combination with conventional chemotherapy, could represent an effective antitumor therapy (41.Longley D.B. Wilson T.R. McEwan M. Allen W.L. McDermott U. Galligan L. Johnston P.G. c-FLIP inhibits chemotherapy-induced colorectal cancer cell death.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 42.Chawla-Sarkar M. Bae S.I. Reu F.J. Jacobs B.S. Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. Downregulation of Bcl-2, FLIP or IAPs (XIAP and survivin) by siRNAs sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 43.Galligan L. Longley D.B. McEwan M. Wilson T.R. McLaughlin K. Johnston P.G. Chemotherapy and TRAIL-mediated colon cancer cell death. The roles of p53, TRAIL receptors, and c-FLIP.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 2026-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, the finding here, that a lysosomal degradation pathway regulates cellular turnover of c-FLIPL, offers additional tools for anticancer strategies based on down-regulation of c-FLIP. The last, but not less important aspect emphasized in this report, is that TRAF7 is involved in regulating the expression level of c-FLIPL to different degrees. First, TRAF7 could regulate degradation of c-FLIPL via activation of JNK and, thus, through the pathway JNK/Itch/proteasome described by Chang et al. (23.Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. The E3 ubiquitin ligase itch couples JNK activation to TNFα-induced cell death by inducing c-FLIP(L) turnover.Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The evidence that TRAF7 promotes Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of c-FLIP (Fig. 2B) is consistent with this possibility. However, it should definitely be noted that TRAF7 promotes Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL, and this type of polyubiquitination has been associated with lysosomal degradation of proteins (37.Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. Itch/AIP4 mediates Deltex degradation through the formation of K29-linked polyubiquitin chains.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Also striking is the evidence that lysosomal degradation of proteins by Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination occurs through the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch (37.Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. Itch/AIP4 mediates Deltex degradation through the formation of K29-linked polyubiquitin chains.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, because TRAF6 promotes polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL, it would be interesting to see if it regulates the expression level of c-FLIPL as well. However, this analysis is complicated by the fact that TRAF6 is a potent activator of NF-κB, which, in turn, positively regulates transcription of c-FLIP (19.Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. NF-κB signals induce the expression of c-FLIP.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 20.Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. NF-κB inducers upregulate cFLIP, a cycloheximide-sensitive inhibitor of death receptor signaling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Also intriguing is the experiment conducted on the JNK−/− DKO EFs, which would suggest that the positive effect exerted by TRAF7 depletion on c-FLIPL turnover is independent of JNK function. Clearly, our work opens many interesting questions concerning TRAF7 function that require further investigation. In this context, the generation of animal models genetically modified in the locus encoding for TRAF7 will certainly be of enormous value to finally define the physiological role of this protein.

Although these enzymes play important roles in a variety of cellular processes, aberrant PRMT activity is associated with several disease states, including heart disease and cancer. In an effort to guide the development of inhibitors targeting individual PRMTs, we initiated studies to characterize the molecular mechanisms of PRMT catalysis. Herein, we report studies on the kinetic mechanism of PRMT6. Initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end analog inhibition studies with the AcH4-21 and R1 peptides, as well as their monomethylated versions, indicate, in contrast to a previous report, that PRMT6 utilizes a rapid equilibrium random mechanism with dead-end EAP and EBQ complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2164148604,"Understanding gene flow in genetically modified (GM) crops is critical to answering questions regarding risk-assessment and the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops. In two field experiments, we tested whether rates of cross-pollination differed between GM and non-GM lines of the predominantly self-pollinating wheat Triticum aestivum. In the first experiment, outcrossing was studied within the field by planting ""phytometers"" of one line into stands of another line. In the second experiment, outcrossing was studied over distances of 0.5-2.5 m from a central patch of pollen donors to adjacent patches of pollen recipients. Cross-pollination and outcrossing was detected when offspring of a pollen recipient without a particular transgene contained this transgene in heterozygous condition. The GM lines had been produced from the varieties Bobwhite or Frisal and contained Pm3b or chitinase/glucanase transgenes, respectively, in homozygous condition. These transgenes increase plant resistance against pathogenic fungi. Although the overall outcrossing rate in the first experiment was only 3.4%, Bobwhite GM lines containing the Pm3b transgene were six times more likely than non-GM control lines to produce outcrossed offspring. There was additional variation in outcrossing rate among the four GM-lines, presumably due to the different transgene insertion events. Among the pollen donors, the Frisal GM line expressing a chitinase transgene caused more outcrossing than the GM line expressing both a chitinase and a glucanase transgene. In the second experiment, outcrossing after cross-pollination declined from 0.7-0.03% over the test distances of 0.5-2.5 m. Our results suggest that pollen-mediated gene flow between GM and non-GM wheat might only be a concern if it occurs within fields, e.g. due to seed contamination. Methodologically our study demonstrates that outcrossing rates between transgenic and other lines within crops can be assessed using a phytometer approach and that gene-flow distances can be efficiently estimated with population-level PCR analyses."

Evidence suggests that temperature preference behavior (TPB) in Drosophila melanogaster, one of poikilothermal animals, is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling in mushroom bodies of the brain. However, downstream targets for the PKA signaling in this behavior have not been identified. From a genome-wide search for the genes regulated by PKA activity in the mushroom bodies, we identified the cyp6a17 Cytochrome P450 gene as a new target for PKA. Our detailed analysis of mutants by genetic, molecular and behavioral assays shows that cyp6a17 is essential for temperature preference behavior. cyp6a17 expression is enriched in the mushroom bodies of the adult brain. Tissue-specific knockdown and rescue experiments demonstrate that cyp6a17 is required in the mushroom bodies for normal temperature preference behavior. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to show PKA-dependent expression of a cytochrome P450 gene in the mushroom bodies and its role as a key factor for temperature preference behavior. Taken together, this study reveals a new PKA-Cytochrome P450 pathway that regulates the temperature preference behavior."

In this paper we show that removing the fixed negative charge of a single acidic amino acid (Glu(51)) in the lateral entrance to the transmembrane pore markedly attenuates the effect of ivermectin on Ca(2+) current and channel gating.

https://openalex.org/W2050305574,"Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative, multisystem disorder characterized by severe phenotypes developing in infancy. Recently, mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated co-chaperone SIL1/BAP were identified to be the major cause of MSS. SIL1 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP, the ER Hsp70 orthologue, which plays an essential role in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptide chains in the ER. SIL1 facilitates the release of BiP from unfolded protein substrates, enabling the subsequent folding and transport of the protein. Although most mutations leading to MSS result in deletion of the majority of the protein, three separate mutations have been identified that disrupt only the last five or six amino acids of the protein, which were assumed to encode a divergent ER retention motif. This study presents an in depth analysis of two of these mutants and reveals that the phenotype in the affected individuals is not likely to be due to depletion of SIL1 from the ER via secretion. Instead, our analyses show that the mutant proteins are particularly unstable and either form large aggregates in the ER or are rapidly degraded via the proteasome. In agreement with our findings, homology modeling suggests that the very C-terminal residues of SIL1 play a role in its structural integrity rather than its localization. These new insights might be a first step toward a possible pharmacological treatment of certain types of MSS by specifically stabilizing the mutant SIL1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1974714180,"In the past 30 years, the average age of biomedical researchers has steadily increased. The average age of an investigator at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) rose from 39 to 51 between 1980 and 2008. The aging of the biomedical workforce was even more apparent when looking at first-time NIH grantees. The average age of a new investigator was 42 in 2008, compared to 36 in 1980. To determine if the rising barriers at NIH for entry in biomedical research might impact innovative ideas and research, we analyzed the research and publications of Nobel Prize winners from 1980 to 2010 to assess the age at which their pioneering research occurred. We established that in the 30-year period, 96 scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine or chemistry for work related to biomedicine, and that their groundbreaking research was conducted at an average age of 41—one year younger than the average age of a new investigator at NIH. Furthermore, 78% of the Nobel Prize winners conducted their research before the age of 51, the average age of an NIH principal investigator. This suggested that limited access to NIH might inhibit research potential and novel projects, and could impact biomedicine and the next generation scientists in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2011651289,"Introduction Cardiovascular agents are pivotal in the therapy of heart failure. Apart from their action on ventricular contractility and systemic afterload, they affect pulmonary arteries and veins. Although these effects are crucial in heart failure with coexisting pulmonary hypertension or lung oedema, they are poorly defined, especially in pulmonary veins. Therefore, we investigated the pulmonary vascular effects of adrenoceptor agonists, vasopressin and angiotensin II in the model of precision-cut lung slices that allows simultaneous studies of pulmonary arteries and veins. Materials and Methods Precision-cut lung slices were prepared from guinea pigs and imaged by videomicroscopy. Concentration-response curves of cardiovascular drugs were analysed in pulmonary arteries and veins. Results Pulmonary veins responded stronger than arteries to α1-agonists (contraction) and β2-agonists (relaxation). Notably, inhibition of β2-adrenoceptors unmasked the α1-mimetic effect of norepinephrine and epinephrine in pulmonary veins. Vasopressin and angiotensin II contracted pulmonary veins via V1a and AT1 receptors, respectively, without affecting pulmonary arteries. Discussion Vasopressin and (nor)epinephrine in combination with β2-inhibition caused pulmonary venoconstriction. If applicable in humans, these treatments would enhance capillary hydrostatic pressures and lung oedema, suggesting their cautious use in left heart failure. Vice versa, the prevention of pulmonary venoconstriction by AT1 receptor antagonists might contribute to their beneficial effects seen in left heart failure. Further, α1-mimetic agents might exacerbate pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure by contracting pulmonary arteries, whereas vasopressin might not."
https://openalex.org/W2048846922,"Staphylococcus aureus is part of the indigenous microbiota of humans. Sometimes, S. aureus bacteria enter the bloodstream, where they form infections on implanted cardiovascular devices. A critical, first step in such infections is a bond that forms between fibronectin-binding protein (FnBP) on S. aureus and host proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn), that coat the surface of implants in vivo. In this study, native FnBPs on living S. aureus were shown to form a mechanically strong conformational structure with Fn by atomic force microscopy. The tensile acuity of this bond was probed for 46 bloodstream isolates, each from a patient with a cardiovascular implant. By analyzing the force spectra with the worm-like chain model, we determined that the binding events were consistent with a multivalent, cluster bond consisting of ~10 or ~80 proteins in parallel. The dissociation rate constant (k(off), s(-1)) of each multibond complex was determined by measuring strength as a function of the loading rate, normalized by the number of bonds. The bond lifetime (1/k(off)) was two times longer for bloodstream isolates from patients with an infected device (1.79 or 69.47 s for the 10- or 80-bond clusters, respectively; n = 26 isolates) relative to those from patients with an uninfected device (0.96 or 34.02 s; n = 20 isolates). This distinction could not be explained by different amounts of FnBP, as confirmed by Western blots. Rather, amino acid polymorphisms within the Fn-binding repeats of FnBPA explain, at least partially, the statistically (p < 0.05) longer bond lifetime for isolates associated with an infected cardiovascular device."
https://openalex.org/W2161890011,"The vertebrate skull evolved to protect the brain and sense organs, but with the appearance of jaws and associated forces there was a remarkable structural diversification. This suggests that the evolution of skull form may be linked to these forces, but an important area of debate is whether bone in the skull is minimised with respect to these forces, or whether skulls are mechanically “over-designed” and constrained by phylogeny and development. Mechanical analysis of diapsid reptile skulls could shed light on this longstanding debate. Compared to those of mammals, the skulls of many extant and extinct diapsids comprise an open framework of fenestrae (window-like openings) separated by bony struts (e.g., lizards, tuatara, dinosaurs and crocodiles), a cranial form thought to be strongly linked to feeding forces. We investigated this link by utilising the powerful engineering approach of multibody dynamics analysis to predict the physiological forces acting on the skull of the diapsid reptile Sphenodon. We then ran a series of structural finite element analyses to assess the correlation between bone strain and skull form. With comprehensive loading we found that the distribution of peak von Mises strains was particularly uniform throughout the skull, although specific regions were dominated by tensile strains while others were dominated by compressive strains. Our analyses suggest that the frame-like skulls of diapsid reptiles are probably optimally formed (mechanically ideal: sufficient strength with the minimal amount of bone) with respect to functional forces; they are efficient in terms of having minimal bone volume, minimal weight, and also minimal energy demands in maintenance."

These fluctuating helices are likely to contribute to a proper conformation of HSP70 for J-domain binding other than directly bind with the J domain. Our findings provide an alternative mechanism of allosteric activation for functional regulation of HSP70 by its J-domain co-chaperones. The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) 2The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinHSJH. sapiens J-domain proteinNBDnucleotide-binding domainJDJ-domainTrxthioredoxinSBDsubstrate-binding domain. are the most ubiquitous and important chaperones that function in many biological events including protein folding and assembly, post-translational modification, transportation, and secretion, and degradation (1.Kampinga H.H.

The HSP70 protein is comprised of an N-terminal 44-kDa ATPase domain (also called nucleotide-binding domain, NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD), which can be further divided into an 18-kDa β-sandwich subdomain (also called SBD-β) forming a hydrophobic binding pocket, and a C-terminal 10-kDa α-helical subdomain (SBD-α) that acts as a lid over the binding pocket (2.Zhu X.

The multiple functions of HSP70 are well regulated in cells by different J-domain (JD) co-chaperones, such as HSP40 (4.Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Mechanisms for regulation of Hsp70 function by Hsp40.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The J domain-containing co-chaperones are required for regulating the ATPase activity of HSP70 and subsequently modulate the substrate binding and ATPase cycle (5.Mayer M.P. Bukau B.

Homo sapiens J domain protein (HSJ1), also called DNAJB2, is a J domain-containing co-chaperone and preferentially expressed in neural tissues (6.Cheetham M.E. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Human homologues of the bacterial heat-shock protein DnaJ are preferentially expressed in neurons.Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There are two alternatively spliced isoforms identified, HSJ1a and HSJ1b. HSJ1a has been reported to function in regulating the ATPase activity of HSP70 and substrate binding (7.Cheetham M.E.

Co-chaperone HSJ1a dually regulates the proteasomal degradation of ataxin-3.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e19763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our current research has revealed that HSJ1a can regulate the proteasomal degradation of polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 by dual association with HSP70 and ubiquitin (8.Gao X.C. Zhou C.J. Zhou Z.R.

Although it is well known that the J domain of HSJ1a (HSJ1a_JD) is responsible for HSP70 binding and subsequent substrate fate determination, the mechanism of the interaction between HSJ1a_JD and HSP70 and the regulation has not been understood yet. Since the 1990s, several structures of J domains from different protein species have been solved and their interactions with HSP70 have also been well studied (9.Szyperski T. Pellecchia M. Wall D.

It is well established that the J domain, particularly its conserved HPD motif, specifically binds to HSP70 (12.Tsai J. Douglas M.G. A conserved HPD sequence of the J-domain is necessary for YDJ1 stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity at a site distinct from substrate binding.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, details of the J-domain binding to mammalian HSP70 has not been clearly addressed, and the molecular mechanism of the J-domain binding and ATPase activation is still obscure. Previous study showed that the ATPase domain of DnaK, a prokaryotic homolog of mammalian HSP70, provides the basic binding mode for the J domain of DnaJ (13.Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Role of the J-domain in the cooperation of Hsp40 with Hsp70.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of auxilin J domain complexed with a C-terminally truncated form of bovine HSC70 was also solved (14.Jiang J. Maes E.G. Taylor A.B. Wang L. Hinck A.P. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Structural basis of J cochaperone binding and regulation of Hsp70.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 422-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but the two molecules were covalently linked together by a disulfide. This structure of HSC70/auxilin_JD complex revealed that both the nucleotides and J domain modulate the linker conformation and the NBD-SBD interactions of HSC70. Our current study indicates that HSJ1a dually regulates the protein levels of ataxin-3 through binding of the J domain with HSP70 and the UIM domain with polyUb chains (8.Gao X.C. Zhou C.J. Zhou Z.R. Zhang Y.H. Zheng X.M. Song A.X. Hu H.Y. Co-chaperone HSJ1a dually regulates the proteasomal degradation of ataxin-3.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e19763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical investigation, we herein report that the C-terminal helical subdomain of HSP70 is essential for binding with the J domain of HSJ1a, and the specific binding is the basis for stimulating the ATPase activity of HSP70. The binding of the J domain to HSP70 may cause an allosteric activation of the ATPase domain of HSP70 through conformational fluctuation of the C-terminal subdomain and thus the entire HSP70 protein. The encoding sequences for HSJ1a (residues 1–274) and HSJ1a_JD (1–91, 1–75) were amplified via PCR. The PCR products were cloned into pGEX-4T-3 or pET22b+ vector for bacterial expression using BamH I/XhoI or NdeI/XhoI cloning sites. HSP70 (residues 1–641) and its fragments (1–384, 1–561, 1–595, 1–610, and 1–631) were cloned into pET22b+ expression vector (15.Huang C. Cheng H. Hao S. Zhou H. Zhang X. Gao J. Sun Q.H. Hu H. Wang C.C. Heat shock protein 70 inhibits α-synuclein fibril formation via interactions with diverse intermediates.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HSP537–610 was cloned to pET32M vector to express thioredoxin (Trx)-fused protein. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids encoding His-tagged or GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The His-tagged proteins were purified through a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. GST and its fusion proteins were purified using the glutathione Sepharose-4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The HSP537–610 peptide was obtained by cleaving the Trx-fused protein with thrombin. The 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled HSJ1a_JD and HSP537–610 proteins were prepared by using the M9 minimal medium containing 15N-NH4Cl and/or 13C6-d-glucose, and purified by a Ni2+-NTA affinity column. All the proteins were further purified by Superdex-75 column chromatography on FPLC (GE Healthcare). Circular dichroic spectra were obtained by using a J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO) as previously described (16.Li H.T. Du H.N. Tang L. Hu J. Hu H.Y.

Experiments were performed at room temperature in 2.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. All CD spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 190–250 nm and processed by averaging three scans of a sample. The purified GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione Sepharose-4B beads in a PBS buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) at 4 °C for 1 h. The His-tagged proteins were incubated with the immobilized GST or GST-fusion proteins at 4 °C. After incubating for 2 h, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with the same buffer, and then eluted by a GSH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm GSH, pH 8.0). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining. 15N/13C-labeled HSJ1a_JD (1–91) or HSP537–610 with a concentration of ∼1 mm was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. All of the heteronuclear spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. Sequence-specific assignments for the J domain were performed as described (17.Gao Y.G. Yan X.Z. Song A.X. Chang Y.G. Gao X.C. Jiang N. Zhang Q. Hu H.Y. Structural insights into the specific binding of huntingtin proline-rich region with the SH3 and WW domains.Structure. 2006; 14: 1755-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For NMR titration experiments, 15N-labeled J-domain protein at the molar concentration of 0.2 mm was used to be titrated with HSP70 and its C-terminally truncated fragments, and then the [1H, 15N] HSQC spectra were acquired to monitor the peak intensity changes upon titration (18.Chang Y.G. Yan X.Z. Xie Y.Y. Gao X.C. Song A.X. Zhang D.E. Hu H.Y. Different roles for two ubiquitin-like domains of ISG15 in protein modification.J. Biol.

Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Agilent Technologies). The intrinsic fluorescence of HSP70 proteins (∼20 μm) was measured in a 500-μl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) when aliquots (5 μl) of acrylamide (stock 5 m) were added. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm and the emission was recorded in the range of 315–380 nm. The data were plotted as fluorescence intensity ratio (F0/F) against acrylamide concentration and analyzed by using the modified Stern-Volmer equation, F0/F = 1 + KSV [Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of quencher, [Q] is the concentration of quencher, and KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (19.Lakowicz J.R.

The small GTPase activity of the ROC domain from LRRK2, a Parkinson's disease-related protein.Protein Pept. Lett. 2009; 16: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) was utilized to measure inorganic phosphate released by HSP70 and its fragments for the ATPase activities. The reaction was set in 2-ml assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.0; 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. A mixture of 1 μm ATPase, 2 μm HSJ1a_JD and 500 μm ATP was incubated in a constant temperature system and each 200 μl of the reaction sample was taken out from the mixture at different time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min) and 50 μl of stop buffer (500 mm EDTA, pH8.0) was added immediately. Then 750 μl of malachite green reagent (0.1% malachite green, 1% ammonium molybdate, 1 m HCl, filtered through a Φ0.45-μm membrane) was added to each sample and allowed stay for 5 min. The absorbance of the samples was read on a spectrophotometer at 650 nm. Sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate monohydrate was used as phosphate standard. The enzymatic activity was represented as the initial rate for hydrolyzing ATP to phosphate (A650/min). To uniformly label the segment (537–610) with 15N in the context of HSP1–610, we used the IMPACT-CN system according to the manufacturer's guidance (NEB) (23.David R. Richter M.P. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Expressed protein ligation. Method and applications.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, HSP1–536 was cloned to the pTYB1 expression vector with NdeI/SapI sites to get the protein fragment with a C-terminal α-thioester. The N-terminal Ser residue of the fragment HSP537–610 was mutated to Cys for combination. Then the C-terminally labeled HSP1–610 was obtained by ligation of the C-terminal thioester of HSP1–536 and the 15N-labeled HSP537–610. The TROSY-based [1H,15N] HSQC spectra were recorded in an 800-MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin). The previous studies showed that the HSP70 proteins have a very weak basal ATPase activity, and the J-domain proteins function to stimulate their ATPase activities (24.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. The Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperone machines.Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 25.Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Kinetics of molecular chaperone action.Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism underlying ATPase activity stimulation of human inducible HSP70 by HSJ1a, we divided the whole HSP70 protein into several C-terminally truncated fragments based on the domain architecture (Fig. 1A). The ATPase activities of purified HSP70 were measured by malachite green based colorimetric assay (21.Quan A. Robinson P.J. Rapid purification of native dynamin I and colorimetric GTPase assay.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 556-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The initial rates of various HSP70 fragments are significantly stimulated to different extents by addition of the J domain (residues 1–91) of HSJ1a (HSJ1a_JD) (Fig. 1B), though the basal ATPase activity of each fragment is similarly low. The N-terminal ATPase domain of HSP70 (HSP1–384), which binds and catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, does not show a stimulation of the ATPase activity in the presence of the J domain. This is consistent with the previous result from DnaK/DnaJ pair that the J domain of DnaJ failed to stimulate ATP hydrolysis of DnaK1–385, as revealed by single turnover ATPase activity measurements (27.Gässler C.S. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Valencia A. Bukau B. Mutations in the DnaK chaperone affecting interaction with the DnaJ cochaperone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15229-15234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The fragment that encompasses both the ATPase domain and the substrate-binding domain (HSP1–561) displays a slight increase of the ATPase activity in the presence of HSJ1a_JD. Compared with the full-length HSP70, the fragment HSP1–595 that has its half of the last C-terminal helix deleted also shows a significant activation of the ATPase activity. However, only the fragment HSP1–610 that retains its intact C-terminal helical subdomain exhibits great stimulation of the ATPase activity by the J domain, even this activation is more efficient than that of full-length HSP70. To verify whether truncation of the C-terminal helices causes significant conformational change of HSP70, far-UV CD spectra of the fragments were recorded and compared (supplemental Fig. S1). These truncation mutants share similar secondary structures, suggesting that the low activation of the helix-deleted mutants by HSJ1a-JD is unlikely to be caused by loss of the overall structure. As for the J domain of HSJ1a, we also examined the stimulation function of the JD fragment with residues 1 - 75. This fragment can also considerably stimulate the ATPase activities of HSP1–610 and full-length HSP70 (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region (72–91) does not affect the function of the J domain. Even in the case of 10-fold excess of the J domain, the ATPase activities of HSP1–384 and HSP1–561 still cannot be effectively stimulated (supplemental Fig. S2A). These results demonstrate that the C-terminal helices of HSP70 (residues 562–610) play crucial roles in the ATPase activation by the J domain of HSJ1a. As reported, the J domain of HSP40 (DnaJ) can interact with the ATPase domain of HSP70 (DnaK) (13.Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Role of the J-domain in the cooperation of Hsp40 with Hsp70.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), while the G/F-rich region flanked by the J domain of DnaJ plays a role in the DnaK chaperone cycle (28.Cajo G.C. Horne B.E. Kelley W.L. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. The role of the DIF motif of the DnaJ (Hsp40) co-chaperone in the regulation of the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12436-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To get mechanistic insights into the interaction between HSJ1a and HSP70, we solved the solution structure of the J domain of HSJ1a by NMR techniques. We prepared a construct that encoding both the J domain and the G/F-rich region of HSJ1a (HSJ1a_JD, residues 1–91). The G/F-rich region is highly flexible in solution, so we just calculated the structure of the J domain (1–71) (supplemental Table S1). The structure of HSJ1a_JD is mainly comprised of four α-helices with residues 4–7, 16–29, 40–56, and 59–68, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). A loop of residues 30–39 is characterized by a highly conserved 31HPD motif. This structure is very similar to those of other conserved J domains (10.Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wüthrich K. NMR structure of the J-domain and the Gly/Phe-rich region of the Escherichia coli DnaJ chaperone.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11.Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. Nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the human Hsp40 (HDJ-1) J-domain.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In comparison of these structures, HSJ1a_JD is more similar with HSP40_JD (Fig. 2C) than DnaJ_JD (Fig. 2D), giving the RMSDs of 4.5 Å and 5.5 Å, respectively, suggesting that interaction of HSJ1a_JD with HSP70 might adopt a similar mode with HSP40_JD (11.Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. Nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the human Hsp40 (HDJ-1) J-domain.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, the domain structure analysis indicates that HSJ1a_JD is capable of interacting with HSP70 similar to HSP40_JD. Although the function of HSJ1a and its interaction with HSP70 has been studied since the identification of HSJ1a (7.Cheetham M.E. Jackson A.P. Anderton B.H. Regulation of 70-kDa heat-shock-protein ATPase activity and substrate binding by human DnaJ-like proteins, HSJ1a and HSJ1b.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we still do not know whether the C-terminal helical subdomain contributes to the specific interaction and the ATPase activation. To demonstrate the binding mode of HSP70 with HSJ1a_JD, we firstly studied physical interaction between full-length HSP70 or its C-terminally truncated fragments and HSJ1a by GST pull-down (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S3). Similar to other J domain-containing proteins, HSJ1a binds with HSP70 through its N-terminal J domain (Fig. 3A). Mutation of the conserved HPD motif (H31Q/D33N) completely abolished the interaction between them (8.Gao X.C. Zhou C.J. Zhou Z.R. Zhang Y.H. Zheng X.M. Song A.X. Hu H.Y. Co-chaperone HSJ1a dually regulates the proteasomal degradation of ataxin-3.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e19763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, HSJ1a_JD cannot bind with the ATPase domain (HSP1–384), as it is undetectable in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3A). The previous studies on prokaryotic DnaK and DnaJ have provided clues that the binding region of DnaK for DnaJ_JD is composed of the ATPase and substrate-binding domains (13.Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Role of the J-domain in the cooperation of Hsp40 with Hsp70.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 29.Suh W.C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Interaction of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone, DnaK, with its cochaperone DnaJ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, only a trace amount of HSP1–561 can be pulled down by HSJ1a_JD, whereas a large amount of HSP1–610 has been pulled down (Fig. 3B). As expected, both full-length HSP70 (1–641) and HSP1–631 are sufficient for binding with HSJ1a_JD (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that at least the N terminus of HSP70 including the ATPase domain and the substrate-binding β-subdomain is not sufficient for HSJ1a_JD binding. To confirm this observation, we further studied the interactions by NMR titration, which is more sensitive than GST pull-down assay. 15N-labeled HSJ1a_JD was titrated with an increasing amount of different C-terminally truncated HSP70 fragments. The HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled HSJ1a_JD were obtained in the absence or presence of the HSP70 fragments. With titration of HSP70, the resonance peaks of the amides in HSJ1a_JD, such as His-31 and Asp-33, gradually become weak due to line broadening of the peaks originated from intermediate exchange in the NMR timescale regime (Fig. 4A), indicating that HSP70 binds with HSJ1a_JD. Based on the NMR titration data, we further obtained a profile of the relative peak heights of amides against the residue number of HSJ1a_JD during titration of HSP70 with molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 (Fig. 4B). Almost all peak intensities corresponding to the J domain (1–71) significantly decrease with addition of HSP70 (Fig. 4B, supplemental Fig. S4). The peak intensities corresponding to the G/F-rich region also decrease but with a much less extent compared with those in the J domain. These signals originated from the G/F-rich region can be used as a well negative control. Upon HSP70 binding, there is no chemical-shift change observed, which is different from the result of DnaK and DnaJ in the previous study (13.Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Role of the J-domain in the cooperation of Hsp40 with Hsp70.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As full-length HSP70, interaction of HSP1–610 shows a very similar profile on HSJ1a_JD (Fig. 4C, supplemental Fig. S5A). Titration of HSP1–595 causes a less extent of intensity decrease of HSJ1a_JD (Fig. 4D, supplemental Fig. S5B), being consistent with the result that HSP1–595 can be considerably activated by HSJ1a_JD (Fig. 1B). Also, titration of HSP1–561 causes a similar extent of intensity decrease with that of HSP1–595 (Fig. 4E, supplemental Fig. S5C), though this fragment is not considerably activated by HSJ1a_JD (Fig. 1B). This NMR titration experiment also corroborates the previous observation that HSP1–561 exhibits a weak interaction with HSJ1a_JD as evidenced by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3B). As for titration with HSP1–384, the peak intensities of HSJ1a_JD remain almost unchanged (Fig. 4F, supplemental Fig. S5D), suggesting that HSP1–384 cannot interact with HSJ1a_JD. Similar result was also reported from surface plasmon resonance experiment that DnaJ failed to bind with DnaK1–385 but can bind with DnaK1–538 (27.Gässler C.S. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Mayer M.P.

Collectively, our results demonstrate that the N-terminal ATPase domain together with the substrate-binding β-subdomain of HSP70 is not sufficient for binding with the J domain of HSJ1a. Besides the substrate-binding domain, the C-terminal helices (residues 537–610) are also required for the effective binding and ATPase activation. Considering that the C-terminal helices of HSP70 is important for HSJ1a binding and subsequent ATPase activity stimulation, we wonder how the C-terminal helical subdomain regulates the HSJ1a_JD binding and the ATPase cycle. We tested whether the C-terminal helices of HSP70 provide a binding site for HSJ1a_JD. The GST pull-down and NMR titration experiments suggest that the C-terminal subdomain does not directly bind with HSJ1a_JD (supplemental Fig. S6). So, we proposed that the C-terminal helices play a role in conformational switch of NBD and SBD domains and allosteric regulation during the ATPase cycle. We applied intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan and quenching to probe the conformation of the N-terminal ATPase domain and the C-terminal helical subdomain. There are two natural Trp residues in wild-type HSP70; Trp-90 is resided in the N-terminal ATPase domain and Trp-580 in the C-terminal helical region. We generated HSP1–595 and HSP1–610 fragments each with a single-Trp residue by mutation of one Trp to Phe. The maximal wavelengths of fluorescence emission are 347, 343, 340, and 342 nm for HSP1–595_W580, HSP1–610_W580, HSP1–595_W90 and HSP1–610_W90, respectively (Fig. 5A). It suggests that the C-terminal helical subdomain in HSP1–610 is less exposed to solution than that in HSP1–595, whereas the ATPase domain where Trp90 is resided in HSP1–610 has a little more exposure than that in HSP1–595. Acrylamide quenching was also used to probe the Trp residues exposed in the protein environment (Fig. 5B, supplemental Fig. S7). By Stern-Volmer fitting (20.Rust E. Martin D.L. Chen C.H. Cofactor and tryptophan accessibility and unfolding of brain glutamate decarboxylase.Arch. Biochem.

Many snRNA and scRNA genes are related via their compact and yet powerful promoters that support RNA polymerase III transcription. We have utilized the human U6 snRNA gene family to examine the mechanism for regulated transcription of these potent transcription units. Analysis of nine U6 family members showed enriched CpG density within the promoters of actively transcribed loci relative to inert genes, implying a relationship between gene potency and DNA methylation. Indeed, both pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and the forced diminution of DNMT-1, DNMT-3a, and DNMT-3b by siRNA targeting resulted in increased U6 levels in asynchronously growing MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells. In vitro transcription assays further showed that template methylation impedes U6 transcription by RNA polymerase III. Both DNMT-1 and DNMT-3a were detected at the U6-1 locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation directly linking these factors to RNA polymerase III regulation. Despite this association, the endogenous U6-1 locus was not substantially methylated in actively growing cells. However, both DNMT occupancy and low frequency methylation were correlated with increased Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) expression, suggesting that the RB status can influence specific epigenetic marks.

https://openalex.org/W2038883827,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection caused by the uptake of virus-antibody complexes by FcγRs is a significant obstacle to the development of effective vaccines to control certain human and animal viral diseases. The activation FcγRs, including FcγRI and FcγRIIa have been shown to mediate ADE infection of virus. In the present paper, we showed that pocine FcγRIIb, an inhibitory FcγR, mediates ADE of PRRSV infection. Stable Marc-145 cell lines expressing poFcγRIIb (Marc-poFcγRII) were established. The relative yield of progeny virus was significantly increased in the presence of sub-neutralization anti-PRRSV antibody. The Fab fragment and normal porcine sera had no effect. Anti-poFcγRII antibody inhibited the enhancement of infection when cells were infected in the presence of anti-PRRSV antibody, but not when cells were infected in the absence of antibody. These results indicate that enhancement of infection in these cells by anti-PRRSV virus antibody is FcγRII-mediated. Identification of the inhibitory FcγR mediating ADE infection should expand our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis for a broad range of infectious diseases and may open many approaches for improvements to the treatment and prevention of such diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2011583577,"Endothelial dysfunction in widely diffuse disorders, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes and senescence, is associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. Here, the behavioural and molecular consequences deriving from NO deficiency in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were investigated.Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was chronically inhibited either by N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment or its expression was down-regulated by RNA interference. After long-term L-NAME treatment, HUVECs displayed a higher migratory capability accompanied by an increased Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (kinase insert domain receptor, KDR) expression. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of eNOS induced a state of pseudohypoxia, revealed by the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Furthermore, NO loss induced a significant decrease in mitochondrial mass and energy production accompanied by a lower O(2) consumption. Notably, very low doses of chronically administered DETA/NO reverted the HIF-1α accumulation, the increased VEGF expression and the stimulated migratory behaviour detected in NO deficient cells.Based on our results, we propose that basal release of NO may act as a negative controller of HIF-1α levels with important consequences for endothelial cell physiology. Moreover, we suggest that our experimental model where eNOS activity was impaired by pharmacological and genetic inhibition may represent a good in vitro system to study endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2037966901,"Rapid opening and closing of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) regulate information flow throughout the brain. For pLGICs, it is postulated that neurotransmitter-induced movements in the extracellular inner β-sheet trigger channel activation. Homology modeling reveals that the β4-β5 linker physically connects the neurotransmitter binding site to the inner β-sheet. Inserting 1, 2, 4, and 8 glycines in this region of the GABA(A) receptor β-subunit progressively decreases GABA activation and converts the competitive antagonist SR-95531 into a partial agonist, demonstrating that this linker is a key element whose length and flexibility are optimized for efficient signal propagation. Insertions in the α- and γ-subunits have little effect on GABA or SR-95531 actions, suggesting that asymmetric motions in the extracellular domain power pLGIC gating. The effects of insertions on allosteric modulator actions, pentobarbital, and benzodiazepines, have different subunit dependences, indicating that modulator-induced signaling is distinct from agonist gating."
https://openalex.org/W2087543298,"In order to better identify the role of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) type III secretion system (T3SS) in chickens, we used the well-known gentamicin protection assay with activated HD11 cells. HD11 cells are a macrophage-like chicken cell line that can be stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to exhibit more macrophage-like morphology and greater production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activated HD11 cells were infected with a wild-type Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) strain, a SPI-2 mutant S. Typhimurium strain, a wild-type Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) strain, a SPI-2 mutant S. Enteritidis strain, or a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain. SPI-2 mutant strains were found to survive as well as their parent strain at all time points post-uptake (PU) by the HD11 cells, up to 24 h PU, while the E. coli strain was no longer recoverable by 3 h PU. We can conclude from these observations that the SPI-2 T3SS of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis is not important for survival of Salmonella in the activated macrophage-like HD11 cell line, and that Salmonella must employ other mechanisms for survival in this environment, as E. coli is effectively eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W2092043587,"Mammal adipose tissues require mitochondrial activity for proper development and differentiation. The components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) are encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. The maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a key element for a functional mitochondrial oxidative activity in mammalian cells. To ascertain the role of mtDNA levels in adipose tissue, we have analyzed the alterations in white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues in thymidine kinase 2 (Tk2) H126N knockin mice, a model of TK2 deficiency-induced mtDNA depletion. We observed respectively severe and moderate mtDNA depletion in TK2-deficient BAT and WAT, showing both tissues moderate hypotrophy and reduced fat accumulation. Electron microscopy revealed altered mitochondrial morphology in brown but not in white adipocytes from TK2-deficient mice. Although significant reduction in mtDNA-encoded transcripts was observed both in WAT and BAT, protein levels from distinct OXPHOS complexes were significantly reduced only in TK2-deficient BAT. Accordingly, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase was significantly lowered only in BAT from TK2-deficient mice. The analysis of transcripts encoding up to fourteen components of specific adipose tissue functions revealed that, in both TK2-deficient WAT and BAT, there was a consistent reduction of thermogenesis related gene expression and a severe reduction in leptin mRNA. Reduced levels of resistin mRNA were found in BAT from TK2-deficient mice. Analysis of serum indicated a dramatic reduction in circulating levels of leptin and resistin. In summary, our present study establishes that mtDNA depletion leads to a moderate impairment in mitochondrial respiratory function, especially in BAT, causes substantial alterations in WAT and BAT development, and has a profound impact in the endocrine properties of adipose tissues."

The relentless progression and invasive supportive treatments of ALS may on the other hand induce severe infections among ALS patients.The present study included 4,004 ALS patients identified from the Swedish Patient Register during 1991-2007 and 20,020 age and sex matched general population controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of ALS given a previous hospitalization for CNS infection or sepsis. Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of hospitalization for CNS infection or sepsis after ALS diagnosis. Overall, previous CNS infection (OR: 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8, 2.4) or sepsis (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.6) was not associated with ALS risk. However, compared to ALS free individuals, ALS cases were more likely to be hospitalized for sepsis after diagnosis (HR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.9, 3.5). We did not observe a higher risk of CNS infection after ALS diagnosis.Our results suggest that acute and severe infections unlikely contribute to the development of ALS; however, ALS patients are at a higher risk of sepsis after diagnosis, compared to ALS free individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2072387974,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be combined with genotype assessment to identify brain systems that mediate genetic vulnerability to mental disorders (“imaging genetics”). A data analysis approach that is widely applied is “functional connectivity”. In this approach, the temporal correlation between the fMRI signal from a pre-defined brain region (the so-called “seed point”) and other brain voxels is determined. In this technical note, we show how the choice of freely selectable data analysis parameters strongly influences the assessment of the genetic modulation of connectivity features. In our data analysis we exemplarily focus on three methodological parameters: (i) seed voxel selection, (ii) noise reduction algorithms, and (iii) use of additional second level covariates. Our results show that even small variations in the implementation of a functional connectivity analysis can have an impact on the connectivity pattern that is as strong as the potential modulation by genetic allele variants. Some effects of genetic variation can only be found for one specific implementation of the connectivity analysis. A reoccurring difficulty in the field of psychiatric genetics is the non-replication of initially promising findings, partly caused by the small effects of single genes. The replication of imaging genetic results is therefore crucial for the long-term assessment of genetic effects on neural connectivity parameters. For a meaningful comparison of imaging genetics studies however, it is therefore necessary to provide more details on specific methodological parameters (e.g., seed voxel distribution) and to give information how robust effects are across the choice of methodological parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2084798744,"Mental retardation is a developmental disorder associated with impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Many studies have addressed white matter abnormalities in patients with mental retardation, while the changes of the cerebral cortex have been studied to a lesser extent. Quantitative analysis of cortical integrity using cortical thickness measurement may provide new insights into the gray matter pathology. In this study, cortical thickness was compared between 13 patients with mental retardation and 26 demographically matched healthy controls. We found that patients with mental retardation had significantly reduced cortical thickness in multiple brain regions compared with healthy controls. These regions include the bilateral lingual gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, the bilateral temporal pole, the left inferior temporal gyrus, the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the right precentral gyrus. The observed cortical thickness reductions might be the anatomical substrates for the impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in adaptive behaviors in patients with mental retardation. Cortical thickness measurement might provide a sensitive prospective surrogate marker for clinical trials of neuroprotective medications."

Thus Syk is activated by an either/or mechanism where ITAM binding or phosphorylation results in maximal kinase activity. Homology modeling of Syk with its closest relative, ζ-chain-associated protein of 70 kDa (Zap70), places Tyr-348 and Tyr-352 at the interface of the SH2 and kinase domains where phosphorylation would disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains (Fig. 1). Because ITAM binding or phosphorylation result in the same, non-additive, increase in kinase activity, the prevailing activation model is that ITAM binding or phosphorylation results in dissociation of the SH2 and kinase domains. Consistent with this model, Syk activated by ITAM binding or phosphorylation has similar catalytic rates as a construct of the kinase domain by itself (SykKD, residues 343–635). Furthermore a naturally occurring splice variant, SykB, lacking 23 residues in the flexible linker is not as efficacious an activator of immune cell signaling (10.Chu D.H. Morita C.T. Weiss A.

Kinases play essential roles in cell signal amplification and transduction. In the human genome the kinase domain motif can be found in ∼520 different proteins (15.Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R.

Amazingly, although the kinase domain has been so multiply adapted, residues involved in ATP binding and catalysis are often conserved between even distant kinase relatives. Due to the conservation and prevalence of the kinase domain, it is a substantial challenge to develop ATP competitive inhibitors that strike a specific target while also simultaneously outcompeting physiological concentrations of ATP (16.Fischer P.M.

Characterization of the mechanism of inhibition from fluorescence binding experiments and steady-state enzyme kinetics reveals X1 is noncompetitive against ATP and peptide substrates, is highly specific, inhibiting Syk and SykB but not SykKD or Zap70, inhibits activation by ITAM, and is a competitive inhibitor of phosphorylation by LynB. Finally, we use small angle x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation to investigate Syk activation and find structural evidence suggesting X1 inhibits Syk by reinforcing regulatory interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains. The genes for the different Homo sapiens Syk constructs were cloned from an existing construct, pBacPAK9-WT (Invitrogen), then subcloned into the pFastBac HT-B baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). All Syk proteins included an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site; sequences were verified by automated sequencing. Recombinant genes were transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli-competent cells to form an expression bacmid, which were used for transfection into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) insect cells following manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen). In vivo homologous recombination between the bacmid DNA and the viral DNA transferred the recombinant gene to the viral genome to generate recombinant virus harboring Syk genes. Recombinant virus were purified by plaque assay and amplified following the manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf-9 host cell lines. Cells were grown in Sf-9 serum-free insect cell medium (SF-900 III SFM, Invitrogen) at 27 °C to a density of 2.5 × 106 cells ml−1 before infection with virus. Cells were grown for 48 h at 27 °C with a shaker speed of 125 rpm and harvested at 75–90% cell viability. Cells were lysed using a Branson Ultrasonic Disintegrator (VWR Scientific Products, Chicago, IL) for 2 min at 60% duty cycle in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and ETDA-free Roche protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), then centrifuged at 20,000 relative centrifugal force. The soluble fraction was applied to a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a linear imidazole gradient (20–400 mm). Final purification of Syk constructs was done using two size-exclusion chromatography steps for Syk and SykB (HiLoad Superdex200 26/60 followed by HiLoad Superdex75 26/60, GE Healthcare) and one chromatography step for SykKD (Superdex75 26/60). Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization-TOF mass spectrometry: Syk = 75,307.8 Da (75,306.6 theoretical), SykB = 72,751.1 Da (72,750.6 theoretical), SykKD = 34,874.0 Da (34,874.1 theoretical). Protein concentrations were determined from sequence-based calculation of absorptivity at 280 nm (28.Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Protein identification and analysis tools in the ExPASy server.Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 531-552PubMed Google Scholar). H. sapiens Zap70 was purchased in purified form. C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Zap70 (Invitrogen) was used in kinetics assays, and a catalytically incompetent Zap70 mutant (Y315F/Y319F/D461N) (Jubilant Biosys, India) (29.Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Structural basis for the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of ZAP-70.Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used in sedimentation velocity assays. C-terminal hexahistidine tagged H. sapiens LynB was purchased in purified form (Invitrogen). A 16-residue peptide corresponding to the H. sapiens ITAM sequence from the FcϵRI receptor, pYTGLSTRNQETpYETLK, was purchased in purified form (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) and used in sedimentation velocity and kinetics assays. The same ITAM sequence with fluorescein attached to the ζ-nitrogen of the C-terminal lysine was purchased in purified form (Anaspec) and used in fluorescence anisotropy assays. Purified proteins were transferred into buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Brij35, 2.5% DMSO, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and EDTA-free Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture. For experiments requiring activated Syk, activation was accomplished with 50 μm ITAM or a 20-min incubation of Syk with 250 μm ATP and 50 μm vanadate at 23 °C (30.Gordon J.A. Use of vanadate as protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was verified by electrospray ionization-TOF mass spectrometry. The concentration of Syk, SykB, SykKD, Zap70, or LynB was 20 nm in kinetics experiments. Omnia peptide 7 Tyr, 8 Tyr, or 5 Tyr were used for Syk, Zap70, or LynB assays, respectively (Invitrogen) (2.Tsang E. Giannetti A.M. Shaw D. Dinh M. Tse J.K. Gandhi S. Ho H. Wang S. Papp E.

Peptide substrate phosphorylation was monitored using a SpectraMax GeminiXS Microplate Fluorometer (Molecular Devices) with a measurement frequency of 20 s−1. Reaction velocities were measured at the steady state after the lag phase but within 30% product conversion. For half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) assays, a constant concentration of 250 μm ATP and 50 μm substrate peptide was used against a variable concentration of X1 or an ATP competitive inhibitor, Kissei compound 9F (24.Hirabayashi A. Mukaiyama H. Kobayashi H. Shiohara H. Nakayama S. Ozawa M. Tsuji E. Miyazawa K. Misawa K. Ohnota H. Isaji M. Structure-activity relationship studies of imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine derivatives as potent and orally effective Syk family kinases inhibitors.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2008; 16: 9247-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For X1, assay inhibitor concentration was varied between 100 and 0.19 μm (2-fold dilutions), and for 9F assays the inhibitor concentration was varied between 50 and 0.01 nm (2-fold dilutions). Changes in enzyme velocity were fit in GraphPad Prism v5 (San Diego, CA) using Equation 1,v=Vmin+Vmax−Vmin1+10log((IC50−I)×H)(Eq. 1) where v is reaction velocity, I is the inhibitor concentration, and H is the Hill coefficient. The mechanism of inhibition experiments was performed using a variable concentration of ATP, peptide, or LynB against a constant concentration of 0, 6.5, 13, or 19.5 μm of compound X1. For ATP competition assays, ATP concentration was varied between 64 and 0.25 μm (2-fold dilutions) at a constant substrate peptide concentration of 50 μm. For substrate peptide competition assays, peptide concentration was varied between 48 and 12 μm (2-fold dilutions) at a constant ATP concentration of 250 μm. For LynB competition assays, LynB concentration was varied between 200 and 6.25 nm (2-fold dilutions) at a constant concentration of 250 μm ATP and 50 μm substrate peptide. The reaction velocity without LynB was subtracted from these data to account for contributions from Syk autoactivation. Because incomplete inhibition of Syk was observed with the allosteric inhibitor, data were globally fit to a partial inhibition model using Equation 2,v=Vmax(1+KmS)(1+IKi)(1+IβKi)(Eq. 2) where Km is the Michaelis constant, Ki is the inhibition constant, and β is the fractional decrease in enzyme catalysis in the presence of inhibitor. Complete inhibition was observed for Syk against 9F or LynB against X1; thus these data were globally fit to a full inhibition model using Equation 3,v=VmaxSKm(1+I/Ki)+S(Eq. 3) Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 Enzyme Kinetics Module from SPSS Science (Richmond, CA). Mechanisms of Syk autophosphorylation assays were performed at 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 nm Syk, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μm substrate peptide. Data were fit to a trans autophosphorylation mechanism using the method of Wu and Wang (32.Wu H. Wang Z.X. The mechanism of p21-activated kinase 2 autoactivation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41768-41778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism v5. For ITAM half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) assays, ITAM concentration was varied between 50 and 0.048 μm (4-fold dilutions) at a constant concentration of 250 μm ATP and 50 μm substrate peptide. Changes in initial reaction velocities were fit in GraphPad Prism v5 using Equation 4,v=Vmin+Vmax−Vmin1+10log((EC50−X)×H)(Eq. 4) where X is the ITAM concentration. Purified proteins were prepared at 5 μm. Compound X1 or 9F were prepared in DMSO, and increasing concentrations of inhibitor were mixed with protein by pipette for 15 s. Data were collected using a FluoroMax-3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). For fluorescence anisotropy measurements, data were collected in the L configuration with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm, 1-nm slit widths, a 0.5-s integration time, and emission monitoring at 520 nm. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments were performed using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm with 2-nm slit widths, a 0.5-s integration time, and emission monitoring between 330 and 370 nm. The fluorescence spectra were scanned in the ratio mode (signal/reference) to compensate for variations in lamp output as a function of wavelength. Changes in fluorescence intensity at maximum peak emission (342 nm), ΔF, were determined after correction from blank DMSO buffer injections and inner filter compound effects (33.Sharma A.S.S.G. Introduction to Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Wiley Interscience, 1999Google Scholar). Data were fit to the quadratic equation to obtain the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for the inhibitor complex using Equation 5 in GraphPad Prism v5,ΔF=Fo−F=(Fo−Fmax)([E]+[I]+Kd)−([E]+[I]+Kd)−4[E][I]2[E](Eq. 5) where Fo is intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the absence of compound, E is the enzyme concentration, Fmax is the maximal change in fluorescence upon saturation of ligand, and E-L is the enzyme ligand complex, where ligand is either X1 or 9F (34.Aulabaugh A. Kapoor B. Huang X. Dollings P. Hum W.T. Banker A. Wood A. Ellestad G.

SAXS data were collected at beamline X9 of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Three 30-s data sets were collected using Syk concentrations between 0.5 and 3.5 g/liter in the absence or presence of 100 μm X1; no aggregation or radiation damage was observed for these samples. Scattering from identical solutions, but lacking Syk, were collected adjacent to sample data sets for use as buffer blanks. Scattering data were circularly averaged over the detector and normalized against transmitted incident beam intensity using software developed at X9. Data at all concentrations were independently processed and compared before merging using PRIMUS (35.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Radius of gyration and particle distance distribution function were determined using GNOM (36.Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Theoretical scattering of Zap70 (PDB accession 2OZO) was determined with CRYSOL (37.Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL–a program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological Macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). A consensus model was determined from the average of 15 simulations using GASBOR (38.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.

Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using an OptimaXL-I centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Samples were loaded into two-channel (1.2 cm path length) carbon-Epon centerpieces in an An-50 Ti rotor and spun at 40,000 rpm, 15 °C with monitoring at 280 nm with 0.006 cm spacing in the continuous mode. Data were processed using SEDFIT v12.1 (40.Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and lamm equation modeling.Biophys.

Frictional coefficients from SEDFIT for ITAM-Syk experiment with ITAM at 3.33, 10, and 30 μm were affected by peak broadening due to exchange with excess ITAM in solution; consequently, frictional coefficients were estimated as the ratio of the sequence-based theoretical sedimentation (SEDNTERP v1.09) (41.Laue T.M.

However, it is unknown how long they can survive upon transplantation, whether they are eventually rejected by recipients, and how their long-term survival can be induced to permanently cure type 1 diabetes. IPCC graft survival is critical for their clinical application and this issue must be systematically addressed prior to their in-depth clinical trials.Here we found that IPCC grafts that differentiated from murine ASCs in vitro, unlike their freshly isolated islet counterparts, did not survive long-term in syngeneic mice, suggesting that ASC-derived IPCCs have intrinsic survival disadvantage over freshly isolated islets. Indeed, β cells retrieved from IPCC syngrafts underwent faster apoptosis than their islet counterparts. However, blocking both Fas and TNF receptor death pathways inhibited their apoptosis and restored their long-term survival in syngeneic recipients. Furthermore, blocking CD40-CD154 costimulation and Fas/TNF signaling induced long-term IPCC allograft survival in overwhelming majority of recipients. Importantly, Fas-deficient IPCC allografts exhibited certain immune privilege and enjoyed long-term survival in diabetic NOD mice in the presence of CD28/CD40 joint blockade while their islet counterparts failed to do so.Long-term survival of ASC-derived IPCC syngeneic grafts requires blocking Fas and TNF death pathways, whereas blocking both death pathways and CD28/CD40 costimulation is needed for long-term IPCC allograft survival in diabetic NOD mice. Our studies have important clinical implications for treating type 1 diabetes via ASC-derived IPCC transplantation."

The nucleolinus (NLi) 2The abbreviations used are: NLinucleolinus, nucleolini, or nucleolinarDICdifferential interference contrastBLASTBasic Local Alignment Search ToolGVgerminal vesiclecontiggroup of overlapping clones. is a compartment or organelle described in a wide variety of cells and with a long although virtually forgotten history (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In cells where it is clearly visible, it is closely apposed to the nucleolus, and in other cells where it has been described it appears to be integrated within the nucleolus. In the latter case, visualization of the NLi was achieved by innovative histochemical techniques (4.Carleton H.M. Observations on an intranucleolar body in columnar epithelium cells of the intestine.Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1920; s2–64: 329-341Google Scholar, 5.Love R. Liles R.H.

With the existing lack of information, we cannot even be certain if the entities described by earlier investigators under the name of NLi are actually analogous structures in the various experimental systems used. Other than to say it contains RNA and protein (6.Love R. Walsh R.J. Nucleolinar morphology in normal diploid, neoplastic, and aneuploid cells in vitro.Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 990-997PubMed Google Scholar), we know virtually nothing of its composition and have no molecular probes (until very recently) with which to study its biogenesis or behavior. By default, the NLi has been considered a part of the nucleolus by the few investigators who are even moderately familiar with it. In his landmark treatise on the nucleolus, Montgomery (7.Montgomery T.H. Comparative cytological studies, with especial regard to the morphology of the nucleolus.J. Morphol. 1898; 15: 265Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) stated, “I can attach no particular morphological significance to the nucleolinus; it appears to be only a detached portion of the nucleolar ground substance.” Nevertheless, there are indications that the NLi can and should be considered a distinct cellular compartment. These include the observations that in some cells, particularly invertebrate oocytes, it is morphologically distinct (7.Montgomery T.H. Comparative cytological studies, with especial regard to the morphology of the nucleolus.J. Morphol. 1898; 15: 265Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8.Gates R.R.

Fertilization and artificial activation in the egg of the surf-clam.Spisula solidissima. 1953; 105: 213-239Google Scholar). Moreover, in cells where it is not visible by unaided bright field microscopy, histochemical stains clearly differentiate it from the nucleolus and other cellular compartments (4.Carleton H.M. Observations on an intranucleolar body in columnar epithelium cells of the intestine.Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1920; s2–64: 329-341Google Scholar, 10.Love R. Bharadwaj T.P. Two types of ribonucleoprotein in the nucleolus of mammalian cells.Nature. 1959; 183: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, its behavior under certain physiological conditions, such as during viral infection, serum starvation, and fertilization of invertebrate oocytes, distinguishes it physically from the closely allied nucleolus (11.Love R. Wildy P. Cytochemical studies of the nucleoproteins of HeLa cells infected with herpes virus.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12.Love R.

Nucleolar behavior in regenerating liver of rats receiving intra-abdominal injections of azo dyes and thioacetamide.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1968; 40: 917-933PubMed Google Scholar). A reasonable operational definition for the NLi may therefore be a cellular compartment closely associated with the nucleolus that can be physically differentiated from the latter by histochemical means and under certain physiological conditions. It has long been thought that the NLi is associated with the cell division apparatus (9.Allen R.D. Biol. Bull.

The role of the nucleolus in spindle formation.Biol. Bull. 1951; 101: 214Google Scholar), either as a precursor to centrosomes or in some other way contributing to spindle formation. This has recently been confirmed in surf clam (Spisula) oocytes (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13718-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In these cells, centrosomes form “de novo” several min after fertilization or parthenogenetic activation (16.Palazzo R.E. Vaisberg E. Cole R.W. Rieder C.L. Centriole duplication in lysates of Spisula solidissima oocytes.Science. 1992; 256: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Induction of damage to the NLi via laser microsurgery before centrosomes or asters develop resulted in a malformed meiotic spindle and failed chromatin segregation in parthenogenetically activated oocytes. γ-Tubulin immunofluorescence suggested that centrosomes could form, but their appearance and number may have been disregulated. In oocytes fertilized with sperm after microsurgery, mitotic centrosomes and the spindle failed to form altogether. Although it was considered unlikely that the NLi is a direct precursor of centrosomes, as suggested by Lavdowsky (14.Lavdowsky M. Formation of the chromatic and achromatic substances in animal and plant cells.Zellen. Merkel und Bonnefs Anat. Hefte. 1894; 4: 13Google Scholar), it was clear that the NLi plays a role in spindle morphogensis. These observations are timely in light of data indicating the plurifunctional nature of the nucleolus and, in particular, its direct role in cell cycle regulation (17.Gaulden M.E. Perry R.P.

The NLi is on one hand demonstrably associated with cell division (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13718-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 3.Alliegro M.C. The nucleolinus. A disappearing, forgotten, and (maybe) misnamed organelle.Comm. Integr. Biol. 2011; 4: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and on the other hand, as noted above, is intimately associated with the nucleolus. This gives rise to a number of questions regarding the interplay between the two and their respective physiolgical roles. Do the nucleolus and NLi act in concert to affect cell division? How are they related in their protein and RNA composition? Should they be considered separate compartments? The Spisula oocyte provides a unique system to observe the interaction between these fundamental structures. The nucleolus and NLi stand out in clear relief using bright field optics within the large oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle (GV)). Centrosomes and other microtubule assemblages are not present in unactivated oocytes (16.Palazzo R.E. Vaisberg E. Cole R.W. Rieder C.L. Centriole duplication in lysates of Spisula solidissima oocytes.Science. 1992; 256: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but their “de novo” formation can be induced by fertilization or parthenogenetic activation. Taking advantage of these characteristics, our aims in this study were to determine the composition of the Spisula NLi, develop specific probes to study its dynamics, and explore its ties to the nucleolus and cell division apparatus. Evidence is provided that, despite an intimate association with the nucleolus, the NLi contains a distinct set of molecules. mAbs to one of these components reveal a centrosomal forerunner in the cytoplasm, and perturbation of the NLi via laser microsurgery suggests a role in tubulin recruitment to the forming cell division apparatus. Gravid Spisula solidissima were obtained from the Marine Resources Center at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). Gametes were collected by dissection. Oocytes were rinsed several times in 0.45-μm filtered sea water and fertilized with sperm (diluted 1:20,000) in Tris-buffered (pH 8.0), filtered sea water. All bright field and immunofluorescence imaging was performed with a Nikon 90i microscope equipped with DIC, epifluorescence, and a Photometrics CoolSNAP EZ digital camera. Immunofluorescence was performed, with minor modifications, as described in an earlier report (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13718-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To visualize centrosomes and avoid cross-talk between secondary antibodies, anti-γ-tubulin IgG was directly conjugated to Alexafluor-594. Every immunofluorescent experiment was accompanied by a battery of controls for antibody specificity, cross-reactivity, and fluorophore channel overlap. Nucleolini were isolated in a two-step process. The first step was isolation of GVs based on methods described by Maul and Avdalovi (21.Maul G.G. Avdalovi N. Nuclear envelope proteins from Spisula solidissima germinal vesicles.Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 130: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Starting with 8–10 ml of packed, unactivated oocytes distributed between four 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes, the cells were resuspended by the addition of 20 ml of buffer containing 1 m glycerol and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, incubated at room temperature for 3 min, and sedimented at 1,750 × g for 15 s. The oocytes were resuspended to 40 ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5 m hexylene glycol, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with occasional mixing by inversion. They were incubated at room temperature and monitored by phase-contrast microscopy every 2–3 min until all cellular structure was dissolved, leaving only intact GVs. The nucleolus dissolves during the lysis step. Nuclear envelopes were stabilized by the addition of 8 ml of ice-cold 40% sucrose with gentle mixing, and the tubes are placed on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 780 × g for 8 min (4 °C) through a 2.0-ml cushion of 10% sucrose buffer (1:1 lysis buffer, 20% sucrose) in a swinging bucket rotor. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for later use. Only three structural elements were visible by DIC microscopy in these isolated GV preparations: the nuclear envelope with attached chromosomes and the NLi. Nucleolini were harvested from this preparation in the second step. One ml of frozen GVs were thawed on ice and resuspended with 5 ml of 10% sucrose buffer. GVs were disrupted by sonication on ice with three bursts of 8 s each at 11 watts with a microprobe sonicator. Samples were then underlain with 2 ml of 40% sucrose (w/v) in 0.5 m hexylene glycol, 0.75 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The pellet was washed twice by sedimentation and resuspension in ice-cold PBS in a microcentrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed. For estimates of RNA and protein content, NLi were counted using a hemocytometer, RNA was estimated by A280/260/230, and protein was determined using Pierce BCA assay reagents. RNA was extracted from isolated NLi using Qiagen RNeasy reagents, reverse transcribed using universal primers described previously (22.Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Centrosomal RNA correlates with intron-poor nuclear genes in Spisula oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6993-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and blunt-cloned into Invitrogen PCR-script plasmid. To guard against the potential amplification and subsequent cloning of genomic DNA contaminants, equal quantities of non-reverse transcribed NLi RNA were used as a control template. Non-reverse transcribed NLi RNA yielded no detectable products from random PCR nor, subsequently, cloned inserts. More than 3,000 clones were sequenced by the Sanger method. Ribosomal RNA was filtered from the pool in an initial BLASTn analysis leaving ∼10% of the sequences for additional analysis. Methods for in situ hybridization were described in an earlier report (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13718-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protocol was optimized to conserve nucleolar and NLi morphology (both of which are labile) throughout the hybridization regimen as well as γ-tubulin antigenicity. In situ hybridization conditions could not be found that preserved the antigenicity of β-tubulin. Samples were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled NLi RNA probes for 2 days at 58–60 °C. Alkaline phosphatase reaction product was visualized after development at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Specificity controls for in situ hybridization included opposite strand (“sense”) hybridizations and comparison of the labeling pattern with other RNA probes. MS grade solvents were from either Burdick and Jackson or Baker. Sequencing grade trypsin was from Promega. Other solutions were the highest grade available from Sigma-Aldrich. For solution digests, the protein sample was dissolved in 8 m urea, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for 40 min at room temperature. After incubation, 120 volume of 200 mm iodoacetamide was added, and the alkylation was allowed to proceed for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The sample was then diluted with 3 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and digested with 4 μg/ml trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Digested samples were purified with C18 affinity tips following the manufacturer's recommendations (Agilent Technologies), redissolved in 1% formic acid, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described below. Samples were analyzed on a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a New Objectives PV-550 nanoelectrospray ion source and an Eksigent NanoLC-2D chromatography system. Peptides were trapped on a 150-μm inner diameter × 2.5-cm precolumn and separated on a 75-μm inner diameter × 15-cm length analytical column terminated with an integral fused silica emitter pulled in house. Both columns were packed in house with Magic C18 AQ and plumbed in a vented column configuration. Peptides were eluted using a 2.5–28% ACN, 0.1% formic acid gradient performed over 42 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. During each scan cycle, one full-range Fourier transform-MS scan (nominal resolution of 60,000 full width at half-maximum, 360–1400 m/z) was collected, whereas the six most intense ions were analyzed via MS/MS in the linear ion trap. Data-dependent MS/MS settings used a trigger threshold of 8,000 counts and monoisotopic precursor selection. Ions previously selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for a duration corresponding to 150% of the observed chromatographic peak width and using an exclusion count of 2. Ions whose charge states could not be assigned were also excluded from MS/MS. Ions that were previously identified as contaminants on blank gradient runs were also excluded. For mass spectrometry analysis, centroided ion masses were extracted using the extract_msn.exe utility from Bioworks 3.3.1 and were used for database searching with Mascot version 2.2.04 (Matrix Science) and X! Tandem version 2007.01.01.1 (available from the Global Proteome Machine Web site). Searches were conducted using the following search parameters: parent mass tolerance 5 ppm; fragment mass tolerance 0.8 Da; one missed tryptic cleavage; and peptide modifications pyroglutamate cyclization of N-terminal Gln, oxidation of Met, formylation or acetylation of the protein N terminus, alkylation of Cys by iodoacetamide. The database search utilized a local copy of NCBInr that was downloaded on March 28, 2010, and contained 10,810,288 protein sequence entries. Searches were also conducted using a reversed sequence decoy strategy. A species filter was not used. Peptide and protein identifications were validated using Scaffold version 2.2.00 (Proteome Software) and the PeptideProphet algorithm (23.Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Empirical statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3885) Google Scholar). Probability thresholds were greater than 99% probability for protein identifications, based upon at least two individual peptides, each identified with 95% probability. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. To confirm the identities of individual key peptides from the proteins fibrillarin, Nop2, Cdk1, and Nop56, experimental MS/MS spectra identifying peptides from these proteins were compared with archived MS/MS spectra from Peptide Atlas (available on the World Wide Web). To quantitate peptide abundances, ion-specific chromatograms for each peptide were extracted to the second decimal place, and their peak areas were measured using QuantBrowser (Thermo). To verify each ion peak, the elution times of these extracted ion peaks were compared with the elution time at which each identifying MS/MS spectra was collected. The immunization regimen and generation of hybridoma cells to produce mAbs against isolated NLi were performed by Cell Essentials, Inc. (Boston). Hybridomas were screened to select positive clones by ELISA and subsequently immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. For laser microsurgery, 8–10 oocytes were transferred into a 3-μl drop of 0.45-μm-filtered, buffered sea water in a Hamilton Thorne 2X-CEL 80-μm Analysis Chamber. The chamber was closed with a 2X-CEL coverslip and topped with a 1.0-mm-thick glass cover. A 150-μs pulsed 1480-nm laser set at 300 milliwatts was directed into a 5-μm spot through the ×40 objective using a Hamilton Thorne (Beverly, MA) XYClone laser system mounted on a Nikon 90i microscope. A visible light beam sight guide of the same diameter was used to effect precise targeting. Controls were irradiated using these same parameters but instead striking within the nucleolus. Following irradiation, oocytes were quickly transferred to fresh sea water and fertilized. Oocytes were fixed at 10 min postfertilization to visualize the NLi, centrosomes, and asters by immunofluorescence. We reiterate here for clarity that at the time of laser irradiation (unactivated oocyte stage), no centrosomes or spindle are present. These elements arise only after fertilization or parthenogenetic activation. NLi can be separated from nucleoli and other cell components by sucrose density gradient centrifugation for compositional analysis. First, GVs were isolated from unactivated oocytes based on methods described by Maul and Avdalovi (21.Maul G.G. Avdalovi N. Nuclear envelope proteins from Spisula solidissima germinal vesicles.Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 130: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This step eliminated almost all cellular debris (Fig. 1, A–C). Nucleoli are highly labile and disintegrate during cell lysis (Fig. 1B), leaving only three structures visible in the preparation: the nuclear envelope and the prophase chromosomes and NLi within (Fig. 1C). NLi are highly dense and are separated from nuclear envelopes, chromatin, and soluble contaminants by sonication and centrifugation through 40% sucrose at just 780 × g for 8 min (Fig. 1D). In addition to monitoring the enrichment of NLi during cell fractionation by DIC microscopy (Fig. 1), LC-MS/MS and Western blots were used to assess the enrichment of specific NLi components (described in detail below). Total RNA was extracted from isolated NLi for library construction and sequence analysis. We estimated 0.7 ± 0.16 (S.E.) pg of RNA/NLi. An initial BLAST analysis revealed that ribosomal RNA sequences constituted ∼91% of our clones. These were screened out of our sample set. Cloning and sequencing were continued until the library was deemed exhausted of new non-rRNA sequences, a point reached after ∼3,100 cDNA clones. A total of 266 non-rRNAs were identified for subsequent analysis (supplemental Table 1), all but three found among the first 1,800 clones sequenced. Although it cannot be quantitated at present, this suggests that the resident transcriptome of the NLi is substantially limited in scope. The major component of the NLi RNA library, comprising ∼67% of clones, assembled into a single 1.1-kb contig, named Contig 1. Contig 1 included the NLi-1 sequence previously reported to localize specifically to the NLi by in situ hybridization (2.Alliegro M.A. Henry J.J. Alliegro M.C. Rediscovery of the nucleolinus, a dynamic RNA-rich organelle associated with the nucleolus, spindle, and centrosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13718-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The remaining 89 (non-Contig 1) sequences included 37 independent clones and 52 others that assembled into 16 contigs for a total of 54 unique, non-rRNA sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers JN196042–JN196094). These ranged in size from 41 to 415 nucleotides in length. Thirteen of these exhibited similarity to database entries, most at low stringency (Table 1). Noteworthy examples include clone N11E09, which exhibited similarity (8e−16) to centrosome-associated RNA from Spisula; clone N27B08, similar to a Spisula zinc finger protein (2e−27) also found associated with centrosomes (22.Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Centrosomal RNA correlates with intron-poor nuclear genes in Spisula oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6993-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); and clone N2C05, which exhibited high identity (2e−73) with an uncharacterized human chromosomal segment. In addition to NLi-1 RNA, three other sequences (Contig 2, N2C05, and N3H05) were examined by in situ hybridization. All three were localized to the NLi in unactivated oocytes (Fig. 2), and until a more descriptive name is determined, they are referred to as NLi-2 through NLi-4 RNAs, respectively.TABLE 1Database similarities for 13 RNAs extracted from isolated NLiClone/ContigSizeTop database hit (E ≤ 0.01)E valueAlgorithmbpContig 1/NLi-1 (177)1118Thermomonospora curvata DSM 43183, complete genome3e−3tBLASTxContig 13 (2)169Canis familiaris chromosome 31, clone XX-107H222e−10BLASTnN2C05/NLi-2168Homo sapiens chromosome 15 clone (+ others)2e−73BLASTnN3H05/NLi-3248Shewanella violacea DSS12 DNA, complete genome2e−9tBLASTxN10E02169Zebrafish DNA sequence from clone CH1073–417H62e−5BLASTxN10G07133Oncomelania hupensis hupensis mitochondrion1e−12BLASTnN11E09135S. solidissima cnRNA86/123/186 (+ others)8e−16BLASTnN11F06269S.solidissima gene for zinc finger protein (and cnRNA190)7e−4BLASTnN15G0695Schistosoma mansoni genome sequence supercontig6e−5BLASTnN17A05152S.solidissima clone S1-F10_RUSS05 microsatellite4e−13BLASTnN18B02131S.solidissima gene for zinc finger protein3e−8BLASTnN19A11415Brachionus manjavacas MRP motif repeat 3 protein precursor0BLASTnN27B08150S. solidissima gene for zinc finger protein2e−27BLASTn Open table in a new tab We measured 5 ± 1.7 (S.E.) pg of protein per nucleolinus, indicating a mass ratio of protein/RNA of 7.

https://openalex.org/W2037619631,"Prior genomewide scans of schizophrenia support evidence of linkage to regions of chromosome 20. However, association analyses have yet to provide support for any etiologically relevant variants.We analyzed 2988 LD-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 327 genes on chromosome 20, to test for association with schizophrenia in 270 Irish high-density families (ISHDSF, N = 270 families, 1408 subjects). These SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina iSelect genotyping array which employs the Infinium assay. Given a previous report of novel linkage with chromosome 20p using latent classes of psychotic illness in this sample, association analysis was also conducted for each of five factor-derived scores based on the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness (delusions, hallucinations, mania, depression, and negative symptoms). Tests of association were conducted using the PDTPHASE and QPDTPHASE packages of UNPHASED. Empirical estimates of gene-wise significance were obtained by adaptive permutation of a) the smallest observed P-value and b) the threshold-truncated product of P-values for each locus.While no single variant was significant after LD-corrected Bonferroni-correction, our gene-dropping analyses identified loci which exceeded empirical significance criteria for both gene-based tests. Namely, R3HDML and C20orf39 are significantly associated with depressive symptoms of schizophrenia (P(emp)<2×10⁻⁵) based on the minimum P-value and truncated-product methods, respectively.Using a gene-based approach to family-based association, R3HDML and C20orf39 were found to be significantly associated with clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of gene-based analysis and support previous evidence that chromosome 20 may harbor schizophrenia susceptibility or modifier loci."
https://openalex.org/W1991778962,"Several hypotheses on divorce predict that monogamous pairs should split up more frequently after a breeding failure. Yet, deviations from the expected pattern “success-stay, failure-leave” have been reported in several species. One possible explanation for these deviations would be that individuals do not use only their own breeding performance (i.e., private information) but also that of others (i.e., public information) to decide whether or not to divorce. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relative importance of private and public information for mate choice decisions in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).We manipulated the reproductive performance of breeding pairs and measured females' preferences for their mate and the neighbouring male first following pair formation and then seven weeks later when all females had laid eggs and the young were independent. Although all females reduced their preference for their mate after a breeding failure, the decrease was significant only when the neighbouring pair had reproduced successfully. Furthermore, there was no evidence that females biased the sex ratio of their offspring according to their mate's attractiveness. On the other hand, after reproduction, both successful and unsuccessful females increased their preferences for males who had produced a larger proportion of sons. Despite the fact that other mechanisms may have also contributed to our findings, we suggest that females changed their mate preferences based on the proportion of sons produced by successful males, because offspring sex ratio reflects the male's testosterone level at the moment of fertilization and hence is an indicator of his immune condition."
https://openalex.org/W1998883590,"Humans remove large amounts of biomass from natural ecosystems, and large bodied high trophic level animals are especially sensitive and vulnerable to exploitation. The effects of removing top-predators on food webs are often difficult to predict because of limited information on species interaction strengths. Here we used a three species predator-prey model to explore relationships between energetic properties of trophodynamic linkages and interaction strengths to provide heuristic rules that indicate observable energetic conditions that are most likely to lead to stable and strong top-down control of prey by predator species. We found that strong top-down interaction strengths resulted from low levels of energy flow from prey to predators. Strong interactions are more stable when they are a consequence of low per capita predation and when predators are subsidized by recruitment. Diet composition also affects stability, but the relationship depends on the form of the functional response. Our results imply that for generalist satiating predators, strong top-down control on prey is most likely for prey items that occupy a small portion of the diet and when density dependent recruitment is moderately high."
