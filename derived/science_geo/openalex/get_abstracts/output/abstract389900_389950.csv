https://openalex.org/W2018339027,"Cysteine is the most intrinsically nucleophilic amino acid in proteins, where its reactivity is tuned to perform diverse biochemical functions. The absence of a consensus sequence that defines functional cysteines in proteins has hindered their discovery and characterization. Here we describe a proteomics method to profile quantitatively the intrinsic reactivity of cysteine residues en masse directly in native biological systems. Hyper-reactivity was a rare feature among cysteines and it was found to specify a wide range of activities, including nucleophilic and reductive catalysis and sites of oxidative modification. Hyper-reactive cysteines were identified in several proteins of uncharacterized function, including a residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny that we show is required for yeast viability and is involved in iron-sulphur protein biogenesis. We also demonstrate that quantitative reactivity profiling can form the basis for screening and functional assignment of cysteines in computationally designed proteins, where it discriminated catalytically active from inactive cysteine hydrolase designs."

https://openalex.org/W2050843600,"Cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNAs are methylated at the N-7 and 2'-O positions of the 5' guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability, the function of 2'-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago. Here we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2'-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild-type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 2'-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2'-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and, specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2'-O methylation of the 5' cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2'-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA probably serves as an example for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015734897,"Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1s) are abundant retrotransposons that comprise approximately 20% of mammalian genomes. Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or gene expression fine-tuning. We have shown previously that L1 retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues. In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by the environment. The neuronal specificity of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activator. The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient stimulation of L1 transcription. The activity of L1 retrotransposons during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1 retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1 neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2170669858,"Post-transcriptional gene regulation frequently occurs through elements in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2166511841,"Background Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the leading cause of dementia. Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the first strongly supported LOAD susceptibility genes since the discovery of the involvement of APOE in the early 1990s. We have now exploited these GWAS datasets to uncover key LOAD pathophysiological processes. Methodology We applied a recently developed tool for mining GWAS data for biologically meaningful information to a LOAD GWAS dataset. The principal findings were then tested in an independent GWAS dataset. Principal Findings We found a significant overrepresentation of association signals in pathways related to cholesterol metabolism and the immune response in both of the two largest genome-wide association studies for LOAD. Significance Processes related to cholesterol metabolism and the innate immune response have previously been implicated by pathological and epidemiological studies of Alzheimer's disease, but it has been unclear whether those findings reflected primary aetiological events or consequences of the disease process. Our independent evidence from two large studies now demonstrates that these processes are aetiologically relevant, and suggests that they may be suitable targets for novel and existing therapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2074561441,"We are familiar with the unpleasant and often irritating odour associated with acids, but whereas acid receptors are known to underlie the detection of sour tastes, no acid-sensing neurons were known in the olfactory system. Greg Suh and colleagues now report the identification of such neurons in the olfactory system of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. Acid sensing also requires the transmembrane protein IR64a to be expressed in those neurons. IR64a is not sufficient by itself to determine acid recognition, but its requirement is the first known function for a member of the recently discovered ionotropic receptor family of putative odorant receptors. Acid sensing has so far been demonstrated in the gustatory system only. Now, fruitfly olfactory sensory neurons selectively activated by acidic compounds have been identified. Acid sensing also requires the transmembrane protein IR64a, expressed in those neurons as well as neurons involved in the detection of non acidic odorants. Although the IR64a protein isn't sufficient by itself to determine acid recognition, the requirement for IR64a in acid recognition is the first function for a member of this recently discovered family of putative odorant receptors — the ionotropic receptor family. The odour of acids has a distinct quality that is perceived as sharp, pungent and often irritating1. How acidity is sensed and translated into an appropriate behavioural response is poorly understood. Here we describe a functionally segregated population of olfactory sensory neurons in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, that are highly selective for acidity. These olfactory sensory neurons express IR64a, a member of the recently identified ionotropic receptor (IR) family of putative olfactory receptors2. In vivo calcium imaging showed that IR64a+ neurons projecting to the DC4 glomerulus in the antennal lobe are specifically activated by acids. Flies in which the function of IR64a+ neurons or the IR64a gene is disrupted had defects in acid-evoked physiological and behavioural responses, but their responses to non-acidic odorants remained unaffected. Furthermore, artificial stimulation of IR64a+ neurons elicited avoidance responses. Taken together, these results identify cellular and molecular substrates for acid detection in the Drosophila olfactory system and support a labelled-line mode of acidity coding at the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W1966688540,"Bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with one another in diverse environments. A new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), was discovered recently in Escherichia coli. CDI is mediated by the CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion (TPS) system. CdiB facilitates secretion of the CdiA 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. An additional small immunity protein (CdiI) protects CDI(+) cells from autoinhibition. The mechanisms by which CDI blocks cell growth and by which CdiI counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. Moreover, the existence of CDI activity in other bacteria has not been explored. Here we show that the CDI growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), and that CdiI binds and inactivates cognate CdiA-CT, but not heterologous CdiA-CT. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple bacterial species encode functional CDI systems with high sequence variability in the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions. CdiA-CT heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during CDI. Indeed, CdiA-CTs from uropathogenic E. coli and the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities, each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. Finally, we show that bacteria lacking the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type CDI(+) cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. Taken together, these results suggest that CDI systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition."

The nucleoprotein (NP) of Lassa virus has essential roles in viral RNA synthesis and immune suppression, the molecular mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of Lassa virus NP at 1.80 Å resolution, which reveals amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal domains with structures unlike any of the reported viral NPs. The N domain folds into a novel structure with a deep cavity for binding the m7GpppN cap structure that is required for viral RNA transcription, whereas the C domain contains 3′–5′ exoribonuclease activity involved in suppressing interferon induction. To our knowledge this is the first X-ray crystal structure solved for an arenaviral NP, which reveals its unexpected functions and indicates unique mechanisms in cap binding and immune evasion. These findings provide great potential for vaccine and drug development. Lassa fever virus (LASV) is a pathogenic arenavirus that can cause severe haemorrhagic fever diseases in humans, for which there is no vaccine or effective therapy. The first crystal structure of LASV nucleoprotein, at 1.80 Å resolution, reveals unexpected functions. The C-terminal domain has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity and the nucleoprotein is capable of cleaving short RNAs and suppressing virus-induced interferon induction. The N-terminal domain contains a unique cap-binding feature, which has implications for understanding the distinctive cap-snatching mechanism of arenaviruses. The first crystal structure for an arenavirus nucleoprotein is solved, revealing some new functions. The C-terminal domain has 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, and it is confirmed that Lassa virus nucleoprotein is capable of cleaving short RNAs and suppressing virus-induced interferon induction.

https://openalex.org/W2107470925,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are inhibitors of cytoplasmic Janus kinases (Jak) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways. Previously the authors surprisingly observed that SOCS1 translocated into the nucleus, which was because of the presence of a nuclear localization sequence. This report now hypothesizes that SOCS1 mediates specific functions within the nuclear compartment because it is instantly transported into the nucleus, as shown by photoactivation and live cell imaging in human HEK293 cells. The NFkB component p65 is identified as an interaction partner for SOCS1 but not for other members of the SOCS family. SOCS1 bound to p65 only within the nucleus. By means of its SOCS box domain, SOCS1 operated as a ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of nuclear p65. Thus, SOCS1 limited prolonged p65 signaling and terminated expression of NFκB inducible genes. Using mutants that lack either nuclear translocation or a functional SOCS box, this report identifies genes that are regulated in a manner dependent on the nuclear availability of SOCS1. Data show that beyond its receptor-proximal function in Jak/STAT signaling, SOCS1 also regulates the duration of NFκB signaling within the cell nucleus, thus exerting a heretofore unrecognized function.—Strebovsky, J., Walker, P., Lang, R., Dalpke, A.

https://openalex.org/W1966403813,"Background Abnormal germline DNA methylation in males has been proposed as a possible mechanism compromising spermatogenesis of some men currently diagnosed with idiopathic infertility. Previous studies have been focused on imprinted genes with DNA methylation in poor quality human sperms. However, recent but limited data have revealed that sperm methylation abnormalities may involve large numbers of genes or shown that genes that are not imprinted are also affected. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing method, we examined methylation patterns of the promoter of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (NG_013351: 1538–1719) in sperm DNA obtained from 94 idiopathic infertile men and 54 normal fertile controls. Subjects with idiopathic infertility were further divided into groups of normozoospermia and oligozoospermia. Overall, 45% (41/94) of idiopathic infertile males had MTHFR hypermethylation (both hemimethylation and full methylation), compared with 15% of fertile controls (P<0.05). Subjects with higher methylation level of MTHFR were more likely to have idiopathic male infertility (P-value for trend = 0.0007). Comparing the two groups of idiopathic infertile subjects with different sperm concentrations, a higher methylation pattern was found in the group with oligozoospermia. Conclusions Hypermethylation of the promoter of MTHFR gene in sperms is associated with idiopathic male infertility. The functional relevance of hypermathylation of MTHFR to male fertility warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2045641443,"Particle physicists have proposed many different solutions to the dark matter problem: dark matter constitutes 85% of all the matter in the Universe, but we still don't know what it actually is. Of the competing candidates, WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) are attracting particular attention because they arise naturally from new theories that seek to extend the standard model of particle physics. In a review in this issue of Nature, Gianfranco Bertone explains why he thinks the moment of truth has arrived for WIMPs. If the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe's particle-physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland, and the latest astroparticle experiments fail to observe WIMPs in the next decade, he reckons, the new era of physics will be on hold for 20 years or more. By that time, a new generation of particle colliders might have arrived. We know that dark matter constitutes 85 per cent of all the matter in the Universe, but we do not know of what it is made. Among the many dark matter candidates proposed, WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) occupy a special place. The moment of truth has now come for WIMPs: either we will discover them in the next five to ten years, or we will witness their inevitable decline.

https://openalex.org/W2143390164,"Quantum networks are composed of quantum nodes that interact coherently by way of quantum channels and open a broad frontier of scientific opportunities. For example, a quantum network can serve as a `web' for connecting quantum processors for computation and communication, as well as a `simulator' for enabling investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and of efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. While such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems (i.e., N=2 quantum systems), entangled states with N > 2 have heretofore not been achieved for quantum interconnects that coherently `clock' multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity measurement-induced entanglement stored in four atomic memories; user-controlled, coherent transfer of atomic entanglement to four photonic quantum channels; and the characterization of the full quadripartite entanglement by way of quantum uncertainty relations. Our work thereby provides an important tool for the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks."

We used a combination of approaches to health systems strengthening to reduce transmission of HIV from mother to infant in a multi-facility public health system in South Africa.All primary care sites and specialized birthing centers in a resource constrained sub-district of Cape Metro District, South Africa, were enrolled in a quality improvement (QI) programme. All pregnant women receiving antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal infant care in the sub-district between January 2006 and March 2009 were included in the intervention that had a prototype-innovation phase and a rapid spread phase. System changes were introduced to help frontline healthcare workers to identify and improve performance gaps at each step of the PMTCT pathway. Improvement was facilitated and spread through the use of a Breakthrough Series Collaborative that accelerated learning and the spread of successful changes. Protocol changes and additional resources were introduced by provincial and municipal government. The proportion of HIV-exposed infants testing positive declined from 7.6% to 5%. Key intermediate PMTCT processes improved (antenatal AZT increased from 74% to 86%, PMTCT clients on HAART at the time of labour increased from 10% to 25%, intrapartum AZT increased from 43% to 84%, and postnatal HIV testing from 79% to 95%) compared to baseline.System improvement methods, protocol changes and addition/reallocation of resources contributed to improved PMTCT processes and outcomes in a resource constrained setting. The intervention requires a clear design, leadership buy-in, building local capacity to use systems improvement methods, and a reliable data system. A systems improvement approach offers a much needed approach to rapidly improve under-performing PMTCT implementation programmes at scale in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2002523753,"Background Although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is emerging as a significant threat to tuberculosis control in high HIV prevalence countries such as South Africa, limited data is available on the burden of drug resistant tuberculosis and any association with HIV in such settings. We conducted a community-based representative survey to assess the MDR-TB burden in Khayelitsha, an urban township in South Africa with high HIV and TB prevalence. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adult clinic attendees suspected for pulmonary tuberculosis in two large primary care clinics, together constituting 50% of the tuberculosis burden in Khayelitsha. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for isoniazid and rifampicin was conducted using a line probe assay on positive sputum cultures, and with culture-based DST for first and second-line drugs. Between May and November 2008, culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 271 new and 264 previously treated tuberculosis suspects (sample enriched with previously treated cases). Among those with known HIV status, 55% and 71% were HIV infected respectively. MDR-TB was diagnosed in 3.3% and 7.7% of new and previously treated cases. These figures equate to an estimated case notification rate for MDR-TB of 51/100,000/year, with new cases constituting 55% of the estimated MDR-TB burden. HIV infection was not significantly associated with rifampicin resistance in multivariate analyses. Conclusions/Significance There is an extremely high burden of MDR-TB in this setting, most likely representing ongoing transmission. These data highlight the need to diagnose drug resistance among all TB cases, and for innovative models of case detection and treatment for MDR-TB, in order to interrupt transmission and control this emerging epidemic."

Using this data we examined joint associations of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with a range of cardiovascular risk factors. 25(OH)D was inversely associated with fasting insulin (mean difference in insulin per 1 standard deviation 25(OH)D: -0.053 (95%CI: -0.091, -0.015)), glucose (-0.046 95%CI: -0.081, -0.012) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-0.032 95%CI: -0.062, -0.001), and positively associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-c (0.088 95%CI: 0.044, 0.148), after adjustment for ethnicity, smoking, socio-economic status and waist circumference. PTH was positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (0.110, 95%CI: 0.055, 0.164) in confounder adjusted models, but was not associated with other cardiovascular risk factors. Albumin adjusted calcium was associated with triglycerides (0.102 95%CI: 0.063, 0.141), postload glucose (0.078, 95%CI: 0.025, 0.130), fasting insulin (0.074, 95%CI: 0.044, 0.104), HbA1c (0.070, 95%CI: 0.036, 0.105), SBP (0.064, 95%CI: 0.028, 0.100), fasting glucose (0.055, 95%CI: 0.018, 0.092) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.052, 95%CI: 0.014, 0.091). With mutual adjustment for each other, these associations remained essentially unchanged.Lower levels of 25(OH)D and higher levels of calcium and PTH appear to be associated with different cardiovascular risk factors and may therefore affect cardiovascular disease risk through different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2019802654,"Background Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) are a transient multipotent embryonic cell population that represents a defining characteristic of vertebrates. The neural crest (NC) gives rise to many derivatives including the neurons and glia of the sensory and autonomic ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, enteric neurons and glia, melanocytes, and the cartilaginous, bony and connective tissue of the craniofacial skeleton, cephalic neuroendocrine organs, and some heart vessels. Methodology/Principal Findings We present evidence that neural crest (NC) competence can be acquired very early when human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are selectively neuralized towards dorsal neuroepithelium in the absence of feeder cells in fully defined conditions. When hESC-derived neurospheres are plated on fibronectin, some cells emigrate onto the substrate. These early migratory Neural Crest Stem Cells (emNCSCs) uniformly upregulate Sox10 and vimentin, downregulate N-cadherin, and remodel F-actin, consistent with a transition from neuroepithelium to a mesenchymal NC cell. Over 13% of emNCSCs upregulate CD73, a marker of mesenchymal lineage characteristic of cephalic NC and connexin 43, found on early migratory NC cells. We demonstrated that emNCSCs give rise in vitro to all NC lineages, are multipotent on clonal level, and appropriately respond to developmental factors. We suggest that human emNCSC resemble cephalic NC described in model organisms. Ex vivo emNCSCs can differentiate into neurons in Ret.k- mouse embryonic gut tissue cultures and transplanted emNCSCs incorporate into NC-derived structures but not CNS tissues in chick embryos. Conclusions/Significance These findings will provide a framework for further studying early human NC development including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition during NC delamination."
https://openalex.org/W2156771687,"Background Many inducible transcription factors are regulated through batteries of posttranslational modifications that couple their activity to inducing stimuli. We have studied such regulation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), a key protein in control of the heat shock response, and a participant in carcinogenisis, neurological health and aging. As the mechanisms involved in the intracellular regulation of HSF1 in good health and its dysregulation in disease are still incomplete we are investigating the role of posttranslational modifications in such regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings In a proteomic study of HSF1 binding partners, we have discovered its association with the pleiotropic protein kinase A (PKA). HSF1 binds avidly to the catalytic subunit of PKA, (PKAcα) and becomes phosphorylated on a novel serine phosphorylation site within its central regulatory domain (serine 320 or S320), both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular PKAcα levels and phosphorylation of HSF1 at S320 were both required for HSF1 to be localized to the nucleus, bind to response elements in the promoter of an HSF1 target gene (hsp70.1) and activate hsp70.1 after stress. Reduction in PKAcα levels by small hairpin RNA led to HSF1 exclusion from the nucleus, its exodus from the hsp70.1 promoter and decreased hsp70.1 transcription. Likewise, null mutation of HSF1 at S320 by alanine substitution for serine led to an HSF1 species excluded from the nucleus and deficient in hsp70.1 activation. Conclusions These findings of PKA regulation of HSF1 through S320 phosphorylation add to our knowledge of the signaling networks converging on this factor and may contribute to elucidating its complex roles in the stress response and understanding HSF1 dysregulation in disease."

https://openalex.org/W2010597388,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major human pathogen causing chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. One of the mechanisms whereby it induces damage depends on its interference with proliferation of host tissues. We here describe the discovery of a novel bacterial factor able to inhibit the cell-cycle of exposed cells, both of gastric and non-gastric origin. An integrated approach was adopted to isolate and characterise the molecule from the bacterial culture filtrate produced in a protein-free medium: size-exclusion chromatography, non-reducing gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, mutant analysis, recombinant protein expression and enzymatic assays. L-asparaginase was identified as the factor responsible for cell-cycle inhibition of fibroblasts and gastric cell lines. Its effect on cell-cycle was confirmed by inhibitors, a knockout strain and the action of recombinant L-asparaginase on cell lines. Interference with cell-cycle in vitro depended on cell genotype and was related to the expression levels of the concurrent enzyme asparagine synthetase. Bacterial subcellular distribution of L-asparaginase was also analysed along with its immunogenicity. H. pylori L-asparaginase is a novel antigen that functions as a cell-cycle inhibitor of fibroblasts and gastric cell lines. We give evidence supporting a role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases and discuss its potential diagnostic application."
https://openalex.org/W2128935140,"Background There exists a lack of knowledge regarding the quantity and quality of scientific yield in relation to individual cancer types. We aimed to measure the proportion, quality and relevance of oncology-related articles, and to relate this output to their associated disease burden. By incorporating the impact factor(IF) and Eigenfactor™(EF) into our analysis we also assessed the relationship between these indices and the output under study. Methods All publications in 2007 were retrieved for the 26 most common cancers. The top 20 journals ranked by IF and EF in general medicine and oncology, and the presence of each malignancy within these titles was analysed. Journals publishing most prolifically on each cancer were identified and their impact assessed. Principal Findings 63260 (PubMed) and 126845 (WoS) entries were generated, respectively. 26 neoplasms accounted for 25% of total output from the top medical publications. 5 cancers dominated the first quartile of output in the top oncology journals; breast, prostate, lung, and intestinal cancer, and leukaemia. Journals associated with these cancers were associated with much higher IFs and EFs than those journals associated with the other cancer types under study, although these measures were not equivalent across all sub-specialties. In addition, yield on each cancer was related to its disease burden as measured by its incidence and prevalence. Conclusions Oncology enjoys disproportionate representation in the more prestigious medical journals. 5 cancers dominate yield, although this attention is justified given their associated disease burden. The commonly used IF and the recently introduced EF do not correlate in the assessment of the preeminent oncology journals, nor at the level of individual malignancies; there is a need to delineate between proxy measures of quality and the relevance of output when assessing its merit.

Tirapazamine (TPZ), a well-characterized bioreductive anticancer agent, is currently in Phase II and III clinical trials. A major aspect of the anticancer activity of TPZ is its identity as a tumor-specific topoisomerase IIα inhibitor. In the study, for the first time, we found that TPZ acts in a novel manner to inhibit HIF-1α accumulation driven by hypoxia or growth factors in human cancer cells and in HepG2 cell-derived tumors in athymic nude mice. We investigated the mechanism of TPZ on HIF-1α in HeLa human cervical cancer cells by western blot analysis, reverse transcription-PCR assay, luciferase reporter assay and small interfering RNA (siRNA) assay. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that neither HIF-1α mRNA levels nor HIF-1α protein degradation are affected by TPZ. However, TPZ was found to be involved in HIF-1α translational regulation. Further studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of TPZ on HIF-1α protein synthesis is dependent on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) rather than the mTOR complex 1/eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (mTORC1/4E-BP1) pathway. Immunofluorescence analysis of tumor sections provide the in vivo evidences to support our hypothesis. Additionally, siRNA specifically targeting topoisomerase IIα did not reverse the ability of TPZ to inhibit HIF-1α expression, suggesting that the HIF-1α inhibitory activity of TPZ is independent of its topoisomerase IIα inhibition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TPZ is a potent regulator of HIF-1α and provide new insight into the potential molecular mechanism whereby TPZ serves to reduce HIF-1α expression."
https://openalex.org/W2083630839,"Sea turtles are long-distance migrants with considerable behavioural plasticity in terms of migratory patterns, habitat use and foraging sites within and among populations. However, for the most widely migrating turtle, the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, studies combining data from individuals of different populations are uncommon. Such studies are however critical to better understand intra- and inter-population variability and take it into account in the implementation of conservation strategies of this critically endangered species. Here, we investigated the movements and diving behaviour of 16 Atlantic leatherback turtles from three different nesting sites and one foraging site during their post-breeding migration to assess the potential determinants of intra- and inter-population variability in migratory patterns.Using satellite-derived behavioural and oceanographic data, we show that turtles used Temporary Residence Areas (TRAs) distributed all around the Atlantic Ocean: 9 in the neritic domain and 13 in the oceanic domain. These TRAs did not share a common oceanographic determinant but on the contrary were associated with mesoscale surface oceanographic features of different types (i.e., altimetric features and/or surface chlorophyll a concentration). Conversely, turtles exhibited relatively similar horizontal and vertical behaviours when in TRAs (i.e., slow swimming velocity/sinuous path/shallow dives) suggesting foraging activity in these productive regions. Migratory paths and TRAs distribution showed interesting similarities with the trajectories of passive satellite-tracked drifters, suggesting that the general dispersion pattern of adults from the nesting sites may reflect the extent of passive dispersion initially experienced by hatchlings.Intra- and inter-population behavioural variability may therefore be linked with initial hatchling drift scenarios and be highly influenced by environmental conditions. This high degree of behavioural plasticity in Atlantic leatherback turtles makes species-targeted conservation strategies challenging and stresses the need for a larger dataset (>100 individuals) for providing general recommendations in terms of conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2022446852,"Phosphorylation is an important type of protein post-translational modification. Identification of possible phosphorylation sites of a protein is important for understanding its functions. Unbiased screening for phosphorylation sites by in vitro or in vivo experiments is time consuming and expensive; in silico prediction can provide functional candidates and help narrow down the experimental efforts. Most of the existing prediction algorithms take only the polypeptide sequence around the phosphorylation sites into consideration. However, protein phosphorylation is a very complex biological process in vivo. The polypeptide sequences around the potential sites are not sufficient to determine the phosphorylation status of those residues. In the current work, we integrated various data sources such as protein functional domains, protein subcellular location and protein-protein interactions, along with the polypeptide sequences to predict protein phosphorylation sites. The heterogeneous information significantly boosted the prediction accuracy for some kinase families. To demonstrate potential application of our method, we scanned a set of human proteins and predicted putative phosphorylation sites for Cyclin-dependent kinases, Casein kinase 2, Glycogen synthase kinase 3, Mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C families (avaiable at http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/huphospho). The predicted phosphorylation sites can serve as candidates for further experimental validation. Our strategy may also be applicable for the in silico identification of other post-translational modification substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2109248668,"Free-flying insectivorous bats occasionally collide with stationary objects they should easily detect by echolocation and avoid. Collisions often occur with lighted objects, suggesting ambient light may deleteriously affect obstacle avoidance capabilities. We tested the hypothesis that free-flying bats may orient by vision when they collide with some obstacles. We additionally tested whether acoustic distractions, such as ""distress calls"" of other bats, contributed to probabilities of collision.To investigate the role of visual cues in the collisions of free-flying little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with stationary objects, we set up obstacles in an area of high bat traffic during swarming. We used combinations of light intensities and visually dissimilar obstacles to verify that bats orient by vision. In early August, bats collided more often in the light than the dark, and probabilities of collision varied with the visibility of obstacles. However, the probabilities of collisions altered in mid to late August, coincident with the start of behavioural, hormonal, and physiological changes occurring during swarming and mating. Distress calls did not distract bats and increase the incidence of collisions.Our findings indicate that visual cues are more important for free-flying bats than previously recognized, suggesting integration of multi-sensory modalities during orientation. Furthermore, our study highlights differences between responses of captive and wild bats, indicating a need for more field experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1991881823,"Background Bone generation and maintenance involve osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes which originate from unique precursors and rely on key growth factors for differentiation. However, an incomplete understanding of bone forming cells during wound healing has led to an unfilled clinical need such as nonunion of bone fractures. Since circulating monocytes are often recruited to sites of injury and may differentiate into various cell types including osteoclasts, we investigated the possibility that circulating monocytes in the context of tissue injury may also contribute to bone repair. In particular, we hypothesized that LL-37 (produced from hCAP-18, cathelicidin), which recruits circulating monocytes during injury, may play a role in bone repair. Methods and Findings Treatment of monocytes from blood with LL-37 for 6 days resulted in their differentiation to large adherent cells. Growth of LL-37-differentiated monocytes on osteologic discs reveals bone-like nodule formation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In vivo transplantation studies in NOD/SCID mice show that LL-37-differentiated monocytes form bone-like structures similar to endochondral bone formation. Importantly, LL-37-differentiated monocytes are distinct from conventional monocyte-derived osteoclasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells and do not express markers of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) lineage, distinguishing them from the conventional precursors of osteoblasts. Furthermore, LL-37 differentiated monocytes express intracellular proteins of both the osteoblast and osteoclast lineage including osteocalcin (OC), osteonectin (ON), bone sialoprotein II (BSP II), osteopontin (OP), RANK, RANKL, MMP-9, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and cathepsin K (CK). Conclusion Blood derived monocytes treated with LL-37 can be differentiated into a novel bone forming cell that functions both in vitro and in vivo. We propose the name monoosteophil to indicate their monocyte derived lineage and their bone forming phenotype. These cells may have wide ranging implications in the clinic including repair of broken bones and treatment of osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2169897314,"In the current report, we compared the specificities of antibody responses in sera from volunteers enrolled in three US NIH-supported HIV vaccine trials using different immunization regimens. HIV-1 Env-specific binding antibody, neutralizing antibody, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and profiles of antibody specificity were analyzed for human immune sera collected from vaccinees enrolled in the NIH HIV Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN) Study #041 (recombinant protein alone), HVTN Study #203 (poxviral vector prime-protein boost), and the DP6-001 study (DNA prime-protein boost). Vaccinees from HVTN Study #041 had the highest neutralizing antibody activities against the sensitive virus along with the highest binding antibody responses, particularly those directed toward the V3 loop. DP6-001 sera showed a higher frequency of positive neutralizing antibody activities against more resistant viral isolate with a significantly higher CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibody response compared to both HVTN studies #041 and #203. No differences were found in CD4-induced (CD4i) antibody responses, ADCC activity, or complement activation by Env-specific antibody among these sera. Given recent renewed interest in realizing the importance of antibody responses for next generation HIV vaccine development, different antibody profiles shown in the current report, based on the analysis of a wide range of antibody parameters, provide critical biomarker information for the selection of HIV vaccines for more advanced human studies and, in particular, those that can elicit antibodies targeting conformational-sensitive and functionally conserved epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2093986108,"The Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaR) regulates salt and water transport in the kidney as demonstrated by the association of gain of function CaR mutations with a Bartter syndrome-like, salt-wasting phenotype, but the precise mechanism for this effect is not fully established. We found previously that the CaR interacts with and inactivates an inwardly rectifying K(+) channel, Kir4.1, which is expressed in the distal nephron that contributes to the basolateral K(+) conductance, and in which loss of function mutations are associated with a complex phenotype that includes renal salt wasting. We now find that CaR inactivates Kir4.1 by reducing its cell surface expression. Mutant CaRs reduced Kir4.1 cell surface expression and current density in HEK-293 cells in proportion to their signaling activity. Mutant, activated Gα(q) reduced cell surface expression and current density of Kir4.1, and these effects were blocked by RGS4, a protein that blocks signaling via Gα(i) and Gα(q). Other α subunits had insignificant effects. Knockdown of caveolin-1 blocked the effect of Gα(q) on Kir4.1, whereas knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain had no effect. CaR had no comparable effect on the renal outer medullary K(+) channel, an apical membrane distal nephron K(+) channel that is internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that the CaR and Kir4.1 physically associate with caveolin-1 in HEK cells and in kidney extracts. Thus, the CaR decreases cell surface expression of Kir4.1 channels via a mechanism that involves Gα(q) and caveolin. These results provide a novel molecular basis for the inhibition of renal NaCl transport by the CaR."

https://openalex.org/W2063576070,"Cryptococcal infection is a frequent cause of mortality in Cambodian HIV-infected patients with CD4+ count ≤100 cells/µl. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for cryptococcosis prevention in HIV-infected patients.A MARKOV DECISION TREE WAS USED TO COMPARE THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES AT THE TIME OF HIV DIAGNOSIS: no intervention, one time systematic serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) screening and treatment of positive patients, and systematic primary prophylaxis with fluconazole. The trajectory of a hypothetical cohort of HIV-infected patients with CD4+ count ≤100 cells/µl initiating care was simulated over a 1-year period (cotrimoxazole initiation at enrollment; antiretroviral therapy within 3 months). Natural history and cost data (US$ 2009) were from Cambodia. Efficacy data were from international literature.In a population in which 81% of patients had a CD4+ count ≤50 cells/ µl and 19% a CD4+ count between 51-100 cells/µl, the proportion alive 1 year after enrollment was 61% (cost $ 472) with no intervention, 70% (cost $ 483) with screening, and 72% (cost $ 492) with prophylaxis. After one year of follow-up, the cost-effectiveness of screening vs. no intervention was US$ 180/life year gained (LYG). The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis vs. screening was $ 511/LYG. The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis vs. screening was estimated at $1538/LYG if the proportion of patients with CD4+ count ≤50 cells/µl decreased by 75%.In a high endemic area of cryptococcosis and HIV infection, serum CRAG screening and prophylaxis are two cost effective strategies to prevent AIDS associated cryptococcosis in patients with CD4+ count ≤100 cells/µl, at a short-term horizon, screening being more cost-effective but less effective than prophylaxis. Systematic primary prophylaxis may be preferred in patients with CD4+ below 50 cells/µl while systematic serum CRAG screening for early targeted treatment may be preferred in patients with CD4+ between 51-100 cells/µl."
https://openalex.org/W2140861001,"Objective To determine whether inflammatory and hemostasis response in patients hospitalized for pneumonia varies by age and whether these differences explain higher mortality in the elderly. Methods In an observational cohort of subjects with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recruited from emergency departments (ED) in 28 hospitals, we divided subjects into 5 age groups (<50, 51–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85). We measured circulating levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL-6, and IL-10), hemostasis (D-dimer, Factor IX, thrombin-antithrombin complex, antithrombin and plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1), and cell-surface markers (TLR-2, TLR-4, and HLA-DR) during the first week of hospitalization and at discharge and compared 90-day mortality. We used logistic regression to compare odds ratios (OR) for 90-day mortality between age groups, adjusting for differences in pre-infection factors alone and then additionally adjusting for immune markers. Results Of 2,183 subjects, 495, 444, 403, 583, and 258 subjects were <50, 51–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years of age, respectively. Large age-related differences were observed in 90-day mortality (0.82% vs. 3.2% vs. 6.4% vs. 12.8% vs. 13.6%, p<0.01). No age-related differences in inflammatory and cell surface markers occurred during the first week. Older subjects had higher pro-coagulant markers on ED presentation and over first week (p≤0.03), but these differences were modest (1.0–1.7-fold differences). Odds of death for older adults changed minimally in models incorporating differences in hemostasis and inflammatory markers (for subjects ≥85 compared to those <50, OR = 4.36, when adjusted for pre-infection factors and OR = 3.49 when additionally adjusted for hemostasis markers). At discharge, despite clinical recovery as evidenced by normal vital signs in >85% subjects, older subjects had modestly increased hemostasis markers and IL-6 levels (p<0.01). Conclusions Modest age-related increases in coagulation response occur during hospitalization for CAP; however these differences do not explain the large differences in mortality. Despite clinical recovery, immune resolution may be delayed in older adults at discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2024039640,"In vitro models of cardiac hypertrophy focus exclusively on applying ""external"" dynamic signals (electrical, mechanical, and chemical) to achieve a hypertrophic state. In contrast, here we set out to demonstrate the role of ""self-organized"" cellular architecture and activity in reprogramming cardiac cell/tissue function toward a hypertrophic phenotype. We report that in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte culture, subtle out-of-plane microtopographic cues alter cell attachment, increase biomechanical stresses, and induce not only structural remodeling, but also yield essential molecular and electrophysiological signatures of hypertrophy. Increased cell size and cell binucleation, molecular up-regulation of released atrial natriuretic peptide, altered expression of classic hypertrophy markers, ion channel remodeling, and corresponding changes in electrophysiological function indicate a state of hypertrophy on par with other in vitro and in vivo models. Clinically used antihypertrophic pharmacological treatments partially reversed hypertrophic behavior in this in vitro model. Partial least-squares regression analysis, combining gene expression and functional data, yielded clear separation of phenotypes (control: cells grown on flat surfaces; hypertrophic: cells grown on quasi-3-dimensional surfaces and treated). In summary, structural surface features can guide cardiac cell attachment, and the subsequent syncytial behavior can facilitate trophic signals, unexpectedly on par with externally applied mechanical, electrical, and chemical stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2052950329,"Matricellular proteins are extracellular regulators of cellular adhesion, signaling and performing a variety of physiological behaviors such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. Within vascular microenvironments, matricellular proteins exert both positive and negative regulatory cues to vascular endothelium. The relative balance of these matricellular cues is believed to be critical for vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis activation or angiogenesis resolution. However, our knowledge of matricellular proteins within vascular microenvironments and the mechanisms by which these proteins impact vascular function remain largely undefined. The matricellular protein lipocalin-7 (LCN7) is found throughout vascular microenvironments, and circumstantial evidence suggests that LCN7 may be an important regulator of angiogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that LCN7 may be an important regulator of vascular function.To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of LCN7 overexpression, recombinant protein and gene knockdown in a series of in vitro and in vivo models of angiogenesis. We found that overexpression of LCN7 in MB114 and SVEC murine endothelial cell lines or administration of highly purified recombinant LCN7 protein increased endothelial cell invasion. Similarly, LCN7 increased angiogenic sprouting from quiescent endothelial cell monolayers and ex vivo aortic rings. Moreover, LCN7 increased endothelial cell sensitivity to TGF-β but did not affect sensitivity to other pro-angiogenic growth factors including bFGF and VEGF. Finally, morpholino based knockdown of LCN7 in zebrafish embryos specifically inhibited angiogenic sprouting but did not affect vasculogenesis within injected embryos.No functional analysis has previously been performed to elucidate the function of LCN7 in vascular or other cellular processes. Collectively, our results show for the first time that LCN7 is an important pro-angiogenic matricellular protein of vascular microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2140728447,"Targeted deletion of the Kcne2 potassium channel β subunit gene ablates gastric acid secretion and predisposes to gastric neoplasia in mice. Here, we discovered that Kcne2 deletion basolaterally reroutes the Kcnq1 α subunit in vivo in parietal cells (PCs), in which the normally apical location of the Kcnq1-Kcne2 channel facilitates its essential role in gastric acid secretion. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that Kcne2 deletion remodeled fundic Kcne3 (2.9±0.8-fold mRNA increase, n=10; 5.3±0.4-fold protein increase, n=7) but not Kcne1, 4, or 5, and resulted in basolateral Kcnq1-Kcne3 complex formation in Kcne2(-/-) PCs. Concomitant targeted deletion of Kcne3 (creating Kcne2(-/-)Kcne3(-/-) mice) restored PC apical Kcnq1 localization without Kcne1, 4, or 5 remodeling (assessed by quantitative RT-PCR; n=5-10), indicating Kcne3 actively, basolaterally rerouted Kcnq1 in Kcne2(-/-) PCs. Despite this, Kcne3 deletion exacerbated gastric hyperplasia in Kcne2(-/-) mice, and both hypochlorhydria and hyperplasia in Kcne2(+/-) mice, suggesting that Kcne3 up-regulation was beneficial in Kcne2-depleted PCs. The findings reveal, in vivo, Kcne-dependent α subunit polarized trafficking and the existence and consequences of potassium channel β subunit remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2056900498,"Recent experimental studies have revealed that bacteria, such as C. crescentus, show a remarkable spatial ordering of their chromosome. A strong linear correlation has been found between the position of genes on the chromosomal map and their spatial position in the cellular volume. We show that this correlation can be explained by a purely geometrical model. Namely, self-avoidance of DNA, specific positioning of one or few DNA loci (such as origin or terminus) together with the action of DNA compaction proteins (that organize the chromosome into topological domains) are sufficient to get a linear arrangement of the chromosome along the cell axis. We develop a Monte-Carlo method that allows us to test our model numerically and to analyze the dependence of the spatial ordering on various physiologically relevant parameters. We show that the proposed geometrical ordering mechanism is robust and universal (i.e. does not depend on specific bacterial details). The geometrical mechanism should work in all bacteria that have compacted chromosomes with spatially fixed regions. We use our model to make specific and experimentally testable predictions about the spatial arrangement of the chromosome in mutants of C. crescentus and the growth-stage dependent ordering in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2081008710,"Background The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression by binding with E2F transcription factor and repressing the expression of a variety of genes required for the G1-S phase transition. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that Rb and E2F1 directly participate in the control of initiation of DNA replication in human HeLa, U2OS and T98G cells by specifically binding to origins of DNA replication in a cell cycle regulated manner. We show that, both in vitro and inside the cells, the largest subunit of the origin recognition complex (Orc1) specifically binds hypo-phosphorylated Rb and that this interaction is competitive with the binding of Rb to E2F1. The displacement of Rb-bound Orc1 by E2F1 at origins of DNA replication marks the progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle toward the G1-S border. Conclusions/Significance The participation of Rb and E2F1 in the formation of the multiprotein complex that binds origins of DNA replication in mammalian cells appears to represent an effective mechanism to couple the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression to the activation of DNA replication."

The aim of the present work was to know if both EOD and exercise produce similar effects on physical capacity, studying their physiological, biochemical and metabolic effects on muscle. Male OF-1 mice were fed either ad libitum (AL) or under EOD. After 18 weeks under EOD, animals were also trained by using a treadmill for another 6 weeks and then analyzed for physical activity. Both, EOD and endurance exercise increased the resistance of animals to extenuating activity and improved motor coordination. Among the groups that showed the highest performance, AL and EOD trained animals, ALT and EODT respectively, only the EODT group was able to increase glucose and triglycerides levels in plasma after extenuating exercise. No high effects on mitochondrial respiratory chain activities or protein levels neither on coenzyme Q levels were found in gastrocnemius muscle. However, exercise and EOD did increase β-oxidation activity in this muscle accompanied by increased CD36 levels in animals fed under EOD and by changes in shape and localization of mitochondria in muscle fibers. Furthermore, EOD and training decreased muscle damage after strenuous exercise. EOD also reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation in muscle. Our results indicate that EOD improves muscle performance and resistance by increasing lipid catabolism in muscle mitochondria at the same time that prevents lipid peroxidation and muscle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2108696892,"The unique properties of embryonic stem cells (ESC) rely on long-lasting self-renewal and their ability to switch in all adult cell type programs. Recent advances have shown that regulations at the chromatin level sustain both ESC properties along with transcription factors. We have focused our interest on the epigenetic modulator HP1γ (Heterochromatin Protein 1, isoform γ) that binds histones H3 methylated at lysine 9 (meH3K9) and is highly plastic in its distribution and association with the transcriptional regulation of specific genes during cell fate transitions. These characteristics of HP1γ make it a good candidate to sustain the ESC flexibility required for rapid program changes during differentiation. Using RNA interference, we describe the functional role of HP1γ in mouse ESC. The analysis of HP1γ deprived cells in proliferative and in various differentiating conditions was performed combining functional assays with molecular approaches (RT-qPCR, microarray). We show that HP1γ deprivation slows down the cell cycle of ESC and decreases their resistance to differentiating conditions, rendering the cells poised to differentiate. In addition, HP1γ depletion hampers the differentiation to the endoderm as compared with the differentiation to the neurectoderm or the mesoderm. Altogether, our results reveal the role of HP1γ in ESC self-renewal and in the balance between the pluripotent and the differentiation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2171491195,"The roles of calmodulin (CaM) have been key points of controversy in the regulation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R). To address the issue, we studied the interaction between CaM and the suppressor domain of IP(3)R, a key allosteric regulatory domain. First, by means of a pulldown and a fluorescence titration experiment, we confirmed the interaction. Through subsequent NMR binding experiments, we observed dramatic peak disappearances of the suppressor domain on interaction with apo-CaM. The data indicated that apo-CaM induces large-scale dynamic conformational changes in the suppressor domain, involving partial unfolding and subdomain rearrangement. Analysis of the NMR data of CaM surprisingly revealed that its C lobe alone can cause such changes. Further binding experiments showed that calcium allows the free N lobe to bind to the suppressor domain, which induces extra conformational changes in both of the proteins. These results were also confirmed with CaM deletion mutants with either the N or C lobe. On the basis of this novel binding mechanism, we propose a model in which the partial unfolding of the suppressor domain by apo-CaM and the stepwise binding of the N lobe of CaM to the suppressor domain are important elements of calcium/CaM inhibition of IP(3)R. We believe that our working model encompasses previous regulation mechanisms of IP(3)R by calcium/CaM and provides new insights into the CaM-target interaction."

The aims of this study are to determine blood levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in SSc and to correlate them with clinical and biological data.Serum samples were obtained from 55 SSc patients and 32 control subjects to measure NTs levels by ELISA and to determine their relationships with SSc profiles.Serum NGF levels were higher in SSc patients (288.26 ± 170.34 pg/mL) than in control subjects (170.34 ± 50.8 pg/mL, p<0.001) and correlated with gammaglobulins levels and the presence of both anti-cardiolipin and anti-Scl-70 antibodies (p<0.05). In contrast, BDNF levels were lower in SSc patients than in controls (1121.9 ± 158.1 vs 1372.9 ± 190.9 pg/mL, p<0.0001), especially in pulmonary arterial hypertension and diffuse SSc as compared to limited forms (all p<0.05). NT-3 levels were similar in SSc and in the control group (2657.2 ± 2296 vs 2959.3 ± 2555 pg/mL, NS). BDNF levels correlated negatively with increased NGF levels in the SSc group (and not in controls).Low BDNF serum levels were not previously documented in SSc, particularly in the diffuse SSc subset and in patients with pulmonary hypertension or anti-Scl-70 antibodies. The negative correlation between NGF and BDNF levels observed in SSc and not in healthy controls could be implicated in sympathic vascular dysfunction in SSc."
https://openalex.org/W2171264266,"Our understanding of coevolution in a predator-prey system is based mostly on pair-wise interactions.Here I analyze a one-predator-two-prey system in which the predator's attack ability and the defense abilities of the prey all evolve. The coevolutionary consequences can differ dramatically depending on the initial trait value and the timing of the alternative prey's invasion into the original system. If the invading prey species has relatively low defense ability when it invades, its defense is likely to evolve to a lower level, stabilizing the population dynamics. In contrast, if when it invades its defense ability is close to that of the resident prey, its defense can evolve to a higher level and that of the resident prey may suddenly cease to evolve, destabilizing the population dynamics. Destabilization due to invasion is likely when the invading prey is adaptively superior (evolution of its defense is less constrained and fast), and it can also occur in a broad condition even when the invading prey is adaptively inferior. In addition, invasion into a resident system far from equilibrium characterized by population oscillations is likely to cause further destabilization.An invading prey species is thus likely to destabilize a resident community."

Patients and Methods Atrial tissues taken from patients who underwent open-heart surgery were examined by harmonics optical microscopy. Using the two-dimensional Fourier transformation method, a spectral-energy description of image texture was constituted and its entropy was used to quantify the mal-alignment of collagen fibers. The amount of collagen fiber was derived from its area ratio to total atrial tissue in each image. Serum C-terminal pro-collagen pro-peptide (CICP), pro-matrix metalloproteinase-1 (pro-MMP-1), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were also evaluated. Results 46 patients were evaluated, including 20 with normal sinus rhythm and 26 with AF. The entropy of spectral-energy distribution of collagen alignment was significantly higher in AF than that in sinus rhythm (3.97±0.33 vs. 2.80±0.18, p<0.005). This difference was more significant in the permanent AF group. The amount of collagen was also significantly higher in AF patients (0.39±0.13 vs. 0.18±0.06, p<0.005) but serum markers of cardiac fibrosis were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions Harmonics optical microscopy can quantify the spatial mal-alignment of collagen fibers in AF. The entropy of spectral-energy distribution of collagen alignment is a potential tool for research in atrial remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2070285472,"Background Uridine has been advocated for the treatment of HIV-1/HAART-associated lipodystrophy (HALS), although its metabolism in HIV-1-infected patients is poorly understood. Methods Plasma uridine concentrations were measured in 35 controls and 221 HIV-1-infected patients and fat uridine in 15 controls and 19 patients. The diagnosis of HALS was performed following the criteria of the Lipodystrophy Severity Grading Scale. Uridine was measured by a binary gradient-elution HPLC method. Analysis of genes encoding uridine metabolizing enzymes in fat was performed with TaqMan RT-PCR. Results Median plasma uridine concentrations for HIV-1-infected patients were 3.80 µmol/l (interquartile range: 1.60), and for controls 4.60 µmol/l (IQR: 1.8) (P = 0.0009). In fat, they were of 6.0 (3.67), and 2.8 (4.65) nmol/mg of protein, respectively (P = 0.0118). Patients with a mixed HALS form had a median plasma uridine level of 4.0 (IC95%: 3.40–4.80) whereas in those with isolated lipoatrophy it was 3.25 (2.55–4.15) µmol/l/l (P = 0.0066). The expression of uridine cytidine kinase and uridine phosphorylase genes was significantly decreased in all groups of patients with respect to controls. A higher expression of the mRNAs for concentrative nucleoside transporters was found in HIV-1-infected patients with respect to healthy controls. Conclusions HIV-1 infection is associated with a decrease in plasma uridine and a shift of uridine to the adipose tissue compartment. Antiretroviral therapy was not associated with plasma uridine concentrations, but pure lipoatrophic HALS was associated with significantly lower plasma uridine concentrations."

The catalytic course of TS is the most complex among the PLP enzymes, and it is an intriguing problem how the elementary steps are controlled in TS to carry out selective reactions. When l-vinylglycine was added to Thermus thermophilus HB8 TS in the presence of phosphate, l-threonine was formed with kcat and reaction specificity comparable with those when OPHS was used as the substrate. However, in the absence of phosphate or when sulfate was used in place of phosphate, only the side reaction product, α-ketobutyrate, was formed. Global analysis of the spectral changes in the reaction of TS with l-threonine showed that compared with the more acidic sulfate ion, the phosphate ion decreased the energy levels of the transition states of the addition of water at the Cβ of the PLP-α-aminocrotonate aldimine (AC) and the transaldimination to form l-threonine. The x-ray crystallographic analysis of TS complexed with an analog for AC gave a distinct electron density assigned to the phosphate ion derived from the solvent near the Cβ of the analog. These results indicated that the phosphate ion released from OPHS by γ-elimination acts as the base catalyst for the addition of water at Cβ of AC, thereby providing the basis of the reaction specificity.

TS is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and, together with the l- and d-serine dehydratases, threonine dehydratase, tryptophan synthase, and cysteine synthase, constitutes the β-family of PLP enzymes (2Alexander F.W.

The reaction mechanism of TS is considered to be the most complicated one catalyzed by the PLP enzymes, proceeding through all the types of intermediates formed during the catalysis of the PLP enzymes (summarized in Scheme 1 (1Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1112-1118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayashi H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Omi R. Goto M.

Neff K.H. Nordhoff E. Pohlenz H.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3413-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). In this mechanism, OPHS reacts with the PLP-Lys aldimine (internal aldimine 1) to form the external aldimine (2) and liberates the side chain of the Lys residue (transaldimination). The intermediate 2 is then converted to the ketimine (3) via a 1,3-prototropic shift. The electron-withdrawing imino group promotes deprotonation at Cβ, and after the formation of the enamine (4), the γ-phosphate group is eliminated, yielding β,γ-unsaturated ketimine (5) and a phosphate ion. In 5, deprotonation at C4′ of the cofactor and protonation at Cγ of the substrate moiety occur to form the PLP-α-aminocrotonate aldimine, 6). The stereospecific addition of a water molecule from the Re face (Cβ being taken as the prochiral center) of 6 to the Cα-Cβ double bond yields the PLP-l-threonine aldimine (8) via the quinonoid intermediate (7). Finally, attack of the ϵ-amino group of Lys on 8 releases the product l-threonine and regenerates the internal aldimine (1). The remarkable feature of this catalytic reaction is that TS can carry out many regiospecific (C4′, Cα, Cβ, and Cγ) and stereospecific proton transfers at the coenzyme-substrate complexes. Therefore, it is an intriguing problem how such specific proton transfers are enabled to optimize the reaction specificity of TS. To provide a structural basis for resolving this issue, we previously determined the x-ray crystallographic structures of a thermostable TS from Thermus thermophilus HB8 in the unliganded form and a complex form with the substrate analog, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) (8Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46035-46045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex with AP5 showed an sp2 hybridization configuration at Cα and Cβ and an sp3 hybridization configuration at C4′, indicating that it is an enamine analogous to 4. In this structure, the ϵ-amino N of Lys-61 is 3.5, 3.3, and 3.6 Å away from C4′, Cα, and Cβ, respectively. Considering the fact that the PLP binding lysine residue is the general base catalyst for the 1,3-prototropic shift in aminotransferases (10Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we can expect that the ϵ-amino group of Lys-61 is the general base catalyst for the protonation/deprotonation at these atoms, which is involved in steps 2–3, 3–4, and 7–8. In contrast to these steps, however, the catalytic steps involving protonation/deprotonation at Cγ are difficult to understand. The ϵ-amino N of Lys-61 is too far (4.7 Å) from Cγ to directly catalyze the protonation/deprotonation at Cγ, and no appropriate protein side chains that can donate/accept a proton are found in the proximity of Cγ. Based on the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus HB8 TS complexed with AP5, we pointed out the possibility that the phosphate released during 4 → 5 may reside at the active site and act as a base catalyst for the protonation/deprotonation at Cγ (8Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46035-46045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the phosphate ion in the proton transfer steps and the reaction specificity of TS have not been experimentally studied. In this study we performed kinetic and spectroscopic analyses of the reactions of the T. thermophilus HB8 TS with OPHS, l-vinylglycine, l-threonine in the presence or absence of phosphate or sulfate and showed that the phosphate ion functions as the catalyst for the addition of water at the Cβ of the PLP-α-aminocrotonate aldimine, thus enabling TS to undergo the β-synthase reaction rather than the γ-lyase reaction. Additionally, the phosphate was also suggested as the catalyst for the protonation/deprotonation at Cγ. The recombinant TS was isolated and purified as previously described (8Omi R. Goto M.

All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. (E)-4-(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-(phosphonooxymethyl)pyridin-4-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid (10) was synthesized according to the method of Schnackerz et al. (11Schnackerz K.D. Ehrlich J.H. Giesemann W. Reed T.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Removal of the cofactor from TS was performed by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at low pH according to the method of Toney and Kirsch (10Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) except that a 100-fold molar excess of hydroxylamine was added to the enzyme to remove PLP from the Lys residue before the addition of ammonium sulfate. The apoenzyme preparation was passed through a PD-10 (GE Healthcare) column twice to remove ammonium sulfate. The concentration of sulfate in the final preparation, measured after heat denaturation (3 min in boiling water) of the protein, was below the detection limit (1 μm) of the photometric method using bromthymol blue (12Madsen B.C. Murphy R.J. Anal. Chem. 1981; 53: 1924-1926Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TS was incubated with various concentrations of OPHS in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After incubation at 298 K for various periods, 100 μl of 100 mm perchloric acid was added to terminate the reaction. A 100-μl aliquot of 100 mm phenyl isothiocyanate and 100 μl of 1 m triethylamine were then added. After incubation for 1 h at 298 K, 400 μl of hexane was added and mixed, and the lower layer was loaded onto a Wakosil PTC column (Wako, Japan) using a Beckman System Gold analyzer. The phenylthiocarbamyl l-threonine was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 254 nm. The method used was a modification of that described by Möckel et al. (13Möckel B. Eggeling L. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8065-8072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TS was incubated with each concentration of substrate in a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After incubation at 298 K for 1 h, 1 ml of reagent (1 g of semicarbazide HCl plus 0.9 g of sodium acetate in 100 ml of H2O) was added to terminate the reaction. After incubation for 15 min at 298 K, 3 ml of H2O was added, and the absorbance due to the semicarbazone was read at 254 nm. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by systematically changing the concentration of l-threonine, phosphate, or sulfate. The kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using KaleidaGraph (Version 3.0, Synergy Software). The absorption spectra were measured at 298 K using a Hitachi (Japan) U-3300 spectrophotometer. Stopped-flow spectrophotometry was performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV spectrophotometer. Typically, equal volumes (75 μl each) of solution A (28 μm enzyme and 100 mm phosphate or sulfate) and solution B (various concentrations of l-threonine) were mixed. The mixing dead time was 2.3 ms under an N2 gas pressure of 500 kPa. The time-resolved spectra were collected at 298 K using SX.18MV equipped with a photodiode array accessory and XScan (Version 1.0, Applied Photophysics). The spectral data were analyzed by ProKineticist II (Version 1.9, Applied Photophysics) to obtain the spectra of the reaction intermediates and the kinetic parameters. The buffer solution for the spectrophotometric measurements contained 50 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. TS was equilibrated with this buffer by gel filtration using a PD-10 column before the measurements. The apoenzyme of TS was crystallized by the microdialysis method. The enzyme solution (8 mg/ml) was placed in a 50-μl dialysis button and dialyzed at 293 K against 1.45 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5. Single crystals with the approximate dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm grew in about 2 weeks, and then the dialysis buttons were transferred to a new reservoir solution supplemented with 40% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant and kept at 293 K for 5 h. The complex of TS with 10 was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The drop was composed of 5 μl of protein solution (8 mg/ml apoenzyme in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.2), 5 μl of reservoir solution (10% (v/v) PEG3350 in 0.1 m Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4, pH 6.2), and 1 μl of 10 mm 10. Single crystals with the approximate dimensions of 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm were obtained by equilibration of the mixture solution against the reservoir solution at 293 K for about 1 week. The crystal was soaked for 10 s in a new reservoir solution supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The crystals were mounted on thin nylon loops (ø, 0.2–0.3 mm) and frozen by flash-cooling to 100 K in a cold N2 gas stream. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K by synchrotron X-radiation (λ = 0.9 Å) using a DIP6040 detector (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI) in the station BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The diffraction data collected for these crystals were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (14Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

After being subjected to the rigid-body refinement, the initial structures of the apoenzyme and the complex with 10 were further refined through simulated annealing from 3000 K and several cycles of B-factor and positional refinements. The model of 10 was built using MOE Version 2007.09 (Chemical Computing Group), and then the topology and parameter files for refinement in CNS were generated with XPLO2D in the X-UTIL package (18Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Water molecules, phosphate ion derived from the reservoir solution, and residues in the active-site region were examined using 2Fo − Fc, Fo − Fc, and omit maps. These models were refined through several additional cycles of the B-factor and positional refinements after introducing solvent molecules. The details and statistics of the crystallographic refinement are also summarized in Table 4.

Open table in a new tab TS catalyzes the formation of l-threonine from OPHS as a physiological reaction (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 1 in Scheme 1). In addition, TS catalyzes the formation of α-ketobutyrate from OPHS as a side reaction (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 1). The kcat and kcat/Km values for the l-threonine formation were about 120- and 190-fold higher, respectively, than those for the α-ketobutyrate formation, yielding a high reaction specificity of 99% in both the kcat and kcat/Km terms (Table 1). That the ratio of the kcat values for the l-threonine and the α-ketobutyrate formation is similar to the corresponding ratio of the kcat/Km values is considered to reflect the fact that l-threonine and α-ketobutyrate are derived from the same intermediate bound to the enzyme, i.e. the PLP-α-aminocrotonate aldimine (6Garrido-Franco M. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Marinkovic' S. Huber R. Laber B. Bourenkov G.P. Clausen T. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab A chemical consideration predicts that besides the physiological substrate OPHS, TS may also catalyze the formation of l-threonine from l-vinylglycine via 9 → 6 → 7 → 8. In this context, the reaction of TS using l-vinylglycine was followed. However, no formation of l-threonine was observed, whereas the side reaction product α-ketobutyrate was formed with a kcat similar to that when OPHS was used as the substrate (Table 1). This indicates that the formation of 6 alone is not enough for producing l-threonine. During the reaction of TS with OPHS, a phosphate ion is released (4 → 5) before the formation of 6 (Scheme 1). To investigate whether the released phosphate ion is involved in the catalysis, the reaction starting from l-vinylglycine was studied in the presence of phosphate and its analog sulfate, which has a similar shape and size as phosphate but has a much lower pKa value (1.92 at 298 K). In the presence of 50 mm phosphate, l-threonine was preferentially formed (Table 1). In both the kcat and kcat/Km terms, the reaction specificity was 98%. This is the same pattern as that observed when OPHS was used as the substrate and again reflects the mechanism that l-threonine and α-ketobutyrate are derived from the same intermediate (6) bound to the enzyme. The kcat values for the l-threonine and α-ketobutyrate formation were similar to those when OPHS was used as the substrate (Table 1). On the other hand, the kcat/Km values for the l-threonine and α-ketobutyrate formation were several hundred-fold lower than the corresponding values using OPHS as the substrate (Table 1). This indicates that l-vinylglycine is far more weakly bound to TS than OPHS. According to the previous crystallographic study of TS complexed with AP5 (8Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol.

The low kcat/Km values for l-vinylglycine (in the presence of phosphate as well as in the presence of sulfate or in the absence of both phosphate and sulfate; see Table 1) as compared with the corresponding values for OPHS indicate the importance of the phosphate group of OPHS for binding to TS. In contrast to the reaction of l-vinylglycine with TS in the presence of phosphate, the reaction in the presence of sulfate showed a pattern essentially similar to the reaction in the absence of both phosphate and sulfate, i.e. only α-ketobutyrate was formed without the formation of l-threonine (Table 1). The above results indicate that 6 derived from l-vinylglycine is preferentially converted to l-threonine in the presence of phosphate as efficiently as the corresponding reaction for the normal catalysis starting from OPHS, and sulfate cannot substitute for phosphate. To investigate in detail the effect of phosphate ion on the catalytic steps after 6, we analyzed the “reverse” reaction 1 → 8 → 7 → 6 → 1 starting from l-threonine in the presence of phosphate or sulfate. The addition of l-threonine up to 50 mm to TS caused no spectral changes (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The CD spectrum also showed no detectable changes upon the addition of l-threonine to TS (data not shown). That change in CD is a sensitive indicator of the formation of the external aldimine (19Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) strongly suggests l-threonine alone cannot form the external aldimine with PLP (8Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H.

On the other hand, the addition of phosphate or sulfate to TS slightly increased the 416-nm peak and concomitantly decreased the absorption at around 340 nm (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). This indicates that the phosphate or sulfate ion binds to the active site of TS, causing the PLP-Lys-61 aldimine to undergo a tautomeric shift from enolimine to ketoenamine. From the absorption change at 416 nm, the Kd for phosphate and sulfate ions were estimated to be 2.2 and 4.9 mm, respectively. In the presence of both l-threonine and either of phosphate or sulfate, distinct spectral changes in the TS (supplemental Fig. S1) and α-ketobutyrate formation (Table 2) were observed. However, neither OPHS nor O-sulfohomoserine was detected in the reaction mixture (data not shown). This is interpreted to reflect the fact that the step of phosphate elimination (4 → 5) is essentially irreversible, and neither phosphate nor sulfate can undergo addition to the Cγ of 5 due to their low Lewis basicities. The kinetic parameters for the α-ketobutyrate formation are summarized in Table 2. The Kd values for phosphate and sulfate kinetically obtained were essentially consistent with the values obtained by the spectroscopic measurements described above. The similarity between the Kd values for phosphate and sulfate suggests the similarity of the recognition of the two anions by TS. On the other hand, the kcat and kcat/Km values in the presence of sulfate were about 7- and 2.4-fold higher, respectively, than those in the presence of phosphate.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for the α-ketobutyrate formation reaction from l-threonineCoexistent anionKd for phosphate/sulfatekcatkcat/Kmmms−1m−1s−1Phosphate1.7 ± 0.20.034 ± 0.0021.3 ± 0.2Sulfate2.6 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.043.1 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab To investigate the reaction steps from l-threonine to α-aminobutyrate in detail, transient kinetic analyses were carried out. A solution containing TS and 50 mm phosphate was reacted with l-threonine (Fig. 1A). The absorption at around 330 nm decreased, and that around 410 nm increased within the dead time (2.3 ms), indicating a rapid association of TS and l-threonine. Subsequently, two sharp peaks emerged at 474 and 446 nm, and a broad absorption band at around 330 nm increased. The sharp peaks at 474 and 446 nm are clearly ascribed to the quinonoid intermediate. The absorbance at 331, 416, and 474 nm was plotted versus the elapsed time after mixing (Fig. 2A). At any wavelengths, the absorbance changes followed a double exponential process, with a kapp of ∼340 and ∼40 s−1 at 250 mm l-threonine. These results indicated that the spectral changes in the reaction of TS with l-threonine in the presence of phosphate can be analyzed by a model that includes two steps after the rapid association of the enzyme (A) and the substrate (B): A+B⇄KdAB⇄k−1k+1C⇄k−2k+2D(Eq. 1) As the rate of α-ketobutyrate formation (kcat = 0.034 s−1; Table 2) is much slower than the kapp values of the spectral changes, the regeneration of A from D was not incorporated in this model (Equation 1).FIGURE 2Time course of the absorbance changes in TS upon reaction with 250 mm l-threonine in the presence of phosphate (A) and sulfate (B).

In contrast to the reaction in the presence of phosphate, no significant accumulation of the quinonoid intermediate was observed. The absorption at 416 nm first increased followed by a slow red shift in λmax and an appearance of a shoulder at around 480 nm. The time course of the absorption changes followed a double exponential process (Fig. 2B) with kapp values of ∼30 and ∼0.85 s−1. The kapp values for the slower spectral changes were of the same order as that of the α-ketobutyrate formation (kcat = 0.23 s−1; Table 2). In this regard, the accumulation of the spectra of the intermediates was apparently lower than that in the presence of phosphate (Fig. 1, A and"
