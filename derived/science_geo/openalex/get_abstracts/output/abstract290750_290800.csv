https://openalex.org/W2079413335,"Fossil burrows within newly recognized buried soils in the Late Ordovician Juniata Formation, near Potters Mills in central Pennsylvania, represent the oldest reported nonmarine trace fossils. They are thought to have been an original part of the soil because their greater density toward the top of the paleosols corresponds with mineralogical, microstructural, and chemical changes attributed to ancient weathering and because about half the burrows are encrusted with nodular carbonate, interpreted as caliche. Associated fossil caliche, the size distribution of the burrows, and their W-shaped backfills are evidence that the burrows may have been excavated by bilaterally symmetrical organisms that grew in well-defined growth increments and were able to withstand desiccation. Among well-known soil organisms, millipedes are burrowing animals that satisfy these requirements, but have a fossil record not quite this old. This trace fossil evidence for animals on land, together with recent palynological evidence for land plants of a bryophytic grade of evolution during Late Ordovician time, are indications of terrestrial ecosystems of slightly greater antiquity and complexity than hitherto suspected."

The spectroscopic, optical, and laser requirements for atmospheric laser remote sensing are reviewed, and the sensitivity and limitations of the technique are described. A sampling of recent measurements includes the detection of urban air pollution and toxic chemicals in the atmosphere, the measurement of global circulation of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere, and the observation of wind shear near airports."

https://openalex.org/W2040445937,"If the volatility of stock market prices is to be understood in terms of the efficient markets hypothesis, then there should be evidence that true investment value changes through time sufficiently to justify the price changes. Three indicators of change in true investment value of the aggregate stock market in the United States from 1871 to 1986 are considered: changes in dividends, in real interest rates, and in a direct measure of intertemporal marginal rates of substitution. Although there are some ambiguities in interpreting the evidence, dividend changes appear to contribute very little toward justifying the observed historical volatility of stock prices. The other indicators contribute some, but still most of the volatility of stock market prices appears unexplained."

https://openalex.org/W2064556593,"The guest star of A.D. 185 is possibly the earliest recorded supernova, and the radio source RCW 86 is believed to be its remnant. However, a restudy of ancient Chinese literature suggests that RCW 86 is unrelated to the guest star, which probably had a visible duration of only 7 months and appeared between β and ε Centauri, instead of the previously proposed 20-month duration and a location between α and β Centauri."

https://openalex.org/W2080437952,"The author summarizes results of a breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. (LLNL) over two years ago, but only recently reported because of security classification. Essentially, a special magnet called a tapered undulator was used to effect the conversion of 40% of the energy of the electron beam of an LLNL accelerator into microwave laser radiation (NOTE: tapering is maintaining the necessary resonance condition by progressively decreasing the dipole period or the magnetic flux along the undulator). This establishes the free-electron laser (FEL) as a leading candidate for the directed-energy alternatives in the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program. The Army's Strategic Defense Command, which is managing the SDI FEL program, is interested in near-infrared wavelengths near 1 ..mu..m and intends to build a facility for such research at its White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The author describes the basics of the LLNL experiment and some of the closely related work of Los Alamos Scientific Lab. and a Boeing Aerospace - Spectra Technology collaboration, emphasizing the problems in going to the visible or near-infrared wavelengths. The near-term future activities of each of these organizations are described briefly. 2 references."
