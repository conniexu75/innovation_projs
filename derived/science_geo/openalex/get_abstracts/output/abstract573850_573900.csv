https://openalex.org/W2552491981,"Light-induced oxidation of water by photosystem II (PS II) in plants, algae and cyanobacteria has generated most of the dioxygen in the atmosphere. PS II, a membrane-bound multi-subunit pigment protein complex, couples the one-electron photochemistry at the reaction centre with the four-electron redox chemistry of water oxidation at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Under illumination, the OEC cycles through five intermediate S-states (S0 to S4), in which S1 is the dark-stable state and S3 is the last semi-stable state before O-O bond formation and O2 evolution. A detailed understanding of the O-O bond formation mechanism remains a challenge, and will require elucidation of both the structures of the OEC in the different S-states and the binding of the two substrate waters to the catalytic site. Here we report the use of femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to obtain damage-free, room temperature structures of dark-adapted (S1), two-flash illuminated (2F; S3-enriched), and ammonia-bound two-flash illuminated (2F-NH3; S3-enriched) PS II. Although the recent 1.95 Å resolution structure of PS II at cryogenic temperature using an XFEL provided a damage-free view of the S1 state, measurements at room temperature are required to study the structural landscape of proteins under functional conditions, and also for in situ advancement of the S-states. To investigate the water-binding site(s), ammonia, a water analogue, has been used as a marker, as it binds to the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S2 and S3 states. Since the ammonia-bound OEC is active, the ammonia-binding Mn site is not a substrate water site. This approach, together with a comparison of the native dark and 2F states, is used to discriminate between proposed O-O bond formation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2553548740,"There is an abrupt transition from alkaline to acid soil pH when mean annual precipitation exceeds mean annual potential evapotranspiration, demonstrating that climate creates a nonlinear pattern in soil solution chemistry at the global scale. Soil pH affects nutrient supply and storage in soils and, in consequence, can influence plant productivity. Transitions from alkaline to acid soils are caused by variations in the water balance across natural climate gradients, but a global-scale investigation of the influence of climate on soil pH is lacking. Here Eric Slessarev et al. evaluate the global relationship between water balance and soil pH, and find that there is an abrupt transition from alkaline to acid soil pH that occurs where mean annual precipitation begins to exceed mean annual potential evapotranspiration. The authors suggest that deviations from the observed global pattern may result from seasonality, climate history, erosion and mineralogy. Soil pH regulates the capacity of soils to store and supply nutrients, and thus contributes substantially to controlling productivity in terrestrial ecosystems1. However, soil pH is not an independent regulator of soil fertility—rather, it is ultimately controlled by environmental forcing. In particular, small changes in water balance cause a steep transition from alkaline to acid soils across natural climate gradients2,3. Although the processes governing this threshold in soil pH are well understood, the threshold has not been quantified at the global scale, where the influence of climate may be confounded by the effects of topography and mineralogy. Here we evaluate the global relationship between water balance and soil pH by extracting a spatially random sample (n = 20,000) from an extensive compilation of 60,291 soil pH measurements. We show that there is an abrupt transition from alkaline to acid soil pH that occurs at the point where mean annual precipitation begins to exceed mean annual potential evapotranspiration. We evaluate deviations from this global pattern, showing that they may result from seasonality, climate history, erosion and mineralogy. These results demonstrate that climate creates a nonlinear pattern in soil solution chemistry at the global scale; they also reveal conditions under which soils maintain pH out of equilibrium with modern climate."
https://openalex.org/W2549615523,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in cellular processes, including the development, proliferation, and migration of cancer cells. We have demonstrated in a prior study that small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) is dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). To further explore the underlying mechanisms of SNGH5 function in the development of GC, in this study, we screened the microRNAs interacting with SNHG5 and elucidated their roles in GC. We showed that SNHG5 contains a putative miR-32-binding site and that deletion of this site abolishes the responsiveness to miR-32. Suppression of SNHG5 expression by miR-32 was found to be Argonaute (Ago)2-dependent. Immunoprecipitation showed that SNHG5 could be pulled down from the Ago-2 complex with miR-32. Furthermore, it was reported that Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a target gene of miR-32. In agreement with SNHG5 being a decoy for miR-32, we showed that KLF4 suppression by miR-32 could be partially rescued by SNHG5 overexpression, whereas miR-32 mimic rescued SNHG5 overexpression-mediated suppression of GC cell migration. In addition, we identified a negative correlation between the expression of SNHG5 and miR-32 in GC tissues. Furthermore, KLF4 expression was significantly downregulated in GC specimens, and a negative correlation between miR-32 and KLF4 expression and a positive correlation between KLF4 and SNHG5 expression levels were detected. Overall, this study demonstrated, for the first time, that the SNHG5/miR-32/KLF4 axis functions as an important player in GC cell migration and potentially contributes to the improvement of GC diagnosis and therapy.—Zhao, L., Han, T., Li, Y., Sun, J., Zhang, S., Liu, Y., Shan, B., Zheng D., Shi, J.

https://openalex.org/W2554408808,"A recently identified polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) from Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 is transcriptionally up-regulated during growth on galacto- and glucomannans. It encodes two glycoside hydrolase family 26 (GH26) β-mannanases, BoMan26A and BoMan26B, and a GH36 α-galactosidase, BoGal36A. The PUL also includes two glycan-binding proteins, confirmed by β-mannan affinity electrophoresis. When this PUL was deleted, B. ovatus was no longer able to grow on locust bean galactomannan. BoMan26A primarily formed mannobiose from mannan polysaccharides. BoMan26B had higher activity on galactomannan with a high degree of galactosyl substitution and was shown to be endo-acting generating a more diverse mixture of oligosaccharides, including mannobiose. Of the two β-mannanases, only BoMan26B hydrolyzed galactoglucomannan. A crystal structure of BoMan26A revealed a similar structure to the exo-mannobiohydrolase CjMan26C from Cellvibrio japonicus, with a conserved glycone region (−1 and −2 subsites), including a conserved loop closing the active site beyond subsite −2. Analysis of cellular location by immunolabeling and fluorescence microscopy suggests that BoMan26B is surface-exposed and associated with the outer membrane, although BoMan26A and BoGal36A are likely periplasmic. In light of the cellular location and the biochemical properties of the two characterized β-mannanases, we propose a scheme of sequential action by the glycoside hydrolases encoded by the β-mannan PUL and involved in the β-mannan utilization pathway in B. ovatus. The outer membrane-associated BoMan26B initially acts on the polysaccharide galactomannan, producing comparably large oligosaccharide fragments. Galactomanno-oligosaccharides are further processed in the periplasm, degalactosylated by BoGal36A, and subsequently hydrolyzed into mainly mannobiose by the β-mannanase BoMan26A."
https://openalex.org/W2555773426,"Abstract Organisms use endogenous clocks to anticipate regular environmental cycles, such as days and tides. Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus , a marine midge whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 (CaMKII.1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII activity in Drosophila melanogaster , and C. marinus ( Cma )-CaMKII.1 increases the transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma- CLOCK and Cma- CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for natural adaptation in circadian timing."
https://openalex.org/W2553234773,"Glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) is frequently overexpressed in cancerous tumors and is a putative target of the plant compound piperlongumine (PL), which contains two reactive olefins and inhibits proliferation in cancer cells but not normal cells. PL exposure of cancer cells results in increased reactive oxygen species and decreased GSH. These data in tandem with other information led to the conclusion that PL inhibits GSTP1, which forms covalent bonds between GSH and various electrophilic compounds, through covalent adduct formation at the C7-C8 olefin of PL, whereas the C2-C3 olefin of PL was postulated to react with GSH. However, direct evidence for this mechanism has been lacking. To investigate, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of GSTP1 bound to PL and GSH at 1.1 A resolution to rationalize previously reported structure activity relationship studies. Surprisingly, the structure showed that a hydrolysis product of PL (hPL) was conjugated to glutathione at the C7-C8 olefin, and this complex was bound to the active site of GSTP1; no covalent bond formation between hPL and GSTP1 was observed. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the reactions between PL and GSTP1 confirmed that PL does not label GSTP1. Moreover, MS data also indicated that nucleophilic attack on PL at the C2-C3 olefin led to PL hydrolysis. Although hPL inhibits GSTP1 enzymatic activity in vitro, treatment of cells susceptible to PL with hPL did not have significant anti-proliferative effects, suggesting that hPL is not membrane-permeable. Altogether, our data suggest a model wherein PL is a prodrug whose intracellular hydrolysis initiates the formation of the hPL-GSH conjugate, which blocks the active site of and inhibits GSTP1 and thereby cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2554575616,"Potent and selective chemical probes are valuable tools for discovery of novel treatments for human diseases. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is a key trigger in the development of liver injury and fibrosis. Whether inhibition of NIK activity by chemical probes ameliorates liver inflammation and injury is largely unknown. In this study, a small-molecule inhibitor of NIK, B022, was found to be a potent and selective chemical probe for liver inflammation and injury. B022 inhibited the NIK signaling pathway, including NIK-induced p100-to-p52 processing and inflammatory gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, in vivo administration of B022 protected against not only NIK but also CCl4-induced liver inflammation and injury. Our data suggest that inhibition of NIK is a novel strategy for treatment of liver inflammation, oxidative stress, and injury.-Ren, X., Li, X., Jia, L., Chen, D., Hou, H., Rui, L., Zhao, Y., Chen, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2550209063,"The onslaught on the World's wildlife continues despite numerous initiatives aimed at curbing it. We build a model that integrates rhino horn trade with rhino population dynamics in order to evaluate the impact of various management policies on rhino sustainability. In our model, an agent-based sub-model of horn trade from the poaching event up through a purchase of rhino horn in Asia impacts rhino abundance. A data-validated, individual-based sub-model of the rhino population of South Africa provides these abundance values. We evaluate policies that consist of different combinations of legal trade initiatives, demand reduction marketing campaigns, increased anti-poaching measures within protected areas, and transnational policing initiatives aimed at disrupting those criminal syndicates engaged in horn trafficking. Simulation runs of our model over the next 35 years produces a sustainable rhino population under only one management policy. This policy includes both a transnational policing effort aimed at dismantling those criminal networks engaged in rhino horn trafficking-coupled with increases in legal economic opportunities for people living next to protected areas where rhinos live. This multi-faceted approach should be the focus of the international debate on strategies to combat the current slaughter of rhino rather than the binary debate about whether rhino horn trade should be legalized. This approach to the evaluation of wildlife management policies may be useful to apply to other species threatened by wildlife trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2550837626,"Few studies have examined the associations between sleep duration, shiftwork, and exercise to the infrequent menstruation, hyperandrogenism, and ovarian morphological changes observed in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).To examine whether lifestyle factors, including short sleep duration, insufficient exercise, and shiftwork, alone or in combination, are associated with the reproductive and metabolic abnormalities typical of PCOS in a healthy population.Prospective cross-sectional study of 231 women, including healthcare workers recruited for an annual health screen, healthy referral patients from the Women's Clinic and volunteers from the university community at the National University Hospital, Singapore, from 2011 to 2015.The women completed a questionnaire, including their menstrual cycle length, sleep length, frequency of exercise and shift work. Hyperandrogenism (hirsutism score, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), ovarian morphology and function (anthral follicle count, ovarian volume, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)), and metabolic measures (body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and fasting lipids) were examined through anthropometric measurements, transvaginal ultrasound scans, and blood tests.No significant associations were observed between shift work, exercise or sleep duration and the androgenic and ovarian measures that define PCOS. However, women reporting fewer than 6 hours of sleep were more likely to report abnormal (short or long) menstrual cycle lengths (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.2). Women who reported fewer than 6 hours of sleep had increased fasting insulin levels (difference in means = 2.13; 95% CI, 0.27 to 3.99 mU/L) and higher odds of insulin resistance (OR = 2.58; CI, 1.16 to 5.76). Lack of regular exercise was associated with higher mean fasting insulin (difference in means = 2.3 mU/L; 95% CI, 0.5 to 4.1) and HOMA-IR (difference in means = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.90) levels.Women with insufficient sleep are at increased risk of menstrual disturbances and insulin resistance, but do not have the hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology typical of PCOS.Improved sleep duration may help reduce the risks of diabetes or infertility. Shift work, exercise or sleep duration appear not to impact the androgenic and ovarian measures that define PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2553280147,"Secretory diarrheas caused by bacterial enterotoxins, including cholera and traveler's diarrhea, remain a major global health problem. Inappropriate activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel occurs in these diarrheas. We previously reported that the benzopyrimido-pyrrolooxazinedione (R)-BPO-27 inhibits CFTR chloride conductance with low-nanomolar potency. Here, we demonstrate using experimental mouse models and human enterocyte cultures the potential utility of (R)-BPO-27 for treatment of secretory diarrheas caused by cholera and Escherichia coli enterotoxins. (R)-BPO-27 fully blocked CFTR chloride conductance in epithelial cell cultures and intestine after cAMP agonists, cholera toxin, or heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli (STa toxin), with IC50 down to ~5 nM. (R)-BPO-27 prevented cholera toxin and STa toxin-induced fluid accumulation in small intestinal loops, with IC50 down to 0.1 μg/kg. (R)-BPO-27 did not impair intestinal fluid absorption or inhibit other major intestinal transporters. Pharmacokinetics in mice showed >90% oral bioavailability with sustained therapeutic serum levels for >4 h without the significant toxicity seen with 7-d administration at 5 μg/kg/d. As evidence to support efficacy in human diarrheas, (R)-BPO-27 blocked fluid secretion in primary cultures of enteroids from human small intestine and anion current in enteroid monolayers. These studies support the potential utility of (R)-BPO-27 for therapy of CFTR-mediated secretory diarrheas.—Cil, O., Phuan, P.-W., Gillespie, A.M., Lee, S., Tradtrantip, L., Yin, J., Tse, M., Zachos, N.C., Lin, R., Donowitz, M., Verkman, A.S.

To understand the genetic basis of LLS and assist breeding in the future, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for LLS and three plant-type-related traits including height of main stem (HMS), length of the longest branch (LLB) and total number of branches (TNB). Significant negative correlations were observed between LLS and the plant-type-related traits in multi-environments of a RIL population from the cross Zhonghua 5 and ICGV 86699. A total of 20 QTLs were identified for LLS, of which two QTLs were identified in multi-environments and six QTLs with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) more than 10%. Ten, seven, fifteen QTLs were identified for HMS, LLB and TNB, respectively. Of these, one, one, two consensus QTLs and three, two, three major QTLs were detected for HMS, LLB and TNB, respectively. Of all 52 unconditional QTLs for LLS and plant-type-related traits, 10 QTLs were clustered in five genetic regions, of which three clusters including five robust major QTLs overlapped between LLS and one of the plant-type-related traits, providing evidence that the correlation could be genetically constrained. On the other hand, conditional mapping revealed different numbers and different extent of additive effects of QTLs for LLS conditioned on three plant-type-related traits (HMS, LLB and TNB), which improved our understanding of interrelationship between LLS and plant-type-related traits at the QTL level. Furthermore, two QTLs, qLLSB6-7 and qLLSB1 for LLS resistance, were identified residing in two clusters of NB-LRR-encoding genes. This study not only provided new favorable QTLs for fine-mapping, but also suggested that the relationship between LLS and plant-type-related traits of HMS, LLB and TNB should be considered while breeding for improved LLS resistance in peanut."
https://openalex.org/W2555523852,"Studies in the 1980s first showed that some natural antibodies were and able to hydrolyze peptide or phosphodiester bonds in antigens. Many naturally occurring catalytic antibodies have since been isolated from human sera and associated with positive and negative outcomes in autoimmune disease and infection. The function and prevalence of these antibodies, however, remain unclear. A previous study suggested that the 18B7 monoclonal antibody against glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major component of the Cryptococcus neoformans polysaccharide capsule, hydrolyzed a peptide antigen mimetic. Using mass spectrometry and Forster resonance energy transfer techniques, we confirm and characterize the hydrolytic activity of 18B7 against peptide mimetics and show that 18B7 is able to hydrolyze an oligosaccharide substrate, providing the first example of a naturally occurring catalytic antibody for polysaccharides. Additionally, we show that the catalytic 18B7 antibody increases release of capsular polysaccharide from fungal cells. A serine protease inhibitor blocked peptide and oligosaccharide hydrolysis by 18B7, and a putative serine protease-like active site was identified in the light chain variable region of the antibody. An algorithm was developed to detect similar sites present in unique antibody structures in the Protein Data Bank. The putative site was found in 14 of 63 (22.2%) catalytic antibody structures and 119 of 1602 (7.4%) antibodies with no annotation of catalytic activity. The ability of many antibodies to cleave antigen, albeit slowly, supports the notion that this activity is an important immunoglobulin function in host defense. The discovery of GXM hydrolytic activity suggests new therapeutic possibilities for polysaccharide-binding antibodies."

Overexpression of PTP1B inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 and Akt phosphorylation in bovine aortic endothelial cells, while PTP1B siRNA increased both, implicating negative regulation of VEGFR2 by PTP1B. Calpain inhibitor ALLN induced VEGFR2 activation, which can be completely blocked by PTP1B overexpression. Calpain activation induced by overexpression or Ca/A23187 resulted in PTP1B cleavage, which can be blocked by ALLN. Moreover, calpain activation inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation, which can be restored by PTP1B siRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2555438545,"Biological oscillations with an ultradian time scale of 1 to several hours include cycles in behavioral arousal, episodic glucocorticoid release, and gene expression. Ultradian rhythms are thought to have an extrinsic origin because of a perceived absence of ultradian rhythmicity in vitro and a lack of known molecular ultradian oscillators. We designed a novel, non-spectral-analysis method of separating ultradian from circadian components and applied it to a published gene expression dataset with an ultradian sampling resolution. Ultradian rhythms in mouse hepatocytes in vivo have been published, and we validated our approach using this control by confirming 175 of 323 ultradian genes identified in a prior study and found 862 additional ultradian genes. For the first time, we now report ultradian expression of >900 genes in vitro. Sixty genes exhibited ultradian transcriptional rhythmicity, both in vivo and in vitro, including 5 genes involved in the cell cycle. Within these 60 genes, we identified significant enrichment of specific DNA motifs in the 1000 bp proximal promotor, some of which associate with known transcriptional factors.

The objective of this study was to determine the role of calpains in mediating BBB dysfunction and hyperpermeability and to test the effect of calpain inhibition on the BBB following traumatic insults to the brain. In these studies, rat brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers exposed to calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor III and calpastatin) or transfected with calpain-1 siRNA demonstrated attenuation of IL-1β-induced monolayer hyperpermeability. Calpain inhibition led to protection against IL-1β-induced loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the tight junctions and alterations in F-actin cytoskeletal assembly.

The EGFR family: not so prototypical receptor tyrosine kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6a020768 Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Several structural biology studies on the ErbB family have been published, and this has helped advance drug development for HER2-positive breast cancer (2Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

Since that time, growing structural biology-based understanding of how EGFR, HER2, and HER3 function at the atomic level has dramatically reshaped our understanding of RTKs (1Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

Despite these advances, there is a domain in each EGFR/ErbB family protein for which little structural biology information is available; this domain is the C-terminal tail (CTT) domain. The CTTs contain numerous autophosphorylation sites that are essential for recruiting downstream signaling proteins and initiating intracellular signaling (5Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V.

The CTT can also contribute to autoinhibition of the kinase domain of RTK (7Gajiwala K.S. EGFR: tale of the C-terminal tail.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lack of available crystallographic information on the CTT region of EGFR/ErbB family RTKs led us to examine whether these proteins lack a stable secondary and/or tertiary structure. epidermal growth factor receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor receptor tyrosine kinase C-terminal tail kinase domain intrinsically disordered region hydrogen/deuterium exchange Src homology 2 size exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering small angle X-ray scattering analytical ultracentrifugation predictor of natural disordered regions dynamic light scattering intracellular half regular β-strand distorted β-strand hydrodynamic radius radius of gyration maximum interatomic distance quench flow manual labeling isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside flow-through regular α-helix distorted α-helix.

Algorithm prediction methods indicate that around 25–30% of eukaryotic proteins can be categorized as having disordered regions (16Oldfield C.J. Cheng Y. Cortese M.S. Brown C.J. Uversky V.N.

Flexible nets: disorder and induced fit in the associations of p53 and 14-3-3 with their partners.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: S1Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Correlation studies have revealed a high propensity for disordered regions to undergo post-translational modification, particularly phosphorylation (22Xie H. Vucetic S. Iakoucheva L.M. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Uversky V.N. Functional anthology of intrinsic disorder. 3. Ligands, post-translational modifications, and diseases associated with intrinsically disordered proteins.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1917-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because traditional methods, such as NMR and X-ray crystallography, were developed to study stable protein structures, IDRs have been more difficult to analyze because of difficulties in obtaining high concentrations or representative protein crystals (11Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Understanding protein non-folding.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1231-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 23Redfield C. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study molten globule states of proteins.Methods. 2004; 34: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Correlation studies suggest a strong association between IDRs and human cancer-associated proteins (24Iakoucheva L.M. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Obradović Z. Dunker A.K. Intrinsic disorder in cell-signaling and cancer-associated proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar); therefore, identifying and analyzing IDRs in cancer-related proteins is vital in understanding how they function. Protein kinases demonstrate a high degree of specificity in facilitating phosphorylation; however, many are able to perform such interactions with multiple substrate partners (25Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). An analysis of the human kinome shows that as many as 83% of kinase genes contain IDRs, which could facilitate these multiple interactions. RTKs are involved in more protein-protein interactions than any other kinase group, thus potentially pointing to the involvement of IDRs in their recognition mechanisms (26Kathiriya J.J. Pathak R.R. Clayman E. Xue B. Uversky V.N. Davé V. Presence and utility of intrinsically disordered regions in kinases.Mol. Biosyst. 2014; 10: 2876-2888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multisequence alignment (27Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22512) Google Scholar) of EGFR/ErbB family RTKs shows that the kinase domain sequences are highly conserved between all four family members. However, the CTT regions are highly divergent between each EGFR/ErbB family member. One previous study using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated that the EGFR CTT is rich in α-helical and β-sheet content (6Lee N.Y. Hazlett T.L. Koland J.G. Structure and dynamics of the epidermal growth factor receptor C-terminal phosphorylation domain.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1142-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but a later study used coarse grained modeling to show many possible conformations of the EGFR CTT based on the assumption that it is naturally disordered (28Koland J.G. Coarse-grained molecular simulation of epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase multi-site self-phosphorylation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10e1003435 Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A high degree of flexibility in the CTT would provide distinct advantages to EGFR interaction with downstream Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding domains during signaling functions (6Lee N.Y. Hazlett T.L. Koland J.G. Structure and dynamics of the epidermal growth factor receptor C-terminal phosphorylation domain.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1142-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this work, we examine the biophysical properties of the CTT of EGFR and HER3. The motivation of this study is to gather structural information on the CTT region to determine whether the tails are highly dynamic, disordered regions. First, we measured the conformational dynamics of intracellular half (ICH) constructs of EGFR/ErbB family members using amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). This information is used to compare the CTTs with the kinase domains. We also expressed and purified EGFR and HER3 CTT-only constructs and demonstrated that they are functional because they are recognized and phosphorylated by EGFR family kinases and once phosphorylated can be bound by the Grb2 SH2 domain. Using these CTT constructs, we performed multiple biophysical analyses, including CD spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results of these methods support the hypothesis that the EGFR and HER3 CTTs are IDRs with extended, non-globular structure in solution. We used computation algorithms to provide an initial survey of disordered regions in the EGFR/ErbB family of RTKs. Predictor of natural disordered regions (PONDR) is a collection of algorithms that use an amino acid sequence to predict native disorder (29Romero P. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Sequence data analysis for long disordered regions prediction in the calcineurin family.Genome Inform. 1997; 8: 110-124PubMed Google Scholar, 30Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Sequence complexity of disordered protein.Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The VL-XT algorithm assigns a disorder propensity score for disorder on a residue by residue basis (29Romero P. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Sequence data analysis for long disordered regions prediction in the calcineurin family.Genome Inform. 1997; 8: 110-124PubMed Google Scholar, 30Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J.

Predicting protein disorder for N-, C-, and internal regions.Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar). The VL-XT prediction for EGFR, HER2, and HER3 can be seen in Fig. 1. PONDR scores greater than 0.5 indicate predicted disorder, and scores less than 0.5 indicate predicted order. Kinase domains of the three EGFR/ErbB family members show mostly predicted order, whereas the CTT in each shows large regions of predicted disorder. The amino acid composition of the CTT and kinase domains of both EGFR and HER3 is shown in Table 1. When comparing the CTTs with the kinase domains in both proteins, we observe that the CTTs are more enriched in polar, uncharged residues and prolines but relatively depleted in hydrophobic residues. For EGFR, polar, uncharged residues make up 30.1% of the CTT versus 14.9% of the kinase domain. Prolines make up 10.6% of the EGFR CTT versus 5.4% in the kinase domain, and hydrophobic residues (excluding tyrosine, which can become phosphorylated) are 27.4% of the EGFR CTT versus 38.9% of the kinase domain (Table 1). Similar values are seen with HER3 CTT (Table 1) despite its primary sequence divergence from EGFR CTT (22% sequence identity between EGFR and HER3 CTT; calculated with Clustal Omega) (74Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (9093) Google Scholar). The lowered hydrophobicity provides a simple explanation as to why the tails would not form a hydrophobic core and therefore be disordered in an aqueous environment. These predictions are a useful tool for gaining a general view of disordered regions in a protein sequence, but direct empirical evidence would better support the hypothesis of the CTTs as being IDRs.TABLE 1EGFR and HER3 amino acid composition analysis by regionAA residuePercentage of total sequenceC-terminal tailsKinase domainEGFRHER3EGFRHER3%Polar uncharged Ser11.912.44.75.1 Thr5.85.24.43.5 Asn6.22.82.22.2 Gln6.23.03.54.4 Subtotal30.123.514.915.2Negative charge Asp8.45.04.44.4 Glu5.310.57.96.6 Subtotal13.715.512.311.1Positive charge Arg3.56.97.07.0 His2.73.62.53.2 Lys2.71.77.66.3 Subtotal8.812.217.116.5Hydrophobic (excluding Tyr) Ala6.65.85.76.3 Val4.93.97.37.9 Ile3.50.67.95.7 Leu6.29.711.112.0 Met1.33.02.83.2 Phe4.40.82.22.5 Trp0.40.31.92.2 Subtotal27.424.038.939.9Tyrosine Tyr4.03.63.53.5Special Cys1.31.71.91.3 Gly4.09.46.07.3 Pro10.610.25.45.4 Open table in a new tab HDX-MS is a highly useful technique to identify and study IDRs (32Keppel T.R.

HDX-MS provides local information about different regions of the protein and readily distinguishes folded, globular regions from IDRs. We performed HDX-MS experiments by exposing the protein to deuterium oxide (D2O) over two ranges of time points, 108–2333 ms using quench flow and 5 s–2 h using manual labeling. HDX was quenched by lowering pH and rapidly cooling. This was followed by digesting the protein with immobilized pepsin and measuring the mass increase that results from incorporation of deuterons into peptic peptides by MS. In this study, we present HDX data as %nex, a percentage of the maximum observable mass increase. %nex is based on the number of amide hydrogens available for exchange and the H2O:D2O ratio during the labeling step. We show that hydrogen/deuterium exchange occurs more rapidly in peptides from the CTT than those from the kinase domain (Fig. 2). Many peptides from the kinase domains (shown in blue) do not reach a maximum exchange plateau even within 2 h of exchange. However, peptides from the CTTs (shown in red) exchanged much more rapidly, often reaching a plateau before 5 s of exchange. This behavior was observed for all three ErbB ICH constructs analyzed. This indicates that the CTT region has faster hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics than the kinase domain with amide hydrogen protection from exchange being much weaker in the tail. Comparisons between HDX data and the domain and secondary structure of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 are shown in Fig. 3. The heat map was constructed by measuring deuterium uptake in individual peptides and then on a residue by residue basis across the entire sequence, averaging the %nex measurement of all peptides covering specific amino acid residues. Residues and time points with no acquired peptide coverage and proline residues are shown as gaps in the data. This averaging method simplifies the observation of variations in deuterium exchange protection for localized protein regions. In the EGFR heat map, for example, we observe low exchange across much of the kinase domain, indicated by blue coloring. Exceptions to this observation include regions within the αC-helix and activation loop (A-loop), which show more rapid exchange within the millisecond time scale of exchange, indicated by yellow colors. The most striking result can be seen within the EGFR CTT where we observe that exchange reaches a plateau very rapidly, often within 5 s of exchange, and the %nex values are indicated by orange and red colors on the heat map. This rapid exchange indicates that the tail is unprotected from exchange when compared with the kinase domain. The observed rapid exchange behavior is characteristic of a highly dynamic and/or frequently exchange-competent conformational state, meaning amide hydrogen bonding between residues is transient or weak in these regions. To further characterize the conformational and physical state of the EGFR and HER3 CTTs, we expressed and purified EGFR and HER3 CTT-only constructs in a bacterial Escherichia coli system. EGFR residues 961–1186 with a C-terminal His tag were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography and gel filtration. Estimated purity by SDS-PAGE was >95% (Fig. 4A) with a concentration of 5 mg ml−1. The HER3 CTT, HER3 residues 981–1342, was also expressed in E. coli and purified to a concentration of 2 mg ml−1 with >95% purity in the same manner (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of the CTT region and subsequent binding of SH2 domain-containing proteins are essential steps in EGFR signaling. We first validated the ability of our CTT constructs to be both recognized and phosphorylated at specific tyrosine sites by separate EGFR family kinase domains in solution just as they would be if they were part of their respective ICH constructs. To test whether the E. coli-expressed EGFR CTT construct is functional, we incubated it with recombinant EGFR kinase domain and measured tail phosphorylation using reaction with ATP and blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. We show, through Western blotting identification of specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues (EGFR Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1173) in the EGFR CTT (Fig. 4C), that the EGFR CTT is recognized and phosphorylated by the EGFR kinase domain even when these two domains are expressed as separated constructs. Furthermore, we used anti-HER3 Tyr(P)-1289 and general PY20 antibodies to verify that the HER3 CTT was phosphorylated by both the EGFR kinase domain and HER2 kinase domain via Western blotting (Fig. 4D). Next, we tested whether EGFR CTT can be bound by an SH2 domain-containing protein. We recombinantly expressed GST-tagged Grb2 SH2 domain and performed a GST pulldown assay (Fig. 4E). Incubating EGFR CTT with EGFR kinase domain produced a phosphorylated CTT that appeared as multiple bands of higher molecular weight, and this phosphorylated EGFR CTT did not bind on its own to glutathione-agarose (Fig. 4E, flow-through in lane 1 and bound in lane 2). Similarly, incubating unphosphorylated EGFR CTT with the GST-Grb2 SH2 domain construct did not result in binding, and EGFR CTT eluted in the flow-through (lane 3). However, once phosphorylated, EGFR CTT was bound by GST-Grb2-SH2 and was pulled down by glutathione-agarose (Fig. 4E, lane 6). These experiments provide evidence for the functionality of the EGFR and HER3 CTT constructs. Far-UV CD spectroscopy provides information about the secondary structure characteristics of protein molecules in solution based on the absorption of circularly polarized light by amide bonds in the polypeptide backbone. Because secondary structure types absorb circularly polarized light differently and each amide bond contributes to the UV absorption, the resulting spectrum will refle"
https://openalex.org/W2550917340,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been shown to induce large populations of CD8 T-effector memory cells that unlike central memory persist in large quantities following infection, a phenomenon commonly termed “memory inflation”. Although murine models to date have shown very large and persistent CMV-specific T-cell expansions following infection, there is considerable variability in CMV-specific T-memory responses in humans. Historically such memory inflation in humans has been assumed a consequence of reactivation events during the life of the host. Because basic information about CMV infection/re-infection and reactivation in immune competent humans is not available, we used a murine model to test how primary infection, reinfection, and reactivation stimuli influence memory inflation. We show that low titer infections induce “partial” memory inflation of both mCMV specific CD8 T-cells and antibody. We show further that reinfection with different strains can boost partial memory inflation. Finally, we show preliminary results suggesting that a single strong reactivation stimulus does not stimulate memory inflation. Altogether, our results suggest that while high titer primary infections can induce memory inflation, reinfections during the life of a host may be more important than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2552288511,"Recent analyses of amino acid mutations in proteins reveal that mutations at many pairs of sites are epistatic-i.e., their effects on fitness are non-additive-the combined effect of two mutations being significantly larger or smaller than the sum of their effects considered independently. Interestingly, epistatic sites are not necessarily near each other in the folded structure of a protein, and may even be located on opposite sides of a molecule. However, the mechanistic reasons for long-range epistasis remain obscure. Here, we study long-range epistasis in proteins using a previously developed model in which off-lattice polymers are evolved under ligand binding constraints. Epistatic effects in the model are qualitatively similar to those recently reported for small proteins, and many are long-range. We find that a major reason for long-range epistasis is conformational change-a recurrent theme in both positive and negative epistasis being the transfer, or exchange of material between the ordered nucleus, which supports the binding site, and the liquid-like surface of a folded molecule. These local transitions in phase and folded structure are largely responsible for long-range epistasis in our model."
https://openalex.org/W2552333311,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. Using adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer, we evaluated the potential to improve skeletal muscle weakness via systemic, postnatal inhibition of either myostatin or all signaling via the activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB). After demonstrating elevated p-SMAD3 content and differential content of ActRIIB ligands, 4-week-old male C/C SMA model mice were treated intraperitoneally with 1x1012 genome copies of pseudotype 2/8 virus encoding a soluble form of the ActRIIB extracellular domain (sActRIIB) or protease-resistant myostatin propeptide (dnMstn) driven by a liver specific promoter. At 12 weeks of age, muscle mass and function were improved in treated C/C mice by both treatments, compared to controls. The fast fiber type muscles had a greater response to treatment than did slow muscles, and the greatest therapeutic effects were found with sActRIIB treatment. Myostatin/activin inhibition, however, did not rescue C/C mice from the reduction in motor unit numbers of the tibialis anterior muscle. Collectively, this study indicates that myostatin/activin inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to increase muscle mass and strength, but not neuromuscular junction defects, in less severe forms of SMA."

Akt is translocated to the plasma membrane for activation. Akt-membrane binding is mediated by direct interactions between its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). It has been shown that Akt activation in breast cancer cells is modulated by calmodulin (CaM). However, the molecular mechanism of the interplay between CaM and membrane binding is not established. Here, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and biochemical and biophysical techniques to characterize how PI(3,4,5)P3, CaM, and membrane mimetics (nanodisc) bind to Akt(PHD). We show that PI(3,4,5)P3 binding to Akt(PHD) displaces the C-terminal lobe of CaM but not the weakly binding N-terminal lobe. However, binding of a PI(3,4,5)P3-embedded membrane nanodisc to Akt(PHD) with a 103-fold tighter affinity than PI(3,4,5)P3 is able to completely displace CaM. We also show that Akt(PHD) binds to both layers of the nanodisc, indicating proper incorporation of PI(3,4,5)P3 on the nanodisc surface. No detectable binding has been observed between Akt(PHD) and PI(3,4,5)P3-free nanodiscs, demonstrating that PI(3,4,5)P3 is required for membrane binding, CaM displacement, and Akt activation. Using pancreatic cancer cells, we demonstrate that inhibition of Akt-CaM binding attenuated Akt activation. Our findings support a model by which CaM binds to Akt to facilitate its translocation to the membrane.

These structural elements are recognized as global features for PHDs in hundreds of proteins in mammals and bacteria (20Lemmon M.A. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and phosphoinositides.Biochem.

The interaction between Akt(PHD) and PI(3,4,5)P3 is considered a hallmark in the activation pathways and is required to initiate a cascade of events, including phosphorylation and downstream activation of effector proteins. The PM-anchored Akt becomes fully activated upon phosphorylation of residues Thr-308 in the KD and Ser-473 in the HM through phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively (18Franke T.F.

Recent studies demonstrated that membrane targeting and subsequent activation of Akt are also modulated by phosphatidylserine (PS) (23Huang B.X. Akbar M. Kevala K. Kim H.Y. Phosphatidylserine is a critical modulator for Akt activation.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PS interacts with specific residues in the PHD and HM of Akt to promote binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. The synergy between PS and PI(3,4,5)P3 is thought to induce Akt inter-domain conformational changes required for phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 (23Huang B.X. Akbar M. Kevala K. Kim H.Y. Phosphatidylserine is a critical modulator for Akt activation.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies revealed that disruption of Akt-PS interaction impairs Akt signaling and increases susceptibility to cell death, suggesting that PS is critical for Akt activation and cell survival particularly in conditions with limited PI(3,4,5)P3 availability (23Huang B.X. Akbar M. Kevala K. Kim H.Y. Phosphatidylserine is a critical modulator for Akt activation.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies imply that a synergy between membrane lipids is perhaps needed for Akt localization and activation. In addition to binding to lipids, an emerging role for Akt(PHD) as a multifunctional domain that can also bind to proteins is now being discovered. Studies have shown that in cells under resting conditions, the PHD interacts with its KD in a closed conformation (24Calleja V. Laguerre M. Parker P.J. Larijani B.

Crystal structure of human AKT1 with an allosteric inhibitor reveals a new mode of kinase inhibition.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5e12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In that stage, Thr-308 is blocked and is inaccessible to PDK1 (26Wu W.I. Voegtli W.C. Sturgis H.L. Dizon F.P. Vigers G.P. Brandhuber B.J. Crystal structure of human AKT1 with an allosteric inhibitor reveals a new mode of kinase inhibition.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5e12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This closed conformation is only disrupted when the PHD binds to PI(3,4,5)P3 (24Calleja V. Laguerre M. Parker P.J. Larijani B.

This disruption is required for subsequent exposure and phosphorylation of residue Thr-308 in the KD. Mutations in the PHD that disrupt PHD-KD interaction result in constitutive Akt activation (27Parikh C. Janakiraman V. Wu W.I. Foo C.K. Kljavin N.M. Chaudhuri S. Stawiski E. Lee B. Lin J. Li H.

Furthermore, the PHD has been shown to bind to calmodulin (CaM) to promote Akt1 (will be called Akt throughout this paper) activation in many breast cancer cells (2Coticchia C.M. Revankar C.M.

These studies are consistent with the findings that CaM is overexpressed in breast tumors and breast cancer cells lines (36Desai K.V. Xiao N. Wang W. Gangi L. Greene J. Powell J.I. Dickson R.

Until recently, the molecular mechanisms governing the Akt(PHD)-CaM interaction were not well characterized at the biochemical, biophysical, and structural levels. Attempting to understand the mechanism by which CaM and lipids contribute into Akt activation, we have initially characterized CaM interaction with Akt(PHD) (38Agamasu C. Ghanam R.H. Saad J.S. Structural and biophysical characterization of the interactions between calmodulin and the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27403-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that CaM forms a tight complex with the Akt(PHD) with a Kd of 100 nm (38Agamasu C. Ghanam R.H. Saad J.S.

Chem. 2015; 290: 27403-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The CaM-binding interface on Akt(PHD) was mapped to two loops adjacent to the PI(3,4,5)P3-binding site, representing a novel CaM-binding motif and suggesting a synergistic relationship between CaM and PI(3,4,5)P3 for Akt activation (38Agamasu C. Ghanam R.H. Saad J.S. Structural and biophysical characterization of the interactions between calmodulin and the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27403-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This proposed role of CaM is consistent with the recent findings that CaM enhances PI(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PHD of a homologous protein from the Tec kinase family called interleukin-2 inducible tyrosine kinase (Itk) and vice versa (39Wang X. Boyken S.E. Hu J. Xu X. Rimer R.P. Shea M.A. Shaw A.S. Andreotti A.H. Huang Y.H. Calmodulin and PI(3,4,5)P(3) cooperatively bind to the Itk pleckstrin homology domain to promote efficient calcium signaling and IL-17A production.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: ra74Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conversely, these findings are inconsistent with other studies that indicated that CaM competes with PI(3,4,5)3 for Akt(PHD) thereby decreasing the affinity of PI(3,4,5)P3 to Akt(PHD) (28Dong B. Valencia C.A. Liu R. Ca2+/calmodulin directly interacts with the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25131-25140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, we strongly believe that further investigation is required to clarify the interplay between CaM and PM lipids in Akt activation. To understand these mechanisms, it is essential to characterize at the molecular level how CaM and lipids bind to Akt(PHD). Here, we employed NMR, biophysical, biochemical, and in vivo tools to understand the interplay between CaM and membrane interactions with Akt. We utilized dibutanoyl-phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ((diC4-PI(3,4,5)P3), a soluble analog of PI(3,4,5)P3, with truncated acyl chains. We show the following: (i) diC4-PI(3,4,5)P3 induces major changes in Akt(PHD); (ii) the glycerol backbone and acyl chains of PI(3,4,5)P3 may contribute to the interaction; (iii) diC4-PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to Akt(PHD) with a Kd of 13 μm; and (iv) CaM does not enhance binding of PI(3,4,5)P3 to Akt(PHD). By using PI(3,4,5)P3- and PS-incorporated nanodisc membrane model, we also show that Akt(PHD) binds tightly to membrane with a Kd of 19 nm, which is able to displace CaM from Akt(PHD). Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of Akt-CaM binding attenuated Akt activation in pancreatic cancer cells. Elucidation of the mechanism by which Akt interacts with both CaM and lipids will help in the understanding of the activation mechanism, which may provide insight for new potential targets to control the pathophysiological processes of cell survival. It is established that membrane binding of Akt is regulated by specific interactions between PI(3,4,5)P3 and the PHD. However, the molecular mechanisms governing Akt(PHD)-membrane interactions and the interplay between membrane lipids and CaM are not well characterized. This is the first study aimed at characterization of the interplay of CaM and lipid/membrane binding to Akt(PHD). Previous NMR studies of Akt(PHD) have been conducted with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), the polar head of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), the polar head of PI(3,4,5)P3 (40Auguin D.

Therefore, it is important to determine how IP4 and diC4-PI(3,4,5)P3 interact with Akt(PHD) and whether there are differences in binding affinity. NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to variations in the local molecular environment. Small changes in the 1H and 15N resonances obtained by collecting HSQC spectra on protein·protein and protein·lipid complexes can be used to map the binding interface. These experiments not only allow for identification of residues involved in the interaction and/or accompanying conformational changes, but they also provide an effective method for examining the stability and folding of the protein and assessing the strength of the interaction. We initially assessed how diC4-PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to Akt(PHD) using NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) as detected in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Because of the propensity of Akt(PHD) to self-associate and form aggregates in solution at high protein concentrations (39Wang X. Boyken S.E. Hu J. Xu X. Rimer R.P. Shea M.A. Shaw A.S. Andreotti A.H.

Twenty-week-old male Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were assigned randomly to the control, D. esculenta treatment, D. esculenta with 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment, or the exercise training groups (running at 25 m/min for 1 h, 5 d/wk; n = 10 each group). Eight weeks of D. esculenta treatment or exercise training significantly attenuated the increase in plasma insulin and fasting glucose levels. Plasma and muscle concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and 5adihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the expression of 5α-reductase increased significantly in the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups, and both treatments led to the upregulation of glucose transporter-4 translocation with concomitant increases in PKB and PKC-ζ/λ phosphorylation. Furthermore, the glucose metabolic clearance rate, which represents insulin sensitivity, increased significantly in both the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups. These effects were suppressed by administration of the DHT synthetic inhibitor. Together, these findings suggest that the D. esculenta-induced increase in muscle sex steroid hormone levels helps decrease insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.—Sato, K., Fujita, S., Iemitsu, M.

https://openalex.org/W2552534973,"In aquaculture, growth and sex are economically important traits. To accelerate genetic improvement in increasing growth in salt-tolerant tilapia, we conducted QTL mapping for growth traits and sex with an F2 family, including 522 offspring and two parents. We used 144 polymorphic microsatellites evenly covering the genome of tilapia to genotype the family. QTL analyses were carried out using interval mapping for all individuals, males and females in the family, respectively. Using all individuals, three suggestive QTL for body weight, body length and body thickness respectively were detected in LG20, LG22 and LG12 and explained 2.4% to 3.1% of phenotypic variance (PV). When considering only males, five QTL for body weight were detected on five LGs, and explained 4.1 to 6.3% of PV. Using only females from the F2 family, three QTL for body weight were detected on LG1, LG6 and LG8, and explained 7.9–14.3% of PV. The QTL for body weight in males and females were located in different LGs, suggesting that in salt-tolerant tilapia, different set of genes ‘switches’ control the growth in males and females. QTL for sex were mapped on LG1 and LG22, indicating multigene sex determination in the salt-tolerant tilapia. This study provides new insights on the locations and effects of QTL for growth traits and sex, and sets the foundation for fine mapping for future marker-assisted selection for growth and sex in salt-tolerant tilapia aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2556313983,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is common in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A recent study demonstrated that a high level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may be associated with PEW in those patients. This prospective study aimed to assess the association of NT-proBNP with body composition and muscle loss. A cohort of prevalent HD patients (n = 238) was examined. Blood samples were obtained at baseline to measure high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin and NT-proBNP. Nutritional status and changes in muscle mass were assessed by subjective global assessment, percentage creatinine generation rate (%CGR), creatinine index (CI) and lean body mass (LBM) estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The %CGR and CI were calculated five times for one year, and DXA was performed at baseline and one year later. Cardiac function was estimated by ultrasonography at baseline. NT-proBNP was significantly higher in HD patients with PEW. High NT-proBNP was associated with cardiac dysfunction, increased levels of hsCRP and IL-6, and serially decreased levels of the indexes for muscle mass. Multiple regression analysis adjusted with confounders showed that NT-proBNP was an independent predictor for decrease in LBM and serial lower levels of %CGR and CI. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a novel association between NT-proBNP and muscle loss. NT-proBNP may be an independent biomarker for malnutrition in HD patients, especially in patients with muscles loss, regardless of chronic inflammation, cardiac dysfunction, or overhydration."
https://openalex.org/W2549806584,"The first ATP-competitive p38a MAPK/MAPK14 inhibitor with excellent in vivo efficacy and selectivity, skepinone-L, is now available. We investigated the impact of selective p38a MAPK/MAPK14 inhibition on enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL) stimulated human monocytes with its implications for atherosclerosis. Among the different p38 MAPK isoforms, p38a/MAPK14 was the predominantly expressed and activated isoform in isolated human peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, eLDL colocalized with macrophages positive for p38a MAPK/ MAPK14 in human carotid endarterectomy specimens. Using the human leukemia cell line THP-1 and/or primary monocyte-derived macrophages, skepinone-L inhibited eLDL-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, inhibited eLDL induced expression of both cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1), without a net effect on foam cell formation, had a cell-and time-dependent effect on eLDLtriggered apoptosis, and inhibited eLDL-stimulated secretion of IL-8 and MIP-1b/CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1b/chemokine, CC motif, ligand 4). Inhibition of a key signaling molecule of the p38 MAPK pathway, p38a MAPK/MAPK14, by selective inhibitors like skepinone-L, conclusively facilitates elucidation of the impact of the complex network of p38 MAPK signaling on atherogenesis and might provide a promising therapeutic tool to prevent inflammatory cascades in atherosclerosis.—Cheng, F., Twardowski, L., Fehr, S., Aner, C., Schaeffeler, E., Joos, T., Knorpp, T., Dorweiler, B., Laufer, S., Schwab, M., Torzewski, M.

https://openalex.org/W2552144962,"Glechoma L. (Lamiaceae) is distributed in eastern Asia and Europe. Understanding chromosome evolution in Glechoma has been strongly hampered by its small chromosomes, constant karyotype and polyploidy. Here phylogenetic patterns and chromosomal variation in Glechoma species are considered, using genome sizes, chromosome mapping of 5S and 35S rDNAs by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), and phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacers (nrITS) of 35S rDNA and 5S rDNA NTS sequences. Species and populations of Glechoma are tetraploid (2n = 36) with base chromosome number of x = 9. Four chromosomes carry pericentric 5S rDNA sites in their short arms in all the species. Two to four of these chromosomes also carry 35S rDNA in subterminal regions of the same arms. Two to four other chromosomes have 35S rDNA sites, all located subterminally within short arms; one individual possessed additional weak pericentric 35S rDNA signals on three other chromosomes. Five types of rDNA locus distribution have been defined on the basis of 35S rDNA variation, but none is species-specific, and most species have more than one type. Glechoma hederacea has four types. Genome size in Glechoma ranges from 0.80 to 0.94 pg (1C), with low levels of intrapopulational variation in all species. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and NTS sequences distinguish three main clades coinciding with geographical distribution: European (G. hederacea-G. hirsuta), Chinese and Korean (G. longituba), and Japanese (G. grandis). The paper presents the first comparative cytogenetic analyses of Glechoma species including karyotype structure, rDNA location and number, and genome size interpreted in a phylogenetic context. The observed variation suggests that the genus is still in genomic flux. Genome size, but not rDNA loci number and distribution, provides a character for species delimitation which allows better inferences of interspecific relationships to be made, in the absence of well-defined morphological differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2552232458,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease affecting cartilage and is the most common form of arthritis worldwide. One third of OA patients have severe synovitis and less than 10% have no evidence of synovitis. Moreover, synovitis is predictive for more severe disease progression. This offers a target for therapy but more research on the pathophysiological processes in the synovial tissue of these patients is needed. Functional studies performed with synovial tissue will be more approachable when this material, that becomes available by joint replacement surgery, can be stored for later use. We set out to determine the consequences of slow-freezing of human OA synovial tissue. Therefore, we validated a method that can be applied in every routine laboratory and performed a comparative study of five cryoprotective agent (CPA) solutions. To determine possible deleterious cryopreservation-thaw effects on viability, the synovial tissue architecture, metabolic activity, RNA quality, expression of cryopreservation associated stress genes, and expression of OA characteristic disease genes was studied. Furthermore, the biological activity of the cryopreserved tissue was determined by measuring cytokine secretion induced by the TLR ligands lipopolysaccharides and Pam3Cys. Compared to non frozen synovium, no difference in cell and tissue morphology could be identified in the conditions using the CS10, standard and CryoSFM CPA solution for cryopreservation. However, we observed significantly lower preservation of tissue morphology with the Biofreeze and CS2 media. The other viability assays showed trends in the same direction but were not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between conditions. In all assays tested a clearly lower viability was detected in the condition in which synovium was frozen without CPA solution. This detailed analysis showed that OA synovial tissue explants can be cryopreserved while maintaining the morphology, viability and phenotypical response after thawing, offering enhanced opportunities for human in vitro studies."
https://openalex.org/W2555993004,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in protection of cells from electrophile-induced toxicity through up-regulating phase II detoxifying enzymes and phase III transporters. We previously reported that oxidative stress induces up-regulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11), a member of the IL-6 family that ameliorates acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity. However, a role for IL-11 in protection of cells from electrophile-induced toxicity remains unclear. Here we show that an environmental electrophile, 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), but not 15d-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) or tert-butylhydroxyquinone (tBHQ), induced IL-11 production. Consistent with a crucial role for prolonged ERK activation in H2O2-induced IL-11 production, 1,2-NQ, but not 15d-PGJ2 or tBHQ, elicited prolonged ERK activation. Conversely, inhibition of the ERK pathway by a MEK inhibitor completely blocked 1,2-NQ-induced IL-11 production at both protein and mRNA levels, further substantiating an intimate cross-talk between ERK activation and 1,2-NQ-induced IL-11 production. Promoter analysis of the Il11 gene revealed that two AP-1 sites were essential for 1,2-NQ-induced promoter activities. Among various members of the AP-1 family, Fra-1 was up-regulated by 1,2-NQ, and its up-regulation was blocked by a MEK inhibitor. Although NRF2 was not required for H2O2-induced IL11 up-regulation, NRF2 was essential for 1,2-NQ-induced IL11 up-regulation by increasing Fra-1 proteins possibly through promoting mRNA translation of FOSL1. Finally, intraperitoneal administration of 1,2-NQ induced body weight loss in wild-type mice, which was further exacerbated in Il11ra1−/− mice compared with Il11ra1+/− mice.

https://openalex.org/W2551264639,"Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is highly selectively expressed in skeletal muscle and is known to lower mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and promote fatty acid oxidation; however, the global impact of UCP3 activity on skeletal muscle and whole-body metabolism have not been extensively studied. We utilized untargeted metabolomics to identify novel metabolites that distinguish mice overexpressing UCP3 in muscle, both at rest and after exercise regimens that challenged muscle metabolism, to potentially unmask subtle phenotypes. Male wild-type (WT) and muscle-specific UCP3-overexpressing transgenic (UCP3 Tg) C57BL/6J mice were compared with or without a 5 wk endurance training protocol at rest or after an acute exercise bout (EB). Skeletal muscle, liver, and plasma samples were analyzed by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Discriminant metabolites were considered if within the top 99th percentile of variable importance measurements obtained from partial least-squares discriminant analysis models. A total of 80 metabolites accurately discriminated UCP3 Tg mice from WT when modeled within a specific exercise condition (i.e., untrained/rested, endurance trained/rested, untrained/EB, and endurance trained/EB). Results revealed that several amino acids and amino acid derivatives in skeletal muscle and plasma of UCP3 Tg mice (e.g., Asp, Glu, Lys, Tyr, Ser, Met) were significantly reduced after an EB; that metabolites associated with skeletal muscle glutathione/Met/Cys metabolism (2-hydroxybutanoic acid, oxoproline, Gly, and Glu) were altered in UCP3 Tg mice across all training and exercise conditions; and that muscle metabolite indices of dehydrogenase activity were increased in UCP3 Tg mice, suggestive of a shift in tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio. The results indicate that mitochondrial UCP3 activity affects metabolism well beyond fatty acid oxidation, regulating biochemical pathways associated with amino acid metabolism and redox status. That select metabolites were altered in liver of UCP3 Tg mice highlights that changes in muscle UCP3 activity can also affect other organ systems, presumably through changes in systemic metabolite trafficking.-Aguer, C., Piccolo, B.

https://openalex.org/W2555705365,"Fear is an important emotional reaction that guides decision making in situations of ambiguity or uncertainty. Both recognition of facial expressions of fear and decision making ability can be impaired after traumatic brain injury (TBI), in particular when the frontal lobe is damaged. So far, it has not been investigated how recognition of fear influences risk behavior in healthy subjects and TBI patients. The ability to recognize fear is thought to be related to the ability to experience fear and to use it as a warning signal to guide decision making. We hypothesized that a better ability to recognize fear would be related to a better regulation of risk behavior, with healthy controls outperforming TBI patients. To investigate this, 59 healthy subjects and 49 TBI patients were assessed with a test for emotion recognition (Facial Expression of Emotion: Stimuli and Tests) and a gambling task (Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)). The results showed that, regardless of post traumatic amnesia duration or the presence of frontal lesions, patients were more impaired than healthy controls on both fear recognition and decision making. In both groups, a significant relationship was found between better fear recognition, the development of an advantageous strategy across the IGT and less risk behavior in the last blocks of the IGT. Educational level moderated this relationship in the final block of the IGT. This study has important clinical implications, indicating that impaired decision making and risk behavior after TBI can be preceded by deficits in the processing of fear."
https://openalex.org/W2556362618,"Translocation of the dense nucleus along a gravity vector initiates mechanical remodeling of a cell, but the underlying mechanisms of cytoskeletal network and focal adhesion complex (FAC) reorganization in a mammalian cell remain unclear. We quantified the remodeling of an MC3T3-E1 cell placed in upward-, downward-, or edgeon-orientated substrate. Nucleus longitudinal translocation presents a high value in downward orientation at 24 h or in edge-on orientation at 72 h, which is consistent with orientation-dependent distribution of perinuclear actin stress fibers and vimentin cords. Redistribution of total FAC area and fractionized super mature adhesion number coordinates this dependence at short duration. This orientation-dependent remodeling is associated with nucleus flattering and lamin A/C phosphorylation. Actin depolymerization or Rho-associated protein kinase signaling inhibition abolishes the orientation dependence of nucleus translocation, whereas tubulin polymerization inhibition or vimentin disruption reserves the dependence. A biomechanical model is therefore proposed for integrating the mechanosensing of nucleus translocation with cytoskeletal remodeling and FAC reorganization induced by a gravity vector.—Zhang, C., Zhou, L., Zhang, F., Lü, D., Li, N., Zheng, L., Xu, Y., Li, Z., Sun, S., Long, M.

Several TRPA1 homologues exist in the animal kingdom, and the ability of TRPA1 to sense potentially harmful electrophilic compounds has been conserved for ∼500 million years, whereas the ancestral thermosensitive properties of TRPA1 are unclear and diverged later (5.Laursen W.J.

A role for mammalian TRPA1, and especially the human TRPA1 (hTRPA1), as noxious cold sensors has been controversial ever since it was proposed (13.Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R.

If it is true that all TRPA1s are intrinsic thermo-gated ion channels, then it appears that human, rat, and mouse TRPA1 respond to cold temperatures below 20 °C, whereas, for example, the rattlesnake, fruit fly, and mosquito TRPA1 respond to warm temperatures above 25 °C (13.Story G.M.

However, this simplistic view may not hold true because it was recently shown that human TRPA1 also responds to heat (25.Moparthi L. Kichko T.I. Eberhardt M. Högestätt E.D. Kjellbom P. Johanson U.

It has been suggested that the intracellular N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPA1 in snakes contains the necessary thermosensitive modules for heat detection, whereas both the N-terminal ARD and the pore region of Drosophila (melanogaster) TRPA1 may contain heat-sensitive elements (4.Julius D.

However, these and similar conclusions have to be regarded with some caution because the use of mutagenic and chimeric strategies results in artificial constructs, which makes it difficult to exclude indirect effects on a temperature sensor located elsewhere in the protein (5.Laursen W.J. Anderson E.O. Hoffstaetter L.J. Bagriantsev S.N. Gracheva E.O.

Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 583-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, each of three single point mutations of amino acids in the N-terminal ARD, not previously regarded critical, like certain cysteine and lysine residues (28.Hinman A. Chuang H.H. Bautista D.M. Julius D. TRP channel activation by reversible covalent modification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19564-19568Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 29.Macpherson L.J.

Noxious compounds activate TRPA1 ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines.Nature. 2007; 445: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), changed the mouse TRPA1 from being cold-sensitive to being heat-sensitive (30.Jabba S. Goyal R. Sosa-Pagán J.O. Moldenhauer H. Wu J. Kalmeta B. Bandell M. Latorre R. Patapoutian A. Grandl J.

Importantly, the authors concluded that this could best be explained by an effect on the coupling of temperature to channel gating rather than altering the nature of the thermosensitive domain itself (30.Jabba S. Goyal R. Sosa-Pagán J.O. Moldenhauer H. Wu J. Kalmeta B. Bandell M. Latorre R. Patapoutian A. Grandl J.

This reasoning is in line with our view that conformational changes of the N-terminal ARD indirectly affect thermo- and chemosensitive structures outside the N-terminal ARD of TRPA1 (10.Zygmunt P.M. Högestätt E.D. TRPA1.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 583-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14.Moparthi L. Survery S. Kreir M. Simonsen C. Kjellbom P. Högestatt E.D. Johanson U.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 16901-16906Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Studies of purified TRPA1 without its N-terminal ARD should therefore be a valuable contribution in the search for TRPA1 thermo- and chemosensory domains (14.Moparthi L. Survery S. Kreir M.

Clearly, various methodological approaches are needed to identify the location of distinct temperature-sensing domains if they exist at all (31.Clapham D.E. Miller C.

The Anopheles gambiae TRPA1 (AgTRPA1), which exists as the two isoforms AgTRPA1(A) and AgTRPA1(B), is heat-sensitive as well as activated by electrophilic compounds when expressed heterologously (12.Kang K.

In the present study, we have purified the AgTRPA1(A) with the aim to determine whether this protein has inherent thermo- and chemosensitive properties and whether such properties are also located outside the N-terminal ARD. We show that AgTRPA1, irrespective of its N-terminal ARD, undergoes conformational changes and is activated by the electrophilic compounds allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and cinnamaldehyde, as well as by temperatures above 25 °C. Thus, our recent proposal that electrophiles modify TRPA1 channel activity by interacting with binding sites, such as cysteine and lysine residues, outside the N-terminal ARD (14.Moparthi L. Survery S. Kreir M. Simonsen C. Kjellbom P. Högestatt E.D. Johanson U. Zygmunt P.M. Human TRPA1 is intrinsically cold- and chemosensitive with and without its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain.Proc.

Most important is our conclusion that temperature-sensitive regions of AgTRPA1 should be searched for outside the N-terminal ARD, as proposed for the cold-sensitive hTRPA1 (14.Moparthi L. Survery S. Kreir M. Simonsen C. Kjellbom P. Högestatt E.D. Johanson U. Zygmunt P.M. Human TRPA1 is intrinsically cold- and chemosensitive with and without its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain.Proc. Natl. Acad.

The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been established as an excellent host for efficient expression of a number of heterologous eukaryotic membrane proteins (14.Moparthi L. Survery S.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used this system to express the full-length isoform A of AgTRPA1 (16.Kang K. Panzano V.C. Chang E.C. Ni L. Dainis A.M. Jenkins A.M. Regna K. Muskavitch M.A. Garrity P.A.

An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) as well as a truncated construct lacking the N-terminal ARD (Δ1–776 AgTRPA1; Fig. 1A). After cell lysis, peripheral proteins were removed from the Pichia membrane fraction by urea and alkali washes, and TRPA1 proteins were extracted by the detergent fos-choline-12, which was identified as the best choice for protein stability and yield in screens performed with various detergents (data not shown). The proteins were further purified, by means of a hexa-His tag in the C-terminal extension by nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The highly expressed Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 was quite pure already after the affinity purification, whereas the full-length construct suffered from both contaminating proteins and some degradation products after the corresponding step (Fig. 1C). In size exclusion chromatography, Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 eluted mainly as a tetramer, whereas AgTRPA1 eluted as a double peak corresponding to the tetramer and the dimer (Fig. 1B). After the two-step purification, the tetrameric Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 yield was estimated to be 1.3 mg from 20 g of Pichia cells. In comparison, the yield of the 2.5 times longer AgTRPA1 was found to be 0.7 mg from the same amount of cells. Only the tetrameric fractions were used for structural and functional characterization of TRPA1. The tetrameric fractions of purified AgTRPA1 and Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 were subjected to synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy to examine their overall fold and thermal unfolding (Fig. 2A). At low temperature, the SRCD spectra of both constructs exhibited the expected characteristic α-helical protein signature with a maximum at 193 nm and two deep minima at 210 and 222 nm, suggesting that the proteins retained their native fold after purification. The SRCD spectra obtained at higher temperatures show that both proteins gradually lose their secondary structure to become almost completely unfolded around 80 °C. The unfolding appears to be irreversible because lowering the temperature does not result in the reappearance of an α-helical spectrum (data not shown). TRPA1 channels are believed to act as thermoreceptors; hence, we performed more careful analysis of the thermal denaturation of AgTRPA1 and Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 to monitor temperature-induced changes in the purified proteins. From differential plots of the spectra obtained at 24.3 °C and at 41.4 °C, the most prominent changes were found at 193 nm and at 222 nm (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we chose these two wavelengths for construction of thermal transition curves (Fig. 2, C and D). Although the complete transition of the truncated construct has a slightly lower midpoint (Table 1; ∼54 °C, both at 193 and 222 nm) than the full-length TRPA1 (55 and 58 °C at 193 and 222 nm, respectively), there appear to be additional early minor transitions at 30 and 45 °C in the latter. A closer investigation of the thermal denaturation between 24 and 45 °C in the truncated construct cannot conclusively support or exclude a similar early transition at 30 °C due to the relatively large variability between samples, but a distinct transition between 41 and 43 °C is observed (Fig. 2D).TABLE 1Midpoints of temperature transitions for AgTRPA1 and Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 as measured by SRCDAgTRPA1Δ1–766 AgTRPA1Midpoint 193 nmMidpoint 222 nmnMidpoint 193 nmMidpoint 222 nmn°C°C°C°C55.3 ± 0.858.1 ± 0.8253.6 ± 1.053.8 ± 1.12 Open table in a new tab In contrast to CD spectrometry that monitors the secondary structure of a protein, tryptophan residues in a protein can be informative when it comes to detecting changes in tertiary structure caused by, for example, the binding of agonists. The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophans residing in a non-polar environment may be quenched or shifted in wavelength by direct interaction with a ligand or due to induced conformational changes exposing the tryptophan to a different milieu (38.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). In AgTRPA1, there are 13 tryptophan residues, of which eight are retained in Δ1–776 AgTRPA1 (Fig. 3A). An alignment with the sequence of the recently reported structure of hTRPA1 (39.Paulsen C.E. Armache J.P. Gao Y. Cheng Y. Julius D. Structure of the TRPA1 ion channel suggests regulatory mechanisms.Nature. 2015; 520: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) reveals that five of the corresponding amino acid residues are resolved in the structure and that tryptophans 915, 926, and 1108 are likely to be located on the surface of the protein, interacting with detergent in the micelle or the aqueous phase (Fig. 3B). Two conserved tryptophans, corresponding to Trp-779 and Trp-950 in AgTRPA1, are buried in the structure: a classification of these tryptophans in the structure of hTRPA1 using PFAST (Protein Fluorescence and Structure Toolkit (40.Shen C.

The protein fluorescence and structural toolkit: database and programs for the analysis of protein fluorescence and structural data.Proteins. 2008; 71: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) suggests that the former is located in a fairly polar environment (class III, p = 0.87), whereas the latter is packed into more hydrophobic milieu (class S (p = 0.55) or class I (p = 0.45)). The conserved amino acid residues within 5 Å of the two tryptophan indole rings (Fig. 4) support a similar polar and hydrophobic setting in AgTRPA1 for Trp-779 and Trp-950, respectively. The expected emission maximum for a tryptophan of class III is between 346 and 350 nm, whereas the ranges for tryptophans belonging to classes S and I are blue-shifted to 321–325 and 330–333 nm (40.Shen C.

Concentration-response experiments show that both constructs have intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with a maximum at 337 nm, which can be totally quenched by the agonist AITC without any associated shift of the maximum in the spectra (Fig. 5A). Although statistical analysis favors a model with different pEC50 values for AITC of the two constructs (p < 0.005), the corresponding EC50 values 256 and 444 μm, for AgTRPA1 and Δ1–776 AgTRPA1, respectively, differ less than 2-fold.FIGURE 4.Conservation of residues surrounding Trp-779 and Trp-950.

https://openalex.org/W2555837903,"Transplantation of ovarian tissue (OT) is currently the only clinical option to restore fertility with cryopreserved OT. However, follicle loss caused by ischemia and slow revascularization occurs in transplanted OT. To shorten the ischemic period and promote angiogenesis, some angiogenic factors have been used. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is one of the major angiogenic factors and has been reported to promote blood vessels and increase vascular permeability in ischemic and/or hypoxic environment. This study was performed to investigate the effects of Ang2 on follicle integrity and revascularization of transplanted mouse OT. Five-week-old B6D2F1 female mice were divided into a control group and two Ang2 groups, followed by ovary collection and vitrification. After warming, the ovaries were autotransplanted into kidney capsules with/without Ang2 injection (50 or 500 ng/kg), and then the mice were sacrificed at days 2, 7, 21, and 42 after transplantation. A total 2,437 follicles in OT grafts were assessed for follicular density, integrity, and classification by using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Apoptosis and revascularization were evaluated by using TUNEL assay and CD31 immunohistochemistry, respectively. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both Ang2 groups showed remarkable increase in morphologically intact follicle ratio across all grafting durations except D21. The numbers of CD31(+) vessels were significantly increased in both Ang2 groups compared with the control group at all durations, except in the 50 ng Ang2 group at D42. However, the mean numbers of follicles of the grafts, apoptosis ratios, and serum FSH levels showed no significant differences among the groups. Our results show that Ang2 treatment significantly increased the intact follicle ratios and the number of blood vessels of the mouse OT grafts. However, further studies performed with large animal or human OT are necessary before clinical application for fertility preservation in cancer patients, and the reliability of the systemic effects of Ang2 should be verified."
https://openalex.org/W2553462024,"Top-down force is referred to arthropod pest management delivered by the organisms from higher trophic levels. In the context of prevalent adoption of transgenic Bt crops that produce insecticidal Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), it still remains elusive whether the top-down forces are affected by the insect-resistant traits that introduced into the Bt crops. We explored how Bt cotton affect the strength of top-down forces via arthropod natural enemies in regulating a non-target pest species, the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii Glover, using a comparative approach (i.e. Bt cotton vs. conventional cotton) under field conditions. To determine top-down forces, we manipulated predation/parasitism exposure of the aphid to their natural enemies using exclusion cages. We found that the aphid population growth was strongly suppressed by the dominant natural enemies including Coccinellids, spiders and Aphidiines parasitoids. Coccinellids, spiders and the assemblage of other arthropod natural enemies (mainly lacewings and Hemipteran bugs) are similarly abundant in both plots, but with the parasitoid mummies less abundant in Bt cotton plots compared to the conventional cotton plots. However, the lower abundance of parasitoids in Bt cotton plots alone did not translate into differential top-down control on A. gossypii populations compared to conventional ones. Overall, the top-down forces were equally strong in both plots. We conclude that transgenic Bt cotton does not disrupt the top-down forces regulating the cotton aphid in central China."
https://openalex.org/W2554747649,"Burgeoning evidence supports a role for cyclooxygenase metabolites in regulating membrane excitability in various forms of synaptic plasticity. Two cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, catalyze the initial step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-2 is generally considered inducible, but in glutamatergic neurons in some brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, it is constitutively expressed. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which this occurs have not been elucidated. Here, we used quantitative PCR and also analyzed reporter gene expression in a mouse line carrying a construct consisting of a portion of the proximal promoter region of the mouse COX-2 gene upstream of luciferase cDNA to characterize COX-2 basal transcriptional regulation in cortical neurons. Extracts from the whole brain and from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulbs exhibited high luciferase activity. Moreover, constitutive COX-2 expression and luciferase activity were detected in cortical neurons, but not in cortical astrocytes, cultured from wild-type and transgenic mice, respectively. Constitutive COX-2 expression depended on spontaneous but not evoked excitatory synaptic activity and was shown to be N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent. Constitutive promoter activity was reduced in neurons transfected with a dominant-negative cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and was eliminated by mutating the CRE-binding site on the COX-2 promoter. However, mutation of the stimulatory protein-1 (Sp1)-binding site resulted in an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent enhancement of COX-2 promoter activity. Basal binding of the transcription factors CREB and Sp1 to the native neuronal COX-2 promoter was confirmed. In toto, our data suggest that spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity regulates constitutive neuronal COX-2 expression via Sp1 and CREB protein-dependent transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2556010928,"Uracil N-glycosylase 2 (UNG2), the nuclear isoform of UNG, catalyzes the removal of uracil or 5-fluorouracil lesions that accumulate in DNA following treatment with the anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (floxuridine), a 5-fluorouracil metabolite. By repairing these DNA lesions before they can cause cell death, UNG2 promotes cancer cell survival and is therefore critically involved in tumor resistance to these agents. However, the mechanisms by which UNG2 is regulated remain unclear. Several phosphorylation sites within the N-terminal regulatory domain of UNG2 have been identified, although the effects of these modifications on UNG2 function have not been fully explored, nor have the identities of the kinases involved been determined. Here we show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) interacts with and phosphorylates UNG2 at Thr60 and that Thr60 phosphorylation requires a Ser64 priming phosphorylation event. We also show that mutating Thr60 or Ser64 to Ala increases the half-life of UNG2, reduces the rate of in vitro uracil excision, and slows UNG2 dissociation from chromatin after DNA replication. Using an UNG2-deficient ovarian cancer cell line that is hypersensitive to floxuridine, we show that GSK-3 phosphorylation facilitates UNG2-dependent repair of floxuridine-induced DNA lesions and promotes tumor cell survival following exposure to this agent.

Consistent with this observation, we and others have shown previously that UNG protects cells from death induced by agents that cause incorporation of uracil or 5-fluorouracil during DNA replication, likely by removing these lesions before they can cause cell death (4.Bulgar A.D.

Mammalian cells express two isoforms of UNG: UNG1, a mitochondrial isoform, and UNG2, a nuclear isoform. Both isoforms have identical C-terminal catalytic domains but differ in the N-terminal regulatory domain because of differential promoter usage and alternative splicing (9.Nilsen H. Otterlei M.

These isoforms are expressed highly during late G1/early S phase of the cell cycle and are reduced in late S phase through proteasome-mediated degradation (10.Fischer J.A. Muller-Weeks S.

UNG initiates BER by detecting and excising the damaged base, leaving an apyrimidinic site, which recruits an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (12.Carey D.C. Strauss P.R.

Indeed, UNG2 not only interacts with the core BER machinery via its N-terminal regulatory domain, but it also interacts with replication protein A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), two complexes that help orchestrate DNA replication and repair reactions in the cell (17.Schormann N.

Three major phosphorylation sites, Ser23, Thr60, and Ser64, conform to cyclin-dependent kinase consensus sites (Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro) and can be phosphorylated by CDK1 and CDK2 in vitro.

Additionally, phosphorylation of Thr60 and Ser64 creates a cyclin E/c-Myc-like phosphodegron that promotes polyubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (20.Welcker M. Clurman B.E.

Alzheimers Dis. 2011; 2011: 505607Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Notably, Thr60 in UNG2 conforms to a consensus sequence for GSK-3 (Ser/Thr-XXX-Ser(P)/Thr(P)) when Ser64 is phosphorylated. Originally identified in 1980 (29.Embi N. Rylatt D.B. Cohen P.

Although previous studies have explored the effects of the phosphorylation of UNG2 on its activity and regulation, the precise mechanism by which these posttranslational modifications control UNG2 function remain to be elucidated. In this work, we show that GSK-3 phosphorylates UNG2 at Thr60 and evaluate the effects of GSK-3 activity on UNG2 function, including repair of DNA lesions induced by floxuridine. UNG2 harbors an N-terminal domain containing several serine and threonine residues shown previously to be phosphorylated in cells, including Thr60 and Ser64. Although Ser64 conforms to a cyclin-dependent kinase consensus site, and cyclin-dependent kinases have been implicated in UNG2 phosphorylation at Ser64, the kinase that phosphorylates Thr60 has not been identified. Interestingly, when we performed a mass spectrometric analysis to identify UNG2 binding partners, we observed that two GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, co-precipitated with UNG2, thus raising the possibility that GSK-3 phosphorylates UNG2. This association was confirmed by showing that wild-type UNG2, tagged with the SFB triple epitope tag, co-precipitated with endogenous GSK-3α (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, mutation of Thr60 or Ser64 (the putative GSK-3 phosphorylation site and priming site, respectively) to alanine disrupted GSK-3 association with UNG2. To determine whether GSK-3 is capable of phosphorylating UNG2 at Thr60 in vitro, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged GSK-3β alone or with HA-tagged wild-type UNG2 or UNG2 T60A (Fig. 1B). In the sample containing only GSK-3β, 32P-labeled autophosphorylated GSK-3β was observed. In the samples in which GSK-3β was co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type and mutant UNG2, we observed 32P-labeled wild-type UNG2 (but not GSK-3β autophosphorylation). In contrast, UNG2 T60A was poorly phosphorylated by GSK-3β, demonstrating that Thr60 is a major GSK-3 phosphorylation site in UNG2. To evaluate UNG2 Thr60 phosphorylation in cells, we created expression vectors for UNG2 with an S epitope tag appended, in which the threonine and serine residues in the range of Thr60-Ser64 were mutated to alanines (S-UNG2 T60A, UNG2 S63A, and S-UNG2 S64A), as well as a vector with Ser64 mutated to aspartate (S-UNG2 S64D) as a potential phosphomimetic mutation. We screened a panel of commercially available phosphospecific antibodies to identify one that recognized phosphorylated wild-type UNG2 but not the UNG2 T60A mutant. S-tagged wild-type and mutant UNG2s were expressed in K562 cells, pulled down with S protein-agarose, and analyzed by Western blotting. The phosphospecific antibody detected a band corresponding to phosphorylated UNG2 in cells expressing wild-type UNG2 and UNG2 S63A but not in cells expressing UNG2 T60A (Fig. 1C). Importantly, no band was detected in UNG2 S64A, suggesting that Thr60 phosphorylation depends on priming Ser64 phosphorylation. This possibility is further supported by the observation that Thr60 phosphorylation is restored by the phosphomimetic mutation that converts Ser64 to aspartate (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the phosphorylation of UNG2 at Thr60 was dependent on GSK-3 activity, cells expressing wild-type S-UNG2 were treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor LY2090314 for 90 min prior to lysis, and S-UNG2 was pulled down with S protein-agarose. Treatment of cells with LY2090314 caused complete loss of the Thr60 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), indicating that UNG2 phosphorylation is dependent on GSK-3. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 system, we introduced frameshift mutations into all copies of the UNG gene in OVCAR-8 cells to prevent expression of both isoforms of UNG (Fig. 2), creating OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells. To evaluate the roles of Thr60 and Ser64 phosphorylation, we then created OVCAR-8ΔUNG cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged UNG2, UNG2 T60A, or UNG2 S64A. It should be noted that, although CRISPR/Cas9 knockout ablates expression of both the mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms of UNG (UNG1 and UNG2, respectively), the UNG2 expression plasmid restores expression of only the nuclear isoform UNG2. Two independent clones were chosen for each cell line and evaluated for UNG2 expression (Fig. 2). Importantly, although one wild-type UNG2 clone expresses a low level of UNG2 relative to unmodified OVCAR-8 parental cells, this amount of UNG2 fully rescued sensitivity to floxuridine (Fig. 9).FIGURE 9.Cells expressing UNG2 T60A and UNG2 S64A are more sensitive to floxuridine versus wild-type UNG2. Parental OVCAR-8 cells (WT OVCAR8) and OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3 1a-2 and 1a-6) or stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2 (UNG2 2a-3 and 2a-8), UNG2 T60A (T60A A5 and B5), or UNG2 S64A (UNG2 S64A 2a-2 and 2a-3) were tested for sensitivity to floxuridine by clonogenic assay (two independent clones for wild-type UNG2 and each UNG2 mutant). All cell lines were analyzed in parallel in the same experiment. However, for clarity of presentation, the T60A clones and the S64A clones were plotted separately versus the same data sets for parental OVCAR-8 cells (WT-OVCAR8) and OVCAR-8ΔUNG transfected with empty vector or wild-type UNG2. Data are representative of three independent experiments; mean ± S.D. of 3 replicates/dose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because a previous study found that phosphorylation of UNG2 on Thr60 and Ser64 creates a possible phosphodegron that promotes proteasomal degradation, we evaluated the stability of UNG2 T60A and UNG2 S64A mutants. OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2, UNG2 T60A, or UNG2 S64A were treated for up to 6 h with cycloheximide to block protein translation and lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to observe levels of HA-tagged wild-type and mutant UNG2 (Fig. 3A). Tubulin was included as a loading control. Although wild-type UNG2 was more than 60% degraded within 1 h of cycloheximide treatment, both UNG2 T60A and UNG2 S64A persisted significantly longer (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that the region surrounding Thr60 constitutes a phosphodegron and that Thr60 is phosphorylated prior to proteasome-mediated degradation (18.Hagen L.

Cell cycle-specific UNG2 phosphorylations regulate protein turnover, activity and association with RPA.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether UNG2 mutants exhibited altered glycosylase activity in vitro, we developed an assay to assess UNG activity in cell lysates. Using PCR, we generated three small 750-bp DNA fragments: a fragment in which all thymidines were substituted with 5-fluorouracil (synthesized with 5′-fluoro-2′-dUTP plus other dNTPs), a fragment in which all thymidines were substituted with uracil (synthesized with dUTP plus other dNTPs), and a control fragment (synthesized with dTTP plus other dNTPs). To analyze cleavage of these substrates, we prepared lysates from OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells transfected with empty vector (EV) or stably expressing equal levels of HA-tagged wild-type UNG2 (WT), UNG2 T60A, or UNG2 S64A (Fig. 4A). To demonstrate that 5-fluorouracil substrates were specifically cleaved by UNG2, the 5′-fluorouracil substrate and dTTP control substrate fragments were incubated with or without cell lysates from OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2 and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The signal from the 5-fluorouracil-substituted fragment was lost during the incubation, whereas the signal from the control fragment was not affected, demonstrating that 5-fluorouracil lesions are required for substrate degradation (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the UNG2 phosphomutants have an altered ability to cleave 5-fluorouracil- and uracil-substituted substrates, the substrate fragments were incubated with the cell lysates and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA substrates were not degraded in EV lysates but were degraded in lysates containing either wild-type or mutant UNG2 (Fig. 4, C and D), demonstrating that UNG2 is required for cleavage of the substrate. Analysis of the UNG2 mutants showed that UNG2 T60A and UNG2 S64A cleaved 5-fluorouracil-substituted DNA as effectively as wild-type UNG2 (Fig. 4C). However, both UNG2 mutants degraded the uracil-substituted DNA substrate at a significantly reduced rate relative to the wild type (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate that blocking phosphorylation of Thr60 and Ser64 does not affect UNG2 activity in cell lysates toward 5-fluoruracil lesions but does reduce the efficiency of uracil lesion repair. We used two approaches to assess whether UNG2 Thr60 or Ser64 phosphorylation affected subcellular localization. In one approach, OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2, UNG2 T60A, or UNG2 S64A were immunostained for the HA tag (Fig. 5A), and in the second approach, EGFP-tagged wild-type UNG2, UNG2 T60A, and UNG2 S64A were expressed in OVCAR-8 cells (Fig. 5B). In both cases, the mutant UNG2s localized to the nucleus with the same distribution as wild-type UNG2. We next examined the interaction of UNG2 with chromatin using isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) (37.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Cortez D. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of proteins at replication forks and in assembled chromatin using isolation of proteins on nascent DNA.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 594-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2 or UNG2 T60A were pulsed with EdU for 1 h, followed by 1–5 h of thymidine chase prior to cell fixation and lysis. EdU-containing DNA was labeled with biotin azide and pulled down with streptavidin-agarose to enrich for chromatin-associated proteins. Proteins associated with EdU-labeled DNA were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). Samples were also analyzed for chromatin-associated PCNA, a replication fork-associated protein, and histone H3, a persistently chromatin-bound protein, as controls. After 1 h of EdU pulse, both wild-type UNG2 and T60A UNG2 were associated with newly synthesized DNA at equal levels (Fig. 6A). Wild-type UNG2 was rapidly lost from EdU-labeled tracts of DNA following 1 h of thymidine chase, with ∼50% lost in 1 h and 70% lost in 5 h. In contrast, UNG2 T60A remained associated far more persistently, with at least 50% of UNG2 T60A still associated after 5 h of chase (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that GSK-3 regulates UNG2 interaction with chromatin and also suggest that PCNA, which interacts with UNG2, is not required for UNG2 association with chromatin following replication. Given that UNG2 T60A and UNG2 S64A removed uracil more slowly from DNA in cell lysates, we next asked whether they lead to increased DNA damage in cells. To address this question, we treated OVCAR-8ΔUNG cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type UNG2, UNG2 T60A, or UNG2 S64A with floxuridine, which leads to the accumulation of 5-fluorouracil and uracil lesions (6.Huehls A.M. Huntoon C.J. Joshi P.M. Baehr C.A. Wagner J.M. Wang X. Lee M.Y. Karnitz L.M.

Because the resolution of DNA damage can be easily monitored by assaying histone H2Ax phosphorylation on Ser139, a marker for DNA damage, we used a flow cytometry-based assay to track Ser(P)139-H2Ax in UNG2 mutant cells and in cells treated with GSK-3 inhibitor. Cells were treated for 24 h with 100 nm floxuridine and stained for Ser(P)139 H2Ax to assess the level of damage induced in each cell line. To assess the progress of DNA repair, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in medium without floxuridine following the 24-h floxuridine treatment. After 24 h of floxuridine exposure,"
https://openalex.org/W2554454954,"Some models of vaccination behavior imply that an individual’s willingness to vaccinate could be negatively correlated with the vaccination rate in her community. The rationale is that a higher community vaccination rate reduces the risk of contracting the vaccine-preventable disease and thus reduces the individual’s incentive to vaccinate. At the same time, as for many health-related behaviors, individuals may want to conform to the vaccination behavior of peers, counteracting a reduced incentive to vaccinate due to herd immunity. Currently there is limited empirical evidence on how individual vaccination decisions respond to the vaccination decisions of peers. In the fall of 2014, we used a rapid survey technology to ask a large sample of U.S. adults about their willingness to use a vaccine for Ebola. Respondents expressed a greater inclination to use the vaccine in a hypothetical scenario with a high community vaccination rate. In particular, an increase in the community vaccination rate from 10% to 90% had the same impact on reported utilization as a nearly 50% reduction in out-of-pocket cost. These findings are consistent with a tendency to conform with vaccination among peers, and suggest that policies promoting vaccination could be more effective than has been recognized."

Depletion of CAF1 in untransformed epithelial cells using siRNA was sufficient to recapitulate the increased motility and invasive phenotypes characteristic of transformed cells without activation of Src. Maintaining high levels of CAF1 by exogenous expression suppressed the increased cell motility and invasiveness phenotypes when Src was activated.

https://openalex.org/W2555766041,"Pho84, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) protein, is the main high-affinity Pi transceptor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although transport mechanisms have been suggested for other MFS members, the key residues and molecular events driving transport by Pi:H+ symporters are unclear. The current Pho84 transport model is based on the inward-facing occluded crystal structure of the Pho84 homologue PiPT in the fungus Piriformospora indica. However, this model is limited by the lack of experimental data on the regulatory residues for each stage of the transport cycle. In this study, an open, inward-facing conformation of Pho84 was used to study the release of Pi. A comparison of this conformation with the model for Pi release in PiPT revealed that Tyr179 in Pho84 (Tyr150 in PiPT) is not part of the Pi binding site. This difference may be due to a lack of detailed information on the Pi release step in PiPT. Molecular dynamics simulations of Pho84 in which a residue adjacent to Tyr179, Asp178, is protonated revealed a conformational change in Pho84 from an open, inward-facing state to an occluded state. Tyr179 then became part of the binding site as was observed in the PiPT crystal structure. The importance of Tyr179 in regulating Pi release was supported by site-directed mutagenesis and transport assays. Using trehalase activity measurements, we demonstrated that the release of Pi is a critical step for transceptor signaling.

Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Major facilitator superfamily.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, 64 crystal structures from 10 different families are available, andseveral of these structures were resolved in substrate-free and substrate-bound conformational states, therefore providing significant insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in nutrient transport (2.Quistgaard E.M. Löw C. Guettou F. Nordlund P. Understanding transport by the major facilitator superfamily (MFS): structures pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The key feature of MFS transporters is that transport across the membrane occurs via an alternating-access mechanism, the “rocker-switch” model (3.Law C.J. Maloney P.C. Wang D.-N. Ins and outs of major facilitator superfamily antiporters.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which involves a variety of distinct conformations including outward-open, substrate-bound occluded, and inward-open states. A limitation of the rocker-switch model, however, is that because it is based solely on rigid body rotation, it does not explain the presence of the occluded state. To account for this limitation, the “clamp-and-switch” model has recently been proposed (2.Quistgaard E.M. Löw C. Guettou F. Nordlund P. Understanding transport by the major facilitator superfamily (MFS): structures pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This model suggests that the conformational transition process is more dynamic than previously assumed and that the switch between conformations is driven by pore-lining helices that bend to form the occluded state and that allow for outward-facing to inward-facing rotations and vice versa. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is required for numerous cellular functions, such as synthesis of DNA and membrane lipids, intracellular signaling, and the generation of high-energy phosphate esters in ATP. Because of the central role of Pi, cells have adopted strategies to ensure rapid cellular responses to internal and external fluctuations in Pi levels that may disturb cellular phosphate homeostasis. Moreover, several Pi transporters have been shown to transport Pi by H+-coupled symport (4.Samyn D.R. Persson B.L. Inorganic phosphate and sulfate transport in S. cerevisiae.in: Ramos J. Sychrová H. Kschischo M. Yeast Membrane Transport. Springer International Publishing, Switzerland2016: 253-269Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Currently, the only available crystal structure of a Pi:H+ transporter is the eukaryotic Piriformospora indica transporter PiPT, which was resolved in the substrate-bound inward-facing occluded conformation (5.Pedersen B.P. Kumar H. Waight A.B. Risenmay A.J. Roe-Zurz Z. Chau B.H. Schlessinger A. Bonomi M. Harries W. Sali A. Johri A.K. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of a eukaryotic phosphate transporter.Nature. 2013; 496: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The current model for Pi:H+-transport is based on this crystal structure and describes three major conformational variations (i.e. substrate-docking, binding, and release) (5.Pedersen B.P. Kumar H. Waight A.B. Risenmay A.J. Roe-Zurz Z. Chau B.H. Schlessinger A. Bonomi M. Harries W. Sali A. Johri A.K. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of a eukaryotic phosphate transporter.Nature. 2013; 496: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A weakness of this model is that it lacks experimental data on the regulatory residues in each stage of the transport cycle. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 high-affinity phosphate transporter is a member of the phosphate:H+ symporter family (2.A.1.9) and is the main transporter during Pi-limiting conditions. Furthermore, Pho84 activates the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which senses and signals the uptake of external Pi in phosphate-starved cells. This dual functionality of Pho84 has led to its classification as a transceptor (6.Schothorst J. Kankipati H.N. Conrad M. Samyn D.R. Van Zeebroeck G. Popova Y. Rubio-Texeira M. Persson B.L. Thevelein J.M. Yeast nutrient transceptors provide novel insight in the functionality of membrane transporters.Curr. Genet. 2013; 59: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of Pho84 in the open inward-facing conformation has been created by homology modeling using the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter GlpT as a template (7.Lagerstedt J.O. Voss J.C. Wieslander A. Persson B.L. Structural modeling of dual-affinity purified Pho84 phosphate transporter.FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This model has been used to verify the roles of key residues in Pi binding, transport, and signaling (8.Samyn D.R. Ruiz-Pávon L. Andersson M.R. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. Mutational analysis of putative phosphate- and proton-binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 phosphate:H+ transceptor and its effect on signalling to the PKA and PHO pathways.Biochem. J. 2012; 445: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A comparison of the Pho84 and PiPT structures revealed a series of conserved residues in the Pi binding site (5.Pedersen B.P. Kumar H. Waight A.B. Risenmay A.J. Roe-Zurz Z. Chau B.H. Schlessinger A. Bonomi M. Harries W. Sali A. Johri A.K. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of a eukaryotic phosphate transporter.Nature. 2013; 496: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to Tyr150 in PiPT, Tyr179 in Pho84 is not in the binding site of the open inward-facing conformation. This difference may result from protonation/deprotonation of the nearby Asp178 residue (Asp149 in PiPT), which may affect the active conformation of the transporter. In addition, Asp178 has been shown to participate in H+-transfer (8.Samyn D.R. Ruiz-Pávon L. Andersson M.R. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. Mutational analysis of putative phosphate- and proton-binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 phosphate:H+ transceptor and its effect on signalling to the PKA and PHO pathways.Biochem. J. 2012; 445: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the protonation/deprotonation mechanism of regulating conformational changes in Pi:H+ transporters remains putative. In this study, we examined the role of Tyr179 on the Pi release step in the open inward-facing conformation of Pho84. To address the finer details of the release mechanism and to build on the transport model previously suggested for PiPT, we performed a series of unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations using different protonation states of Pi and Asp178. These simulations revealed that the protonation state of Asp178 alters the conformational state of Pho84. Upon protonation of Asp178, Tyr179 underwent a rotameric change to become part of the binding site. This agrees with the contact found between Pi and Tyr150 in the PiPT occluded inward-facing conformation. Based on SMD simulations, different Pi release routes were suggested. The lowest-energy release route was found with H2PO4− and deprotonated Asp178. We also confirmed the importance of Tyr179 in regulating Pi transport by a series of site-directed mutagenesis studies and biochemical assays. Finally, we measured trehalase activity to determine whether Tyr179 regulated PKA signaling, and we demonstrated that the release of Pi is critical for signaling. Altogether, our data contributes to a more complete picture of the dual functions of phosphate transceptors. The two-dimensional topology of Pho84 consists of a C-domain and an N-domain, each domain is made up of six transmembrane segments (Table 1), and both the N and C termini are oriented toward the cytoplasm. The three-dimensional in silico model displays a Mayan temple shape (3.Law C.J. Maloney P.C. Wang D.-N. Ins and outs of major facilitator superfamily antiporters.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) with a distinct N- and C-terminal domain organization and a clearly visible transport channel in the center of the protein (Fig. 1B).

Furthermore, the corresponding Tyr150 is proposed to be in the Pi binding site of the PiPT crystal structure. In the inward-open conformation of the Pho84 model, Tyr179 orients toward the cytoplasm and points away from the binding cavity. A growth spot test with strains expressing mutant alleles of PHO84 was performed to assess changes in the transport activity of Pho84 (Fig. 3). When compared with the wild-type strain (CEN.PK 113–7D PHO84-6xHis-2xmyc), the strains expressing Pho84 Tyr179-Ala and Tyr179-Gly exhibited drastic reductions in growth in low-Pi (LPi) conditions indicating that Tyr179 is crucial for transport. The growth of the strains expressing Pho84 Tyr179-Ser and Tyr179-Phe was equivalent to the growth of the Pho84 wild-type strain. In addition, in vivo radiolabeled Pi uptake assays showed a drastic reduction in transport activity in the Tyr179-Ala mutant and abolished activity in the Tyr179-Gly mutant (Fig. 4A). The Tyr179-Ser and Tyr179-Phe mutant strains had uptake activities equivalent to the uptake activity in the Pho84 wild-type strain. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the site-directed mutations yielded full-length recombinant proteins (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 3.Yeast growth spot test images were taken after 2 days of growth under HPi conditions and after 3 days of growth under LPi conditions.

The wild-type strain was analyzed under either high-Pi (HPi) or low-Pi (LPi) conditions (8.Samyn D.R. Ruiz-Pávon L. Andersson M.R. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. Mutational analysis of putative phosphate- and proton-binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 phosphate:H+ transceptor and its effect on signalling to the PKA and PHO pathways.Biochem.

Strains expressing Pho84 Tyr179-Ala and Tyr179-Gly exhibited pronounced increases in secreted phosphatase activity, which is consistent with the significantly reduced transport activities of these mutants. Strains expressing Pho84 Tyr179-Ser and Tyr179-Phe had secreted phosphatase activities similar to the wild-type level. These results show that full-length expressed, plasma membrane localized, non-functional Pho84 suppresses rAPase activity resulting in less activity relative to the activity in pho84Δ (9.Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Phosphate transport and sensing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data for Tyr179 clearly shows that this residue plays a crucial role in Pi transport. By introducing a side chain that is relatively inert, such as a residue that is non-charged, weakly polar, or lacking an aromatic residue, transport activity was largely abolished. In contrast, by introducing side chains with increased polarity (Tyr179-Ser) or hydrophobicity (Tyr179-Phe), transport activity was restored to the wild-type level. A protonation/deprotonation cycle has been shown to be crucial for the functionality of many transporters. The Escherichia coli lactose permease LacY serves as a paradigm for understanding the importance of protonation/deprotonation in the transport cycle that begins in the outward-open conformation and requires functional protonation to facilitate substrate binding (10.Stroud R.M. Transmembrane transporters: an open and closed case.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1445-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MD simulations of the protonation/deprotonation of Glu325 showed significant changes in the structure leading to a transition from the inward-facing to the occluded conformation (11.Andersson M. Bondar A.-N. Freites J.A. Tobias D.J. Kaback H.R. White S.H. Proton-coupled dynamics in lactose permease.Structure. 2012; 20: 1893-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MD simulations of the E. coli sugar fucose:H+ symporter FucP also showed that protonation of Glu135 is required to trigger conversion from the outward-open to the inward-open conformation (12.Liu Y. Ke M. Gong H. Protonation of Glu(135) facilitates the outward-to-inward structural transition of fucose transporter.Biophys. J. 2015; 109: 542-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These examples show that protonation/deprotonation events are crucial to the alternating-access dynamics of MFS transporters. In a previous site-directed mutagenesis study, the Pho84 residue Asp178 was mutated to Glu and Asn, and Asn was found to mimic a protonated aspartate (8.Samyn D.R. Ruiz-Pávon L. Andersson M.R. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. Mutational analysis of putative phosphate- and proton-binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 phosphate:H+ transceptor and its effect on signalling to the PKA and PHO pathways.Biochem. J. 2012; 445: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that protonation of Asp178 plays a role in a late phosphate release step of the transport cycle. To investigate this hypothesis, a series of unrestrained MD simulations were performed on Pho84 models with protonated or deprotonated Asp178. Pi was inserted in the Pho84 binding site at approximately equal distances from Lys492 and Asp178. This allowed us to investigate the roles of these residues on Pi binding and on proton transfer. In addition, simulations were conducted using different protonation states of Pi (H3PO4, H2PO4−, and HPO42−) to resolve the role of charge balance in the binding site and its influence on the energetics of cytosolic release of Pi (see supplemental Table S1 for information on the number of molecules in each system and the denotations that are used throughout this paper). All of the systems were subsequently subjected to 30 ns of equilibration to reach stable energy, temperature, and density values (supplemental Figs. S1–S16). Equilibration of the transmembrane helices (Fig. 1) in the 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer were verified by recording root mean square deviation values over time for backbone (N, Cα, and C) atoms. These values reached a plateau after ∼15 ns with values of 3.5 Å or less (supplemental Fig. S17). Extracted snapshots of the Pho84 binding site after 30 ns of equilibration revealed the position of Pi in the binding site, the location of residues important for Pi binding, and the location of proton transfer (Fig. 6). Analysis of the position of H3PO4 and its variations in distance over time (Fig. 6, A1, and supplemental Fig. S18) revealed stable interactions between H3PO4, Lys492, and Asp178. Models using H2PO4− or HPO42− revealed weakened interactions with Asp178 due to repulsion between mono- and divalent species of Pi and the deprotonated state of Asp178 (Fig. 6, B1 and C1, and supplemental Fig. S18). Moreover, systems with either H2PO4− or HPO42− in the binding site and a protonated state of Asp178 (Fig. 6, B2 and C2, supplemental Figs. S18 and S19) revealed the formation of a hydrogen bond between Asp178 and the adjacent Asp76 residue resulting in less distance between helix I that harbors Asp76 and helix IV that harbors Asp178. Similar interactions were seen in the absence of Pi indicating that the proton is not donated by Pi (supplemental Fig. S19). These data confirm the role of Asp178 in proton-coupling (8.Samyn D.R. Ruiz-Pávon L. Andersson M.R. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. Mutational analysis of putative phosphate- and proton-binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho84 phosphate:H+ transceptor and its effect on signalling to the PKA and PHO pathways.Biochem. J. 2012; 445: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the symport of protons through Pho84 occurs at a Pi:H+ stoichiometry of 1:3 (13.Borst-Pauwels G.W. Mutual interaction of ion uptake and membrane potential.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1145: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The largest shift in the distance between Asp178 and Asp76 upon protonation of Asp178 was observed for H2PO4− rather than for HPO42− suggesting that H2PO4− has the largest impact on the conformational flexibility of Pho84. Simulations with H3PO4 in the binding site and protonated Asp178 resulted in a helical rotation that affected helices I and IV such that Asp76, rather than Asp178, bound to Pi (Fig. 6, A2, and supplemental Fig. S18). These data demonstrate that the charge distribution in the Pho84 binding site regulates the active conformational state of Pho84. In addition to the observed roles of Asp178 in regulating Pi binding and proton-coupling, the change in the conformational state of helix IV in Pho84 that occurred upon protonation of Asp178 led to Tyr179 becoming more accessible for Pi binding (Fig. 6, B2 and C2, and supplemental Fig. S20). X-ray crystallographic analysis of PiPT in the substrate-bound inward-facing occluded conformation shows that the corresponding tyrosine (Tyr150) is involved in Pi binding (5.Pedersen B.P. Kumar H. Waight A.B. Risenmay A.J. Roe-Zurz Z. Chau B.H. Schlessinger A. Bonomi M. Harries W. Sali A. Johri A.K. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of a eukaryotic phosphate transporter.Nature. 2013; 496: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in a comparison of Fig. 6, panels A1/A2 versus panels B1/B2/C1/C2, the shift in the position of Tyr179 as correlated to the protonation state of Asp178 was not as prominent for models that incorporated H3PO4. We investigated the stability of salt bridges involving Asp76 and Asp79 and their link to Pho84 conformational changes (Fig. 6). We found stable contacts between Asp76-Arg267 and Asp79-Arg168 in all of the simulations with the exception of the model incorporating H3PO4 and protonated Asp178 in which Asp178 and Asp76 exchanged positions (Fig. 6, A2). Moreover, a Pho84 simulation without Pi in the binding site showed a disruption of the Asp79-Arg168 salt bridge after 15 ns of equilibration. Because protonation of Asp178 led to a stable Asp79-Arg168 salt bridge, we suggest that the presence of Pi in the binding site may increase the conformational stability of Pho84 (data not shown). A series of SMD simulations were performed to investigate alternative Pi release routes in Pho84. For each model investigated, five separate SMD simulations were performed to sample the configurational space provided by the flexible Lys492 residue and to identify possible Pho84 exit routes using various protonation states of both Asp178 and Pi. Although, according to the Jarzynski equality method that requires a large number of samplings to be performed (14.Hummer G. Szabo A.

Calculation of force profiles (supplemental Figs. S21–S22), work (supplemental Figs. S23–S24), as well as hydrogen bond contacts between residues and Pi (supplemental Tables S2–S5 and Figs. S25–S28) and water molecules and Pi (supplemental Fig. S29 –S30) along the series of routes populated allowed for a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of Pi release in Pho84. The steered MD simulations suggested that the lowest-energy release route involved H2PO4− and deprotonated Asp178 (supplemental Figs. S23–S34). SMD (Fig. 7) and unrestrained simulations demonstrated that protonation of Asp178 resulted in a rotation of helix IV, which increased the work required to release Pi via this route. The increased work required could be a result of the increase in hydrogen bond contacts and the number of water molecules encountered by H2PO4− when Asp178 is protonated. A 30-ns unrestrained simulation showed that rotation of Tyr179 into the binding site made it more accessible for Pi binding. This increased binding between Pi and Tyr179 upon protonation of Asp178 indicated that Pho84 regulates its conformational state preceding Pi release. The lowest-energy route for the release of H2PO4− from Pho84 involves helices IV and X"

Recent research supports the view that degradation of irreparable O6-mG-T mispair-containing DNA by the MMR system and CAF-1-dependent packaging of the newly replicated DNA into nucleosomes are two concomitant processes that interact with each other. Here, we studied whether CAF-1 modulates the activity of the MMR system in the cytotoxic response to Sn1-type methylating agents.

https://openalex.org/W2554281660,"Left atrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) are well-known predictors for arrhythmia recurrence after AF catheter ablation (LRAF). In this study, by using pathway enrichment analysis of GWAS data, we tested the hypothesis that genetic pathways associated with these phenotypes are also associated with LRAF.Samples from 660 patients with paroxysmal (n = 370) or persistent AF (n = 290) undergoing de-novo AF catheter ablation were genotyped for ~1,000,000 SNPs. SNPs found to be significantly associated with left atrial diameter (LAD) or AF type were used for gene-based association tests in a systematic biological Knowledge-based mining system for Genome-wide Genetic studies (KGG). Associated genes were tested for pathway enrichment using WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt), the Gene Annotation Tool to Help Explain Relationships (GATHER) and the databases provided by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). In a second step, the association of consistently enriched pathways and LRAF was tested.By using sequential 7-day Holter ECGs, LRAF between 3 and 12 months was observed in 48% and was associated with LAD (B = 1.801, 95% CI 0.760-2.841, p = 1.0E-3) and persistent AF (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.567-2.931, p = 2.0E-6). WebGestalt (adj. p = 2.7E-22) and GATHER (adj. p = 5.2E-3) identified the calcium signaling pathway (hsa04020) as the only consistently enriched pathway for LAD, while the extracellular matrix (ECM) -receptor interaction pathway (hsa04512) was the only consistently enriched pathway for AF type (adj. p = 2.1E-15 in WebGestalt; adj. p = 9.3E-4 in GATHER). Both calcium signaling (adj. p = 2.2E-17 in WebGestalt; adj. p = 2.9E-2 in GATHER) and ECM-receptor interaction (adj. p = 1.2E-10 in WebGestalt; adj. p = 2.9E-2 in GATHER) were significantly associated with LRAF.Calcium signaling and ECM-receptor interaction pathways are associated with LAD and AF type and, in turn, with LRAF.

Using the double in vivo biotinylation (DIB) technique, recently developed in our laboratory, turnover of erythrocyte cohorts of different age groups during AIHA was monitored. Results indicate a significant decline in the proportion of reticulocytes, young and intermediate age groups of erythrocytes, but a significant increase in the proportion of old erythrocytes in blood circulation. Binding of the autoantibody was relatively higher to the young erythrocytes and higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also seen in these cells. Erythropoietic activity in the bone marrows and the spleen of AIHA induced mice was examined by monitoring the relative proportion of erythroid cells at various stages of differentiation in these organs. Cells at different stages of differentiation were enumerated flow cytometrically by double staining with anti-Ter119 and anti-transferrin receptor (CD71) monoclonal antibodies. Erythroid cells in bone marrow declined significantly in AIHA induced mice, erythroblast C being most affected (50% decline). Erythroblast C also recorded high intracellular ROS level along with increased levels of membrane-bound autoantibody. No such decline was observed in spleen. A model of AIHA has been proposed indicating that binding of autoantibodies may not be a sufficient condition for destruction of erythroid cells in bone marrow and in blood circulation. Last stage of erythropoietic differentiation in bone marrow and early stages of erythrocytes in blood circulation are specifically susceptible to removal in AIHA."
https://openalex.org/W2555054490,"Extravasation of macrophages and formation of lipid-laden foam cells are key events in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The degradation of atherogenic lipoproteins subsequently leads to alterations in cellular lipid metabolism that influence inflammatory signaling. Especially sphingolipids and ceramides are known to be involved in these processes. We therefore analyzed monocyte derived macrophages during differentiation and after loading with enzymatically (eLDL) and oxidatively (oxLDL) modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL).Primary human monocytes were isolated from healthy, normolipidemic blood donors using leukapheresis and counterflow elutriation. On the fourth day of MCSF-induced differentiation eLDL (40 μg/ml) or oxLDL (80 μg/ml) were added for 48h. Lipid species were analyzed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry. Taqman qPCR was performed to investigate transcriptional changes in enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Furthermore, membrane lipids were studied using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.MCSF dependent phagocytic differentiation of blood monocytes had only minor effects on the sphingolipid composition. Levels of total sphingomyelin and total ceramide remained unchanged, while lactosylceramides, cholesterylesters and free cholesterol decreased. At the species level most ceramide species showed a reduction upon phagocytic differentiation. Loading with eLDL preferentially increased cellular cholesterol while loading with oxLDL increased cellular ceramide content. Activation of the salvage pathway with a higher mRNA expression of acid and neutral sphingomyelinase, neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor and glucosylceramidase as well as increased surface expression of SMPD1 were identified as potentially underlying mechanisms. Moreover, flow-cytometric analysis revealed a higher cell-surface-expression of ceramide, lactosylceramide (CDw17), globotriaosylceramide (CD77), dodecasaccharide-ceramide (CD65s) and GM1 ganglioside upon oxLDL loading. ApoE in contrast to apoA-I preferentially bound to the ceramide enriched surfaces of oxLDL loaded cells. Confocal microscopy showed a co-localization of acid sphingomyelinase with ceramide rich membrane microdomains.eLDL leads to the formation of lipid droplets and preferentially induces cholesterol/sphingomyelin rich membrane microdomains while oxLDL promotes the development of cholesterol/ceramide rich microdomains via activation of the salvage pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2554584002,"In closed-canopy forests, gap formation and closure are thought to be major drivers of forest dynamics. Crown defoliation by insects, however, may also influence understory resource levels and thus forest dynamics. We evaluate the effect of a forest tent caterpillar outbreak on understory light availability, soil nutrient levels and tree seedling height growth in six sites with contrasting levels of canopy defoliation in a hardwood forest in northern lower Michigan. We compared resource levels and seedling growth of six hardwood species before, during and in the three years after the outbreak (2008-2012). Canopy openness increased strongly during the forest tent caterpillar outbreak in the four moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites. Total inorganic soil nitrogen concentrations increased in response to the outbreak in moderately and severely defoliated sites. The increase in total inorganic soil nitrogen was driven by a strong increase in soil nitrate, and tended to become stronger with increasing site defoliation. Seedling height growth increased for all species in the moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites, either during the outbreak year or in the year after the outbreak. Growth increases did not become stronger with increasing site defoliation, but were strongest in a moderately defoliated site with high soil nutrient levels. Growth increases tended to be strongest for the shade intolerant species Fraxinus americana and Prunus serotina, and the shade tolerant species Ostrya virginiana. The strong growth response of F. americana and P. serotina suggests that recurring forest tent caterpillar outbreaks may facilitate the persistence of shade intolerant species in the understory in the absence of canopy gaps. Overall, our results suggest that recurrent canopy defoliation resulting from cyclical forest insect outbreaks may be an additional driver of dynamics in temperate closed-canopy forests."
https://openalex.org/W2549753261,"Monoamine oxidases (MAO), downstream targets of glucocorticoid, maintain the turnover and homeostasis of monoamine neurotransmitters; yet, its pathophysiological role in monoamine deficiency, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation remains controversial. Protective effects of M30, a brain selective MAO inhibitor with iron-chelating antioxidant properties, have been shown in models of neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to examine the neuroprotective mechanism of M30 against depressive-like behavior induced by corticosterone (CORT). Sprague-Dawley rats were given CORT subcutaneous injections with or without concomitant M30 administration for two weeks. CORT-treated rats exhibited depressive-like behavior with significant elevated levels of MAO activities, serotonin turnover, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus with significant losses of synaptic proteins when compared to the control. The expression and activity of cytokine-responsive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), a catabolic enzyme of serotonin and tryptophan, was significantly increased in the CORT-treated group with lowered levels of serotonin. Besides, CORT markedly reduced dendritic length and spine density. Remarkably, M30 administration neutralized the aberrant changes in the hippocampus and prevented the induction of depressive-like behavior induced by CORT. Our results suggest that M30 is neuroprotective against CORT-induced depression targeting elevated MAO activities that cause oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, resulting in IDO-1 activation, serotonin deficiency and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2551318538,"Hydrogen sulfide is a signaling molecule that plays important roles in several physiological processes, and its methylation product trimethylsulfonium (TMS) is a natural constituent of human urine that could serve as a biomarker for hydrogen sulfide. In vitro studies showed that the enzyme indole-ethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) is responsible for the production of trimethylsulfonium as well as its selenium analogue trimethylselenonium (TMSe). Marked inter-individual variability in TMSe production is associated with genetic polymorphisms in the INMT gene, but it remains unclear whether these polymorphisms affect substrate specificity or general enzymatic activity. Therefore, we explore the association between the TMS and TMSe production phenotypes. Caucasian volunteers were recruited and grouped according to their TMSe status into “TMSe producers” and “TMSe non-producers”, and morning urine samples were collected over 5 consecutive days from each volunteer. A total of 125 urine samples collected from 25 volunteers (13 TMSe producers and 12 TMSe non-producers) were analyzed for total selenium and total sulfur using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), trimethylselenonium using HPLC/ICPMS, and trimethylsulfonium using HPLC/electrospray ionization—triple quadrupole—mass spectrometry (ESI-QQQ-MS). Although there was no correlation between TMS and TMSe urinary levels within the “TMSe producers” group, the “TMSe producers” had urinary levels of TMS 10-fold higher than those of the “TMSe non-producers” (P < 0.001). This result indicates that stratification according to TMSe status or genotype is crucial for the correct interpretation of urinary TMS as a possible biomarker for hydrogen sulfide body pools."
https://openalex.org/W2553527397,"Accurately interpreting other's emotions through facial expressions has important adaptive values for social interactions. However, due to the stereotypical social perception of overweight individuals as carefree, humorous, and light-hearted, the body weight of those with whom we interact may have a systematic influence on our emotion judgment even though it has no relevance to the expressed emotion itself. In this experimental study, we examined the role of body weight in faces on the affective perception of facial expressions. We hypothesized that the weight perceived in a face would bias the assessment of an emotional expression, with overweight faces generally more likely to be perceived as having more positive and less negative expressions than healthy weight faces. Using two-alternative forced-choice perceptual decision tasks, participants were asked to sort the emotional expressions of overweight and healthy weight facial stimuli that had been gradually morphed across six emotional intensity levels into one of two categories-""neutral vs. happy"" (Experiment 1) and ""neutral vs. sad"" (Experiment 2). As predicted, our results demonstrated that overweight faces were more likely to be categorized as happy (i.e., lower happy decision threshold) and less likely to be categorized as sad (i.e., higher sad decision threshold) compared to healthy weight faces that had the same levels of emotional intensity. The neutral-sad decision threshold shift was negatively correlated with participant's own fear of becoming fat, that is, those without a fear of becoming fat more strongly perceived overweight faces as sad relative to those with a higher fear. These findings demonstrate that the weight of the face systematically influences how its emotional expression is interpreted, suggesting that being overweight may make emotional expressions appear more happy and less sad than they really are."
https://openalex.org/W2549954209,"ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to uni-directionally transport substrates across cell membrane. ATP hydrolysis occurs at the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimer interface of ABC transporters, whereas substrate translocation takes place at the translocation pathway between the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is more than 30 angstroms away from the NBD dimer interface. This raises the question of how the hydrolysis energy released at NBDs is ""transmitted"" to trigger the conformational changes at TMDs. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we studied the post-hydrolysis state of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD. Totally 3-μs MD trajectories demonstrate a predominantly asymmetric arrangement of the NBD dimer interface, with the ADP-bound site disrupted and the ATP-bound site preserved in most of the trajectories. TMDs response to ATP hydrolysis by separation of the L-loops and opening of the cytoplasmic gate II, indicating that hydrolysis of one ATP could facilitate substrate translocation by opening the cytoplasmic end of translocation pathway. It was also found that motions of the L-loops and the cytoplasmic gate II are coupled with each other through a contiguous interaction network involving a conserved Asn83 on the extended stretch preceding TM3 helix plus the cytoplasmic end of TM2/6/7 helix bundle. These findings entail a TMD-NBD communication mechanism for type II ABC importers."
https://openalex.org/W2555756903,"Many assays have been developed for the detection of influenza virus which is an important respiratory pathogen. Development of these assays commonly involves the use of human clinical samples for validation of their performance. However, clinical samples can be difficult to obtain, deteriorate over time, and be inconsistent in composition. The goal of this study was to develop a simulated respiratory secretion (SRS) that could act as a surrogate for clinical samples. To this end, we determined the effects major respiratory secretion components (Na+, K+, Ca2+, cells, albumin IgG, IgM, and mucin) have on the performance of influenza assays including both nucleic acid amplification and rapid antigen assays. Minimal effects on the molecular assays were observed for all of the components tested, except for serum derived human IgG, which suppressed the signal of the rapid antigen assays. Using dot blots we were able to show anti-influenza nucleoprotein IgG antibodies are common in human respiratory samples. We composed a SRS that contained mid-point levels of human respiratory sample components and studied its effect compared to phosphate buffered saline and virus negative clinical sample matrix on the Veritor, Sofia, CDC RT-PCR, Simplexa, cobas Liat, and Alere i influenza assays. Our results demonstrated that a SRS can interact with a variety of test methods in a similar manner to clinical samples with a similar impact on test performance."
https://openalex.org/W2554566848,"The morphology and distribution of lateral line neuromasts vary between ecomorphological types of anuran tadpoles, but little is known about how this structural variability contributes to differences in lateral-line mediated behaviors. Previous research identified distinct differences in one such behavior, positive rheotaxis towards the source of a flow, in two tadpole species, the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis; type 1) and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana; type 4). Because these two species had been tested under different flow conditions, we re-evaluated these findings by quantifying flow-sensing behaviors of bullfrog tadpoles in the same flow field in which X. laevis tadpoles had been tested previously. Early larval bullfrog tadpoles were exposed to flow in the dark, in the presence of a discrete light cue, and after treatment with the ototoxin gentamicin. In response to flow, tadpoles moved downstream, closer to a side wall, and higher in the water column, but they did not station-hold. Tadpoles exhibited positive rheotaxis, but with long latencies, low to moderate accuracy, and considerable individual variability. This is in contrast to the robust, stereotyped station-holding and accurate rheotaxis of X. laevis tadpoles. The presence of a discrete visual cue and gentamicin treatment altered spatial positioning and disrupted rheotaxis in both tadpole species. Species differences in lateral-line mediated behaviors may reflect differences in neuromast number and distribution, life history, or perceptual salience of other environmental cues."
