Increase in cell number leads to the formation of beating, fiber-like masses. It appears that direct physical contact is necessary for attainment of synchronous contractions."

https://openalex.org/W2086472548,"Ordering of boron in a feldspar crystallographic site T1(0) has been found in reedmergnerite, which has silicon-oxygen and sodium-oxygen distances comparable to those in isostructural low albite. If a simple ionic model is assumed, calculated bond strengths yield a considerable charge imbalance in reedmergnerite, an indication of the inadequacy of the model with respect to these complex structures and of the speculative nature of conclusions based on such a model."

https://openalex.org/W2093073276,"The frequency of visible mutations induced by x-rays, phosphorus-32, and sulfur-35 was calculated in six hexaploid Triticum species. The species with spelted ears and winter habit showed a much lower mutation rate than the free-threshing, spring wheats."

https://openalex.org/W1982136743,"Results, obtained with a photoelectric refractometer and sucrose solutions, indicate that a concentrated surface layer rapidly builds up when sucrose solutions are allowed to stand under conditions where evaporation can occur from the surface. The phenomenon is similar to the formation of a cool boundary film which has recently been shown to occur on the surface of the ocean."
