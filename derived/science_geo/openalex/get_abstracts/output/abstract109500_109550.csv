https://openalex.org/W1842434515,"A novel form of an ATP-regulated, oligomeric, Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) has been purified from the cytosol of the murine macrophage-like cell line P388D1. The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential column chromatography on octyl-Sepharose, ATP-agarose, Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and hydroxyapatite FPLC. The resulting enzyme preparation was purified over 400,000-fold with a final specific activity of approximately 5 mumol/min/mg using a mixed micelle assay system of Triton X-100 and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC). The purified enzyme was Ca(2+)-independent and did not show a preference for either sn-2 arachidonic acid or sn-1 alkyl-ether containing phospholipids when utilizing mixed micelles as substrate. It was found to hydrolyze dipalmitoyl-PC approximately 4-fold faster than 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-PC and approximately 15-fold faster than 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonyl-PC. Triton X-100 increased the P388D1 iPLA2 activity with optimal activity found at a Triton/phospholipid molar ratio of 4:1. The purified enzyme was activated 2-6-fold by ATP as well as other di- and triphosphate nucleosides. This activation was sensitive to the concentration of Triton X-100 present in the assay. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis carried out on the purified enzyme yielded a single major band at a molecular weight of about 80,000. However, radiation inactivation experiments, carried out on the cell homogenate, demonstrated a target size of 337 +/- 25 kDa, indicating that the catalytically active iPLA2 exists as a large oligomeric complex, either through self-aggregation or association of the enzyme with other proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1510434099,"To elucidate the mechanism causing the transient accumulation of intracellular cAMP in the FRTL-5 thyroid cell line, the short-term effect of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity was studied. Together with an increase in cAMP levels, TSH produced a significant increase in total PDE activity as early as 3 min, with a maximal stimulation reached after 15 min. This short-term increase in PDE activity was dependent on the TSH concentration (ED50 = 4 x 10(-11) M TSH). Forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP produced an even larger stimulation than that produced by TSH, suggesting that the effect of TSH is mediated by cAMP. To determine the properties of the PDE forms activated by TSH, antibodies specific for the cAMP-PDEs were used to immunoprecipitate the PDEs present in control cells, and cells incubated for 15 min in the presence of 10 nM TSH. Comparison of the activity recovered in the immunoprecipitation pellets demonstrated that TSH produced more than a 2.5-fold increase in the cAMP-PDE form(s) recognized by this antibody. Conversely, the activity remaining in the supernatants was not affected by the TSH treatment. Most of the activity recovered in the immunoprecipitation pellets (90%) was inhibited by 10 microM Rolipram, an inhibitor specific for the high affinity cAMP-PDEs. No TSH stimulation of the Rolipram-insensitive PDE activity could be observed under these conditions. Western blot analyses with two different cAMP-PDE specific antibodies showed that a 15-min stimulation with TSH induced the appearance of a new band with electrophoretic mobility slower than the polypeptide present in unstimulated cells. The appearance of this band did not require ongoing protein synthesis because it occurred in the presence of cycloheximide. Metabolic [32P]orthophosphate labeling of intact FRTL-5 cells indicated that the TSH treatment caused an increased 32P incorporation into a polypeptide that co-purified with the stimulated PDE activity and had an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the cAMP-PDE. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, elicited a potentiation of the TSH-stimulated PDE activity. The stimulating of a PDE with the same immunological properties and Rolipram sensitivity as the cAMP-PDE stimulated by TSH in the intact cells was reproduced, in a cell-free system, by incubating soluble extracts from FRTL-5 cells with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data provide evidence that TSH produces a rapid activation of a cAMP-PDE in the FRTL-5 cells through a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1493800420,"Gestational exposure to ethanol causes defects in neuronal migration, fasciculation, and synaptogenesis, developmental events that depend on the patterned expression and function of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) increases cell-cell adhesion and promotes cell clustering in proliferating neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells by strongly inducing N-CAM and L1. Here we show that concentrations of ethanol achieved during social drinking inhibit hOP-1-induced cell clustering without affecting cell proliferation, the induction and cell surface expression of N-CAM and L1, or the alternative splicing and sialylation of N-CAM. This inhibition was reproduced by other alcohols in proportion to their chain length, but not by teratogenic anticonvulsants or phenylalanine. Ethanol inhibition of hOP-1 morphogenesis was inversely proportional to the concentration of hOP-1 and, hence, to the levels of N-CAM and L1. Low concentrations of ethanol (IC50 5-10 mM) inhibited cell-cell adhesion in hOP-1-treated cells, and this action too was reproduced more potently by propanol and butanol. Ethanol may perturb brain and skeletal development by inhibiting CAM-mediated cell-cell interactions."

We have shown both by in planta and ex planta studies that hevein is involved in the coagulation of latex by bringing together rubber particles. This polyvalent bridging between hevein and rubber particles is mediated by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and involves a receptor glycoprotein of 22 kDa, which is localized on the surface of the rubber particles. The proposed role of hevein helps us to understand the mechanism of coagulation of latex and assigns a physiological intracellular function to one of the smallest lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1508055754,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent mitogen for bone cells and is a constituent of the bone matrix. We have found that osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells expressed bFGF mRNA transcript of 4.5 kilobases (kb). We examined factors that regulate the expression of bFGF mRNA and protein in MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with bFGF (10 nM) for 4-48 h induced another 7-kb bFGF transcript at 4 h. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with TGF beta (10 ng/ml) also induced the 7-kb transcript of bFGF mRNA. In contrast, heparin, parathyroid hormone, and interleukin-1 had no effect on bFGF mRNA. Western blot analyses revealed that MC3T3-E1 cells produced a 24-kDa bFGF protein, which was increased by TGF beta. Immunofluorescence showed that bFGF protein was localized to the cytoplasm in serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment of these cultures with medium containing fetal calf serum or TGF beta caused increased cytoplasmic staining for bFGF and marked shape change. Furthermore, in the cells treated with TGF beta there was both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for the protein. These data demonstrate that bFGF mRNA and protein are expressed in osteoblastic cells and are regulated by treatment with TGF beta and bFGF. Production of bFGF may be important as an autocrine and paracrine mediator of bone cell replication, differentiation, and function."
https://openalex.org/W1800101419,"The short half-life of c-myc mRNA is influenced by sequences in the 3'-untranslated region and the C-terminal part of the coding region. In cell-free extracts, a polysomal protein binds to RNA corresponding to the coding region stability determinant. This and other observations suggest that the protein is bound to polysome-associated c-myc mRNA and protects the mRNA from a ribosome-associated endoribonuclease (Bernstein, P.L., Herrick, D.J., Prokipcak, R.D., and Ross, J. (1992) Genes & Dev. 6, 642-654). Here, we describe a four-step purification of the binding protein: solubilization from ribosomes, ammonium sulfate precipitation, RNA affinity chromatography, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The 70-kDa protein can be renatured from solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate or organic solvents, greatly facilitating its purification. Protein binding to c-myc coding region RNA is blocked by diamide and N-ethylmaleimide, indicating a requirement for sulfhydryl groups. The protein also binds to N-myc coding region RNA but with approximately 5-fold lower affinity than to the comparable c-myc region. Excess c-myc competitor RNA induces 8-fold destabilization of c-myc mRNA in cell-free mRNA decay extracts. In contrast, N-myc coding region competitor RNA has no effect on c-myc mRNA half-life. Therefore, the protein we have purified probably affects c-myc mRNA metabolism with high specificity."

https://openalex.org/W1605797637,"Transcription of the S14 gene in primary hepatocytes is stimulated in response to increased carbohydrate metabolism. We have demonstrated previously that a 30-base pair (bp) segment of the S14 gene from -1457 to -1428 is a carbohydrate response element (ChoRE). This element contains a (5')CACGTG motif that is essential for control. DNase I footprinting experiments with liver nuclear extract revealed two factors binding within the S14 ChoRE. In transient transfection experiments, mutation of the upstream site between -1457 and -1450 did not affect the response to elevated glucose, whereas the downstream 21-bp site between -1448 and -1428 was sufficient to mediate the glucose induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the hepatic factor binding to this site in vitro is closely related or identical to the major late transcription factor (MLTF). However, replacement of the 21-bp S14 ChoRE with the authentic MLTF binding site from the adenovirus major late promoter failed to elicit the glucose response. By systematically exchanging bases between the functional S14 and nonresponsive adenovirus sites, the sequence (5')CACGTGNNNGCC was found to be essential for carbohydrate regulation. A segment containing this specific motif from the rat fatty acid synthase gene, another carbohydrate-responsive gene in hepatocytes, conferred a carbohydrate response when linked to the S14 promoter. Thus, the context of the CACGTG motif provides the specificity for regulation by carbohydrate metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1527157622,"The myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and the MARCKS-related protein (MRP) are members of a distinct family of protein kinase C (PKC) substrates that also bind calmodulin in a manner regulated by phosphorylation by PKC. The kinetics of PKC-mediated phosphorylation and the calmodulin binding properties of intact, recombinant MARCKS and MRP were investigated and compared with previous studies of synthetic peptides spanning the PKC phosphorylation site/calmodulin binding domains (PSCBD) of these proteins. Both MARCKS and MRP were high affinity substrates for the catalytic fragment of PKC, and their phosphorylation occurred with positive cooperativity (MARCKS: S0.5 = 100 nM, KH = 1.43; MRP: S0.5 = 238 nM, KH = 1.72). These affinities are similar to the values determined from studies of their respective PSCBD peptides. Two-dimensional mapping of MRP and its synthetic PSCBD peptide yielded identical patterns of tryptic phosphopeptides, indicating that, as in the case of MARCKS, all of the PKC phosphorylation sites in MRP lie within the 24-amino acid PSCBD. Sequence analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides revealed that the first and third, but not the second, serines in the MRP PSCBD were phosphorylated by PKC. Both MARCKS and MRP bound dansyl-calmodulin with high affinity, with a Kapp of 4.6 and 9.5 nM, respectively. Phosphorylation of MARCKS and MRP by PKC disrupted the protein-calmodulin complexes, with half-lives of 4.0 and 3.5 min, respectively. These studies suggest that intact, recombinant MARCKS and MRP are accurately modeled by their synthetic PSCBD peptides with respect to PKC phosphorylation kinetics and their phosphorylation-dependent calmodulin binding properties."

https://openalex.org/W1525024061,"Most nuclearly encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with an amino-terminal leader peptide that is cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). Purified rat liver MPP, like the Neurospora and yeast enzymes, consists of two nonidentical subunits, alpha (55 kDa) and beta (50 kDa). To confirm the functional authenticity of the recently cloned and sequenced cDNAs for the alpha- and beta-MPP subunits from rat liver and to study each subunit's participation in MPP activity, we have subcloned and expressed separately in Escherichia coli the mature sequence of each subunit as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein. After induction, about 80% of each expressed fusion protein was insoluble in aggregates or inclusion bodies, and 20% remained soluble in the supernatant. The fusion proteins in the soluble fraction were purified by affinity chromatography and treated with factor Xa, and the MPP subunits were purified to homogeneity. When mixed together, these subunits showed no activity, suggesting that they might be misfolded. Therefore, a reconstitution protocol was developed which consisted of denaturation in urea, dithiothreitol, and 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by renaturation by dilution and dialysis under reducing conditions. With this procedure, active MPP was recovered from the mixed subunits, and it could be demonstrated that both alpha- and beta-MPP subunits were necessary for activity. Reconstituted recombinant MPP resembled the native rat liver enzyme as judged by its molecular weight, its inhibition by EDTA, and its ability to process a variety of mitochondrial precursor proteins appropriately to either an intermediate or a mature form."
https://openalex.org/W1495976322,"Nuclear pore proteins bearing O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) are involved in nuclear transport, although a role for their glycosylation is not established. Xenopus egg extracts capable of reforming functional nuclei in vitro yielded nuclei with impaired transport and reduced nuclear pore density when depleted of wheat germ agglutinin-binding proteins. Many of the nuclear pores remaining in wheat germ agglutinin-depleted nuclei showed a striking loss of internal structure. Nuclear transport and normal nuclear pore structure were restored by the addition of nuclear pore glycoproteins from rat liver or Xenopus eggs. Glycoproteins modified by the addition of galactose to O-linked GlcNAc were also competent for assembling normal nuclear pores and restoring nuclear transport. Aphidicolin-sensitive DNA synthesis was unaffected by the removal or modification of O-linked GlcNAc glycoproteins. These data argue against a requirement for a lectin-like recognition of O-linked GlcNAc glycoproteins in nuclear pore assembly, nuclear transport, or DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1598941499,"The prototype mammalian proprotein processing enzyme furin is shown to be encoded by three distinct FUR mRNA isoforms which differ only in their 5'-untranslated regions. By primer extension analysis, the transcription start sites of the three mRNA isoforms were defined. The genomic regions located immediately upstream of the three alternative transcriptional start sites were shown to possess promoter activity in transfection experiments using the luciferase encoding gene as reporter. In a liver cell line, the P1 promoter appeared to be the strongest; in a lung cell line, the P1A promoter. Human FUR promoter P1 but not P1A or P1B was transactivated by transcription factor C/EBP beta. Other members of this family of bZIP transcription factors, C/EBP alpha and C/EBP delta, were not able to transactivate the P1 promoter. Promoter P1A and P1B have characteristics of promoters of housekeeping genes. They lack TATA or CAAT boxes upstream of the transcription start site but are very GC-rich and contain several SP1 sites. Promoter P1, on the other hand, has a TATA box in the proximal promoter region. In electromobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analysis, transcription factor SP1 was found to bind to the proximal region of the P1 promoter. Altogether, our results indicate that expression of the human FUR gene is directed by alternative promoters, housekeeping (GC-rich) as well as regulated (TATA-containing) promoters, suggesting that their differential use may be a mechanism to modulate levels of the furin enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526579847,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is essential for the hepatic assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins. Recent studies have revealed that in both hepatic and nonhepatic cells a large percentage of newly synthesized apoB polypeptides engage in transmembrane interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These apoB-membrane interactions have been implicated in the processes of lipoprotein assembly and regulation. To identify domains of apoB that are responsible for its transmembrane localization, overlapping 300 amino acid segments of human apoB48 (amino-terminal 48% of apoB) and two control proteins, human complement component C3 and mouse CD4, were appended to the amino-terminal 77 amino acids of a soluble secretory precursor protein and expressed in COS-1 cells. While the integral membrane protein CD4 conferred predictable transmembrane orientation on the hybrid protein, as evidenced by its partial protease accessibility in intact microsomes, all of the apoB-containing proteins and the soluble secretory control, C3, were fully protease-resistant, consistent with their complete translocation into the ER. To determine if conformational properties of apoB are responsible for its transmembrane interactions with the ER, proteins containing the entire amino-terminal approximately 50% of apoB (apoB50) were expressed in COS-1 cells. Irrespective of whether targeting and translocation initiation were directed by a heterologous signal peptide or the native apoB signal peptide, apoB50 appeared to undergo complete membrane translocation into a protease-inaccessible compartment. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal 50% of apoB lacks autonomous signals or properties that can fully block ER membrane translocation or promote any other form of stable transmembrane assembly in nonhepatic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1902396307,"Three positive (PR1-3) and one negative (NR1) transcriptional control domain have been tentatively mapped in the promoter of the human F0F1-ATP synthase beta subunit gene (ATPsyn beta) in the context of expression in myogenic cells. Lipofection of promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion constructs into C2C12 myogenic cells revealed that two of the three positive domains (PR1 and PR2) function in both myoblasts and myotubes, whereas the third positive domain (PR3) and the sole negative domain (NR1) seem to function only in myotubes. PR1 contains a cluster of four CCAAT cis-elements, PR2 is a small 44-base pair region containing an SP1-like motif, and PR3 is a region previously shown to be recognized by both OXBOX- and REBOX-binding factors. By site-directed polymerase chain reaction linker mutations, the activity of the OXBOX/REBOX cis-element in myoblasts is shown to be masked by flanking sequences in PR3. The negative domain, NR1, is located between 300 and 1,000 base pairs upstream from the OXBOX/REBOX elements in a region containing multiple Alu repeats. Mobility gel shift analysis of DNA-protein complexes using competitor DNAs verified the involvement of both OXBOX- and REBOX-binding factors in PR3. Similar experiments show SP1-specific binding at PR2. These data with observations of OXBOX and REBOX-specific binding of an OXBOX/REBOX-like region within the conserved sequence block C of the human mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequence are consistent with the idea that OXBOX- and REBOX DNA-binding factors coordinate the expression of mitochondrial energy genes in highly oxidative tissues by working with well characterized general transcription factors such as SP1 and CCAAT DNA-binding proteins, which exist in the nucleus, and MTF, which exists in the mitochondrion."

https://openalex.org/W1538647221,"The expression of the yeast ADH2 gene is controlled by the transcriptional activator ADR1, a zinc-finger protein that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS1) in the ADH2 promoter. We report here the isolation of seven mutations in the ADR1-5c allele, defining five different amino acid changes, that suppress the enhanced ADH2 expression caused by the ADR1-5c allele. Each of the mutations was shown to reduce the activation of ADH2 by a wild-type ADR1 gene, suggesting the mutations disrupt a domain important to the function of both the ADR1 and ADR1-5c proteins. All five amino acid changes occurred within the DNA-binding domain of ADR1 and were shown to severely inhibit the ability of ADR1 to bind UAS1 in vitro. These mutations were found, however, to also affect the ability of ADR1 to activate transcription independent of its ability to bind DNA. These results indicate that the DNA-binding region of ADR1 is involved in both transactivation and DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1487115130,"We have studied the competitive binding of histones and the Rous sarcoma virus internal enhancer binding factor (IBF) factor (which recent studies indicate is almost certainly cEBP beta). We find that histones and IBF are incapable of forming a ternary complex with a 159-base pair (bp) fragment of DNA containing a single IBF binding site and that histones and factor are mutually exclusive in binding. We have analyzed the various physical parameters of binding, in an attempt to understand how the factor might establish an exclusive binding in the cell. The stability of the nucleosome and the factor-DNA complex have been determined, and in addition a minimum value for the affinity of the histone octamer has been computed. We find that in simple competition the IBF can successfully compete, only if the substrate DNA is shorter than 140 bp. The relevance of these results is discussed in terms of a kinetic model for successful factor competition during the replication of the factor binding site in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1543801246,"Using an improved reconstitution method, we have purified an Na(+)-dependent neutral L-alpha-amino acid transporter from rabbit small intestine to apparent homogeneity. The preparation solubilized with octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) was purified by successive chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl and lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B columns. The transport activity was assayed by reconstitution of the protein into liposomes. The specific activity of the final preparation was 1364-fold that of brush border membrane vesicles. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the active fractions gave one band of 90 kDa. Kinetic analysis using proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified fraction showed that alanine transport was mediated by high affinity system with Kt value of 0.19 mM and Jmax value of 2.8 nmol/mg protein/s. Analysis of the amino acid composition of the purified transporter revealed that the transporter is very hydrophobic protein. From its specific activities for transport of individual amino acids this transporter was concluded to possess broad specificity for neutral L-alpha-amino acids. Furthermore, inhibition study of other amino acids allowed us to identify this transport pathway as the intestinal system B."
