https://openalex.org/W2984202283,"While amino acid restriction remains an attractive strategy for cancer therapy, metabolic adaptations limit its effectiveness. Here we demonstrate a role of translational reprogramming in the survival of asparagine-restricted cancer cells. Asparagine limitation in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells activates receptor tyrosine kinase-MAPK signalling as part of a feedforward mechanism involving mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent increase in MAPK-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), resulting in enhanced translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA. MAPK inhibition attenuates translational induction of ATF4 and the expression of its target asparagine synthetase (ASNS), sensitizing melanoma and pancreatic tumours to asparagine restriction, reflected in inhibition of their growth. Correspondingly, low ASNS expression is among the top predictors of response to inhibitors of MAPK signalling in patients with melanoma and is associated with favourable prognosis when combined with low MAPK signalling activity. These studies reveal an axis of adaptation to asparagine deprivation and present a rationale for clinical evaluation of MAPK inhibitors in combination with asparagine restriction approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2985731727,"Many individuals who engage with conspiracy theories come to do so through a combination of individual and social factors. The interaction between these factors is challenging to study using traditional experimental designs. Reddit.com is a large connected set of online discussion forums, including one (r/conspiracy) devoted to wide-ranging discussion of conspiracy theories. The availability of large datasets of user comments from Reddit give a unique opportunity to observe human behavior in social spaces and at scale. Using a retrospective case control study design, we analyzed how Reddit users who would go on to engage with a conspiracy-related forum differed from other users in the language they use, differences in the social environments where they posted, and potential interactions between the two factors. Together, the analyses provide evidence for self-selection into communities with a shared set of interests which can feed into a conspiratorial world-view, and that these differences are detectable relative to controls even before users begin to post in r/conspiracy. We also suggest that survey-based and experimental studies may benefit from differentiating between passive private endorsement by individuals and active engagement with conspiracy theories in social spaces."
https://openalex.org/W2986670900,"Front-of-pack labeling is a cost-effective strategy to decrease population consumption of sodium, sugar, saturated fat, total fat, and trans-fatty acids, considered critical nutrients for chronic disease. Our main objective was to explore the subjective understanding of labels that are currently used internationally among low- and middle-income Mexican consumers. We performed two phases of 10 focus groups with adolescents (13–15 y), young adults (21–23 y), mothers of children 3–12 y, fathers of children 3–12 y and older adults (55–70 y). Seven FOPL were evaluated: Guideline Daily Amounts, Multiple Traffic Light, Chilean Warning labels, Warning labels in Red, 5-Color Nutrition Label, Health Star Rating, and Healthy Choice label. Data was analyzed with a triangulation of researchers using a content analysis, based on three codes: 1) awareness and use of the Guideline Daily Amounts, 2) acceptability, and 3) subjective understanding of labels. Most participants were aware of the Guideline Daily Amounts, however they rarely used it because interpreting the information displayed on the label was too complicated. Health Star Rating, Warning labels, Multiple Traffic Light and the Healthy Choice logo labels were the most understandable, however the acceptability of the The Healthy Choice logo decreased as it did not provide information on specific ingredients. The Warning labels was the only label able to warn about critical nutrients that could represent a health risk. The Warning labels in red was more accepted compared to Warning labels in black. Results show that directive and semi-directive labels, such as Warning labels, Health Star Rating or Multiple Traffic Light, may be better at helping population of low- and middle income make healthier food choices, than non-directive FOPL such as the Guideline Daily Amounts implemented in México. The study results highlight the potential of Warning labels to support decreases in the consumption of critical ingredients in low- and middle-income Mexican consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2989515819,"Dehydrins are late embryogenesis abundant proteins that help regulate abiotic stress responses in plants. Overexpression of the Saussurea involucrata dehydrin gene SiDHN has previously been shown to improve water-use efficiency and enhance cold and drought tolerance of transgenic tobacco. To understand the mechanism by which SiDHN exerts its protective function, we transformed the SiDHN gene into tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and assessed their response to abiotic stress. We observed that in response to stresses, the SiDHN transgenic tomato plants had increased contents of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid and relative water content compared with wild-type plants. They also had higher maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and accumulated more proline and soluble sugar. Compared to those wild-type plants, malondialdehyde content and relative electron leakage in transgenic plants were not significantly increased, and H2O2 and O2- contents in transgenic tomato plants were significantly decreased. We further observed that the production of stress-related antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, and catalase, as well as pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and lipid transfer protein 1, were up-regulated in the transgenic plants under cold and drought stress. Based on these observations, we conclude that overexpression of SiDHN gene can promote cold and drought tolerance of transgenic tomato plants by inhibiting cell membrane damage, protecting chloroplasts, and enhancing the reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity. The finding can be beneficial for the application of SiDHN gene in improving crop tolerance to abiotic stress and oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2986598803,"Bioinformatics, a discipline that combines aspects of biology, statistics, mathematics, and computer science, is becoming increasingly important for biological research. However, bioinformatics instruction is not yet generally integrated into undergraduate life sciences curricula. To understand why we studied how bioinformatics is being included in biology education in the US by conducting a nationwide survey of faculty at two- and four-year institutions. The survey asked several open-ended questions that probed barriers to integration, the answers to which were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. The barrier most frequently reported by the 1,260 respondents was lack of faculty expertise/training, but other deterrents—lack of student interest, overly-full curricula, and lack of student preparation—were also common. Interestingly, the barriers faculty face depended strongly on whether they are members of an underrepresented group and on the Carnegie Classification of their home institution. We were surprised to discover that the cohort of faculty who were awarded their terminal degree most recently reported the most preparation in bioinformatics but teach it at the lowest rate."
https://openalex.org/W2987705663,"This paper proposes a UAV platform that autonomously detects, hunts, and takes down other small UAVs in GPS-denied environments. The platform detects, tracks, and follows another drone within its sensor range using a pre-trained machine learning model. We collect and generate a 58,647-image dataset and use it to train a Tiny YOLO detection algorithm. This algorithm combined with a simple visual-servoing approach was validated on a physical platform. Our platform was able to successfully track and follow a target drone at an estimated speed of 1.5 m/s. Performance was limited by the detection algorithm’s 77% accuracy in cluttered environments and the frame rate of eight frames per second along with the field of view of the camera."

However, we observed that PORCN inhibition does not phenocopy the effects of WNT4 knockdown in WNT4-dependent breast cancer cells. This suggests a unique relationship between PORCN and WNT4 signaling. To examine the role of PORCN in WNT4 signaling, here we overexpressed WNT4 or WNT3A in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Conditioned media from these lines and co-culture systems were used to assess the dependence of Wnt secretion and activity on the critical Wnt secretion proteins PORCN and Wnt ligand secretion (WLS) mediator. We observed that WLS is universally required for Wnt secretion and paracrine signaling. In contrast, the dependence of WNT3A secretion and activity on PORCN varied across the cell lines, and WNT4 secretion was PORCN-independent in all models. Surprisingly, WNT4 did not exhibit paracrine activity in any tested context. Absent the expected paracrine activity of secreted WNT4, we identified cell-autonomous Wnt signaling activation by WNT4 and WNT3A, independent of PORCN or Wnt secretion. The PORCN-independent, cell-autonomous Wnt signaling demonstrated here may be critical in WNT4-driven cellular contexts or in those that are considered to have dysfunctional Wnt signaling.

Despite these observed critical roles of WNT4 in both normal and malignant tissues, WNT4 signaling is crudely understood due to varied context-dependent functions. In a cell type- and tissue-specific manner, WNT4 (human or murine) has been shown to regulate either β-catenin–dependent or -independent Wnt signaling and has been shown to either activate or suppress signaling (described in references herein). Furthermore, conflicting reports exist whether murine Wnt4 can or cannot activate Wnt signaling via β-catenin in the murine mammary gland (36Rajaram R.D. Buric D. Caikovski M. Ayyanan A. Rougemont J.

It is also unclear which FZD complexes are utilized as receptors by WNT4, as WNT4 is often required for distinct, nonredundant functions versus other Wnt proteins (35Alexander C.M. Goel S. Fakhraldeen S.A. Kim S. Wnt signaling in mammary glands: plastic cell fates and combinatorial signaling.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Because WNT4 has myriad downstream signaling effects, inhibition of WNT4 upstream of Wnt effector pathways (e.g. with PORCN inhibitors) is an attractive approach to block WNT4 signaling in a “pathway-indifferent” manner to treat WNT4-related pathologies. We reported that regulation of WNT4 expression is co-opted by the estrogen receptor in a subtype of breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (40Sikora M.J. Cooper K.L. Bahreini A. Luthra S.

Although WNT4-driven signaling in ILC has yet to be fully elucidated, ILC cells lack the capacity to engage canonical Wnt signaling, as the characteristic genetic loss of E-cadherin in ILC leads to loss of β-catenin protein (41Sikora M.J.

This suggests WNT4 drives β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in ILC cells. Although the specific pathways activated by WNT4 are unknown, PORCN inhibition should be an effective strategy to block WNT4 upstream and treat ILC. However, treatment of ILC cells with PORCN inhibitors did not suppress growth or survival. These unexpected results initiated further studies into the mechanisms underlying WNT4 secretion and signaling. In this report, we show WNT4 secretion is mediated by atypical mechanisms. Our observations challenge the paradigm that PORCN-mediated secretion is required for Wnt signaling and suggest a novel process by which Wnt proteins, including WNT4, can initiate β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling. We hypothesized that because ILC cells are dependent on WNT4 for proliferation and survival (41Sikora M.J. Jacobsen B.M. Levine K. Chen J. Davidson N.E. Lee A.V. Alexander C.M. Oesterreich S. WNT4 mediates estrogen receptor signaling and endocrine resistance in invasive lobular carcinoma cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. 2016; 18 (27650553): 9210.1186/s13058-016-0748-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), inhibition of PORCN would phenocopy WNT4 siRNA by blocking WNT4 secretion and downstream signaling. Proliferation and cell death were monitored by live-cell imaging of MM134 (ILC) cells either transfected with siRNA targeting PORCN (siPORCN) or treated with PORCN inhibitor (PORCNi) LGK974. Proliferation and cell death were compared with untreated cells and cells treated with the anti-estrogen fulvestrant (Fulv) or transfected with siRNA-targeting WNT4 (siWNT4). As we reported previously (41Sikora M.J. Jacobsen B.M. Levine K. Chen J. Davidson N.E. Lee A.V. Alexander C.M. Oesterreich S. WNT4 mediates estrogen receptor signaling and endocrine resistance in invasive lobular carcinoma cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. 2016; 18 (27650553): 9210.1186/s13058-016-0748-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), siRNA-mediated WNT4 knockdown or Fulv halts proliferation, and WNT4 knockdown induces cell death (Fig. 1A). However, neither genetic nor chemical PORCN inhibition had any effect on cell proliferation or survival of MM134 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained in the ILC cell line SUM44PE, as PORCN inhibitor at concentrations up to 1 μm did not affect proliferation (Fig. S1). These data suggest PORCN inhibition is not sufficient to inhibit WNT4 function, and WNT4 signaling likely occurs via PORCN-independent mechanisms. Because targeting PORCN did not phenocopy WNT4 knockdown, we further examined the role of PORCN in WNT4 secretion. To facilitate Wnt secretion studies, we overexpressed WNT3A or WNT4 in MM134 (MM134:W3 and MM134:W4; Fig. 2A and Table 1), and we measured secreted Wnt proteins in conditioned medium. Of note, because epitope tags may alter Wnt secretion and activity (e.g. Ref. 8Najdi R. Proffitt K. Sprowl S. Kaur S. Yu J. Covey T.M. Virshup D.M. Waterman M.L. A uniform human Wnt expression library reveals a shared secretory pathway and unique signaling activities.Differentiation. 2012; 84 (22784633): 203-21310.1016/j.diff.2012.06.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we performed all studies with nontagged Wnt constructs.

Secreted WNT3A and WNT4 were detected in conditioned medium from MM134:W3 and MM134:W4, respectively (Fig. 2B).

Turbidometry, pH measurements and instability indices of each CsA solution were measured. DED was induced with BAC, and animals were treated with vehicle or CsA preparations. Tear volume and fluorescein staining scores were evaluated on days 7 and 14. Eyes were enucleated and subjected to IHC, TUNEL staining, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, real-time PCR and western blotting.Both SNEDDSs had lower and more uniform particle size distribution than C-CsA, and a similar optical density to phosphate-buffered saline and stable pH, in contrast to the high turbidity and unstable pH of C-CsA. Aqueous tear volume and fluorescein staining scores were improved in C-CsA- and SNEDDS-treated mice. Numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells and levels of inflammatory mediators were decreased by both C-CsA and SNEDDS, although SNEDDS resolved inflammation more effectively than C-CsA.Cyclosporine A eyedrops with SNEDDS have improved physicochemical properties and treatment efficacy in BAC-induced DED."
https://openalex.org/W2987043806,"The aim of this trial was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a home-based exercise program delivered four months following hip-fracture surgery. In the two-armed randomized, single blinded clinical trial we included persons who lived in the catchment area, were 70 years or older, and community-dwelling at time of the fracture. We excluded persons who were unable to walk ten meters prior to the fracture, and those who were bedridden or had medical contraindications for exercise at baseline (ie. four months after the fracture). All participants underwent routine treatment and rehabilitation. The intervention group received additional 20 sessions (10 weeks) structured, home exercise targeting gait and balance, delivered by physiotherapists in primary health care. Gait speed was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, gait characteristics, cognitive function, activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, and health care costs extracted from hospital and municipality records. In total, 223 participants were included. Four months post surgery 143 were randomized for the exercise trial (70% women, mean age 83.4 (SD 6.1) years, mean gait speed 0.6 (SD 0.2) m/sec). Estimated between group difference in gait speed was 0.09 m/sec (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14, p<0.001) at posttest and 0.07 m/sec (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.12, p = 0.009) 12 months post surgery. The mean between-group QALY difference was -0.009 (95% CI: -0.061 to 0.038). The mean between-group total cost difference was +242.9 EUR (95% CI: -8397 to 8584). Our findings suggest that gait recovery after hip fracture can be improved by introducing a home-based balance and gait exercise program four months post surgery, without increasing total health care costs. Future research should focus on how to implement gait and balance exercise in comprehensive interventions that increase adherence among the most vulnerable persons and have an effect on daily life activities and patient-centred outcomes.

This study aimed to evaluate a multifaceted intervention to prevent and manage MSP in two hospitals.We performed a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial, with a late intervention control group. Clusters were independent hospital units with nursing staff as participants. The intervention comprised three evidence-based components: participatory ergonomics, health promotion activities and case management. Both the intervention and the control group received usual occupational health care. The intervention lasted one year. MSP and work functioning data was collected at baseline, six and 12-month follow-up. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for MSP risk in the intervention group compared to the control group using logistic regression through GEE. Differences in work functioning between the intervention and control group were analyzed using linear regression through GEE. The incidence of sickness absence was calculated through logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to analyze the effect of the intervention on sickness absence duration.Eight clusters were randomized including 473 nurses and nursing aides. At 12 months, the intervention group showed a statistically significant decrease of the risk in neck, shoulders and upper back pain, compared to the control group (OR = 0.37; 95%CI = 0.14-0.96). A reduction of low back pain was also observed, though non statistically significant. We found no differences regarding work functioning and the incidence and duration of sickness absence.The intervention was effective to reduce neck, shoulder and upper back pain. Our results, though modest, suggests that interventions to prevent and manage MSP need a multifactorial approach including the three levels of prevention, and framed within the biopsychosocial model."
https://openalex.org/W2989166508,"The majority of available systems for vagus nerve stimulation use helical stimulation electrodes, which cover the majority of the circumference of the nerve and produce largely uniform current density within the nerve. Flat stimulation electrodes that contact only one side of the nerve may provide advantages, including ease of fabrication. However, it is possible that the flat configuration will yield inefficient fiber recruitment due to a less uniform current distribution within the nerve. Here we tested the hypothesis that flat electrodes will require higher current amplitude to activate all large-diameter fibers throughout the whole cross-section of a nerve than circumferential designs. Computational modeling and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate fiber recruitment in different nerves and different species using a variety of electrode designs. Initial results demonstrated similar fiber recruitment in the rat vagus and sciatic nerves with a standard circumferential cuff electrode and a cuff electrode modified to approximate a flat configuration. Follow up experiments comparing true flat electrodes to circumferential electrodes on the rabbit sciatic nerve confirmed that fiber recruitment was equivalent between the two designs. These findings demonstrate that flat electrodes represent a viable design for nerve stimulation that may provide advantages over the current circumferential designs for applications in which the goal is uniform activation of all fascicles within the nerve."

In this paper, TAP, which is based on token mechanism and deep learning technology, was proposed as an analysis model to discover the vulnerabilities of PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) Web programs conveniently and easily. Based on the token mechanism of PHP language, a custom tokenizer was designed, and it unifies tokens, supports some features of PHP and optimizes the parsing. Besides, the tokenizer also implements parameter iteration to achieve data flow analysis. On the Software Assurance Reference Dataset(SARD) and SQLI-LABS dataset, we trained the deep learning model of TAP by combining the word2vec model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network algorithm. According to the experiment on the dataset of CWE-89, TAP not only achieves the 0.9941 Area Under the Curve(AUC), which is better than other models, but also achieves the highest accuracy: 0.9787. Further, compared with RIPS, TAP shows much better in multiclass classification with 0.8319 Kappa and 0.0840 hamming distance."
https://openalex.org/W2986837945,"Objective An ACTH stimulation test is the standard diagnostic test for adrenal insufficiency (AI). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance between serum morning (0800 h) cortisol and serum basal (0900–1300 h) cortisol levels and determine the proper cut-off point to facilitate AI diagnosis to reduce the number of tests. Methods A six-year retrospective study was performed in a tertiary care medical center. We identified 416 patients who had undergone either low (LDT) or high dose (HDT) ACTH stimulation outpatient tests. AI was defined as a peak serum cortisol level of <500 nmol/L at 30 or 60 minutes after LDT or HDT. The associations between AI and serum basal and morning cortisol levels were demonstrated by logistic regression model. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by ROC analysis. Results Of the 416 patients, 93 (22.4%) were categorized as having AI. The adjusted area under the curve (AUC) for the basal cortisol level for the diagnosis of AI was significantly higher than that for the morning cortisol (0.82 vs 0.69, p <0.001) level. The proposed cut-off values for the basal cortisol were <85 nmol/L (specificity 99.7%) and >350 nmol/L(sensitivity 98.9%). By using these proposed cut-off points, approximately 30% of the ACTH stimulation tests could be eliminated. Conclusion The serum basal cortisol level with the proposed cut-off points were considered as an alternative option for diagnosis of AI. Utilizing the serum basal cortisol level can facilitate AI diagnosis as it is convenient, is not a time-specific test and has a high diagnostic performance."

https://openalex.org/W2990453550,"Insulin promotes glucose uptake by triggering the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane through exocytosis. GLUT4 exocytosis is a vesicle fusion event involving fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. For GLUT4 vesicle fusion to occur, GLUT4 vesicles must first be tethered to the plasma membrane. A key tethering factor in exocytosis is a heterooctameric protein complex called the exocyst. The role of the exocyst in GLUT4 exocytosis, however, remains incompletely understood. Here we first systematically analyzed data from a genome-scale CRISPR screen in HeLa cells that targeted virtually all known genes in the human genome, including 12 exocyst genes. The screen recovered only a subset of the exocyst genes, including exocyst complex component 7 (Exoc7/Exo70). Other exocyst genes, however, were not isolated in the screen, likely because of functional redundancy. Our findings suggest that selection of an appropriate exocyst gene is critical for genetic studies of exocyst functions. Next we developed an inducible adipocyte genome editing system that enabled Exoc7 gene deletion in adipocytes without interfering with adipocyte differentiation. We observed that insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis was markedly inhibited in Exoc7 KO adipocytes. Insulin signaling, however, remained intact in these KO cells. These results indicate that the exocyst plays a critical role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis in adipocytes. We propose that the strategy outlined in this work could be instrumental in genetically dissecting other membrane-trafficking pathways in adipocytes."

The one-factor-model proposed by the original authors was tested, and the SSCS showed an unacceptable model fit. For the development of an economical short version of the TICS, including items of the nine areas of chronic stress, nine items based on the alphamax algorithm were selected. The one-factor-model of this new short version of the TICS of nine items provided a good fit for the latent construct and showed good reliability (α = .88).

Yet, there is little information on male involvement in the cervical cancer screening and treatment process in Ghana. In this study, we explore male knowledge and support during cervical cancer screening and treatment in a rural setting in Ghana. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among a total of 41 respondents to collect qualitative data from cervical cancer patients, their male partners and other married men in the North Tongu District, Ghana. A thematic approach was used for data analysis and presentation of the results. The results show that male partners have little or no knowledge about cervical cancer. Some men provide various forms of support–financial, social, material and emotional–to their partners during the screening and treatment stages of the disease. Some men, however, abandoned their partners during the screening and treatment process of the disease. Men whose partners did not have cervical cancer said they were willing to provide financial, social, emotional and material support to their partners if they should contract the disease. Some men said they were willing to support their female partners but lacked education on the disease. This study underscores the need for cervical cancer education programmes to target Ghanaian men. The education should focus on the causes of the disease, screening and treatment methods of the disease, and, ultimately, promote spousal support during the screening and treatment processes."

Little consensus exists as to the best, standard methods to collect fecal samples for future microbiome analysis. We evaluated three distinct populations (N = 132 participants) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data to investigate the reproducibility, stability, and accuracy of microbial profiles in fecal samples collected and stored via fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) tubes, 70% and 95% ethanol, RNAlater, or with no solution. For each collection method, based on relative abundance of select phyla and genera, two alpha diversity metrics, and four beta diversity metrics, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate reproducibility and stability, and Spearman correlation coefficients (SCCs) to estimate accuracy of the fecal microbial profile. Comparing duplicate samples, reproducibility ICCs for all collection methods were excellent (ICCs ≥75%). After 4–7 days at ambient temperature, ICCs for microbial profile stability were excellent (≥75%) for most collection methods, except those collected via no-solution and 70% ethanol. SCCs comparing each collection method to immediately-frozen no-solution samples ranged from fair to excellent for most methods; however, accuracy of genus-level relative abundances differed by collection method. Our findings, taken together with previous studies and feasibility considerations, indicated that FOBT/FTA cards, FIT tubes, 95% ethanol, and RNAlater are excellent choices for fecal sample collection methods in future microbiome studies. Furthermore, establishing standard collection methods across studies is highly desirable."

Methods Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage [SAIL] databank in Wales, linking maternal primary care data with infant outcomes. Participants: 107,573, 105,331, and 38,725 infants born 2000–2010 with information on prematurity, SGA and breastfeeding respectively, after exclusions. Exposures: Maternal antidepressant prescriptions in trimesters 2 or 3, discontinuation after trimester 1, recorded diagnosis of depression [medicated or unmediated] in pregnancy. Methods: Odds ratios for adverse pregnancy outcomes were calculated, adjusted for smoking, parity, socio-economic status, and depression. Results Exclusive formula feeding at 6–8 weeks was associated with prescriptions in trimesters 2 or 3 for any antidepressants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.81, 95% confidence intervals 0.67–0.98), SSRIs [aOR 0.77, 0.62–0.95], particularly higher doses [aOR 0.45, 0.23–0.86], discontinuation of antidepressants or SSRIs after trimester 1 (aOR 0.70, 0.57–0.83 and 0.66, 0.51–0.87), diagnosis of depression aOR 0.76 [0.70–0.82), particularly if medicated (aOR 0.70, 0.58–0.85), rather than unmedicated (aOR 0.87, 0.82–0.92). Preterm birth at <37 and <32 weeks’ gestation was associated with diagnosis of depression (aOR 1.27, 1.17–1.38, and 1.33, 1.09–1.62), particularly if medicated (aOR 1.56, 1.23–1.96, and 1.63, 0.94–2.84); birth at <37 weeks was associated with antidepressants, (aOR 1.24, 1.04–1.49]. SGA <3rd centile was associated with antidepressants (aOR 1.43, 1.07–1.90), and SSRIs (aOR 1.46, 1.06–2.00], particularly higher doses [aOR 2.10, 1.32–3.34]. All adverse outcomes were associated with socio-economic status and smoking. Implications Exposure to antidepressants or depression increased risks of exclusive formula feeding at 6–8 weeks, and prescription of antidepressants was associated with SGA <3rd centile. Prescription of antidepressants offers a useful marker to target additional support and additional care before and during pregnancy and lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2987653724,"This study aimed to investigate whether people scoring higher (compared to lower) on sensory-processing sensitivity respond differently to the work environment. Specifically, based on the literature on sensory-processing sensitivity and the Job Demands-Resources model, we predicted that the three components of sensory-processing sensitivity (i.e. ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold) amplify the relationship between job demands (i.e. workload and emotional demands) and emotional exhaustion as well as the relationship between job resources (i.e. task autonomy and social support) and helping behaviour. Survey data from 1019 Belgian employees were analysed using structural equation modelling analysis. The results showed that ease of excitation and low sensory threshold amplified the relationship between job demands and emotional exhaustion. Low sensory threshold also strengthened the job resources-helping behaviour relationship. This study offered first evidence on the greater susceptibility among highly sensitive persons to the work environment and demonstrated that the moderating role might differ for the three components of sensory-processing sensitivity. Additionally, it adds sensory-processing sensitivity to the Job Demands-Resources model and highlights the idea that personal factors may act both as a personal vulnerability factor and a personal resource, depending on the nature of the perceived work environment."

As such, GEs represent promising biochemical tools in industrial processing of these recalcitrant resources. However, details on how GEs interact and catalyze degradation of their natural substrates are sparse, calling for thorough enzyme structure-function studies. Presented here is a structural and mechanistic investigation of the bacterial GE OtCE15A. GEs belong to the carbohydrate esterase family 15 (CE15), which is in turn part of the larger α/β-hydrolase superfamily. GEs contain a Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad, but the location of the catalytic acid in GEs has been shown to be variable, and OtCE15A possesses two putative catalytic acidic residues in the active site. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that these residues are functionally redundant, possibly indicating the evolutionary route toward new functionalities within the family. Structures determined with glucuronate, in both native and covalently bound intermediate states, and galacturonate provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of CE15. A structure of OtCE15A with the glucuronoxylooligosaccharide 23-(4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronyl)-xylotriose (commonly referred to as XUX) shows that the enzyme can indeed interact with polysaccharides from the plant cell wall, and an additional structure with the disaccharide xylobiose revealed a surface binding site that could possibly indicate a recognition mechanism for long glucuronoxylan chains. Collectively, the results indicate that OtCE15A, and likely most of the CE15 family, can utilize esters of glucuronoxylooligosaccharides and support the proposal that these enzymes work on lignin-carbohydrate complexes in plant biomass.

https://openalex.org/W2986604169,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies. It is phenotypically heterogeneous with a highly unstable genome and provides few common therapeutic targets. We found that MCL1, Cofilin1 (CFL1) and SRC mRNA were highly expressed by a wide range of these cancers, suggesting that a strategy of dual MCL-1 and SRC inhibition might be efficacious for many patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MCL-1 protein was present at high levels in 94.7% of patients in a cohort of PDACs from Australian Pancreatic Genome Initiative (APGI). High MCL1 and Cofilin1 mRNA expression was also strongly predictive of poor outcome in the TCGA dataset and in the APGI cohort. In culture, MCL-1 antagonism reduced the level of the cytoskeletal remodeling protein Cofilin1 and phosphorylated SRC on the active Y416 residue, suggestive of reduced invasive capacity. The MCL-1 antagonist S63845 synergized with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib to reduce cell viability and invasiveness through 3D-organotypic matrices. In preclinical murine models, this combination reduced primary tumor growth and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer xenografts. These data suggest that MCL-1 antagonism, while reducing cell viability, may have an additional benefit in increasing the antimetastatic efficacy of dasatinib for the treatment of PDAC."

A disruption of microbiota within the cervical milieu has been suggested to be a driving factor of sexually transmitted infections. These include Chlamydia trachomatis which frequently causes serious reproductive sequelae such as infertility in women. In this study, we profiled the cervical microbial composition of a population of 70 reproductive-age Malaysian women; among which 40 (57.1%) were diagnosed with genital C. trachomatis infection, and 30 (42.8%) without C. trachomatis infection. Our findings showed a distinct compositional difference between the cervical microbiota of C. trachomatis-infected subjects and subjects without C. trachomatis infection. Specifically, significant elevations of mostly strict and facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, and Veillonella in the cervical microbiota of C. trachomatis-positive women were detected. The results from the current study highlights an interaction of C. trachomatis with the environmental microbiome in the endocervical region."
https://openalex.org/W2985856187,"Boosting is a family of supervised learning algorithm that convert a set of weak learners into a single strong one. It is popular in the field of object tracking, where its main purpose is to extract the position, motion, and trajectory from various features of interest within a sequence of video frames. A scientific application explored in this study is to combine the boosting tracker and the Hough transformation, followed by principal component analysis, to extract the location and trace of grain boundaries within atom probe data. Before the implementation of this method, these information could only be extracted manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on an experimental dataset obtained from a pure aluminum bi-crystal and validated on simulated data. The information gained from this method can be combined with crystallographic information directly contained within the data, to fully define the grain boundary character to its 5 degrees of freedom at near-atomic resolution in three dimensions. It also enables local atomic compositional and geometric information, i.e. curvature, to be extracted directly at the interface."
https://openalex.org/W2989021822,"Delirium is a common post-surgical complication, but few studies have examined postoperative delirium following lung cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to clarify the risk factors of postoperative delirium, to construct a useful scoring system, and to clarify the relationship between delirium and prognosis after lung cancer surgery. We retrospectively analyzed data from 570 patients who underwent surgery for primary lung cancer. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the effects of various factors on the onset of delirium. Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to determine the relationship between delirium and prognosis. Postoperative delirium occurred in 6.7% of the patients. Three risk factors were identified, and the risk scores were determined as follows: 2×(cerebrovascular disease history) + 1×(squamous cell carcinoma) + 1×(age older than 75 years). Scores 0–1 denoted low risk, 2 denoted intermediate risk, and 3–4 denoted high risk. Additionally, we found that patients who developed delirium had significantly shorter overall survival. However, there was no difference in the frequency between cancer-related death and non-cancer related death when comparing the delirium and non-delirium groups. We identified the risk factors, i.e., cerebrovascular disease history, squamous cell carcinoma, and age older than 75 years, that determine the onset of delirium after lung cancer surgery and constructed a useful scoring system. In addition, although the prognosis of the delirium group was poor, the factor that determines prognosis may not be cancer per se but vulnerability in the patient background."
https://openalex.org/W2991503554,"Expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is strongly associated with predisposition toward ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and other spondyloarthropathies. However, the exact involvement of HLA-B27 in disease initiation and progression remains unclear. The homodimer theory, which proposes that HLA-B27 heavy chains aberrantly form homodimers, is a central hypothesis that attempts to explain the role of HLA-B27 in disease pathogenesis. Here, we examined the ability of the eight most prevalent HLA-B27 allotypes (HLA-B*27:02 to HLA-B*27:09) to form homodimers. We observed that HLA-B*27:03, a disease-associated HLA-B27 subtype, showed a significantly reduced ability to form homodimers compared with all other allotypes, including the non-disease-associated/protective allotypes HLA-B*27:06 and HLA-B*27:09. We used X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis to unravel the molecular and structural mechanisms in HLA-B*27:03 that are responsible for its compromised ability to form homodimers. We show that polymorphism at position 59, which differentiates HLA-B*27:03 from all other allotypes, is responsible for its compromised ability to form homodimers. Indeed, histidine 59 in HLA-B*27:03 leads to a series of local conformational changes that act in concert to reduce the accessibility of the nearby cysteine 67, an essential amino acid residue for the formation of HLA-B27 homodimers. Considered together, the ability of both protective and disease-associated HLA-B27 allotypes to form homodimers and the failure of HLA-B*27:03 to form homodimers challenge the role of HLA-B27 homodimers in AS pathoetiology. Rather, this work implicates other features, such as peptide binding and antigen presentation, as pivotal mechanisms for disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2984610894,"Background/Aims To analyse the distribution of macular ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT) in patients with foveal hypoplasia (FH) with or without albinism to obtain new insights into visual pathway anomalies in albinos. Methods Patients with FH who presented at our institution between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively drawn for analysis. Mean GCLT was calculated after automated segmentation of spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans. Patients with FH due to albinism (n = 13, termed ‘albinism FH’) or other kinds (n = 10, termed ‘non-albinism FH’) were compared with control subjects (n = 15). The areas: fovea (central), parafovea (nasal I, temporal I) and perifovea (nasal II, temporal II) along the horizontal meridian were of particular interest. Primary endpoints of this study were the ratios (GCLT-I- and GCLT-II-Quotient) between the GCLT measured in the temporal I or II and nasal I or II areas. Results There was a significant difference between the GCLT-I-Quotient of healthy controls and albinism FH (p<0.001), as well as between non-albinism FH and albinism FH (p = 0.004). GCLT-II-Quotient showed significant differences between healthy controls and albinism FH (p<0.001) and between non-albinism FH and albinism FH (p = 0.006). The best measure for distinguishing between non-albinism FH and albinism FH was the calculation of GCLT-II-Quotient (area temporal II divided by area nasal II), indicating albinism at a cut-off of <0.7169. The estimated specificity and sensitivity for this cut-off were 84.6% and 100.0%, respectively. The estimated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.892 [95%CI: 0.743–1.000, p = 0.002]. Conclusion Macular GCLT-distribution showed a characteristic temporal to central shift in patients with FH due to albinism. Calculation of the GCLT-II-Quotient at a cut-off of <0.7169 presents a new diagnostic criterion for identification of ocular albinism."
https://openalex.org/W2988557509,"This study examined variation in the timing of 5,447 infants’ and toddlers’ reported acquisition of 12 basic social-emotional skills across and within 11 developing and developed country sites. Although children differed significantly across sites in when they attained social-emotional skills on average (e.g., M age Brazil = 20.50 months vs. M age India = 26.92 months), there was also substantial heterogeneity across skills. For example, children in Pakistan were reported to demonstrate sympathy on average seven months earlier than their peers in Ghana, whereas the opposite was true for sharing. Overall, country-level health and education were strongly associated (r > .60) with earlier site-level skill attainment. In addition to heterogeneity across sites, we also observed notable within-site variability in skill development (ICCs = .03 to .38). Future research is needed to identify sources of variability and how to promote skills that matter within a given context."
https://openalex.org/W2983695582,"Background To evaluate the prognostic impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with Infective Endocarditis (IE). Methods and results 375 patients with diagnosis of IE referred to our Hospital between 1994–2017 were retrospectively included; diabetes was reported in 129 (34.4%). Diabetic patients were older than non-diabetic (66±1 vs. 57±2 years, p<0.001) and showed a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension (75 vs. 54%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (30 vs. 12%, p<0.001) and history of heart failure (HF; 24 vs. 13%, p = 0.021). Echocardiography showed a higher incidence of paravalvular complications (82 vs. 64%, p<0.001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 52±11 vs. 55±10%, p = 0.001) in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. In-hospital mortality was higher in diabetic patients (83 vs. 74%; p = 0.030). At logistic regression, history of HF (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.87–5.29, p<0.001) resulted an independent predictor of in-hospital death. At long-term follow-up [median 24(7–84) months], the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower survival free from all-cause death in the group with diabetes (Log-rank<0.001). At the propensity score adjusted Cox multivariable analysis, DM (HR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.18–2.6, p = 0.005), age (HR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.02–1.05, p<0.001), intravenous drug users (HR = 5.42, 95%CI: 2.55–11.51, p<0.001) and low LVEF (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96–0.99, p = 0.013) were independently associated to a higher mortality. Conclusion In patients with IE, DM is associated to a higher prevalence of anatomic complications and a more impaired LVEF. Diabetic patients show a significantly lower survival both in hospital and during follow-up compared to the non-diabetic ones."
https://openalex.org/W2986804983,"Increases in the number of shark bites, along with increased media attention on shark-human interactions has led to growing interest in preventing injuries from shark bites through the use of personal mitigation measures. The leading cause of fatality from shark bite victims is blood loss; thus reducing haemorrhaging may provide additional time for a shark bite victim to be attended to by emergency services. Despite previous shark-proof suits being bulky and cumbersome, new technological advances in fabric has allowed the development of lightweight alternatives that can be incorporated onto traditional wetsuits. The ability for these fabrics to withstand shark bites has not been scientifically tested. In this report, we compared two types of recently developed protective fabrics that incorporated ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibre onto neoprene (SharkStop and ActionTX) and compared them to standard neoprene alternatives. We tested nine different fabric variants using three different tests, laboratory-based puncture and laceration tests, along with field-based trials involving white sharks Carcharodon carcharias. Field-based trials consisted of measuring C. carcharias bite force and quantifying damages to the new fabrics following a bite from 3–4 m total length C. carcharias. We found that SharkStop and ActionTX fabric variants were more resistant to puncture, laceration, and bites from C. carcharias. More force was required to puncture the new fabrics compared to control fabrics (laboratory-based tests), and cuts made to the new fabrics were smaller and shallower than those on standard neoprene for both types of test, i.e. laboratory and field tests. Our results showed that UHMWPE fibre increased the resistance of neoprene to shark bites. Although the use of UHMWPE fibre (e.g. SharkStop and ActionTX) may therefore reduce blood loss resulting from a shark bite, research is needed to assess if the reduction in damages to the fabrics extends to human tissues and decreased injuries."

Preference-based or utility information is necessary to make informed economic decisions on treatment and alternative therapies. This study aimed to assess preference-based measures of HRQL in sickle cell patients. Methods and findings Data were collected from two SCD outpatient clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria. A standard algorithm was used to derive utility scores, and measure SF-6D from the SF-36. A multivariate regression model was used to assess predictors and their impact. A combination of socio-demographic, bio-physiological and psychosocial variables predicted utility score in people with SCD. Socio-demographic and bio-physiological factors explained 7.5% and 17.9% of the variance respectively, while psychosocial factors explained 4.9%. Women had lower utility scores with a small effect size (d = 0.17). Utility score increased with level of education but decreased with age, anxiety, frequency of pain episodes and number of co-morbidities. Conclusions Utility score in SCD was low indicating a substantial impact of the disease on HRQL of patients and the value they place on their health state due to the limitations they experienced. Interventions should include both clinical and psychosocial approach to help in improving their quality of life of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2988450604,"Due to the public health importance of flagellar genes for typing, it is important to understand mechanisms that could alter their expression or presence. Phenotypic novelty in flagellar genes arise predominately through accumulation of mutations but horizontal transfer is known to occur. A linear plasmid termed pBSSB1 previously identified in Salmonella Typhi, was found to encode a flagellar operon that can mediate phase variation, which results in the rare z66 flagella phenotype. The identification and tracking of homologs of pBSSB1 is limited because it falls outside the normal replicon typing schemes for plasmids. Here we report the generation of nine new pBSSB1-family sequences using Illumina and Nanopore sequence data. Homologs of pBSSB1 were identified in 154 genomes representing 25 distinct serotypes from 67,758 Salmonella public genomes. Pangenome analysis of pBSSB1-family contigs was performed using roary and we identified three core genes amenable to a minimal pMLST scheme. Population structure analysis based on the newly developed pMLST scheme identified three major lineages representing 35 sequence types, and the distribution of these sequence types was found to span multiple serovars across the globe. This in silico pMLST scheme has shown utility in tracking and subtyping pBSSB1-family plasmids and it has been incorporated into the plasmid MLST database under the name “pBSSB1-family”."
https://openalex.org/W2982989798,"Vibrio (Listonella) anguillarum is a pathogenic bacterium causing septicaemia in a wide range of marine organisms and inducing severe mortalities, thus it is crucial to conduct its accurate and rapid identification. The aim of this study was to assess MALDI-TOF MS as a method of choice for identification of clinical V. anguillarum isolates from affected marine fish. Since the method accuracy might be influenced by the type of the medium used, as well as by the incubation conditions, we tested V. anguillarum isolates grown on standard media with and without the addition of NaCl, cultured at three incubation temperatures, and at three incubation periods. The best scores were retrieved for V. anguillarum strains grown on NaCl-supplemented tryptone soy agar (TSA) at 22°C and incubated for 48h (100% identification to species level; overall score 2.232), followed by incubation at 37°C and 48h (100% to species level; score 2.192). The strains grown on non-supplemented TSA gave the best readings when incubated at 22°C for 72h (100% identification to species level; overall score 2.182), followed by incubation at 15°C for 72h (100% to species level; score 2.160). Unreliable identifications and no-identifications were growing with the incubation duration at 37°C, on both media, amounting to 88.89% for 7d incubation on supplemented TSA, and 92.60% for 7d incubation on non-supplemented TSA. The age of the cultured strains and use of media significantly impacted the mass spectra, demonstrating that for reliable identification, MALDI-TOF MS protein fingerprinting with the on-target extraction should be performed on strains grown on a NaCl-supplemented medium at temperatures between 15 and 22°C, incubated for 48-72 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2987209391,"Purpose To evaluate the surgically induced changes in refraction (sphere and astigmatism) and higher order aberrations by corneal incision for one year. Setting University Hospital “Virgen de la Arrixaca”, Murcia, Spain. Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods Corneal power, astigmatism and higher order aberrations (HOA) were calculated from corneal topography measured in 27 eyes prior to surgery and at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months and 1 year following cataract surgery with 3.2-mm corneal incision. At every stage, optical changes were calculated as the difference between pre- and post-surgery data (in each follow-up) using the formulas of obliquely crossed cylinders for the refraction and Zernikes coefficients for HOA. Results At 2 weeks after surgery the mean corneal values of induced sphere, cylinder and the root mean square (RMS) of HOA were +0.54±0.27 D, -0.77±0.32 D and 0.15 microns respectively. These parameters decreased significantly (p-values between 0 and 0.01) at 3 months to +0.33±0.27 D sphere, -0.50±0.24 D cylinder and 0.10±0.05 microns HOA and were stable at the next follow-ups. Induced spherical equivalent was around zero at all visits. The changes in HOA were mainly due to trefoil aberration. Conclusions Linear corneal incisions do not change the spherical power but can induce significant values of astigmatism and trefoil aberration in the cornea. However, these changes revert fully or partially to preoperative values by the third month after surgery and remain stable with time."
https://openalex.org/W2985078752,"Polyphenism is a type of phenotypic plasticity supposedly adaptive to drastic and recurrent changes in the environment such as seasonal alternation in temperate and tropical regions. The butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows polyphenism with well-described wet and dry seasonal forms in sub-Saharan Africa, displaying striking morphological, physiological and behavioural differences in response to higher or lower developmental temperatures. During the seasonal transition in the wild, the intermediate phenotype co-occurs with wet and dry phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to characterize the secondary sexually-selected wing traits of the intermediate form to infer its potential fitness compared to wet and dry phenotypes. Among the previously described wing morphological traits, we first showed that the area of the fifth eyespot on the ventral hindwing is the most discriminant trait to identify wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes in both sexes. Second, we characterized the intermediate form for two secondary sexually-selected wing traits: the area and UV reflectance of the dorsal forewing pupil and the composition of the male sex pheromone. We showed that values of these two traits are often between those of the wet and dry phenotypes. Third, we observed increasing male sex pheromone production in ageing dry and wet phenotypes. Our results contrast with previous reports of values for sexually-selected traits in wet and dry seasonal forms, which might be explained by differences in rearing conditions or sample size effects among studies. Wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes display redundant sexually dimorphic traits, including sexually-selected traits that can inform about their developmental temperature in sexual interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2986186533,"We demonstrate the effective use of randomized methods for linear algebra to perform network-based analysis of complex vortical flows. Network theoretic approaches can reveal the connectivity structures among a set of vortical elements and analyze their collective dynamics. These approaches have recently been generalized to analyze high-dimensional turbulent flows, for which network computations can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose efficient methods to approximate network quantities, such as the leading eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrix, using randomized methods. Specifically, we use the Nyström method to approximate the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors, achieving significant computational savings and reduced memory requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated on two high-dimensional flow fields: two-dimensional flow past an airfoil and two-dimensional turbulence. We find that quasi-uniform column sampling outperforms uniform column sampling, while both feature the same computational complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2987804852,"Generic pharmaceuticals should have very little price dispersion. Economics’ Law of One Price suggests that identical goods, in the absence of trade frictions and under conditions of free competition and price flexibility, should sell for the same price, and the FDA ensures that generics are identical. In this study, we examine whether generic pharmaceuticals indeed have the low price dispersion that theory predicts, and if not, whether the dispersion seen for pharmaceuticals used to treat neuropsychiatric conditions is substantially higher than that of other drugs. Such a difference may offer an explanation for the price dispersion seen: namely, a strategy that takes advantage of buyers’ cognitive constraints and impaired ability to comparison shop. We thus assembled a list of generic pharmaceuticals and their prices using www.GoodRx.com, based on a convenience sample of the 5 most popular drugs for 10 common medical conditions listed there. Three neuropsychiatric diagnoses were used: Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. Seven other diagnoses served as controls: asthma; diabetes mellitus-type II; high cholesterol; hypertension; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; and urinary tract infection. For each drug, we identified the highest and lowest prices and calculated the mean, median and coefficient of variation (CV). We further calculated the ratios of the highest price to the median price and of the highest to lowest price. We found that the mean price CV was 43%. For neuropsychiatric drugs and controls, it was 61% and 35%, respectively. The mean high-to-median ratio was3.7 for neuropsychiatric drugs and 1.9 for controls. The mean high-to-low ratio was 5.9 for neuropsychiatric drugs and 2.8 for controls. In short, generic medications have high price dispersion, despite public availability of prices. Although our study did not examine why this price dispersion is present, the especially large high-to-low price ratio for neuropsychiatric medications suggests a strategy that exploits vulnerable patients."

Objective To investigate the outcomes of emergent oocyte cryopreservation after failed sperm retrieval from severe oligospermic or non-obstructive azoospermic (NOA) patients on oocyte retrieval day. Methods Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: Academic fertility center at Lee Women's Hospital, Taiwan, between March 2015 and August 2017. Patients: For 203 couples with NOA(n = 200) or severe oligospermia(n = 3), testicular spermatozoa (n = 67 cycles) or frozen donor sperm (n = 209 cycles) were injected into fresh or frozen-thawed oocytes via 276 intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates (LBRs). Results In the 67 cycles involving the use of fresh testicular spermatozoa, no significant differences were observed between fresh and warmed oocytes with respect to the fertilization rates (69.2% vs. 74.1%; p = 0.27), number of Day-3 embryos (8.6±4.4 vs. 6.4±3.4; p = 0.08), number of good-quality Day-3 embryos (4.5±3.9vs. 4.7±3.0; p = 0.45), implantation rates (29.1% vs. 17.8%; p = 0.21), clinical pregnancy rates (36.4% vs. 26.8.0%; p = 0.81), live birth rates (36.4% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.46), or perinatal outcomes. In the 209 cycles involving the use of frozen donor sperm, no significant differences were seen between the two groups, except that the mean birth weights were significantly lower with fresh oocyte pregnancies than with warmed oocytes (2952±196 gm vs 2643±700 gm; p = 0.006). Conclusions Emergent oocyte cryopreservation is a feasible strategy to manage unexpected sperm retrieval failure from severe oligospermic or NOA patients on the oocyte retrieval day. There is no detrimental effect on the live birth rate when testicular spermatozoa or frozen donor sperm are injected into the thawed oocytes compared with fresh oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2986776586,"The impact of performing exercise on the immune system presents contrasting effects on health when performed at different intensities. In addition, the consequences of performing chronic exercise have not been sufficiently studied in contrast to the effects of acute bouts of exercise. The porpoise of this work was to determine the effect that a popular exercise regimen (chronic/moderate/aerobic exercise) has on the proportion of different immune cell subsets, their function and if it affects the cannabinoid system with potentially functional implications on the immune system. A marked increase in several immune cell subsets and their expression of cannabinoid receptors was expected, as well as an enhanced proliferative and cytotoxic activity by total splenocytes in exercised animals. For this study male Wistar rats performed treadmill running 5 times a week for a period of 10 weeks, at moderate intensity. Our results showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, Tγδ, and CD45 RA+ cells) and an increase in the cannabinoid receptors expression in those same cell. Although functional assays did not reveal any variation in total immunoglobulin production or NK cells cytotoxic activity, proliferative capability of total splenocytes increased in trained rats. Our results further support the notion that exercise affects the immunological system and extends the description of underlying mechanisms mediating such effects. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the benefits of exercise on the practitioner´s general health."
https://openalex.org/W2987741184,"Image compression and image encryption are two essential tasks in image processing. The former aims to reduce the cost for storage or transmission of images while the latter aims to change the positions or values of pixels to protect image content. Nowadays, an increasing number of researchers are focusing on the combination of these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel joint image compression and encryption approach that integrates a quantum chaotic system, sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and a bit-level 3D Arnold cat map, so-called QSBLA, for such a purpose. Specifically, the QSBLA consists of 6 stages. First, a quantum chaotic system is employed to generate chaotic sequences for subsequent compression and encryption. Second, as one method of compressive sensing, SBL is used to compress images. Third, an operation of diffusion is performed on the compressed image. Fourth, the compressed and diffused image is transformed into several bit-level cubes. Fifth, 3D Arnold cat maps are used to permute each bit-level cube. Finally, all the bit-level cubes are integrated and transformed into a 2D pixel-level image, resulting in the compressed and encrypted image. Extensive experiments on 8 publicly-accessed images demonstrate that the proposed QSBLA is superior or comparable to some state-of-the-art approaches in terms of several measurement indices, indicating that the QSBLA is promising for joint image compression and encryption."
https://openalex.org/W2983837405,"P21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that are subdivided into two groups on the basis of their domain architecture: group-I (PAK1-3) and group-II (PAK4-6). PAKs are considered as attractive drug targets that play vital role in cell proliferation, survival, motility, angiogenesis and cytoskeletal dynamics. In current study, molecular dynamics simulation-based comparative residual contributions and differential transitions were monitored in both active and inactive states of human PAK homologs for therapeutic intervention. Due to their involvement in cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders, it is inevitable to develop novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target PAKs on the basis of their activity pattern. In order to isolate novel inhibitors that are able to bind at the active sites of PAK1 and PAK4, high throughput structure-based virtual screening was performed. Multiple lead compounds were proposed on the basis of their binding potential and targeting region either phosphorylated (active) or unphosphorylated PAK isoform (inactive). Thus, ATP-competitive inhibitors may prove ideal therapeutic choice against PAK family members. The detailed conformational readjustements occurring in the PAKs upon phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events may serve as starting point for devising novel drug molecules that are able to target on activity basis. Overall, the observations of current study may add valuable contribution in the inventory of novel inhibitors that may serve as attractive lead compounds for targeting PAK family members on the basis of activity-based conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W2987218793,"The aim of this research was to isolate bacteria capable of biotransforming daidzein from fresh feces from pregnant horses. A Hungate anaerobic roller tube was used for anaerobic culture. Single colonies were picked at random and incubated with daidzein. High performance liquid chromatography was used to detect whether the isolated bacteria were able to biotransform the substrate. A strain capable of reducing daidzein was selected and characterized using sequence analysis of 16S rDNA, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of the strain were investigated. A facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium capable of converting daidzein to dihydrodaidzein was isolated and named HXBM408 (MF992210). A BLAST search of HXBM408's 16S rDNA sequence against the GenBank database suggested that the strain has 99% similarity with Pediococcus acidilactici strain DSM (NR042057). The morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of HXBM408 are very similar to those of Pediococcus. Based on these characteristics, the strain was identified as Pediococcus acidilactici. The bacterial strain HXBM408 isolated from the feces of pregnant horses was able to reduce the isoflavone daidzein to dihydrodaidzein."
https://openalex.org/W2988704411,"The bacteria utilizing methane as a growth substrate (methanotrophs) are important constituents of the biosphere. Methanotrophs mitigate the emission of anthropogenic and natural greenhouse gas methane to the environment and are the promising agents for future biotechnologies. Many aspects of CH4 bioconversion by methanotrophs require further clarification. This study was aimed at characterizing the biochemical properties of the malic enzyme (Mae) from the halotolerant obligate methanotroph Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z. The His6-tagged Mae was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by affinity metal chelating chromatography. As determined by gel filtration and non-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, the molecular mass of the native enzyme is 260 kDa. The homotetrameric Mae (65x4 kDa) catalyzed an irreversible NAD+-dependent reaction of L-malate decarboxylation into pyruvate with a specific activity of 32 ± 2 units mg-1 and Km value of 5.5 ± 0.8 mM for malate and 57 ± 5 μM for NAD+. The disruption of the mae gene by insertion mutagenesis resulted in a 20-fold increase in intracellular malate level in the mutant compared to the wild type strain. Based on both enzyme and mutant properties, we conclude that the malic enzyme is involved in the control of intracellular L-malate level in Mtm. alcaliphilum 20Z. Genomic analysis has revealed that Maes present in methanotrophs fall into two different clades in the amino acid-based phylogenetic tree, but no correlation of the division with taxonomic affiliations of the host bacteria was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2983812557,"RNA degradation is one of several ways for organisms to regulate gene expression. In bacteria, the removal of two terminal phosphate moieties as orthophosphate (Bacillus subtilis) or pyrophosphate (Escherichia coli) triggers ribonucleolytic decay of primary transcripts by 5′-monophosphate–dependent ribonucleases. In the soil-dwelling firmicute species B. subtilis, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase BsRppH, a member of the Nudix family, triggers RNA turnover by converting primary transcripts to 5′-monophospate RNA. In addition to BsRppH, a source of redundant activity in B. subtilis has been proposed. Here, using recombinant protein expression and in vitro enzyme assays, we provide evidence for several additional RNA pyrophosphohydrolases, among them MutT, NudF, YmaB, and YvcI in B. subtilis. We found that in vitro, YvcI converts RNA 5′-di- and triphosphates into monophosphates in the presence of manganese at neutral to slightly acidic pH. It preferred G-initiating RNAs and required at least one unpaired nucleotide at the 5′-end of its substrates, with the 5′-terminal nucleotide determining whether primarily ortho- or pyrophosphate is released. Exchanges of catalytically important glutamate residues in the Nudix motif impaired or abolished the enzymatic activity of YvcI. In summary, the results of our extensive in vitro biochemical characterization raise the possibility that YvcI is an additional RNA pyrophosphohydrolase in B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W2987627303,"Concerted efforts to identify the pathogenesis and mechanism(s) involved in pansteatitis, (a generalized inflammation of the adipose tissue), that was attributed to the recent crocodile die off in the Olifants River and Loskop Dam in Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga, South Africa have been in the forefront of research in recent time. As part of the efforts, molecular characterization of healthy and pansteatitis adipose tissue was carried out by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and de novo assembly of the adipose transcriptome, followed by differential gene expression analysis.Healthy adipose tissue consisting of fifty samples was collected from the subcutaneous, visceral, intermuscular adipose tissues and the abdominal fat body of ten 4 years old juvenile crocodiles from a local crocodile farm in Pretoria, South Africa. Ten pansteatitis samples were collected from visceral and intermuscular adipose tissues of five crocodiles that were dying of pansteatitis.Forty-two thousand, two hundred and one (42,201) transcripts were assembled, out of which 37, 835 had previously been characterized. The de novo assembled transcriptome had an N50 (average sequence) of 436 bp, percentage GC content of 43.92, which compared well with previously assembled transcripts in the saltwater crocodile. Seventy genes were differentially expressed and upregulated in pansteatitis. These included genes coding for extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling ligands, inflammatory cytokines and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) receptors, fatty acid synthase and fatty acid binding proteins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), nuclear factor and apoptosis signaling ligands, and mitogen activated protein kinase enzymes among others. Majority (88.6%) of the upregulated genes were found to be involved in hypoxia inducible pathways for activation of NFkβ and inflammation, apoptosis, Toll-like receptor pathway and PPARγ. Bicaudal homologous 2 Drosophila gene (BICD2) associated with spinal and lower extremity muscle atrophy was also upregulated in pansteatitis while Sphingosine -1-phosphate phosphatase 2 (SGPP2) involved in Sphingosine -1- phosphate metabolism was downregulated. Futhermore, Doublesex-mab-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) responsible for sex gonad development and germ cell differentiation was also downregulated.Thus, from the present study, based on differentially expressed genes in pansteatitis, affected Nile crocodiles might have died partly due to their inability to utilize stored triglycerides as a result of inflammation induced insulin resistance, leading to starvation in the midst of plenty. Affected animals may have also suffered muscular atrophy of the lower extremities and poor fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2987902162,"Naturally occurring, mixed litter decomposes at unpredictable rates when individual components do not decompose in mixtures as they do individually. Consequently, nutrient, carbon and energy fluxes associated with decomposition may be difficult to predict. However, predictability is improved when we understand the mechanisms responsible for such non-additive decomposition. In this study, we explored mechanisms to explain our previous observation that an approximately 30% increase in oat straw decomposition due to the presence of clover litter is associated with a significant increase in the activity of cellobiohydrolase, an enzyme involved in litter decomposition. We hypothesized that resources limiting decomposer microbe enzyme activity in oat straw can be supplied by clover litter. Amendment of oat straw with water, NH4Cl, glucose, or NH4Cl combined with glucose did not account for the significant, positive effect of clover litter on oat straw decomposition and cellobiohydrolase activity. However, amendment of oat straw with a complete set of mineral nutrients for plant growth did account for the entire effect of clover litter, and the addition of the complete set of mineral nutrients without N accounted for the majority of the clover effect. In our system, therefore, the majority of the positive effect of clover litter on oat straw decomposition and cellobiohydrolase activity was unexpectedly not attributable to the transfer from clover to oat straw of labile N. We found that mineral soil could substitute for the mineral nutrients other than N. This highlights the role of soil as a potential source of limiting resources for microbes decomposing litter. It may also explain why positive, non-additive decomposition has been observed in some previous studies but not in others depending on whether the soil supplied a resource that limited decomposer activity."
https://openalex.org/W2985686996,"The manganese transport regulator MntR is a metal-ion activated transcriptional repressor of manganese transporter genes to maintain manganese ion homeostasis. MntR, a member of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) family of metalloregulators, selectively responds to Mn2+ and Cd2+ over Fe2+, Co2+ and Zn2+. The DtxR/MntR family members are well conserved transcriptional repressors that regulate the expression of metal ion uptake genes by sensing the metal ion concentration. MntR functions as a homo-dimer with one metal ion binding site per subunit. Each MntR subunit contains two domains: an N-terminal DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. However, it lacks the C-terminal SH3-like domain of DtxR/IdeR. The metal ion binding site of MntR is located at the interface of the two domains, whereas the DtxR/IdeR subunit contains two metal ion binding sites, the primary and ancillary sites, separated by 9 Å. In this paper, we reported the crystal structures of the apo and Mn2+-bound forms of MntR from Bacillus halodurans, and analyze the structural basis of the metal ion binding site. The crystal structure of the Mn2+-bound form is almost identical to the apo form of MntR. In the Mn2+-bound structure, one subunit contains a binuclear cluster of manganese ions, the A and C sites, but the other subunit forms a mononuclear complex. Structural data about MntR from B. halodurans supports the previous hypothesizes about manganese-specific activation mechanism of MntR homologues."
