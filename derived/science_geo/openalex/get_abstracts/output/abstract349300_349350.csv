https://openalex.org/W1634705003,"Gasometric methods for estimating blood oxygen are time-consuming. This consideration often limits the number of observations which can be made in the course of experiments requiring oxygen determinations. In many cases it is an arteriovenous difference which is particularly desired, as in the measurement of cardiac output by the Fick principle, or the estimation of oxygen consumption by human liver, kidney, or brain. The present paper describes a rapid, simple spectrophotometric method for determination of arteriovenous oxygen differences with an"

Green1 isolated from arsenical cattle-dipping fluids in South Africa a bacterium, provisionally referred to as Bacillus arsenoxydans but since lost2, which was able to grow in culture media cantaining up to 1 per cent of As2O3 as arsenite and to bring about its oxidation to arsenate. In view of the well-known toxicity of tervalent arsenicals, now largely explicable in terms of their inhibitory action upon highly important sulphydryl-dependent metabolic enzymes3'4, it is particularly unfortunate that Green's valuable paper, being published in an annual report mainly devoted to veterinary research, apparently escaped the attention of enzymologists and general bacteriologists ; for the enzymic mechanism of arsenite oxidation was never studied while the strain was available, nor was the existence of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria ever afterwards reported."

https://openalex.org/W2316643451,"HÆMOGLOBIN is found in the Crustacea. It occurs dissolved in the blood plasma of the Notostraca1,2, Anostraca3, Cladocera3,4, and parasitic Copepoda5,6 although it is absent in free-living ones2. I have not been able to find hæmoglobin in the Branchiura (Argulus). It is found, however, in Ostracoda7 and in a parasitic member of the Cirripedia8. All these groups are Entomostraca ; hæmoglobin is unknown in the Malacostraca. Among the latter, the Decapoda have hæmocyanin as a respiratory blood pigment. I have now found hæmoglobin in the one remaining group of the Entomostraca, namely, the Conchostraca, in which, to my knowledge, it has not yet been sought."

These proteins can be concentrated by precipitation at 80 per cent saturation with ammonium sulphate and redissolved in water. Starting from that material we have succeeded in preparing a crystalline protein by using our method based on solubility curves at constant ionic strength and varying pH 3,4. The accompanying photomicrograph gives an idea of the appearance of these crystals, which have a globular form."

It involves complete dehydration and very careful handling. In the clearing medium, the specimens become very brittle and often lose important diagnostic hairs. For mounting mosquito larvae, Wanamaker1 has described a medium composed of creosote and Canada balsam ; but with this medium preparations often get distorted and take a long time to dry."
