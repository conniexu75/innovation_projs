https://openalex.org/W2080325016,"Well-defined constants of radioactive decay are the cornerstone of geochronology and the use of radiogenic isotopes to constrain the time scales and mechanisms of planetary differentiation. Four new determinations of the lutetium-176 decay constant (lambda176Lu) made by calibration against the uranium-lead decay schemes yield a mean value of 1.865 +/- 0.015 x 10(-11) year(-1), in agreement with the two most recent decay-counting experiments. Lutetium-hafnium ages that are based on the previously used lambda176Lu of 1.93 x 10(-11) to 1.94 x 10(-11) year(-1) are thus approximately 4% too young, and the initial hafnium isotope compositions of some of Earth's oldest minerals and rocks become less radiogenic relative to bulk undifferentiated Earth when calculated using the new decay constant. The existence of strongly unradiogenic hafnium in Early Archean and Hadean zircons implies that enriched crustal reservoirs existed on Earth by 4.3 billion years ago and persisted for 200 million years or more. Hence, current models of early terrestrial differentiation need revision."

The proteins were printed onto slides at high spatial density to form a yeast proteome microarray and screened for their ability to interact with proteins and phospholipids. We identified many new calmodulin- and phospholipid-interacting proteins; a common potential binding motif was identified for many of the calmodulin-binding proteins. Thus, microarrays of an entire eukaryotic proteome can be prepared and screened for diverse biochemical activities. The microarrays can also be used to screen protein-drug interactions and to detect posttranslational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2098151249,"Optical conductivity measurements on the perovskite-related oxide CaCu3Ti4O12 provide a hint of the physics underlying the observed giant dielectric effect in this material. A low-frequency vibration displays anomalous behavior, implying that there is a redistribution of charge within the unit cell at low temperature. At infrared frequencies (terahertz), the value for the dielectric constant is approximately 80 at room temperature, which is far smaller than the value of approximately 10(5) obtained at lower radio frequencies (kilohertz). This discrepancy implies the presence of a strong absorption at very low frequencies due to dipole relaxation. At room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times are fast (less than or approximately 500 nanoseconds) but increase dramatically at low temperature, suggesting that the large change in dielectric constant may be due to a relaxor-like dynamical slowing down of dipolar fluctuations in nanosize domains."

A tight metabolic association with rhizobial bacteria allows legumes to obtain nitrogen compounds by bacterial reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonium (NH4+). We present here the annotated DNA sequence of the alpha-proteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the symbiont of alfalfa. The tripartite 6.7-megabase (Mb) genome comprises a 3.65-Mb chromosome, and 1.35-Mb pSymA and 1.68-Mb pSymB megaplasmids. Genome sequence analysis indicates that all three elements contribute, in varying degrees, to symbiosis and reveals how this genome may have emerged during evolution. The genome sequence will be useful in understanding the dynamics of interkingdom associations and of life in soil environments."

Availability of new data sets, together with progress in computation and statistics, will increase our ability to forecast ecosystem change. An agenda that would lead toward a capacity to produce, evaluate, and communicate forecasts of critical ecosystem services requires a process that engages scientists and decision-makers. Interdisciplinary linkages are necessary because of the climate and societal controls on ecosystems, the feedbacks involving social change, and the decision-making relevance of forecasts."

https://openalex.org/W2061003736,"The human organic anion transporting polypeptide-C (OATP-C) (gene SLC21A6) is a liver-specific transporter importantly involved in the hepatocellular uptake of a variety of endogenous and foreign chemicals. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of multiple functionally relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OATP-C in a population of African- and European-Americans. Moreover, examination of 14 nonsynonymous polymorphisms indicated that genotypic frequencies were dependent on race. Functional assessment of 16OATP-C alleles in vitro revealed that several variants exhibited markedly reduced uptake of the OATP-C substrates estrone sulfate and estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide. Specifically, alterations in transport were associated with SNPs that introduce amino acid changes within the transmembrane-spanning domains (T217C (Phe-73 → Leu), T245C (Val-82 → Ala), T521C (Val-174 → Ala), and T1058C (Ile-353 → Thr)) and also with those that modify extracellular loop 5 (A1294G (Asn-432 → Asp), A1385G (Asp-462 → Gly), and A1463C (Gly-488 → Ala)). Cell surface biotinylation experiments indicated that the altered transport activity of some OATP-C variants was due, in part, to decreased plasma membrane expression. Given the relatively high genotypic frequency of the T521C (14%) transition in European-Americans and the G1463C (9%) transversion in African-Americans, SNPs in OATP-C may represent a heretofore unrecognized factor influencing drug disposition.

Indeed, certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)1 in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, are well known determinants of altered drug responsiveness and are often associated with drug toxicity or, in some cases, loss of therapeutic efficacy (1Evans W.E.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). More recently, there has been an increasing appreciation of the role of drug transporters in drug disposition. For example, the product of the MDR1 gene, P-glycoprotein, is an efflux transporter involved in the oral drug absorption, distribution to certain tissues, and biliary and urinary excretion of many drugs. Moreover, P-glycoprotein has been shown to have broad and overlapping substrate specificities to CYP enzymes (3Kim R.B. Wandel C. Leake B. Cvetkovic M. Fromm M.F. Dempsey P.J. Roden M.M. Belas F.

Furthermore, polymorphisms in theMDR1 gene have been associated with alterations in digoxin (4Hoffmeyer S. Burk O. von Richter O. Arnold H.P. Brockmoller J. Johne A. Cascorbi I. Gerloff T. Roots I.

Whereas passive diffusion can be involved in the uptake of many uncharged or lipophilic compounds, carrier-mediated processes are often critical for the efficient hepatic uptake of solutes and many drugs. Among the transporters expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family (6Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W.

Accordingly, given the extent of its substrate specificity for endogenous and exogenous compounds, it is conceivable that genetic polymorphisms in OATP-C may have significant pharmacologic, toxicologic, and pathologic consequences. In this report, we describe the identification of SNPs inOATP-C and their prevalence in European-American and African-American populations. We show that a number of frequently occurring variant alleles are associated with profound reduction in transport activity. Radiolabeled [3H]estrone sulfate (53 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), [3H]estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide (44 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), and [3H]taurocholate (3.4 Ci/mmol, >97% purity) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]BQ-123 (42 Ci/mmol, >95% purity) was obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]Methotrexate (20 Ci/mmol, 99% purity) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). All other chemical and reagents, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. A 10-ml sample of blood was obtained from healthy subjects and DNA was isolated using the Qiamp system (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). All subjects were unrelated, healthy, volunteer adults residing in middle-Tennessee who were judged to be healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests indicative of normal cardiac, renal, and liver function. Race was defined by self-reporting (15Senior P.A. Bhopal R. Brit. Med. J. 1994; 309: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board-Health Sciences, and informed consent was obtained. PCR was carried out using ∼200 ng of human genomic DNA, consisting of dNTPs (0.25 mm each), the specific primer pair (4 μm each), in PCR buffer II (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 2.5 mmMgCl2 and 2.5 unit of AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. The complete oligonucleotide primer sequences are provided in TableI. After the PCR, nonisotopic SSCP analysis was used to identify the presence of OATP-C allelic variants (16Hongyo T. Buzard G.S. Calvert R.J. Weghost C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The gel run time was varied to yield optimal separation of the single strands; for the most part, run times of 4–6 h were sufficient. Variations in the single-strand mobility patterns were clearly visualized.Table ISummary of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in OATP-CExon1-aForward and reverse primers used in PCR of OATP-C exons.PositionGenotyping method1-bForward primers for wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) variants used in AS-PCR.

Open table in a new tab Human liver samples (Nashville Regional Organ Procurement Agency, Nashville, TN) from Caucasian donors without any history of underlying liver pathology or prior medications were utilized in the total RNA extraction, using Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Direct cloning of OATP-C full-length cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using the primer pair 5′-GATATCTATATTTCAACCATGGACC-3′ and 5′-TTAACAATGTGTTTCACTATCTGCCCCAG-3′. Four independent OATP-Cclones from each liver were fully sequenced. SNPs were deemed to be authentic and present if the polymorphism was observed in at least two independent clones. A number of full-length cDNA clones derived from human liver samples contained various OATP-C mutations, making them suitable for in vitro expression studies. However, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create additional variant sites known to be present among European- and African-American subjects. Point mutations were introduced into the wild-type (OATP-C*1a) using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides containing the Val-174 → Ala, Asn-432 → Asp, and Asp-655 → Gly mutations were used to create OATP-C*5,OATP-C*7, and OATP-C*9 expression vectors, respectively. Two mutant sites, Arg-152 → Lys and Asp-241 → Asn, had to be introduced sequentially in order create theOATP-C*1c expression vector. The presence of the mutations was verified by full sequencing. Haplotypes could be defined when subjects homozygous at a single polymorphic site or multiple sites were identified. Additionally, when subjects homozygous for a SNP at one site were found to be heterozygous for another SNP at a different site, an allelic assignment was possible. Furthermore, the presence of SNPs in the liver-derived full-length cDNAs provided unequivocal verification of haplotype. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was used to determine the genotypic frequencies of nine nonconservative polymorphisms. The primers (based on GenBankTM accession number AC022335) and restriction endonucleases used for PCR-RFLP analysis are summarized in Table I. Allele-specific PCR was performed to obtain genotypic frequencies for three polymorphisms (see Table Ifor primers). HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates (∼0.8 × 106 cells/well) were infected with vaccinia at a multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu/cell in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells in each well were then transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or variant OATP-C cDNA packaged into pEFHis6-Topo vector (Invitrogen), along with LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The parental plasmid lacking any insert was used as control. Transport was then evaluated using labeled drug substrates as outlined previously (17Kim R.B. Leake B. Cvetkovic M. Roden M.M. Nadeau J. Walubo A. Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 1204-1209PubMed Google Scholar). In order to measure the estrone sulfate and estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide transport kinetics, radiolabeled drug uptake during the linear phase (first 3 min) was assessed in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled compound. Passive diffusion was determined by carrying out parallel experiments using the parental plasmid DNA lacking the transporter cDNA, and this value was then subtracted from the total uptake rate seen in the presence of the transporter cDNA. Michaelis-Menten-type nonlinear curve-fitting was carried out to obtain estimates of the maximal uptake rate (V max) and the concentration at which half the maximal uptake occurs (K m) (PrismTM, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All experiments were carried out in duplicate on at least two to three separate experimental days. HeLa cells transfected with OATP-C cDNA were scraped off plates, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was reconstituted with HED buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and lysed by sonication. Samples were diluted with Laemmli buffer, and 3.75 μg of total cell protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:3000 dilution) raised against the C-terminal peptide of OATP-C (ESLNKNKHFVPSAGADSETHC). This antibody was custom-made by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). In order to normalize sample loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-calnexin antibody (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with theOATP-CcDNAs using a similar protocol for transport experiments. Sixteen hours posttransfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca/Mg (138 mmNaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 9.6 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and then treated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, 1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca/Mg containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with the same buffer to remove the remaining labeling agent. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline Ca/Mg, cells were disrupted with 700 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. Following centrifugation, 140 μl of streptavidin agarose beads (Pierce) were added to 600 μl of cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were released by incubation of the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Samples of the total cell lysate (12.5 μl) and the biotinylated fractions (25 μl) were subjected to Western analysis for detection of immunodetectable OATP-C and the intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin, as described above. Determination of the statistical differences between various group parameters was determined using either Student's ttest, Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance (using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test), or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was taken to be the minimum level of statistical significance. Inspection of originally depositedOATP-C cDNA sequences revealed the presence of three nonconservative polymorphisms (A388G (Asn-130 → Asp), G455A (Arg-152 → Lys), and G721A (Asp-241 → Asn)). Based on the nomenclature system proposed by Nebert (18Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these alleles were designated OATP-C*1a (GenBankTM/EMBL accession numbers AB026257 and AJ132573; Refs. 8Tamai I.

To identify additional polymorphisms from genomic DNA, SSCP analysis (Fig.2 A) of all 14 exons ofOATP-C was performed in a group of 42 European-Americans and 22 African-Americans. The genomic structure of human OATP-Cwas determined using the bacterial artificial chromosome cloneAC022335. Four nonsynonymous polymorphisms (A388G (Asn-130 → Asp), C463A (Pro-155 → Thr), T521C (Val-174 → Ala), and G1463C (Gly-488 → Asp)) were detected. Sequencing of full-length cDNA clones obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from livers of seven European-Americans revealed eight additional nonsynonymous polymorphisms (T217C (Phe-73 → Leu), T245C (Val-82 → Ala), A467G (Glu-156 → Gly), T1058C (Ile-353 → Thr), A1294G (Asn-432 → Asp), A1385G (Asp-462 → Gly), A1964G (Asp-655 → Gly), and A2000G (Glu-667 → Gly)) (Fig. 1 A). On the basis of haplotype analysis, alleles were designated OATP-C*2 to *14 (Fig.1 B). Variants associated with OATP-C*1c (G455A and G721A) were not detected during the course of SNP screening. In addition, a number of synonymous SNPs in OATP-C were detected, including G411A and C571T (present in AF205071) transversions.Figure 2A, SSCP pattern of T521C mutations for wild-type and heterozygous subjects.

Several variants were found at a relatively high incidence (A388G > C463A > T521C > A2000G > G1463C), and their genotypic frequencies appeared to be dependent on race (Table I). G388C and G1463C polymorphisms were more common in African-Americans than European-Americans; however, the converse was true for C463A and T521C mutations (p < 0.05). The most common polymorphisms in African-Americans were A388G (74%), A2000G (34%), and G1463C (9%), whereas the A388G (30%), C463A (16%), and T521C (14%) were predominant among European-Americans. Other nonsynonymous polymorphisms were observed at low genotypic frequencies (<2%) in this study population, and their racial dependence could not be established. With regards to the synonymous polymorphisms, G411A occurred at a higher frequency in African- than European-Americans (41% versus 18%,p < 0.05), whereas C571T was more common in European-Americans (54% versus 5%, p < 0.05). An array of expression plasmids comprising 16 OATP-C allelic variants (Fig. 1 B) was constructed. When expressed using the recombinant vaccinia system (VTF-7), OATP-C*1a was capable of transporting known substrates, including BQ-123, estrone sulfate, taurocholate, and estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide (Fig.3 A). Moreover, we found that methotrexate is a novel substrate for OATP-C (Fig. 3 A). To determine the relative transport efficiencies of the OATP-C variants, we focused on estrone sulfate and estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide, as they appeared to be the most efficiently transported substrates among the compounds tested. Under linear kinetic conditions, estrone sulfate transport activities of the originally reported OATP-Cs (*1a, *1b, and *1c), were not different from each other (Fig. 3 B). For estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide, transport activities with OATP-C*1a and *1b were comparable and slightly greater than *1c (Fig.3 C). With a number of other OATP-C variants (*2, *3, *5, *6, *9, *10, *12, and *13), estrone sulfate transport activities were significantly lower than the reference allele (*1a) (Fig.3 B). Similar results were seen for estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide transport, except that OATP-C*7 now had slightly lower transport activity, and *10 was indistinguishable from the reference allele (Fig. 3 C). For the majority of variants, the transport activity differences were not associated with alterations in total OATP-C protein expression because immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 C) indicated a lack of relationship between the total amount of immunoreactive protein and estrone sulfate uptake rate. A clear exception was seen with OATP-C*2, the expression of which appears to be lower than that of the other variants, consistent with its lower transport activity. In OATP-C transfected HeLa cells, the polyclonal antibody reacts with a diffuse ∼71-kDa band that is absent in cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 3 C), showing that the antibody was specific. Treatment of the HeLa cell homogenates with N-glycosidase F resulted in the disappearance of the major 71-kDa band and the emergence of a single ∼64-kDa band (not shown), indicating that OATP-C was glycosylated in HeLa cells. With crude human liver homogenates, the OATP-C antibody reacts with proteins with apparent molecular masses of ∼82 and ∼64 kDa (not shown). For a more comprehensive characterization, the concentration-dependent uptake kinetics of estrone sulfate was examined for all 16 allelic variants, and the results are summarized in Table II. Some variants (e.g. OATPC*5, Fig.4 A) possessed significantly higher K m values, whereas others (e.g.OATP-C*6, Fig. 4 A) demonstrated lowerV max values than those obtained with OATP-C*1a. Likewise, for one variant (e.g. OATP-C*9), bothV max and K m values differed in comparison to the reference allele (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether reductions in transport activities for OATP-C variants are seen with other substrates than estrone sulfate, concentration-dependent uptake kinetics were also determined using estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide. In general, similar trends were observed for the kinetics of estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide among OATP-C variants compared with estrone sulfate (Fig. 4). Intrinsic clearances for estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide were lower for OATP-C*2, *3, *5, *6, and *9 variants when compared with *1a (Fig. 4 B), and for the most part, this was due to decreased V max. Upon association of the transport activities with the corresponding SNPs, we were able to deduce that that Phe-73 → Leu (OATP-C*2), Val-174 → Ala (OATP-C*5), Ile-353 → Thr (OATP-C*6), Gly-488 → Ala (OATP-C*9), and Asp-655 → Gly (OATP-C*10) mutations significantly reduced estrone sulfate and/or estradiol-17β-d-glucuronide transport activities of OATP-C. Intrinsic clearance values for allelic variants containing any one of these amino acid substitutions were markedly lower than OATP-C*1a and ranged from 7 to 53% of the reference allele (Table IIand Fig. 4). For the OATP-C*3 allele, it was not possible to establish whether Val-82 → Ala and/or Glu-156 → Gly mutations were important for the reduced OATP-C activity.Table IIKinetic parameters (mean ± S.E.) for [3H]estrone sulfate transport by OATP-C va"

A better understanding of the control of macroautophagy is also dependent upon the identification of signal transduction pathways that control the formation of autophagosomes (8Blommaart E.F.C.

In the present work we demonstrate that PTEN is expressed in human colon cancer HT-29 cells and negatively regulates IL-13-dependent PI 3-K/PKB signaling. Moreover PTEN, via its lipid phosphatase activity, is involved in the signaling control of autophagy, together with the downstream acting Akt/PKB. These results add a new function to the PI 3-K/PTEN/PKB pathway and also provide a new link between the control of autophagy and tumor progression. HT-29 cells were cultured as described previously (20Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Destefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Enzymes, synthetic oligonucleotides, and cell culture reagents such as Geneticin (G418) and hygromycin B were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eragny, France). The SuperfectTM transfection kit was from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). Pfu DNA polymerase, the LacSwitch® II-inducible mammalian expression system, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Monoclonal antibody directed against polyhistidine tag (C terminus), blasticidin and pcDNA6/V5-His A, B, C vectors were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Rabbit anti-PTEN, rabbit anti-actin, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt/PKB (Thr308), sheep anti-Akt/PKB, sheep anti-phospho-GSK-3β, and sheep anti-GSK-3β antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). IL-13 and cDNA encoding for the myristoylated and dead forms of HA-tagged Akt/PKB were kindly provided by A. Minty (Sanofi Elf Biorecherche, Labege, France), Dr. T. F. Franke (Columbia University, New York, NY), and Dr. P. N. Tsichlis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA), respectively. l-[U-14C]valine (specific activity: 288.5 mCi/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France). The full-length PTEN cDNA was synthesized from total RNA derived from HT-29 cells by PCR using pfu DNA polymerase and primers that add a 5′BamHI site (5′-CGCGGATCCATGACAGCCATCATCAAAGAGATCGTTAGC) and a 3′ XbaI site (5′-CGCTCTAGATG*ACTTTTGTAATTTGTGTATGC containing a mutated stop codon (*)). The resulting cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA6/V5-His, and the sequence was verified by automated sequencing using several pairs of primers at position 1–400, 365–800, 770–1000, and 980–1300. Histidine-tagged PTEN cDNA was then amplified by PCR and subcloned into pOPRSVI/MCS operator vector from the LacSwitch® II-inducible mammalian expression system. Histidine-tagged C124S and G129E PTEN mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the pOPRSVI/MCS operator vector. In a first set of experiments, HT-29 cells were transfected with 5 μg of Lac-repressor-expressing vector and selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. In a second set of experiments, stable Lac-repressor-expressing HT-29 cells were transfected with 5 μg of each pOPRSVI/MCS operator vector constructions, including the empty vector, His-tagged wt-PTEN, C124S, and G129E PTEN mutants, and selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Under these conditions, expression of inserted cDNA is repressed until inducer (5 mm IPTG) is added to the media for 16 h. HT-29 cells were transfected with 5 μg each of pCMV6-HA-tagged, myristoylated, and dominant negative Akt/PKB and selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. Before and after IPTG induction for 16 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered NaCl solution and lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, and 2 mmNa4PO7) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using the BCA reagent. One-hundred μg of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, and 005% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The polyclonal anti-PTEN, anti-phospho-Akt/PKB (Thr308), anti-Akt/PKB, anti-phospho-GSK-3β, and anti-GSK-3β antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. The monoclonal anti-His and anti-HA antibodies were used at 1:2500 and 1:3000 dilution, respectively. Autophagic sequestration of LDH and measurement of the degradation of long-lived proteins were determined as reported previously (21Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in complete medium containing 5 mm IPTG for 16 h and then chased for 4 h in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in the absence of fetal calf serum) containing 5 mm IPTG. When used, 3-MA (10 mm) and IL-13 (30 ng/ml) were added to the cells at the beginning of the chase period. As the PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor is frequently inactivated in several cancer cells and in a series of related disorders that are characterized by a predisposition to cancer (15Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 16Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypania K. Bose S. Wag S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L.

A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), we have first determined whether wt-PTEN is expressed in HT-29 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of PTEN recognized a M r 56,000 protein in HT-29 cells. To investigate the presence of mutations of endogenous PTEN, we analyzed its cDNA amplified by RT-PCR. After total sequencing, no mutation was detected on PTEN, including the region corresponding to the common phosphatase P loop motif (HCXXGXXR located at the position 123–130). To determine whether increased levels of wt-PTEN or inactive phosphatase mutants had effects on Akt/PKB activation in HT-29 cells, full-length cDNAs were subcloned into an eucaryotic expression pcDNA6/V5/His vector. Preliminary attempts to select clones of HT-29 cells overexpressing wt-PTEN were unsuccessful, probably because of the induction of cell death induced by the forced expression of PTEN as reported previously (22Weng L.P. Smith W.M. Dahia P.L.M. Ziebold U. Gil E. Lees J.A. Eng C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5808-5814PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent this difficulty, His-tagged constructs expressing either wt-PTEN or an inactive phosphatase mutant (C124S) or the G129E phosphoinositide phosphatase-deficient mutant were transfected after insertion into the IPTG-inducible pOPRSVI/MCS operator vector together with a Lac-repressor-expressing vector. HT-29 cells overexpressing the pOPRSVI/MCS operator vector with no insert were used as a control. G418- and hygromycin B-resistant clones were selected, and PTEN expression was measured at different times after the addition of 5 mm IPTG. After 16 h of induction, expression of PTEN in the selected clones was detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against the polyhistidine tag (Fig.2 A). Under these conditions no detectable signs of cell death were observed, and a 2.5-fold increase of PTEN proteins was detected using an anti-PTEN antibody (data not shown). IL-13 is known to activate Akt/PKB in HT-29 cells in a class I PI 3-K-dependent manner (13Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18515-18523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When wt-PTEN-expressing cells were challenged with IL-13 after IPTG addition, we observed a decrease in Akt/PKB phosphorylation when compared with the control cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, a robust Akt/PKB phosphorylation was observed either in C124S- or G129E-expressing cells after IPTG addition. Whatever the cell population considered no modification of the PI 3-K activity was observed in presence or absence of IPTG (data not shown), demonstrating that PTEN functions downstream of PI 3-K as expected. We have shown previously that stimulation of class I PI 3-K by IL-13 decreased the autophagic capacities of HT-29 cells (13Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) in a similar way to that observed after treatment with 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy (11Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). By contrast, in wt-PTEN-overexpressing cells autophagy was no longer sensitive to IL-13 treatment but still sensitive to 3-MA as determined by the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long-lived proteins (Fig.3) and the rate of sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme LDH into autophagic vacuoles (TableI). The increase of autophagic capacity observed in wt-PTEN-overexpressing cells after treatment with IL-13 could be due to the reduction of basal level of phosphatidylinositide (3,4,5)P3 in this cell population. As expected autophagy was reduced by IL-13 in C124S PTEN-expressing cells in the presence of IPTG. More importantly IL-13 also decreased the rate of autophagy in cells expressing the G129E mutant, which has only retained the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN. From these results we concluded that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required to control autophagy.Table IAutophagic sequestration of LDH in HT-29 cell populationsTransfected constructSequestration of LDH1-aValues are the mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab To demonstrate the role of Akt/PKB in the control of autophagy, HT-29 cells were stably transfected with the HA-tagged constitutively active form of Akt/PKB (MyrPKB) or the HA-tagged dominant negative mutant of Akt/PKB (kdPKB), and expression of both proteins was detected using a monoclonal antibody raised against the HA-tag and a polyclonal anti-Akt/PKB antibody (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the constitutive active form of Akt/PKB was operative as determined by the analysis of the phosphorylation of GSK-3β using a polyclonal phospho-GSK-3β antibody, a direct substrate of Akt/PKB (24Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, GSK-3β was phosphorylated in cells transfected with the MyrPKB construct, whereas phosphorylation of GSK-3β was not detected in cells transfected with thekdPKB construct or in control cells. Autophagic parameters (proteolysis, see Fig. 4 C, and the rate of LDH sequestration, see Table I) were dramatically decreased inMyrPKB-expressing cells when compared with control cells. By contrast, 3-MA-sensitive autophagy was up-regulated inkdPKB-expressing cells, demonstrating that activation of Akt/PKB negatively regulates the autophagic signaling pathway. The results presented here demonstrate that the signaling control of autophagy depends upon the activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Somatic mutations or deletion of PTEN are frequently observed in a large variety of cancers either at early or late stages of development (15Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 25Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Similarly to other colon cancer cell lines, HT-29 cells express wt-PTEN (26Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5667-5672PubMed Google Scholar). This result is in line with the observation that PTEN′s loss of function is not a common event in colorectal cancers (27Wang Z.J. Taylor F. Churchman M. Norbury G. Tomlinson I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 363-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Guanti G. Resta N. Simone C. Cariola F. Demma I. Fiorente P. Gentile M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data may explain why in contrast to most cancer cells, autophagy is not down-regulated in HT-29 colon cancer cells. However, alterations in PTEN expression and function is not the only cause for the low rate of autophagy in cancer cells. Recently, the protein Beclin 1 has been reported to stimulate autophagy and to suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells (5Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Beclin 1 interacts with the class III PI 3-K in mammalian cells (29Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is probably part of the machinery engaged in the formation of autophagic vacuoles. Together these data show that PTEN and Beclin 1, two proteins with tumor-suppressive properties, control autophagy at different levels,i.e. signaling and autophagosome formation, respectively. The role of PTEN in controlling autophagy is dependent upon its lipid phosphatase activity, which antagonizes the inhibitory effect of the PI 3-K/PKB pathway on the autophagic sequestration. These results point to a molecular connection existing between autophagy and cell death, because it is now well established that cell survival signaling is operative through the activation of Akt/PKB (30Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of wt-PTEN or its forced expression counteracts the Akt/PKB-dependent cell survival (26Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5667-5672PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang X. Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Pathan N. Reed J.C. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1934-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the role of autophagy in the execution of a programmed cell death remains to be elucidated, several studies have pointed to its importance in the type II cell death (autophagic cell death) (32Zakeri Z. Bursch W. Tenniswood M. Lockshin R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1995; 2: 83-92PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in the modulation of type I cell death (apoptosis) (33Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y. Crowe R.A. Cascio W.E. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that PTEN is essential for embryonic development (34Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) and that a high expression of PTEN was detected in different tissues during human development (35Gimm O. Attie-Bitach T. Lees J.A. Vekemans M. Eng C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1633-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) give credit to the idea that autophagy is instrumental during development (36Clarke P.G.H. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) and could utilize some regulatory mechanisms common with those of apoptosis (37Lee C.-Y. Baehrecke E.H. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Akt/PKB in the negative control of autophagy is compatible with the IL-13 signal transduction pathway and the effect of PTEN. Among the known targets of Akt/PKB several lines of evidence indicate that the kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) occupies a central position in the signaling cascade of autophagy in eucaryotic cells (38Blommaart E.F.C.

Actin modified to block polymerization was crystallized in the adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) state, and the structure was solved to 1.54 angstrom resolution. Compared with previous ATP-actin structures from complexes with deoxyribonuclease I, profilin, and gelsolin, monomeric ADP-actin is characterized by a marked conformational change in subdomain 2.

Purified S2 also bound to polyP and formed a complex with Lon in the presence of polyP. Thus, polyP may promote ribosomal protein degradation by the Lon protease, thereby supplying the amino acids needed to respond to starvation."

The accuracy of such procedures is classically limited by the available power and bandwidth. Quantum entanglement and squeezing have been exploited in the context of interferometry, frequency measurements, lithography and algorithms. Here we report that quantum entanglement and squeezing can also be employed to overcome the classical limits in procedures such as positioning systems, clock synchronization and ranging. Our use of frequency-entangled pulses to construct quantum versions of these protocols results in enhanced accuracy compared with their classical analogues.

Later DJ-1 was also found to be an infertility-related protein that was reduced in rat sperm treated with sperm toxicants that cause infertility in rats. To determine the functions of DJ-1, cDNAs encoding DJ-1-binding proteins were screened by the yeast two-hybrid method. Of several proteins identified, PIASxα/ARIP3, a modulator of androgen receptor (AR), was first characterized as the DJ-1-binding protein in this study. DJ-1 directly bound to the AR-binding region of PIASxα by an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay and also bound to PIASxα in human 293T cells. Both proteins were co-localized in the nuclei. PIASxα inhibited the AR transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner in cotransfected monkey CV1 cells with an androgen responsive element-luciferase reporter. Introduction of DJ-1 into CV1 cells in a state of inhibition of AR activity by PIASxα restored AR transcription activity by absorbing PIASxα from the AR-PIASxα complex, while a DJ-1 mutant harboring an amino acid substitution at number 130 from lysine to arginine did not restore it.

Both human and mouse DJ-1 genomic DNAs comprise seven exons, and exons 2–7 code for DJ-1 proteins (2Taira T. Takahashi K. Kitagawa R. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Gene. 2001; 263: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The human DJ-1 gene is mapped at chromosome 1p36.2-p36.3, where a hot spot of chromosome abnormalities has been reported in several tumors (2Taira T. Takahashi K. Kitagawa R. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Gene. 2001; 263: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DJ-1 is preferentially expressed in the testis and moderately in other tissues, and it is translocated from the cytoplasm to nuclei during the cell cycle after mitogen stimulation, suggesting that DJ-1 has a growth-related function (1Nagakubo D.

However, the mechanism by which cells are transformed has not been clarified. Another group has also identified RS, another name for human DJ-1, as a regulatory component of an RNA-binding protein complex (3Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell.

Furthermore, CAP-1 or SP22, a rat homolog of human DJ-1, has been identified by other laboratories as a key protein related to the infertility of male rats exposed to sperm toxicants such as ornidazole and epichlorohydrin in which DJ-1 in the sperm and epididymis decreased in parallel with the following infertility of rat (4Klinefelter G.R.

In addition to its expression in spermatocytes and spermatids, DJ-1 is also expressed in the sperm head and is translocated to the cytoplasmic side of sperm after the sperm toxicant treatment in infertile rats, suggesting that DJ-1 plays a role in fertilization (7Welch J.E.

ARIP3/PIASxα belongs to the family of PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins, which includes PIAS1/GBP, PIAS3, PIASy, and PIASxβ/Miz1. PIAS1 and PIAS3 have been suggested to inhibit cytokine signaling (47Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To try to determine the molecular mechanism of DJ-1 function, we screened cDNAs encoding DJ-1-binding proteins by the yeast two-hybrid method using a human testis cDNA library, and we identified PIASxα as a DJ-1-binding protein. PIASxα inhibited the AR minimal promoter activity in monkey CV1 cells, and DJ-1 antagonized the repression activity of PIASxα to AR by absorbing PIASxα from the AR-PIASxα complex. Mouse TM4 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human 293T, human HepG2, mouse TM4, monkey CosI, and monkey CV1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. pSG5rAR, a expression vector for rat AR, and pARE2-TATA-Luc, a reporter plasmid for testing AR transcription activity, were provided from J.J. Palvimo, cDNAs of human PIASxβ and mouse PIAS3 were provided from K. Shuai and H. Yokosawa, respectively. An expressed sequence tag clone, ID no. 2228314 corresponding to human PIASy cDNA, was purchased from Incyte Genomics. pGLex-DJ-1:DJ-1 cDNA starting first ATG was inserted in frame into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGlex, a modified version of the LexA-derived bait vector for yeast two-hybrid screening (53Ono T.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells containing the lacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pGLex-DJ-1, which did not activatelacZ transcription by itself. The transformant cells were subsequently transformed with human testis MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain (GALAD) fused to the cDNAs from human testis cells. Approximately 1.5 × 106 colonies were screened for lacZ expression, which indicated the association of a GALAD-fused protein with the LexABD-fused DJ-1. The plasmid DNAs in the lacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols from CLONTECH. Nucleotide sequences of the plasmids derived from positive colonies were determined by using an ABI377 or Li-Cor Long Reader 4200 autosequencer. 35S-labeled FLAG-tagged DJ-1 and PIASxα were synthesized in vitro using the reticulocyte lysate of the TnT-transcription-translation coupled system (Promega). Labeled proteins were mixed at 4 °C for 120 min and then immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After washing with the same buffer, the precipitates were separated in a 12.5% of polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and visualized by fluorography. Ten μg of pcDNA3-F-DJ-1 together with 10 μg of pEF-PIASxα-HA was transfected to human 293T cells 60% confluent in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (54Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the whole cell extract was prepared by the procedure as described previously (55Taira T. Sawai M. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24270-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of the 293T cell proteins were first immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG under the same conditions as those of thein vitro binding assay as described above. After washing with the same buffer except for 0.05% Nonidet P-40 instead of 0.25%, the precipitates were separated in 10% of polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with the mouse anti-FLAG antibody. The monkey CosI cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-F-DJ-and pEF-PIASxα-HA by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (54Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and reacted with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) or anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz). The cells were then reacted with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and observed under a confocal laser fluorescent microscopy. Two μg of a reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal, a β-galactosidase expression vector, were transfected to cells ∼60% confluent in a 6-cm dish by the calcium phosphate method (54Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared by the addition of the Triton X-100-containing solution from a Pica gene kit (Wako Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) to the cells. About a one-fifth volume of the extract was used for the β-galactosidase assay to normalize the transfection efficiency as described previously (55Taira T. Sawai M. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24270-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the luciferase activity due to the reporter plasmid was determined using a Pica gene kit and a luminometer, Lumat LB 9507 (EG & G Berthold). The same experiments were repeated three to five times. Bandshift assays were carried out as described previously (56Taira T. Negishi Y. Kihara F. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of CV1 cell nuclear extract, 2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 16 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll 400, and 25 nm testosterone was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. A labeled probe of 1 × 104 cpm was then added to the mixture, and the mixture was further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes formed in the mixture were separated in a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 × TBE and visualized by autoradiography. Nucleotide sequences used for the bandshift assay were 5′-CGAGTAGTACGTGATGTTCTAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTAGAACATCACGTACTACTCGAGCT-3′ of the upper and lower strands, respectively. To screen cDNAs encoding DJ-1–1-associating proteins, a full-size DJ-1 starting from amino acid number 1 was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain and introduced into S. cerevisiae L40 cells. A human testis cDNA library cloned in pGADGH was then introduced into the transformant yeast cells, and the colonies resistant to a His marker followed by β-galactosidase expression were selected. Among a total of 5 × 105 transformant cells, 10 colonies were His- and β-galactosidase-positive, and two of the 10 positive colonies were identified as PIASXα/ARIP3 after determination of their nucleotide sequences. PIASXα/ARIP3 has been reported to be expressed preferentially in the testis and to modulate AR transcription activity (49Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Yan W. Toppari J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3700-3704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because the longest clone contained amino acids 335–572 of PIASxα (see Fig. 1), the full-size PIASxα cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the specific primers corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of human PIASxα using total testis cDNAs (Marathon cDNA,CLONTECH) as templates. PIASxα was comprised of at least two domains, leucine zipper-like and AR-interacting domains, and four LXXLL motifs. To determine the DJ-1-binding region of PIASxα, various deletion constructs fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GALAD) were used for a two-hybrid assay with DJ-1 as a bait (Fig. 1A). Neither the N-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1–334 nor the C-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 494–572 of PIASxα bound to DJ-1. All other fragments including the original clones isolated (335–572, 340–572, and 433–572) bound to DJ-1 more strongly than the full-size PIASxα did. These results indicate that DJ-1 binds to the C-terminal region of PIASxα spanning amino acids 433–493 that includes the AR-interacting domain. The binding activity of DJ-1 to AR was then examined by the two-hybrid method. DJ-1 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain was not able to bind to AR fused to GALAD (Fig.1B). Then, the interaction of DJ-1 with other PIAS family proteins, including PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxβ, and PIASy, was tested by the yeast two-hybrid method, where DJ-1 and PIAS family were fused to LexA DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively (Fig.1C). Of the PIAS family proteins, DJ-1 strongly bound to PIAS3 and PIASxα, weakly bound to PIASy, and did not bind to PIAS1. We therefore concentrated on PIASxα in this study. Anin vitro binding assay was then performed by using35S-labeled FLAG-tagged DJ-1 and PIASxα synthesizedin vitro. Both labeled proteins were mixed together, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. Then the precipitate(s) was separated on the gel and visualized by fluorography (Fig.2A). First, it was confirmed that the anti-FLAG antibody alone did not precipitate labeled PIASxα without DJ-1 (data not shown). PIASxα was coimmunoprecipitated with DJ-1 by the anti-FLAG antibody but not by IgG (Fig. 2A,lanes 1 and 2, respectively), suggesting that there was a direct interaction between DJ-1 and PIASxα. To observe the complex formation of PIASxα with DJ-1 in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged DJ-1 and HA-tagged PIASxα together were transfected to human 293T cells. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cell extract was prepared, and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B). The anti-FLAG antibody did precipitate FLAG-DJ-1 (data not shown). PIASxα-HA, on the other hand, was detected in the immunoprecipitate with the anti-HA antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively), indicating that PIASxα was associated with DJ-1 in ectopic-expressed 293T cells. Previous studies have shown that DJ-1 was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in DJ-1-transfected human HeLa cells and translocated from the cytoplasm to nuclei during the S-phase of the cell cycle upon induction by mitogen (1Nagakubo D.

Comm. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and that PIASxα/ARIP3 was located in nucleus (49Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Yan W. Toppari J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3700-3704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular localization of PIASxα and DJ-1, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged DJ-1 and HA-tagged PIASxα were transfected into monkey CosI cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were stained with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, and the proteins were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies, respectively, and then visualized under confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 3). DJ-1 (green) and PIASxα (red) were co-localized in nuclei as shown by the yellow color (Fig. 3,Merge). Cell nuclei were identified by (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining (data not shown). We have recently found that DJ-1 was conjugated with SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, at lysine of amino acid number 130, and that this modification is necessary for DJ-1 to manifest full activities for cell transformation in collaboration with activated ras and stimulation of cell growth. 2C. Seino, T. Taira, S. M. M. Iguchi-Ariga, and H. Ariga, unpublished data. DJ-1-K130RX is a point mutant where lysine at amino acid number 130 was changed to arginine and three amino acids at amino acid numbers 57, 96, and 126 were also changed from serine, glutamic acid, and histidine to arginine, glycine, and tyrosine, respectively. Because this mutant was found to lose full activities of DJ-1 and also binding activity to PIASα (see Fig. 5C), we used K130RX3 as a negative control of wild-type DJ-1 in this study. It has been reported that PIASxα/ARIP3 modulates AR transcription activity in a cell type or promoter-dependent manner (49Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Yan W. Toppari J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J.

PIASxα/ARIP3 first stimulates and then decreases AR activity with a dose of PIASxα/ARIP3 introduced into the ARE-E1b promoter (minimal promoter), but it represses the activity of probasin promoter, a natural target of AR, in monkey CosI cells (50Kotaja N.

Moreover, PIASxα/ARIP3 lacks the inherent transcription activation function, whereas other PIAS family proteins, PIAS1/GBP and PIASxβ/Miz1, possess this function (50Kotaja N. Aittomaki S.

The beta-helical polymers retain their structure in water and unfold in a cooperative process at elevated temperatures. The peptide architecture in these polymers is a different form of the beta-helix motif found in proteins. Unlike their natural counterparts, which contain arrays of large beta-sheets stacked in a helical fashion, the isocyanopeptide polymers have a central helical core that acts as a director for the beta-sheet-like arrangement of the peptide side arms. The helical structure of these isocyanopeptide polymers has the potential to be controlled through tailoring of the side branches and the hydrogen-bonding network present in the beta-sheets."

https://openalex.org/W2101736392,Many central nervous system regions at all stages of life contain neural stem cells (NSCs). We explored how these disparate NSC pools might emerge. A traceable clone of human NSCs was implanted intraventricularly to allow its integration into cerebral germinal zones of Old World monkey fetuses. The NSCs distributed into two subpopulations: One contributed to corticogenesis by migrating along radial glia to temporally appropriate layers of the cortical plate and differentiating into lamina-appropriate neurons or glia; the other remained undifferentiated and contributed to a secondary germinal zone (the subventricular zone) with occasional members interspersed throughout brain parenchyma. An early neurogenetic program allocates the progeny of NSCs either immediately for organogenesis or to undifferentiated pools for later use in the “postdevelopmental” brain.

Female African lions demonstrate a unique form of plural breeding in which companions consistently produce similar numbers of surviving offspring. Consistent with theoretical predictions from models of reproductive skew, female lions are unable to control each other's reproduction because of high costs of fighting and low access to each other's newborn cubs. A female also lacks incentives to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding. Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female lions are ""free agents"" who only contribute to communal care when they have cubs of their own."

The activity of the complexes is further controlled by a number of mechanisms including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, interaction with inhibitory proteins, proteolysis, and intracellular trafficking (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). In yeast, a single CDK (cdc2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe or CDC28 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae) governs both the G1/S and G2/M transitions (2Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Stern B. Nurse P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In animal cells, distinct CDKs that associate sequentially with different cyclins monitor the cell cycle progression (4Pines J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Of the five mammalian CDKs strongly implicated in cell cycle control, three (CDC2/CDK1, CDK2, and CDK3) are closely related to the prototypical yeast cdc2 and have the same characteristic PSTAIRE motif in the cyclin-binding domain (5De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The other two CDKs, CDK4 and CDK6, form a distinct subfamily of CDKs in which PSTAIRE is substituted with either PISTVRE or PLSTIRE, respectively. Both CDK4 and CDK6 are known to function exclusively in the G1 phase (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Plants, like animals, possess also an array of CDK-like kinases (referred to as CDKs hereafter), but their functions are poorly defined (6Mironov V. De Veylder L. Van Montagu M. Inzé D.

Chiatante D. Plant Cell Proliferation and Its Regulation in Growth and Development. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 1-19Google Scholar).

Utsugi T. Toh-E A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, a dominant-negative mutant of an A-type CDK from Arabidopsis thaliana was found to affect negatively cell cycle progression, most probably both at the G1/S and G2/M transitions (14Hemerly A. de Almeida Engler J. Bergounioux C. Van Montagu M. Engler G. Inzé D. Ferreira P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3925-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Currently, functions of plant CDKs other than A-type remain essentially not understood. Here, we studied the function of a plant-specific subfamily of CDKs (B-type; Ref. 7Segers G. Rouzé P. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Bryant J.A. Chiatante D. Plant Cell Proliferation and Its Regulation in Growth and Development. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 1-19Google Scholar). B-type CDKs form a group of closely related kinases from diverse plant species, sharing ∼70–80% identity and comprising a distinct cluster of CDKs. Instead of PSTAIRE, all of them bear unique motifs, either PPTALRE (B1 group) or PPTTLRE (B2 group) (15Fobert P.R. Gaudin V. Lunness P. Coen E.S. Doonan J.H. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1465-1476PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hirayama T. Imajuku Y. Anai T. Matsui M. Oka A. Gene. 1991; 105: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Kidou S.-I. Umeda M. Uchimiya H. DNA Seq. 1994; 5: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Magyar Z. Mészáros T. Miskolczi P. Deák M. Fehér A. Brown S. Kondorosi E. Athanasiadis A. Pongor S. Bilgin M. Bakó L. Koncz C. Dudits D. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Unlike typical CDKs, the expression of B-type CDKs is under strict cell cycle control, and attempts to complement yeast CDK-deficient mutants have been unsuccessful. We have chosen tobacco as the experimental system because of the high degree of synchronization attainable in the tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cell line (19Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The close similarity among B-type CDKs across species has allowed us to use polyclonal antibodies against CDC2bAt from A. thaliana to identify and characterize a B-type CDK in tobacco. In synchronized BY-2 cells, the accumulation of the protein and the related kinase activity is cell cycle regulated and is linked to mitosis. We further demonstrate that the specific activity is present in the form of high molecular weight complexes, whereas the fraction corresponding to the monomeric protein is inactive, which implies the presence of a yet unidentified activating subunit. To assess the function of B-type CDKs in vivo, we have expressed a dominant-negative mutant of the CDC2bAt in transgenic tobacco. These plants were found to have an increased fraction of 4C cells. Accordingly, we propose that B-type plant CDKs play a unique role in the G2/M progression. The cDNA for CDC2bAt-D161N was obtained by mutating the codon GAT (Asp-161) for AAT (Asn-161) by in vitro mutagenesis (20Porceddu A. De Veylder L. Hayles J. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Mironov V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both CDC2bAt and CDC2bAt-D161N cDNAs were fused to the Triple-Op promoter, which is a derivative of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and has an activity comparable to that of the cauliflower mosaic virus35S promoter (21Gatz C. Frohberg C. Wendenburg R. Plant J. 1992; 2: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). The expression cassettes Triple-Op-CDC2bAt-D161N-3′Nos and Triple-Op-CDC2b-3′Nos were ligated into the pGSC1704 binary vector (22Hérouart D. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transferred intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1RifR by conjugation. Tobacco plants were transformed by leaf disc transformation (23Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann N.L. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3717) Google Scholar) and 15 independent T0 primary transformants were analyzed by protein gel blotting. The T0 plants were self-fertilized and the segregating T1 first generation was analyzed further. The tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow-2) suspension was maintained at a weekly dilution (1.8/100) of cells in fresh Murashige and Skoog medium modified according to Nagata et al. (19Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) and cultured at 28 °C and 130 rpm in the dark. The cells were synchronized as described (24Reichheld J.-P. Sonobe S. Clément B. Chaubet N. Gigot C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 245-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A stationary culture was diluted 1/5 in fresh medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma). After 24 h of culture, the drug was removed by extensive washes, and the cells were resuspended into fresh medium. DNA synthesis was determined by pulse-labeling with [3H]thymidine as described (24Reichheld J.-P. Sonobe S. Clément B. Chaubet N. Gigot C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 245-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mitotic index was determined by ultraviolet light microscopic analysis of 500 cells stained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. Tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were obtained from 5 × 104 cells by digestion with 1 ml of enzyme solution (2% cellulase Onozuka R10, 0.1% pectolyase (Kikkoman Co.), 0.66m sorbitol) for 1 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 ×g), washed once with Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 4.5% mannitol. Nuclei were released from the protoplast pellet in Galbraith's extraction buffer (25Galbraith D.W. Harkins K.R. Maddox J.M. Ayres N.M. Sharma D.P. Firoozabady E. Science. 1983; 220: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). After addition of 1% formaldehyde, nuclei were stored at 4 °C until analysis by flow cytometry. Before analysis, nuclei were filtered through a 10-μm nylon filter, treated with RNase A, and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Cytometrical analyses were performed on 104nuclei with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For flow cytometrical analysis of nuclear DNA content in plant tissues, cotyledons or individual calli were chopped with a razor blade in Galbraith's buffer and analyzed as described above. Polyclonal antibodies against CDC2aNt (courtesy of P. John, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia) and CDC2bAt were raised with the peptides ARNALEHEYFKDIGYVP and SAKTALDHPYFDSLDKSQF derived from the C termini of the respective proteins. The sera were purified with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because tobacco possesses multiple nearly identical CDKs that share the same C-terminal peptides for both A-type (accession numbers L77082, L77083, D50738, and AF289467) and B1-type (accession numbers AF289465 and AF289466) CDKs, the data obtained with the sera are cumulative. Protein extracts from BY-2 cells were prepared by grinding cells with sea sand in homogenization buffer as described (26Magyar Z. Bakó L. Bögre L. Dedeoǧlu D. Kapros T. Dudits D. Plant J. 1993; 4: 151-161Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tobacco plants were ground in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined with the Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). SDS-PAGE and protein gel blots were performed according to standard procedures with primary anti-CDC2aNt and anti-CDC2bAt antibodies diluted 1/500 and 1/2500, respectively, and a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/5000. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 100–200 μg of protein extracts were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform with 25% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After centrifugation, equal amounts of the supernatant were incubated for 4 h with purified antibodies (1/50 diluted anti-CDC2aNt or 1/50 diluted anti-CDC2bAt) and subsequently for 1 h with 25% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times with homogenization buffer and a fourth time with kinase buffer (26Magyar Z. Bakó L. Bögre L. Dedeoǧlu D. Kapros T. Dudits D. Plant J. 1993; 4: 151-161Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The histone H1 kinase assay was carried out by incubating 25 μl of the packed beads with 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 1 mg/ml histone H1 (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 35 μl. Samples were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and autoradiographed. For competition experiments the C-terminal CDC2bAt peptide was purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase chromatography on a PRLP-S column (8 μm, 300 Å) (Polymer Laboratories) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a 0–70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The competition was achieved by preincubation of the antiserum with the purified CDC2bAt peptide at 4 °C overnight before the antiserum was used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Proliferating tobacco BY-2 cell suspension culture cells were collected three days after subculturing. Proteins were extracted in homogenization buffer as described previously (27Stals H. Bauwens S. Traas J. Van Montagu M. Engler G. Inzé D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and bound to a Q-ceramic HyperD column (10 × 25 cm; Biosepra), equilibrated with homogenization buffer. Proteins were eluted by a one-step elution with 1 m NaCl in 0.5× homogenization buffer and further fractionated by size on a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 1.7 × 100 cm Omnifit column). The column was equilibrated with Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) containing 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium). Kinase activity associated with either A- or B-type CDKs was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-CDC2aNt and anti-CDC2bAt antisera, respectively. The activity of 100-μl aliquots of 5-ml fractions was assayed in vitro in the presence of histone H1 (1 mg/ml), cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor, 15 μm ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 35 μl at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated after 20 min by heating the samples in sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. The proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study the function of B-type CDKs, we first analyzed the associated kinase activity in the course of the cell cycle in the tobacco BY-2 cell suspension (19Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Because B-type CDKs had not been described in tobacco, we decided to use an antibody raised against the C-terminal SAKTALDHPYFDSLDKSQF peptide of CDC2bAt of Arabidopsis. This region is well conserved among the known PPTALRE kinases with 17 of 19 amino acids being identical. Thus, we expected the anti-CDC2bAt antibody to recognize tobacco orthologs. Indeed, the antibody recognized specifically a single protein in a crude protein extract of BY-2 cells fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1a). The apparent molecular mass of the protein, 34.5 kDa, is close to that of theArabidopsis CDC2b. Furthermore, the interaction was specific, as the addition of the peptide used to raise the antibody obliterated the signals corresponding to the protein (Fig.1b). We also analyzed by protein gel blotting with anti-CDC2bAt antibody immunoprecipitates obtained with either an anti-CDC2bAt or an anti-PSTAIRE antibody and found that the 34.5-kDa protein was easily detectable in the former but not the latter precipitate (data not shown). These results suggested that tobacco possesses a CDC2bAt homolog, referred to as CDC2bNt hereafter. Indeed, the sequences of two nearly identical (99.7%) tobacco B-type CDKs have been deposited into public data bases (accession numbersAF289465 and AF289466) with the identical C-terminal peptide SAKAALDHPYFDSLDKSQF, which differs from Arabidopsis CDC2b only in one position (Fig. 1c). Characteristically, the protein level of CDC2bNt fluctuated through the cell cycle (CDC2b; Fig. 2b), thus displaying the most conspicuous feature of B-type CDKs. The protein was hardly detectable in early S phase, started to accumulate in late S phase, reached the maximal level at the G2/M transition, and declined afterward. After immunoprecipitation with anti-CDC2bAt serum, the kinase activity associated with CDC2bNt was measured by in vitro phosphorylation of histone H1. In the course of the cell cycle, CDC2bNt kinase activity peaked later than the corresponding protein level with a maximum in the middle of mitosis (Fig. 2b). For comparison, we analyzed also the CDC2aNt protein and associated kinase activity using a specific antibody. The level of CDC2aNt protein was constant during the whole cell cycle (Fig.2b). Its activity rose in early S phase and declined during mitosis, slightly earlier than that of CDC2bNt (Fig.2b). To biochemically characterize CDC2bNt, the proteins present in a total extract of actively proliferating BY-2 suspension cells were separated in two fractions by ion exchange chromatography. The bound fraction contained most of the kinase activity (∼95 and 75% for CDC2aNt and CDC2bNt, respectively) and was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. The CDK-associated complexes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-CDC2aNt or anti-CDC2bAt polyclonal antibodies and assayed in an in vitro kinase assay with histone H1 as a substrate. The CDC2bNt-associated kinase activity eluted as two minor peaks of ∼250 kDa and more than 700 kDa and one major broad peak in the range of 65 to 100 kDa, referred to as the 80-kDa fraction hereafter (Fig. 3a). In contrast, CDC2aNt activity eluted essentially as a single peak of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 3a). Immunoblotting showed that most of the CDC2bNt protein was present in high molecular mass complexes with a relatively low kinase activity compared with that of the major CDC2bNt activity peak, whereas the majority of the CDC2aNt protein comigrated with the peak of activity (Fig. 3b). The fractions corresponding to monomeric CDC2aNt and CDC2bNt (fractions 20–21; Fig.3) contained detectable, albeit low, amounts of the corresponding proteins and were essentially inactive. To confirm that the kinase activity in the immunoprecipitated protein complexes was specific for CDC2bNt, we performed peptide competition assays for the bound protein fraction used in the size fractionation experiments above. As can be seen from Fig. 3c, preincubation of the serum with the peptide strongly reduced immunoprecipitated kinase activity. This corresponds well with our results obtained with a dominant-negative mutant of CDC2bAt and also indicated that at least 80% of the kinase activity immunoprecipitated with the same serum from the whole cell tobacco extracts could be attributed to CDC2bNt (see below). Additionally, it should be stressed that the peptide SAKTALDHPYFDSLDKSQF is highly specific for B-type CDKs. All the significant hits retrieved by a BLAST search with the peptide were confined to B-type CDKs, with at least 17 amino acids identical for PPTALRE kinases and only 12 for PPTTLRE kinases. Gel filtration separation of the flow-through fraction showed that the majority of the CDC2aNt protein was present in the inactive monomeric fractions and accounted for approximately half of the total CDC2aNt protein (data not shown). In contrast, only a very limited amount of the total CDC2bNt protein was found in the flow-through fraction and it eluted after gel filtration as a single peak of ∼200 kDa, co-migrating with the peak of kinase activity (data not shown). Thus, the pool of monomeric CDC2bNt is very small compared with that of CDC2aNt. Our data demonstrate that large amounts of both CDC2aNt and CDC2bNt are kept in inactive forms, albeit by different means. The residue Asp-161 ofArabidopsis CDC2b belongs to the triad of catalytic residues that are conserved in all eukaryotic protein kinases (Arg-33, Glu-51, and Asp-145 in the human CDK2) and are strictly required for the kinase activity by providing vital contacts for correct ATP orientation and Mg2+ coordination (28Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The mutation of the Asp residue to Asn results in loss of activity and, in the case of CDKs, has, upon overproduction, a dominant-negative effect (29Labib K. Moreno S. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3285-3294PubMed Google Scholar, 30van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) presumably because of the competition of the mutant proteins for the association with the rate-limiting interacting proteins such as cyclins. As it is well known, orthologous CDKs, even from very divergent species, are functionally interchangeable; hence, dominant-negative mutants are efficacious in heterologous systems (14Hemerly A. de Almeida Engler J. Bergounioux C. Van Montagu M. Engler G. Inzé D. Ferreira P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3925-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To see whether kinase-negative mutants of B-type CDKs are dominant-negative as well, we generated transgenic tobacco plants that express the mutantCDC2bAt–D161N under control of a strong constitutive promoter (Fig. 4). We also produced tobacco plants expressing wild-type CDC2bAt under control of the same promoter. For 15 independent lines from each transformation, the level of the protein was analyzed in 2-week-old plantlets in the primary T0 transformants and in the self-fertilized T1 population. The level of CDC2bAt-D161N was consistently lower than that of CDC2bAt (data not shown), suggesting that a higher level of CDC2bAt-D161N is incompatible with plant regeneration and/or development. Two lines from both transformations that segregated the T-DNA as a single locus were selected for further analysis. We compared histone H1 kinase activity of protein complexes immunoprecipitated with CDC2bAt antiserum in the transgenic and parental lines (Fig. 5). Production of the CDC2bAt-D161N protein correlated with an ∼5-fold inhibition of the B-type CDK activity in both DN-1 and DN-27 lines (Fig. 5). In contrast, ectopic production of the wild-type CDC2bAt (WT-14 and WT-23; Fig. 5) did not affect the corresponding kinase activity (in this case cumulative for CDC2bNt and CDC2bAt), even when produced to a much higher level than the mutant forms (WT-23). Effectively, these results mean also that at least 80% of the kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates associates with CDC2bNt and that cross-reacting contaminants, if any, contribute to less than 20% of the total activity.Figure 5Transgene expression and histone H1 activity in transgenic tobacco. Seedlings of transgenic plants expressingCDC2bAt (lines WT14 and WT23) orCDC2bAt-D161N (lines DN-1 and DN-27) grown for 2 weeks on selective medium are compared with the SR-1 control of the same age. a, protein gel blot analysis of total proteins with anti-CDC2bAt antibodies (CDC2b) and the kinase activity in protein complexes immunoprecipitated either with anti-CDC2bAt antibodies (CDC2b activity) or with anti-CDC2aNt antibodies (CDC2a activity) (see “Experimental Procedures”). b, relative CDC2b kinase activity estimated by quantification of the radioactively phosphorylated H1 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To see whether CDK activities other than B-type are affected in the transgenics, we analyzed histone H1 kinase activity in protein complexes either immunoprecipitated with CDC2aNt-specific antibodies or purified with p13SUC1 affinity matrix (p13SUC1binds CDC2a but not CDC2b in tobacco). 2H. Stals and P. Casteels, unpublished data. In neither case, any reliable difference among the lines could be detected (Fig.5a; data not shown). To analyze whether the down-regulation of B-type CDK activity affects cell cycle progression, we compared the nuclear DNA content in segregating T1 plants grown on nonselective medium for two weeks. For each of the lines, 20 plants were chosen randomly. For each plant, half of one cotyledon was transferred to selective medium to identify the siblings that lost the transgene, while the other half was used to regenerate calli on nonselective medium. The regenerated calli and the other cotyledon were subjected to the flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content. The cotyledons and calli were chosen as representatives of terminally differentiated and undifferentiated tissues, respectively. The fractions of 2C (G1 phase) and 4C (G2 phase) cells were determined for individual plants, and the siblings with and without the T-DNA were compared. As shown in Fig.6b, the expression ofCDC2bAt-D161N correlated with an ∼2- and 1.5-fold increase in the 4C/2C ratio in cotyledons and calli, respectively. The ectopic expression of CDC2bAt did not modify the G2/G1 ratio. Thus, these data showed that ectopic expression of CDC2bAt-D161N, but notCDC2bAt, affects cell cycle in transgenic tobacco. We further studied whether ectopic production of the CDC2bAt protein and its D161N mutant affects the morphology of plants. T0 seeds were germinated on nonselective medium for two weeks, and the phenotypes of the segregating populations of plants were compared. The plants ectopically expressingCDC2bAt showed no phenotypic alterations (WT-23; Fig.6a). Neither were the plants expressingCDC2bAt-D161N affected, despite a 5-fold reduction of the B-type CDK activity (Fig. 6a, DN-1). Microscopic analyses revealed no cytological modifications in any of the tissues analyzed including epidermal cells in leaves, cotyledons, and all the root cell files or particular modifications in the organization of the shoot and root meristems (the primary sources of all plant cells). Because the ploidy level and morphogenesis of seedlings is known to be under light control (31Gendreau E. Traas J. Desnos T. Grandjean O. Caboche M. Höfte H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we compared also seedlings grown in the dark and could not find any changes either. Furthermore, we did not observe any significant differences in the rate of callus regeneration from the cotyledons (data not shown). We have attempted to elucidate the function of the CDK group distinguished by a PPT(A/T)LRE motif, which is specific for plants (referred to as B-type; Ref. 7Segers G. Rouzé P. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Bryant J.A. Chiatante D. Plant Cell Proliferation and Its Regulation in Growth and Development. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 1-19Google Scholar). We identified a B-type CDK in tobacco on the basis of its similarity to the Arabidopsis CDC2b protein, the founding member of the B-type CDKs (16Hirayama T. Imajuku Y. Anai T. Matsui M. Oka A. Gene. 1991; 105: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The single tobacco CDK characterized to date (13Hashimoto J. Hirabayashi T. Hayano Y. Hata S. Ohashi Y. Suzuka I. Utsugi T. Toh-E A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) belongs to the A-group of plant CDKs (PSTAIRE-type). Here, we show that tobacco possesses a putative homolog of the CDC2bAt kinase, recognized by a CDC2bAt-specific antibody and displaying the expression pattern characteristic of this type of CDKs. As shown before for the alfalfa PPTALRE kinase CDC2MsD (18Magyar Z. Mészáros T. Miskolczi P. Deák M. Fehér A. Brown S. Kondorosi E. Athanasiadis A. Pongor S. Bilgin M. Bakó L. Koncz C. Dudits D.

https://openalex.org/W2010121586,"Activated estrogen receptor α (ERα) modulates transcription triggered by the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), which consists of Jun-Jun homodimers and Jun-Fos heterodimers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interference occurs without binding of ERα to DNA but probably results from protein·protein interactions. However, involvement of a direct interaction between ERα and AP-1 is still debated. Using glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays, we demonstrated that ERα bound directly to c-Jun and JunB but not to FOS family members, in a ligand-independent manner. The interaction could occur when c-Jun was bound onto DNA, as shown in a protein-protein-DNA assay. It implicated the C-terminal part of c-Jun and amino acids 259–302 present in the ERα hinge domain. ERα but not an ERα mutant deleted of amino acids 250–303 (ER241G), also associated with c-Jun in intact cells, in the presence of estradiol, as shown by two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We also show that ERα, c-Jun, and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 can form a multiprotein complex in vitro and in intact cells and that the ERα·c-Jun interaction could be crucial for the stability of this complex. VP16-ERα and c-Jun, which both interact with GRIP1, had synergistic effect on GAL4-GRIP1-induced transcription in the presence of estradiol, and this synergistic effect was not observed with the ERα mutant VP16-ER241G or when c-Fos, which bound GRIP1 but not ERα, was used instead of c-Jun. Finally, ER241G was inefficient for regulation of AP-1 activity, and an ERα truncation mutant encompassing the hinge domain had a dominant negative effect on ERα action. These results altogether demonstrate that ERα can bind to c-Jun in vitro and in intact cells and that this interaction, by stabilizing a multiprotein complex containing p160 coactivator, is likely to be involved in estradiol regulation of AP-1 responses. Activated estrogen receptor α (ERα) modulates transcription triggered by the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), which consists of Jun-Jun homodimers and Jun-Fos heterodimers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interference occurs without binding of ERα to DNA but probably results from protein·protein interactions. However, involvement of a direct interaction between ERα and AP-1 is still debated. Using glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays, we demonstrated that ERα bound directly to c-Jun and JunB but not to FOS family members, in a ligand-independent manner. The interaction could occur when c-Jun was bound onto DNA, as shown in a protein-protein-DNA assay. It implicated the C-terminal part of c-Jun and amino acids 259–302 present in the ERα hinge domain. ERα but not an ERα mutant deleted of amino acids 250–303 (ER241G), also associated with c-Jun in intact cells, in the presence of estradiol, as shown by two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We also show that ERα, c-Jun, and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 can form a multiprotein complex in vitro and in intact cells and that the ERα·c-Jun interaction could be crucial for the stability of this complex. VP16-ERα and c-Jun, which both interact with GRIP1, had synergistic effect on GAL4-GRIP1-induced transcription in the presence of estradiol, and this synergistic effect was not observed with the ERα mutant VP16-ER241G or when c-Fos, which bound GRIP1 but not ERα, was used instead of c-Jun. Finally, ER241G was inefficient for regulation of AP-1 activity, and an ERα truncation mutant encompassing the hinge domain had a dominant negative effect on ERα action. These results altogether demonstrate that ERα can bind to c-Jun in vitro and in intact cells and that this interaction, by stabilizing a multiprotein complex containing p160 coactivator, is likely to be involved in estradiol regulation of AP-1 responses. estrogen receptor activator protein 1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase glutathioneS-transferase dextran-coated charcoal-stripped serum DNA binding domain ligand binding domain TPA-responsive element Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 384,N-n-butyl-11-(3,17 β-dihydroxyestra-1,3,5-(10)-trien-7α-yl) glucocorticoid receptor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate Estrogens play a pivotal role in the control of growth and differentiation of estrogen target tissues. Their action is mediated through estrogen receptors (ER),1 which belong to a superfamily of nuclear receptors that act as ligand-activated transcription factors and can be subdivided to six regions (A–F) exhibiting different degrees of evolutionary conservation (1Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Domain C encompasses the highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD). The moderately conserved region E contains the ligand binding domain (LBD) and a ligand-dependent transcription activation function (AF-2). The quite divergent A/B domains contain, in some nuclear receptor members such as ER, a transcription activation function (AF-1), which can activate transcription constitutively in the absence of ligand. Upon binding to their cognate ligands, nuclear receptors activate transcription by interacting with specific DNA sequences present in target gene promoters (reviewed in Refs. 2Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 3Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Coactivators, among them the cAMP-response element-binding protein CBP/p300 and a group of highly related molecules called p160 proteins, comprising SRC-1, TIF2/GRIP1, and RAC3/p/CIP/AIB1/ACTR, associate with receptors in a ligand- and AF-2-dependent manner to enhance their transactivation potential. They function as bridging proteins to the components of the basal transcriptional machinery, and some of them, such as CBP/p300, SRC-1, and ACTR, possess an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity that could influence the accessibility of transcription factors to the chromatin template (reviewed in Refs. 4McKenna N.J.

Nuclear receptors also modulate transcription without receptor·DNA interaction by functional interference with other transcription factors such as activating protein-1 (AP-1) (reviewed in Refs. 6Schüle R.

AP-1, which is implicated in diverse cellular processes, including differentiation, cell proliferation, and transformation (reviewed in Ref. 10Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Nature. 1988; 336: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), predominantly consists of various combinations of JUN (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) and FOS (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB) proteins. JUN proteins can form homodimers or more stable heterodimers with proteins of the FOS family that do not homodimerize. Jun·Jun and Jun·Fos dimers regulate gene transcription through interactions with a specific DNA sequence, the TPA-responsive element (TRE) (11Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar, 12Kerr L.D. Inoue J.-I. Verma I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Karin M.

Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition, ERα bearing a point mutation in the first zinc finger (18Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.-M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol.

These data together suggest that the mechanism by which estrogens regulate AP-1 activity is triggered by protein·protein interactions. A physical interaction between c-Jun and nuclear receptors has been proposed to be responsible for negative or positive cross-talk between nuclear receptor and AP-1 (17Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M.

Little is known, however, about the domains of nuclear receptors involved in the physical interaction with c-Jun or about the actual role of this direct interaction in the regulation of AP-1-dependent transcription. C-Jun and c-Fos also directly interact with coactivators CBP/p300 (26Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar) and SRC-1 (27Lee S.-K. Kim H.-J. Na S.-Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the mutual inhibition observed between some nuclear receptors and AP-1 depends on the competition for limited amounts of CBP/p300 (28Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

In addition, some coactivators likely participate in the positive interference between ERα and AP-1, because deletion of ERα helix12 (29Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R.

In the present study, we provide evidence that ERα binds to c-Junin vitro and in vivo and further characterize the physical interaction between ERα and AP-1 factors. We also show that this interaction, which participates in a multiprotein complex containing the p160 coactivator GRIP1, is likely to be involved in estradiol regulation of AP-1 responses. Reporter plasmids (AP-1)4-TK-CAT (15Philips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 19: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and ERE-βGlobin-Luciferase (30Metzger D. Berry M.

The GAL4-inducible reporters pG5luc and GAL4luc were obtain from Promega (Charbonnières, France) or from M. Parker (31Butler A.J. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4143-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively. Expression vectors for ERα and ERα mutants were donated by P. Chambon (1Kumar V. Green S. Stack G.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). ER241G was obtained from the ERα expression vector HEGO by deletion of the D domain (amino acids 250–303) using polymerase chain reaction (32Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To construct the ERα-(249–306) mutant, ERα amino acids 249–306 were amplified from pSG5 HEGO (1Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), and initiation and stop codons were added by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-GGAATGATGAAAGGTGGGATACGAAAA-3′ and 5′-AAACGCTCTAAGAAGAACAGCCTG-3′. The amplified ERα region was then cloned into the pCI vector (Promega) afterEcoRI/XbaI digestion. All ERα GST fusion proteins were constructed from human ERα except for GST-ER-(313–599), which was obtained from mouse ERα. GST-ER-(251–595), donated by S.

GST-ER-(251–312) was obtained from GST-ER-(251–595) by EagI/EcoRI digestion, filling of 3′ termini by the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I and religation. GST-ER-(179–312) was constructed by EagI digestion of GST-ER-(179–595). To generate GST-ER-(179–595), the EcoRI fragment from pSG5 HE19 (1Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P.

PBAT c-Jun Δ146–221, pBAT c-Jun Δ6–194 and plasmids allowing expression of the fusion proteins GST-c-Jun, GST-c-Fos, and GAL4- c-Jun have been described (26Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare pSPT19 c-Jun Δ224–334, aBamHI/EcoRI fragment was obtained from GST·c-Jun Δ224–334 donated by M. Karin (42Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and cloned into pSPT19 digested with BamHI and EcoRI. PTarget c-Jun Δ1–238 was constructed as follows. The C-terminal domain (codons 239–334) of the mouse c-Jun was amplified from pCI c-Jun by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-ATGGGAGAGACGCCGCCCCTGTCCCCTAT-3′ and 5′-CTTCCATTGCCCCTCAGGGGTGACA-3′ and inserted into the MluI and SmaI sites of pTarget vector (Promega). PSG5-GRIP1 (43Hong H. Kohli K. Triveri A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and MCF7 cells in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For transient transfection experiments, cells were stripped of endogenous steroids by successive passages in phenol red-free medium containing 10% (2 days) and then 3% (3 days) dextran-coated charcoal stripped serum (DCC) as previously described (15Philips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 19: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). They were then plated at about 80% confluence (106to 2 × 106 cells per 35-mm diameter well) 24 h before transfection. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was changed and cells were transfected for 16 h using the calcium phosphate DNA coprecipitation method as previously described (15Philips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 19: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). When cells were transfected by an expression vector, the same amount of empty vector was transfected in control cells. One microgram of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV β (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) for MCF7 cells, and 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid PCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for COS cells, were used for internal control of transfection efficiency. PSPT19 DNA was added up to 5 μg of total DNA per well. Cells were washed twice with phenol red-free medium and treated, as indicated, for 24 h in phenol red-free medium containing 1% DCC for MCF7 cells and 3% DCC for COS cells. CAT enzyme assays were performed in whole cell extracts after normalization for β-galactosidase activity (15Philips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 19: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Acetylated and nonacetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by TLC. Quantification was performed with a Fuji BAS1000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Raytest, Paris, France). For luciferase assays, cells were lysed for 15 min in the cell culture lysis reagent from Promega. Luciferase activity was measured using an LKB luminometer (LKB Instruments, Rockville, MD) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity as described by Roux et al. (44Roux S. Térouanne B. Balaguer P. Jausons-Loffreda N. Pons M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nicolas J.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1214-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of E. coli transformed with parental or recombinant pGEX plasmids were diluted 1:10 in L-broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After a further 3–5 h of growth, cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in a 1:5 (v/v) solution for plasmids recombinants and in 1:10 (v/v) for parental plasmid of the original culture volume of NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) containing proteases inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. GST fusion protein suspension beads (50 μl) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with35S-labeled proteins generated by the TnT in vitro transcription-coupled translation system from Promega. After three washes with NETN, samples were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Signals were amplified by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gels exposed at −80 °C. Quantification of 35S proteins was performed with a Fuji BAS1000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Raytest, Paris, France). Protein-Protein-DNA assay was performed as described by Thénot et al. (45Thénot S. Bonnet S. Boulahtouf A. Margeat E. Royer C.A. Borgna J.-L. Cavaillès V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2137-2150PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide, corresponding to the collagenase TRE (18Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.-M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 973-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was labeled by Klenow enzyme in the presence of [32P]dCTP. C-Jun-primed reticulocyte lysate (15 μl) was preincubated with the TRE (2 nm) in TKE buffer (10 mm Tris, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) plus 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dIdC) and protease inhibitors. GST fusion proteins preloaded on glutathione-Sepharose and resuspended in TKE were then added, and binding reactions were performed overnight at 4 °C. After two washes in TKE, bound molecules were analyzed on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation, transfected COS cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.4 mKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Boehringer). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation before incubation overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies (clone 1D5, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) reacting with the A/B domain of ERα (dilution 1:40). Pre-washed protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added and the incubation continued for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-c-Jun rabbit antibodies (N-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, SA, dilution 1:300) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France, dilution 1:4000). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Le Blanc Mesnil, France). Overnight cultures of E. coli transformed with pDS56-c-Jun and pDS56-c-Fos (46Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar) were diluted 1:20 in L-broth and incubated at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After a further 4 h of growth, cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in a 1:20 (v/v) solution of NETN. Cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then dissolved in the same volume of inclusion body solubilization reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). After 20-min incubation at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid silica (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with DWB buffer (6m urea, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8), recombinants proteins were eluted in the same buffer in the presence of 0.3 m imidazole. The purified proteins were then dialyzed against 6 m urea for 6 h, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was added, eight times every 2 h, until an urea concentration of 2 m was reached. Finally, proteins were dialyzed for another 6 h against 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl. The purity of histidine-tagged Fos and Jun was ∼95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein renaturation was verified by gel retardation assay using a consensus collagenase TRE, as previously described (18Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.-M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 973-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether c-Jun associates directly with ERα in vitro, we first performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments in which GST and GST-c-Jun fusion proteins, preloaded on glutathione-coupled beads, were incubated with in vitrotranslated ERα. As shown in Fig.1B, 35S-labeled ERα, which was not retained by GST, associated with the bead-bound GST-c-Jun fusion protein. The ability of 35S-labeledin vitro translated c-Jun to interact with a GST-ERα fusion protein was also tested in a reciprocal experiment. Contrary to GST-c-Jun, only a small fraction of the hybrid ERα protein was expressed as a full-length protein. Although efficacy of interaction between c-Jun and ERα was lower than in the reciprocal experiment, the assay confirmed the direct in vitro binding between the two proteins (data not shown). In vitro translated ERα mutant proteins (Fig.1A) were then analyzed for binding to GST-c-Jun to localize the ERα domain(s) required for interaction with c-Jun (Fig.1B). Deletion of the C-terminal part of ERα (mutant HE15) totally abolished binding with the fusion protein. On the contrary, the ERα mutant protein HE19, deleted of the N-terminal part of ERα, was still able to interact with GST-c-Jun. HE11, deleted of the entire DBD, also bound to GST-c-Jun although less efficiently than HEO or HE19. To assess the role of ERα domains in ERα-mediated regulation of AP-1 activity, increasing concentrations of the same ERα deletion constructs (1Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) were transfected in MCF7 cells together with the (AP-1)4-TK-CAT reporter plasmid (Fig. 1C). Mutant HE19, lacking AF-1, was as efficient as HEO in increasing the hormonal effect. In contrast, mutant HE15, deleted of the LBD and AF-2, and, in agreement with previous results (18Philips A. Teyssier C. Galtier F. Rivier-Covas C. Rey J.-M. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 973-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mutant HE11, lacking the DBD, had no effect on AP-1 activity in MCF7 cells. Both LBD and DBD therefore appeared to be important in ERα-mediated regulation of AP-1 activity in these cells. To more accurately define the borders of c-Jun binding sites on ERα, a series of GST-ERα deletion mutants were tested in pull-down experiments (Fig. 2). The GST-ER-(2–184) fusion protein, which only contains the A/B ERα domain, did not interact with radiolabeled c-Jun, in agreement with results obtained in the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 1B). In fact, deletion of 250 amino acids from the ERα N terminus (hybrid protein GST-ER-(251–595)) did not impair the interaction. By contrast, deletion of amino acids 251–312 (compare results obtained with GST-ER-(251–595) and GST-ER-(313–599)) totally abolished c-Jun binding, indicating that an"

https://openalex.org/W2063936308,"Smad proteins are central mediators of the transcriptional effects of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily that regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Smad7, an inhibitory Smad protein that prevents TGF-β signaling by interacting with the activated type I TGF-β receptor, was recently shown to induce sensitization of cells to different forms of cell death. Here we examined the effect of Smad7 on the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade and investigated the role of this cascade in both the inhibitory and apoptotic functions of Smad7. The transient and stable expression of Smad7 caused a strong and sustained activation of JNK. Expression of a dominant-interfering mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, which completely abolished Smad7-induced activation of JNK, had no effect on Smad7-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling, indicating that the inhibitory function of Smad7 is independent of the JNK cascade. In contrast, expression of the dominant-interfering mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 impaired the ability of Smad7 to promote cell death. These experiments reveal a novel link between Smad7 and the JNK cascade, which is essential for potentiation of cell death by this inhibitory Smad.

Signaling by TGF-β is initiated by the heteromeric TGF-β cell surface receptor, composed of two distantly related transmembrane serine/threonine kinases called receptors I (TβRI) and II (TβRII). Primary binding of the ligand occurs with TβRII, promoting formation of a heterotetramer with TβRI and activation of TβRI by the TβRII kinase (4Wrana J. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J.

Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). The activated TβRI then interacts with an adaptor molecule SARA (Smad anchor for receptoractivation) (6Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), which facilitates the access of Smad2 and Smad3 to activated TGF-β receptors. The Smad proteins are divided into three distinct classes based upon structure and function (7Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 8Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-regulated Smads are phosphorylated on two serines at the C terminus, within a highly conserved SSXS motif by the type I receptors in a ligand-specific manner. Thus, Smad2 and -3 are phosphorylated by TGF-β or activin receptors, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and presumably Smad8 are substrates for bone morphogenic protein receptors (7Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 8Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, receptor-regulated Smads associate with the shared partner Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where Smad complexes participate in transcriptional activation of target genes (7Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 8Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to receptor-regulated Smads and Smad4, the antagonistic Smads, which include Smad7, appear to negatively regulate these pathways by blocking ligand-dependent signaling (10Hayashi H.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). The expression of both Smad6 and Smad7 is increased in response to TGF-β, bone morphogenic protein, and activin, providing a mechanism for negative feedback regulation of the Smad signaling pathway (9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Smad7 can also be induced by interferon-γ and by TNF-α, raising the interesting possibility that Smad7 may fulfill other cellular functions independent of its inhibitory role (13Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 14Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, overexpression of Smad7 has been reported to sensitize various cell types to many forms of cell death (15Landstrom M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Smad7 induces cell death remains largely undefined. There is growing evidence that TGF-β can activate various mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, most prominently the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases (17Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Frey R.S. Mulder K.M.

The activation of JNK by TGF-β can be mediated through the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and the downstream protein kinase they activate, such as MAPK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (17Atfi A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In turn, MEKK1 phosphorylates and activates MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), which activates JNK (17Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Once activated, JNK phosphorylates the transactivating domain of c-Jun protein at serine residues 63 and 73 and increases its transcriptional activating potential (22Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is also activated by TNF-α and other stress-activated signals (23Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative components of the JNK pathway can block stress- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis in several cell lines, suggesting that activation of the JNK pathway is required for these apoptotic inducers (24Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, it has been shown that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, an activating kinase of the JNK pathways that functions in response to TNF-α, is sufficient to induce apoptosis and is required for TNF-α-induced cell death (25Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of MEKK1, which activates JNK, resulted in the apoptotic death of fibroblasts, suggesting that under some circumstances JNK signaling alone might be sufficient to cause cell death (26Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which Smad7 induces apoptosis, we examined the potential role of the JNK pathway in this process. In the current study, we demonstrate that expression of Smad7 specifically initiates a signaling cascade leading to JNK activation. Furthermore, using a dominant-negative mutant of MKK4, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK, we show that forced expression of Smad7 triggers cell death through JNK activation. These data provide a novel property of Smad7 in regulating JNK cascade activity and point out a role for JNK in Smad7-mediated apoptosis.

Madin-Darby canine kidney, COS-7, and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. To assess the kinase activity in transient transfection, COS-7 or MDCK cells, grown in 60-mm dishes, were transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3 μg per plate with vector DNA (pcDNA3). For reporter gene assays, cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method. Cells were subsequently incubated in the presence or absence of human TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 16 h. Extracts were then prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system described by the manufacturer (Promega). Light emission was measured during the initial 30 s of the reaction using a luminometer. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression from pCMV5.LacZ control vector. JNK activity was determined as described previously (17Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and endogenous or transiently expressed kinases were immunoprecipitated using anti-JNK (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA (12C5A; Roche Diagnostics) antibodies. Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein G-Sepharose and washed three times in lysis buffer and then twice with kinase assay buffer (12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). JNK kinase activity was assayed for 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 2 μg of GST-Jun (1–79), 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-P32]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding electrophoresis sample buffer, and proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit, goat, or mouse IgG using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells growing on glass coverslip were transfected using LipofectAMINE. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, stained with 4′-6-diamine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (2 μg/ml), and mounted. Morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were observed under an Olympus fluorescent microscope. For DNA fragmentation assay, cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After centrifugation for 5 min at 1,600 × g, the supernatants were collected, and the extraction was repeated once. The supernatants were incubated with 2 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h at 56 °C and then 100 μg/ml proteinase K were added, and the incubation was continued for at least 2 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 0.5 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate at −20 °C overnight. After centrifugation, samples were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in loading buffer. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. For the clonal growth assays, MDCK cells were cotransfected with pEMP4 vector encoding a hygromycin resistance gene using LipofectAMINE, and hygromycin-resistant colonies were visualized with crystal violet 10–13 days after transfection. We first examined the effect of Smad7 overexpression on TGF-β-induced JNK activation using a well characterized cell line in which the level of Smad7 expression is controlled by the human inducible metallothionein IIA promoter (see Ref. 29Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar and Fig.1A). Mv1Lu cells stably transfected with a pMEP4 vector (Mv1Lu-pMEP4 cells) or a pMEP4-Smad7 (Mv1Lu-S7 cells) expression vector were treated with the inducer ZnCl2 and with or without TGF-β before being examined for JNK activity by an immune complex kinase assay using GST-Jun (1–79) as substrate. Surprisingly, we found that Smad7 synergizes dramatically with TGF-β to induce a strong increase in JNK enzymatic activity (Fig.1B). To determine the basis of this synergism, we examined the effect of ectopic Smad7 expression on JNK activity. For this, Mv1Lu-S7 cells were treated with or without ZnCl2 for different times, and lysates were assayed for the in vitro phosphorylating activity of JNK and expression of the Flag-Smad7 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, induction of Flag-Smad7 resulted in a marked stimulation of endogenous JNK activity, which is detectable after 3 h and increases with time. In contrast, control cells carrying an empty vector (Mv1Lu-pMEP4 cells) showed little or no activation of JNK in response to ZnCL2 (data not shown). Immunoblotting analysis with anti-JNK antibody of total cell lysates from Mv1Lu-S7 cells demonstrated that approximately equivalent amounts of JNK protein were examined (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that Smad7 can effectively induce a signaling pathway leading to the activation of endogenous JNK. To confirm the activation of JNK by Smad7, we cotransfected MDCK cells with increasing amounts of a Flag-Smad7 expression vector and a plasmid encoding an HA epitope-tagged version of JNK1. After 48 h, the transiently expressed HA-JNK1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation, its activity was measured by immune complex kinase assay, and its expression level was determined by immunoblotting. Similar to the above observation in Mv1Lu cells, JNK activity was increased in a dose-dependent fashion by Smad7 overexpression (Fig.1D). Anti-HA immunoblotting of total cell lysates confirmed that the observed increase in JNK activity was not because of high levels of HA-JNK1 expression in the Smad7-transfected cells (Fig.1D). We also tested for this effect in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and found a similar activation by Smad7 (see Fig. 2, A and B, and see Fig. 3), which is consistent with the notion that the Smad7-dependent JNK activation can occur in multiple cell lines.Figure 3Smad7 activates JNK independently of its inhibitory effect on TGF-β-mediated responses. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with HA-JNK1, together with an empty vector or with various amounts of Flag-Smad7, Flag-Smad7NCΔ, or Myc-Smad6. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and immunoprecipitates were subjected toin vitro kinase assay (top). The relative levels of transfected proteins were determined by direct immunoblotting of total cell lysates (middle and bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the endogenous Smad7 protein might act as an activator of JNK, we attempted to reduce the level of endogenous Smad7 protein using an expression vector encoding an antisense cDNA to Smad7. For this, we first examined the ability of this construct to reduce the level of Smad7 protein. As shown in Fig. 1E, a strong Smad7 signal was detected by anti-Flag immunoblotting in Flag-Smad7-transfected MDCK cells, and coexpression of Smad7 antisense vector blocked the synthesis of Flag-Smad7 protein. As expected, transfection of MDCK cells with the expression vector carrying the Flag-tagged Smad7 cDNA induced a remarkable increase in JNK enzymatic activity, and this effect was significantly lowered when the Smad7 antisense was cotransfected. More importantly, expression of the Smad7 antisense alone resulted in a concomitant decrease in the basal activity of JNK, demonstrating that JNK activity can be regulated by endogenous Smad7 protein. The efficient activation of the JNK cascade by Smad7 should result in stimulation of c-Jun transcriptional activity. Indeed, overexpression of Smad7 in MDCK cells stimulated the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-c-Jun (1) fusion protein containing the c-Jun activation domain (Fig. 1F). This stimulation is likely to depend on c-Jun phosphorylation, because overexpression of Smad7 failed to stimulate the activity of a GAL4-c-Jun (1–223; A63/73) fusion protein in which the serines that are phosphorylated by JNK were replaced by alanines (Fig. 1F). Three groups of MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, referred to as p42/44 MAPKs, and the stress-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK. To test for the specificity of JNK activation by Smad7, COS-7 cells were transfected with an expression vector for Myc-Smad7, together with another vector encoding HA-JNK, HA-MAPK, or Flag-p38. The activity of immunopurified tagged MAPK was then measured by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun, myelin basic protein, or GST-ATF2, respectively. In contrast to JNK, Smad7 failed to elevate MAPK and p38 activities, which were strongly stimulated by cotransfection of the constitutively active forms of Ras and MKK6, respectively (Fig. 2A). To determine whether JNK activation was exclusively induced by Smad7, we tested for the effects of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. When transfected into COS-7 cells, Flag-Smad2, Flag-Smad3, and Flag-Smad4 were detectably expressed, as judged by their immunodetection with the anti-Flag M2 antibody. However, these Smad proteins failed to activate JNK, whereas Smad7 had a very potent effect under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2B). The failure of these Smad proteins to activate JNK is in contrast to several previous observations demonstrating that the expression of Smad7 can be increased by overexpression of Smad2, -3, and/or -4 (30Nagarajan R.P.

In several attempts, we were also unable to see an effect of overexpression of different combinations of Smad2, -3, and -4 on JNK enzymatic activity (data not shown). The apparent discrepancy between these findings and ours might be because of the sensitivity of the biological responses under study or could reflect the possibility that overexpression of these Smad proteins generates another signal that counteracts the effect of Smad7 on JNK activity. Identification of the mechanisms by which Smad7 activates JNK cascade will help clarify this issue. One mechanism proposed to explain the inhibitory function of Smad7 in the TGF-β signaling pathway is based on the ability of Smad7 to bind the activated type I receptor, thereby preventing access and phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads. In contrast with its stimulatory effect on JNK, stable expression of Smad7 blocked the ability of TGF-β to induce growth arrest and expression of the endogenous PAI-1 gene (see Refs. 27Prunier C.

To demonstrate this directly, we examined whether the expression of a nonfunctional truncated form of Smad7 (Smad7NCΔ), which no longer interacts with the TGF-β receptor (10Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), might be able to trigger JNK activation (Fig. 3). To test this possibility, we compared the effect of increasing amounts of expression vectors for Smad7 and Smad7NCΔ on JNK activity. Similar to overexpression of wild-type Smad7, overexpression of Smad7NCΔ consistently induced a marked increase in the in vitrophosphorylating activity of JNK (Fig. 3), thus providing direct evidence that Smad7 elevates JNK activity by a mechanism that is independent of its ability to interact with the TGF-β type I receptor and disruption of TGF-β signaling pathways. In support of this notion, we found that Smad6, which interacts stably with the TGF-β type I receptor to inhibit TGF-β signaling through Smad proteins (11Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate JNK enzymatic activity (Fig. 3). We have reported previously that the activation of the JNK cascade by constitutively activated mutants of MKK4 and MEKK1 can suppress the ability of TGF-β to mediate gene expression by repressing Smad2 and Smad3 transcriptional activities (36Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate the role of the Smad7-dependent activation of JNK in TGF-β signaling, we examined whether the expression of a dominant-interfering mutant of MKK4 (MKK4.Ala), the kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK, abrogated Smad7-induced JNK activation. As shown in Fig.4A, expression of MKK4.Ala inhibited Smad7-dependent activation of JNK, indicating that Smad7 signaling was specifically blocked in the transfected cells. To test the hypothesis of a role for JNK activation in Smad7 inhibition of TGF-β signaling, we turned our attention on the luciferase CAGA reporter plasmid, which contains concatamerized CAGA elements shown previously to bind complexes of Smad3 and Smad4 and to be transactivated by both TGF-β and complex Smad3-Smad4 expression. As expected, TGF-β-induced expression of the reporter gene was markedly inhibited by Smad7 expression in HepG2 cells (Fig.4B). Under these experimental conditions, we confirmed (36Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,37Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that expression of MKK4.Ala or a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) increased the sensitivity of the cells to TGF-β (Fig.4B). However, expression of MKK4.Ala or TAM67, together with Smad7, did not block the inhibitory effect of Smad7 even at the highest amounts of transfected cDNA (see Fig. 4B, and data not shown), suggesting that this inhibitory function of Smad7 is independent of JNK signaling pathway. A similar conclusion could be drawn when the ARE-Lux reporter, which contains three copies of the ARE from the Xenopus Mix.2 promoter linked to a basic TATA box and a luciferase reporter gene, was used in these analyses (Fig. 4C). This ARE is stimulated by TGF-β/activin signaling pathways, which induce assembly of a DNA-binding complex that is composed of the forkhead-containing DNA-binding protein Fast-1 and the complex Smad2-Smad4 (38Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In the course of these analyses, we also investigated the ability of a constitutively activated mutant of MKK4 (MKK4.ED) or wild-type c-Jun to modulate Smad7-dependent repression of TGF-β signaling. Transfection of HepG2 cells with the expression vectors encoding MKK4.ED or wild-type c-Jun, together with the reporters CAGA (Fig.4D) or ARE-Lux (Fig. 4E), stimulated by themselves luciferase activity with an efficiency approaching that elicited by transfection of Smad7. Interestingly, MKK4.ED or wild-type c-Jun synergize with Smad7 to induce a strong suppression of TGF-β-induced luciferase activity, supporting the notion that Smad7 and JNK signaling are not acting through the same pathway to suppress TGF-β-dependent gene expression. The JNK pathway has been widely studied in the context of stress activation and induction of programmed cell death. If Smad7-induced JNK activation leads to cell death, it would be expected that coexpression of the dominant inhibitory MKK4.Ala, which suppresses Smad7-dependent JNK activation, would also inhibit apoptosis induced by Smad7. To test this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for GFP-Smad7, which allows specific detection of transfected cells by its green fluorescence. After 24 h, cells were transferred into medium containing 0.1% FCS and maintained in this medium for 24 h before being examined for apoptosis. Expression of GFP alone had no significant effect on cell viability, cell morphology, or nuclear structure. In clear contrast, COS-7 cells that express GFP-Smad7 fusion protein displayed morphological alterations that are characteristic of apoptotic cells, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of nucleus (Fig.5A). Annexin V staining confirms that the death of COS-7 cells induced by overexpression of Smad7 occurred by an apoptotic mechanism (data not shown). Interestingly, coexpression of MKK4.Ala blocked the majority of Smad7-induced cell death, demonstrating that the JNK pathway is required for this process. To quantitate these results, cells were scored in a blinded manner as healthy or apoptotic by cell morphology. Over 35% of green cells arising from transfection of GFP-Smad7 showed morphological changes consistent with apoptosis, whereas only 8–10% of cells that had been cotransfected with GFP-Smad7 plasmid, in combination with MKK4.Ala, exhibited such a phenotype (Fig.5B). The transient transfection assays described above suggested that the apoptotic function of Smad7 was linked to its ability to promote JNK activation. To confirm these results, wild-type MDCK cells or MDCK cells overexpressing MKK4.Ala (39Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were stably transfected with a Smad7 expression vector, and drug-resistant pools of transfected cells (Fig.5C) were examined for the sensitivity to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. As expected from our previous studies, expression of Smad7 resulted in a marked increase in nuclear DNA fragmentation, and this effect was significantly lowered when the dominant-interfering mutant MKK4.Ala was cotransfected (Fig.5D). To examine further the role of the JNK cascade in Smad7-mediated cell death, MDCK cells were cotransfected with a vector encoding a hygromycin resistance gene and maintained in 0.1% FCS medium for 48 h. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were visualized with crystal violet 10–13 days after transfection. As shown in Fig.5E, expression of Smad7 reduced the number of viable MDCK cells by 80% or more, reinforcing the role of Smad7 as a positive mediator of cell death. This cytotoxic effect of Smad7 is lost in cells cotransfected with the dominant-interfering mutant MKK4.Ala, thereby providing strong evidence that Smad7 induces apoptotic cell death through activation of the JNK cascade. We have reported previously that expression of Smad4, but not of Smad3, induces programmed cell death in MDCK cells (28Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Prunier C. Ferrand N. Frottier B. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3302-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, coexpression of Smad3, along with Smad4, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of viable cells, suggesting that Smad4 and Smad3 may function in a cooperative way to induce cell death (28Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of Smad3 and/or Smad4 under identical experimental conditions did not affect the activity of JNK (see Fig.2B, and data not shown), which is consistent with the hypothesis that JNK cascade is not a component of the Smad3/Smad4-triggered signaling cascade resulting in apoptotic cell death. To explore the possibility that Smad3/Smad4 could induce cell death via the induction of Smad7, we took advantage of the availability of the expression vector encoding the antisense cDNA to Smad7, which dramatically inhibits Smad7 protein synthesis (Fig.1E). Using the clonal growth assay developed for our studies on Smad7 (Fig. 5E), we observed that expression of Smad3/Smad4 reduced the number of survival colonies by about 80%, consistent with our previous studies (28Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In cells cotransfected with the antisense cDNA to Smad7, Smad3/Smad4 reduced the number of viable MDCK cells as strongly as it is in the absence of the Smad7 antisense (Fig. 5F), indicating that the Smad3/Smad4-induced apoptotic pathway is separate from the pathway that leads to induction of Smad7 expression. The identification of Smad proteins as essential downstream mediators of TGF-β transcriptional responses has been a major advance in understanding how this cytokine exerts its biological effects. Upon phosphorylation on C-terminal serine residues by the activated type I receptor, Smad2 or Smad3 associate with Smad4, and the resulting complexes move into the nucleus to regulate expression of a large number of target genes, most of which remain to be identified. The Smad signaling pathway can be limited by Smad7, which is suggested to function by binding to the activated receptor complex to prevent phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Here, we report an additional and heretofore unexpected role for Smad7 in the activation of the JNK signaling pathway, which appears to play a critical role in mediating the apoptotic function of Smad7. At present, the molecular mechanism whereby Smad7 induces activation of the JNK cascade is unknown. One attractive possibility is that Smad7 might stimulate JNK activity by directly binding to an upstream kinase of the JNK cascade, such as MKK4, MEKK1, ASK1, or TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1). However, we were unable to detect such an interaction using different techniques, including immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting and in vitro binding assays with GST-Smad7 produced in bacteria (data not shown). Because association could be transient or unstable, these negative results do not definitively rule out the possibility of a direct interaction of Smad7 with a kinase of the JNK cascade. Therefore, the molecular framework that we proposed gives rise to a number of areas for future studies, including the identification of downstream targets of Smad7 in the biochemical route to JNK and the investigation of how these targets are regulated to initiate JNK activation and apoptotic cell death."

CD244 is an N-glycosylated protein predominantly expressed on NK cells, γδ T cells, monocytes, and a subset of CD8+ T cells (29Nakajima H. Colonna M. Hum.

Moreover, a defect in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in some XLP patients was attributed to dysfunctional signaling by CD244 (11Parolini S. Bottino C. Falco M. Augugliaro R. Giliani S. Franceschini R.

Lane W.S. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7470-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dok1 is present in hematopoietic cells, where Dok1 constitutively associates with the p120Ras GTPase-activating protein (32Sylla B.S. Murphy K. Cahir-McFarland E. Lane W.S. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7470-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Classically, high affinity association of SH2 domains with Tyr-containing motifs (i) depends upon phosphorylation of the Tyr in the ligand and (ii) requires that the Tyr(P) be embedded within a specific amino acid sequence, where an additional contact C-terminal (usually at position +3) to the Tyr(P) is established. To bind to the non-phosphorylated CD150 Tyr281 motif, the SH2 domain of SH2D1A uses a “three-pronged” modality of binding instead of a conventional “two-pronged” recognition (16Sayos J. Wu C.

The additional interactions of SH2D1A involve the side chains of residues −2 and −1 (Thr279 and Ile280) adjacent to Tyr281 in the CD150 peptide. These interact with residues in the βD strand of the SH2 domain (33Poy F. Yaffe M.B. Sayos J. Saxena K. Morra M. Sumegi J. Cantley L.C. Terhorst C. Eck M.J. Mol.

Several classes of SH2D1A mutations have so far been identified in XLP patients: (a) micro/macrodeletions, (b) mutations interfering with mRNA transcription or splicing, and (c) nonsense mutations or amino acid substitutions. Because missense mutations spanning the entireSH2D1A coding sequence have been identified in XLP patients (9Strahm B. Rittweiler K. Duffner U. Brandau O. Orlowska-Volk M. Karajannis M.A. Stadt U.

Here, we analyze a series of SH2D1A proteins with missense mutations byin vitro and in vivo studies. We report differential binding of these mutants to the hematopoietic cell receptors CD150, CD244, CD229, and CD84. Two major classes of SH2D1A missense mutations are identified depending on their protein half-life. Particular attention was focused on the SH2D1A T53I amino acid substitution because its ability to bind to non-phosphorylated CD150 is affected, whereas it binds normally to phosphorylated CD150. However, further studies show that T53I does not bind to receptors CD229 and CD244. The study emphasizes that SH2D1A controls multiple signal transduction pathways relevant to the pathogenesis of XLP. COS-7 cells were cultured as described (16Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The Jurkat T cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Anti-human CD150 monoclonal antibody was a gift from DNAX Research Institute (25Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and rabbit anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in Western blotting. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The anti-mouse CD244 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-human CD229 (clone HCD229.1.84) and CD84 (clones CD84.1.2.21 and CD84.1.7) antibodies were produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with 300.19 murine cells stably transfected with full-length cDNA. HumanSH2D1A cDNA was cloned in vector pCMV-FLAG (Kodak) to generate a FLAG-SH2D1A construct. cDNAs coding for SH2D1A mutants based on XLP patient sequences were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in polymerase chain reactions using oligonucleotide primers incorporating the point mutation. Human WTSH2D1A and mutants R32Q, T53I, and T68I coding regions were cloned in vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate GST-SH2D1A constructs. The mouse CD244 coding region was cloned in vector pcDNA3.1. The human CD150 cDNA in vector pJFE14-SRα was a gift from DNAX Research Institute. HumanCD229 and CD84 cDNAs were expressed by a pcDNA3.1 vector. COS-7 cells (10 × 106) were transfected with different expression vectors containing the appropriate cDNA insert by the DEAE-dextran method (38Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1995)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Suppl. 17, p. 16.13.1, Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar) or using the LipofectAMINE method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. For cloning of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) SH2D1A, total mRNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using the Trizol extraction method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oligonucleotides based on the 5′-untranslated (forward, GCC TGG TGG ACT CTT GG) and 3′-untranslated (reverse, GAA CTG TAT TAT CTA CAA TAT ATA AGA C) regions of human SH2D1A were generated and used to amplify monkey SH2D1A cDNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Products were subcloned in a TA cloning vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced. After lysis of the cells with 0.5% CHAPS, immunoprecipitations were done using the indicated antibodies and 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.). Filters were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk (or 3% bovine serum albumin) and then probed with the indicated antibodies. Bound antibody was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce). For anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, we used a directly conjugated horseradish peroxidase/antibody mixture (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Transfected COS-7 cells were starved for methionine and cysteine for 1 h and then pulse-labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine using Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals, Cleveland, OH) (39Hall C. Berkhout B. Alarcon B. Sancho J. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized proteins were chased for various times in complete medium containing cycloheximide (final concentration of 25 μg/ml). Cell aliquots (5 × 106 cells/lane) were lysed, and the fate of radiolabeled SH2D1A was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the M5 antibody to FLAG. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 15% density. Gels were fixed and incubated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before autoradiography. Interactions between GST-SH2D1A proteins and a synthetic fluorescent peptide of 11 amino acids (KSLTIpYAQVQK) corresponding to residues 276–286 of human CD150 were measured in a fluorescence polarimeter according to Danliker et al. (40Danliker W.B. Levin J. Rao B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Polarization values were determined in a Beacon system and were expressed in millipolarization units. Before performing equilibrium binding experiments, the time to reach equilibrium was determined. Under the conditions used, the time required was <2 min (data not shown). Equilibrium binding isotherms were constructed by titrating a fixed concentration of fluorescent peptide (below the probable kD) with increasing amounts of the GST-SH2D1A mutant chimeric proteins. The same data were also used to construct a Klotz plot (millipolarization unitsversus log[GST-SH2D1A mutants]). The curves were fit by nonlinear regression using Prism curve-fitting software (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). One XLP patient was found to carry a mutation in the 3′-splice acceptor of the second intron of SH2D1A, determining an inefficiency in mRNA processing (16Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Because of this mutation, only 5–10% of WT mRNA was present in the patient's T cells, whereas most of the SH2D1A mRNA did not contain exon 2 (16Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether missense mutations can affect the stability of the SH2D1A protein and thus the SH2D1A level in the cell, leading to a disease phenotype. To test this hypothesis, the protein half-lives of 10 mutant SH2D1A proteins (Y7C (βA2), S28R (βB1), R32T (βB5), C42W (βC4), T53I (βD4), T68I (βE6), Q99P, P101L (βG2), V102G (βG3), and Stop128R (tail)) (Fig. 1) were determined. The location of each mutation in the three-dimensional structure of the protein (33Poy F. Yaffe M.B. Sayos J. Saxena K. Morra M. Sumegi J. Cantley L.C. Terhorst C. Eck M.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) is indicated in parentheses. These mutations exclusively correspond to amino acid residues that are highly conserved in human, rhesus monkey (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF322912), cotton-top tamarin (accession number AF322913), and mouse SH2D1A genes (Fig. 1). Specifically, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected withSH2D1A cDNAs (WT or mutant) in a FLAG-tagged vector and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 3 h. The cells were then incubated in medium containing cycloheximide and nonradioactive amino acids for the indicated time intervals (0, 3, 6, 10, and 20 h) (Fig.2a). The half-life of the WT SH2D1A protein was also measured in the Jurkat T cell line (Fig.2b). Jurkat cells were labeled under the same conditions, and the endogenous SH2D1A protein was immunoprecipitated. Fig.2b shows that the half-life of T cell endogenous SH2D1A is comparable to that measured in the COS-7 cell assay (Fig.2a). When FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a), a number of missense mutations were found to dramatically shorten the half-life of SH2D1A. This was readily detectable because the WT SH2D1A protein was stable with an apparent half-life of ∼18 h (Fig. 2a,first panel). The half-lives of three mutant SH2D1A proteins (C42W, T53I, and T68I) were unaffected by the mutation, whereas the majority of the amino acid substitutions resulted in an extremely shortened protein half-life (Fig. 2a). Inspection of the SH2D1A three-dimensional structure (33Poy F. Yaffe M.B. Sayos J. Saxena K. Morra M. Sumegi J. Cantley L.C. Terhorst C. Eck M.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) indicated that most of the amino acid substitutions that affect protein half-life localized to the backbone of the SH2D1A SH2 domain. Surprisingly, the Stop129R mutant, the only point mutation outside of the SH2 domain, also had a drastically shortened half-life. Taken together, these observations support the notion that SH2D1A needs to be present in the cell at an optimal level in order to function normally. Previous experiments had shown that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of human CD150 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosines (16Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses showed that SHP-2 binds to phosphorylated tyrosines 281 and 327 of the cytoplasmic tail of CD150. The peptide segment around Tyr327 also binds SH2D1A, but this interaction appears to be more dependent upon phosphorylation of the tyrosine than the Tyr281site. 2D. Howie and C. Terhorst, submitted for publication. To test whether mutant SH2D1A proteins had lost their ability to block recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to CD150, a COS-7 cell assay was used. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with combinations of plasmids coding for SH2D1A (WT or mutant) and CD150. To phosphorylate the tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CD150, a cDNA encoding the tyrosine kinase Fyn was cotransfected. After 72 h, cells were lysed, and post-nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD150 antibodies. WT SH2D1A bound to both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD150 and, as expected, blocked SHP-2 recruitment to phosphorylated CD150 completely (Fig.3A, lanes 3 and4). Almost all SH2D1A mutants had lost their ability to block SHP-2 recruitment; as expected, the proteins that had shortened half-lives belonged to this group (data not shown). Two mutants that disrupt the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of SH2D1A were analyzed. Mutant R32Q, which was predicted to affect interactions with both the Tyr(P)281 and Tyr281 peptides (33Poy F. Yaffe M.B. Sayos J. Saxena K. Morra M. Sumegi J. Cantley L.C. Terhorst C. Eck M.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was unable to bind the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD150 proteins (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and6). R32Q also completely failed to block SHP-2 recruitment. Because mutant R32Q does not only have a mutation that grossly disrupts binding to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD150, as R32Q is present in reduced copies in the cell, its lack of SHP-2 competition is likely to be the result of both properties. By contrast, mutant C42W is a relatively stable protein (Fig.2a), and its position in the SH2D1A structure predicts that it could also interfere with binding to both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD150. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig.3B (lanes 7 and 8). This lack of binding is therefore consistent with an important role for Cys42 in the interactions with the CD150 tyrosine site. A second stable mutant protein (T68I) did bind phosphorylated CD150, but not the non-phosphorylated CD150 protein (Fig. 3A,lanes 7 and 8). However, its ability to block SHP-2 binding to phosphorylated CD150 was reduced. This mutation affects the interaction of Val284 at"

Treatment of chromaffin cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate produces disassembly of cortical F-actin, increasing the number of vesicles at release sites (Vitale, M. L., Seward, E. P., and Trifaró, J. M. (1995) Neuron 14, 353–363). Here, we provide evidence for involvement of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), a protein kinase C substrate, in chromaffin cell secretion. MARCKS binds and cross-links F-actin, the latter is inhibited by protein kinase C-induced MARCKS phosphorylation. MARCKS was found in chromaffin cells by immunoblotting. MARCKS was also detected by immunoprecipitation. In intact or permeabilized cells MARCKS phosphorylation increased upon stimulation with 10−7 m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This was accompanied by cortical F-actin disassembly and potentiation of secretion. MARCKS phosphorylation, cortical F-actin disassembly, and potentiation of Ca2+-evoked secretion were inhibited by a peptide (MARCKS phosphorylation site domain sequence (MPSD)) with amino acid sequence corresponding to MARCKS phosphorylation site. MPSD was phosphorylated in the process. A similar peptide (alanine-substituted phosphorylated site domain) with four serine residues of MPSD substituted by alanines was ineffective. These results provide the first evidence for MARCKS involvement in chromaffin cell secretion and suggest that regulation of cortical F-actin cross-linking might be involved in this process.

It has been suggested that the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton is involved in regulated secretion controlling the number of secretory vesicles present at release sites in the subplasmalemmal region (3Trifaró J.M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, F-actin forms a cortical network that excludes the large majority of chromaffin vesicles from plasma membrane docking, and disruption of F-actin networks allows translocation of vesicles to the plasma membrane in preparation for exocytosis (2Vitale M.L.

Previous work has demonstrated that scinderin, an F-actin severing protein discovered and cloned in our laboratory (6Rodrı́guez del Castillo A. Lemaire S. Tchakarov L. Jeyapragasan M. Doucet J.P.

Biochem. 1994; 141: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), played a major role in the release of chromaffin vesicles by controlling disassembly of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton through Ca2+-dependent and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate-modulated mechanisms (8Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau S.K Trifaró J.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, other pathways or treatments that produce disassembly of cortical F-actin should increase the size of the release-ready vesicle pool with a consequent enhancement in the initial rate of vesicular exocytosis (4Vitale M.L.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). How PKC stimulation exerts its potentiating effect on secretion and which are its physiological substrates in this response are still largely unknown. In recent years, an acidic myristoylated protein and substrate of PKC, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), has been implicated in several cellular processes such as motility, mitosis, cytoskeleton dynamics, phagocytosis, and transformation (19Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 438-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 21Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Allen L.A.

MARCKS has a basic domain of 25 amino acids, located in the middle of the primary structure, which is the phosphorylation site domain (PSD) (19Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 438-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 21Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MARCKS PSD domain, in addition to containing four serines that are possible substrates for PKC, can also interact with calmodulin, phospholipids, and actin in a complex manner (24Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McIlroy B.K. Walters J.D. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of MARCKS in the PSD domain by PKC inhibits F-actin cross-linking (26Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). MARCKS is known to be present in chromaffin cells (29Powis D.A. O'Brien K.J. Harrison J.M. Jarvie P.E. Dunkley P.R. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and correlations between its phosphorylation and several aspects of neurosecretion have been published (30Coffey E.T.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work from our laboratory has also suggested the involvement of MARCKS in the release of serotonin from platelets (33Elzagallaai A. Rosé S.D. Trifaró J.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 894-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no specific role has been demonstrated for this protein in the exocytotic process. In this study, a synthetic peptide with the bovine MARCKS PSD (MPSD) sequence has been used in preparations of permeabilized chromaffin cells to evaluate the role of MARCKS in F-actin network dynamics and secretion. The results presented here indicate that peptide MPSD reduced both cortical F-actin disassembly and MARCKS phosphorylation in response to PKC activation by PMA, and these are accompanied by inhibition of PKC potentiation of exocytosis. The results suggest that the PKC effect on catecholamine release is mediated through MARCKS phosphorylation. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid (50 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol), Amplify, and ECL chemiluminescent kits were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The peptides MPSD (H-KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK-OH) and Ala-PSD (H-KKKKKRFAFKKAFKLAGFAFKKNKK-OH) were custom made by Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). Mouse anti-bovine monoclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of MARCKS was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against C-terminal domains of MARCKS was a generous gift from Dr. Byers (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada) (34Rosé S.D. Cook H.W. Palmer F.B. Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2314-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal antibodies raised against the N- and C-terminal domains of MARCKS were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and all reagents for electrophoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad. PMA, protein G-Sepharose, and digitonin were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical or molecular biology grade and were obtained from standard suppliers. Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, and chromaffin cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and further purified using a Percoll gradient (35Trifaró J.M. Lee R.H.W. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Chromaffin cells represented 90–95% of the isolated cells; the remaining cells were fibroblasts (4–9%) and cortical cells (1%). Fibroblasts contain MARCKS, and to reduce the number of fibroblasts present in the cultures, further purification of chromaffin cells by differential plating was performed. The cells were plated in 100-mm plastic dishes for 5 h, and under these conditions, most of the fibroblasts attached to the plastic dish. Floating cells, more than 99% chromaffin cells, were then plated on collagen-coated plastic 24-multiwells, plastic 35-mm dishes, or coverslips according to the specific study to be performed. The cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48–72 h. Chromaffin cells plated on collagen-coated plastic 24-multiwell dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well were cultured for 48–72 h. After rinsing the wells three times with 0.5 ml of 10% fetal calf serum in amino acid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (36Kenigsberg R.L. Trifaró J.M. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the cells were incubated with 10−7 m[3H]NA (48 Ci/mmol) in the same medium for 5 min at room temperature. The preparations were then incubated with six changes of 0.5 ml of regular Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.25 mm K2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2) over a 60-min period. Finally, the cells were washed once with Ca2+-free Locke's solution (2.2 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 2 mmEGTA) and permeabilized by 5 min of treatment with 20 μmdigitonin in K+-glutamate buffer (139 mmK+-glutamate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgATP, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm d-glucose, pH 6.6). Following permeabilization, [3H]NA release was determined by incubation of the cells in K+-glutamate buffer for 90 s in the absence (basal) or presence of 10 μm Ca2+ (stimulated) with or without 10−7 m PMA. Peptides MPSD (1–10 μm) and Ala-PSD (10 μm) were included during the permeabilization and stimulation steps as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation media were collected and assayed for [3H]NA. The [3H]NA cell content was determined by treating cells with 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min followed by two washes with 250 μl of 6% trichloroacetic acid. Total [3H]NA cell content was calculated by adding the [3H]NA secreted into the medium and the [3H]NA extracted with trichloroacetic acid. Basal [3H]NA release values (1.4–1.8%) were subtracted from those values obtained after stimulation. The radioactivity present in the samples was measured using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Wallac model 1414, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). For labeling of chromaffin cells, proteins with myristic acid, the cultures were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and incubated in 2 ml of fresh culture medium containing [3H]myristic acid (50 μCi/ml) for 18 h as described previously (34Rosé S.D. Cook H.W. Palmer F.B. Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2314-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies on MARCKS phosphorylation were performed in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Permeabilization was initiated by a 20 μm digitonin treatment as described above except that 80 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added into the medium after 3 min of permeabilization. After additional 2 min of digitonin treatment, PMA was added to a final concentration of 10−7 mand incubated for an additional period of 3 min. Phosphorylation was stopped by treatment of cells with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) followed by scraping of the cells. Samples were then heated at 80 °C for 3 min (34Rosé S.D. Cook H.W. Palmer F.B. Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2314-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Blackshear P.J. Wen L. Glynn B.P. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 251: 1459-1469Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The samples were concentrated by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation for 1 h, and the sediments were washed twice with ice-cold acetone. Protein samples prepared as indicated above were redissolved for one-dimensional SDS-PAGE by boiling for 5 min in 1.25% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue and separated in 10% SDS gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The protein samples for two-dimensional electrophoresis were prepared by dissolving the trichloroacetic acid sediments in iso-urea solution (9.5m urea, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm CHAPS, 5% glycerol, 0.6% pH 3–5 ampholytes, 0.6% pH 4–6 ampholytes, and 1% pH 3–10 ampholytes; Bio-Lyte, Bio-Rad). Aliquots (200–250 μg of protein in 75 μl of sample buffer) were subjected to isoelectric focusing in gels contained in 16-cm tubes of 2.4-mm diameter. This was followed by 10% SDS-PAGE according to O'Farrell (39O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical first dimension run consisted in 1 h at 200 V/h, 12 h at 1200 V/h, and a final 1 h at 2000 V/h. The pH gradient of isoelectric focusing gels was estimated by using a mock sample (only sample buffer) and equilibrating 0.5-cm segments of the tube gel in 1 ml of water in 10 × 75-mm glass tubes overnight. The gradient was approximately linear from pH 4.3 to 6.8. The gels containing [3H]myristic acid-labeled samples were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to radiographic film for fluorography. Western blotting procedures were done using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system as described previously (34Rosé S.D. Cook H.W. Palmer F.B. Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2314-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. MARCKS protein was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) against the C-terminal domain of Human MARCKS followed by treatment with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2500 (v/v). Western blot bands were developed using an ECL chemiluminescent kit. Digital scans of fluorograms, autoradiograms, and Western blots were obtained with a flat bed scanner (Hewlett Packard 4P) at 360 dpi resolution and processed with Adobe Photoshop 4.0. For densitometric analysis of phosphorylation and myristoylation, digital scans were analyzed using NIH Image software, version 1.61 (Research Services Branch, NIMH, Bethesda, MD). The area under the peaks were integrated, and the results were expressed in arbitrary units. Experiments to further demonstrate the presence of MARCKS in chromaffin cells and its phosphorylation under different conditions were performed using immunoprecipitation techniques. These were carried out on intact as well as on permeabilized cells. To labeled ATP, intact cells were incubated with 200 μCi [32P]phosphate/ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 2 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Phosphorylation experiments in digitonin-permeabilized cells were performed as described above, except that 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/ml was added per ml of medium. The phosphorylations were stopped by treatment of cells with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, pH 7.4) followed by scraping cells off from the culture dishes. The samples were then heated at 80 °C for 3 min, and the heat labile proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants (1 ml) were precleared by centrifugation after the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants thus obtained were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with a mixture of two polyclonal antibodies raised in goat against the N- and C-terminal domains of MARCKS. This was followed by addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) and incubation for 2 h. Sepharose beads were sedimented and washed five times with PBS. The immunoprecipitates were then dissolved by boiling for 5 min in SDS loading buffer, and separation of the phosphoproteins by SDS-PAGE was performed as described above. Autoradiograms were exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film using a BioMax MS intensifying screen to achieve higher sensitivity for detection of 32P emission (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Chromaffin cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips contained within 35-mm plastic Petri dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells. Cultured cells were rinsed with Locke's solution and permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin in K+-glutamate buffer for 5 min at room temperature as indicated above. Then the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm Ca2+, 10−7 m PMA, 10 μm MPSD, and 10 μm Ala-PSD peptides as indicated in the figure legends. Following the treatments, chromaffin cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (40Lee R.W.H. Trifaró J.M. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2087-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were permeabilized by three successive exposures of 5 min each to 50, 100, and 50% acetone and washed several times with PBS (130 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). Chromaffin cells were stained for F-actin with 0.25 unit/ml of rhodamine-phalloidin for 40 min in the dark at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed several times with PBS and mounted in glycerol-PBS (1:1). The slides were observed with a Leitz Ortholux fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-W high pressure mercury lamp and a Ploemopack II incident light illuminator. The effect of several treatments on the percentage of cells showing cortical F-actin disassembly was determined by examining four coverslips for each condition, and 100 single-rounded chromaffin cells were examined per coverslip. Each cell examined was classified as having either a “continuous” or “discontinuous” cortical rhodamine (F-actin) fluorescent ring as described previously (2Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The percentage of chromaffin cells showing cortical F-actin disassembly (discontinuous rhodamine fluorescent ring) was calculated for each experimental condition, and the mean ± S.E. of the values was plotted. Quantitative analysis of cortical rhodamine fluorescence (F-actin) was performed by using a Hamamatsu Photonic KK Argus-50/CL Image Processor (Hamamatsu Photonic Systems, Bridgewater, NJ). The fluorescence microscope was coupled to the video camera (Carl Zeiss, TV3M model), which was connected to the Argus 50-Image processor. The video camera control parameters (i.e. gain, offset, and sensitivity) were set up to obtain a clear image of the cell on the monitor and fluorescence intensity of 250 (arbitrary units) in the cortical region of the cell. The three-dimensional graphic analysis shows the coordinates of the equatorial plane of the cell on the x and y axes and the fluorescence intensity of this plane on the z axis (4Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaró J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Proteins in extracts of chromaffin cells previously labeled with [3H]myristic acid were heated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” and the heat resistant fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). MARCKS, a protein that remains soluble after heat denaturation (37Blackshear P.J. Wen L. Glynn B.P. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 251: 1459-1469Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), migrated as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 80–84 kDa (Fig. 1B). MARCKS represented 25% of the heat-stable [3H]myristic acid-labeled proteins in the chromaffin cells extracts. The myristoylated broad protein band at 80 kDa was also confirmed to be MARCKS by immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for bovine MARCKS (Fig. 1C). The immunoreactive band had the same apparent molecular mass as that band labeled with [3H]myristic acid. The immunodetection of this band with MARCKS antibody was enhanced by heat treatment as described previously for neuroblastoma cell lines (34Rosé S.D. Cook H.W. Palmer F.B. Ridgway N.D. Byers D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2314-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MARCKS presence in chromaffin cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using MARCKS-specific polyclonal antibodies raised in goat. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody against MARCKS (Fig.1D). The preparation of permeabilized chromaffin cells allows the study of secretory events distal to receptor and channel activation. In addition, this preparation permits the testing on the system of large molecules (i.e. peptides, antibodies). Digitonin treatment of chromaffin cells release ∼30% of MARCKS into the medium after 5 min of permeabilization (data not shown). Treatment with 10−7 m PMA, a concentration that activates PKC, had no effect on the pattern of leaked myristoylated proteins (data no shown). To test the possibility that MARCKS is the PKC substrate involved in the potentiation of the secretory response, experiments were performed on digitonin-permeabilized cells. A 25-mer peptide (MPSD) with an identical sequence to the phosphorylation site, calmodulin, and actin-binding domain of bovine MARCKS was used (Fig. 2A). In addition, a similar 25-mer peptide that is not a substrate for PKC, in which the serine residues were substituted by alanine (Ala-PSD), was also tested (Fig. 2A). As expected, PMA (10−7m) induced a significant potentiation of the Ca2+-evoked secretory response from permeabilized chromaffin cells (Fig. 2B). Incubation with 10 μm MPSD blocked PKC-induced increase of [3H]NA release in response to Ca2+stimulation. On the other hand, the nonphosphorylable Ala-PSD, used at the same concentration, did not affect PMA-induced potentiation of Ca2+-evoked [3H]NA release (Fig.2B). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of MPSD on PMA-induced [3H]NA release was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 2C). The fact that MPSD blocked PKC-induced potentiation of Ca2+-induced amine release together with the lack of effect of Ala-PSD would suggest the involvement of MARCKS in this process. The results also suggest that phosphorylation of MPSD serines residues might be involved in the inhibitory effect of the peptide. Because phosphorylation of similar serine residues are involved in PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS, the effects of MPSD and Ala-PSD on chromaffin cell protein phosphorylation were investigated next. Permeabilized chromaffin cells were incubated with PMA and [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of either MPSD or Ala-PSD. This was followed by separation of heat-stable proteins by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs of the gels together with their corresponding scans and quantification are depicted in Fig.3. Activation of PKC by treatment with PMA for a short period of time (3 min) increased phosphorylation of MARCKS to 163 ± 10% (n = 8) when compared with the nonstimulated control (Fig. 3). In the presence of MPSD, there was a significant inhibition of PMA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation, and the percentage of inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation was 81 ± 11% (n = 6). On the other hand, there was not significant inhibition of PMA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation when Ala-PSD was present in the medium (Fig. 3C). PKC activity was not affected by MPSD because the peptide was phosphorylated in response to PMA (Fig. 3A, front band). Resting permeabilized chromaffin cells have an unexpected relatively high basal level of MARCKS phosphorylation that, after treatment with PMA, increased only by 1.5 times (Fig. 3, A and C). Moreover, phosphorylated proteins of molecular mass lower than MARCKS does not appear to be affected by MPSD presence in the incubation medium (Fig.3, A and B). To further study the phosphorylation of these proteins and obtain a higher resolution of MARCKS phosphorylation, two-dimensional PAGE was performed (Fig.4). MARCKS is a highly acidic protein that ran in two-dimensional PAGE with an isoelectric point of 4.2–4.4 and an apparent molecular mass of 80–85 kDa. The spotlabeled MARCKS in Fig. 4A was first identified as MARCKS on the basi"

(1999)Blood 93, 1464–1476). Electron efflux through NADPH oxidase is electrogenic (Henderson, L. M., Chappell, J. B., and Jones, O. T. G. (1987) Biochem. J. 246, 325–329) and is compensated by H+ efflux through proton channels that reportedly are contained within the gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase. To test whether gp91phox functions as a proton channel, we studied H+ currents in granulocytes from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease patients lacking gp91phox (X-CGD), the human myelocytic PLB-985 cell line, PLB-985 cells in which gp91phox was knocked out by gene targeting (PLBKO), and PLB-985 knockout cells re-transfected with gp91phox (PLB91). H+currents in unstimulated PLBKO cells had amplitude and gating kinetics similar to PLB91 cells. Furthermore, stimulation with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased H+ currents to a similar extent in X-CGD, PLBKO, and PLB91 cells. Thus, gp91phox is not the proton channel in unstimulated phagocytes and does not directly mediate the increase of proton conductance during the respiratory burst. Changes in H+ channel gating kinetics during NADPH oxidase activity are likely crucial to the activation of H+ flux during the respiratory burst.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that the gp91phox component of the NADPH oxidase complex might be the proton channel that is activated during the respiratory burst (2Henderson L.M.

An increase in H+ currents after transfection might reflect expression of channels formed by the transfected gene product but could simply reflect up-regulation of constitutively expressed H+channels. It is also possible that expression of gp91phox in a background lacking p22phox might induce non-physiological behavior that is not exhibited in phagocytes. The stability of gp91phox and p22phoxexpression in phagocytes is enhanced by the formation of heterodimers of these two components of flavocytochrome b558(19Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol.

We therefore studied stable PLB-985 cell lines with gp91phox genetically knocked-out and with gp91phox re-expressed in the same background (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The PLB-985-derived cell lines were developed by Dinauer and colleagues (21Zhen L.

Wild-type PLB-985 cells (PLBWT), PLBKO (PLB-985 cells targeted with a construct that prevents gp91phoxexpression), and PLB91 (gp91phoxknockout cells after rescue by stable transfection with gp91phox cDNA) were all induced by incubation with 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; Sigma) for 4–7 days. Some whole-cell studies were done on PLBKO cells before DMF induction, designated PLBKO*. The absence of gp91phoxexpression in the PLBKO granulocytes is well documented (20DeLeo F.R.

X-CGD granulocytes (mainly neutrophils) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation as described (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) from three patients with CGD, all of whom had documented absent neutrophil superoxide production and mutations that would prevent stable expression of gp91phox (25Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Rae J. Noack D. Roos D. van Koppen E. Cross A.R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The specific mutations were (a) Cys1347 → Ala in Exon 11, changing the codon for Cys445 to a premature STOP codon; (b) deletion of Cys1028 in Exon 9, leading to a frameshift after Pro339 and a premature STOP three codons downstream; and (c) insertion of Cys after Gly169 in Exon 3, leading to a frameshift after Leu52 and a premature STOP codon in Exon 5. In patientc, the absence of cytochrome b558 was demonstrated spectrophotometrically in neutrophil extracts. Blood from patient c was refrigerated overnight before use, and most surviving granulocytes were identified as eosinophils in a Wright-stained cytospin preparation. Whole-cell and permeabilized patch voltage-clamp recordings were done as described (26Cherny V.V. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen.

Whole-cell solutions (pipette and bath) included 100 mm buffer near its pKa with tetramethylammonium+and methanesulfonate− as the main ions, 1 mmEGTA, and 1–2 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2. For permeabilized patch recording, all solutions contained 50 mm NH4+, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm BES, 1 mm EGTA, titrated to pH 7.0 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The symmetrical NH4+ clamped pHinear 7.0 (27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Currents are shown without correction for leak or liquid junction potentials. Data were collected at 20–21 °C or at room temperature. PLB-985 cells induced by DMF to granulocytic differentiation express all NADPH oxidase components and are capable of a respiratory burst (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PLBWT cells had large voltage-gated proton currents (Fig.1, A and B) that resemble those in other phagocytes and related cells (17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Proton currents in DMF-induced PLB91 cells (Fig. 1, Cand D) were similar to those in DMF-induced PLBWT cells, as expected. PLBKO cells, which do not express gp91phox protein (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. DeLeo F.R. Epstein R.I. LeRoy B.A. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol.

These results demonstrate unequivocally that gp91phox is not the voltage-gated proton channel in unstimulated phagocytes. To explore whether expression of gp91phox might alter the properties of H+ channels, we characterized the H+ currents thoroughly. Tail currents reversed near the Nernst potential for H+ in the three PLB lines (Fig.2A), confirming that protons carry these currents. The slope of the data is 51.8 mV/unit pH, which is close to the 58.2 mV given by the Nernst equation. The largest deviation from the Nernst prediction indicates that H+ is >106 more permeant than tetramethylammonium+, the main cation present. Like other H+ channels (17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), those in PLB cells are essentially perfectly H+–selective. The voltage dependence of H+ current activation was very similar in PLBWT, PLB91, and PLBKO cells, as evident in average H+chord-conductance voltage (gH-V) data (Fig.2B). H+ currents in PLB knockout cells studied before (PLBKO) and after induction with DMF (PLBKO*) were identical. The effects of changing pHo from 7.0 (Fig. 1, A,C, and E) to 5.5 (Fig. 1, B,D, and F) were similar in all cell types and to effects reported previously (17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Cherny V.V. Markin V.S. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 861-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The behavior of thegH in cells studied at pHi 6.5 (not shown) was also similar in PLB91 and PLBKO cells and to that described previously (17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Cherny V.V. Markin V.S. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 861-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, C and D shows that the kinetics of H+ channel opening (τact) and closing (τtail), respectively, were indistinguishable in PLB-985 cells expressing (PLBWT and PLB91) or lacking gp91phox (PLBKO and PLBKO*). Thus, the physiological properties of H+ channels in unstimulated phagocytes are not altered by gp91phox expression. The response of individual PLB91 cells to PMA was variable, possibly reflecting variable levels of induction by DMF. We observed DPI-sensitive electron currents, which reflect NADPH oxidase activity (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2001; 535: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), at the holding potential in about half (9 of 17) of PLB91 cells stimulated with PMA. Electron currents usually appeared after a delay (up to 10 min) and in conjunction with a slowing of tail current decay. The average peak electron current was −2.4 ± 1.8 pA (mean ± S.D.;n = 9), similar to −2.3 pA in human neutrophils (27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This similarity is consistent with the similar levels of superoxide anion production in PMA-stimulated PLB-985 cells and human neutrophils (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The demonstration that gp91phox is not the voltage-gated proton channel in unstimulated PLB-985 cells is compatible with a recent suggestion that two types of H+ channels exist in phagocytes and that gp91phox functions as a proton channel only when NADPH oxidase is active (29Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In human neutrophils or eosinophils studied in permeabilized patch configuration, both NADPH oxidase and H+ channels can be activated by PMA or arachidonic acid (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2001; 535: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The H+ currents in these activated phagocytes closely resemble the NADPH oxidase-related variety described by Bánfi et al. (29Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The H+ current response of PLB91 cells to PMA was qualitatively like that of human neutrophils and eosinophils (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fig.3A illustrates H+currents during test pulses to +60 mV in a PLB91 cell. PMA stimulation produced four changes in H+ currents in PLB91 cells that displayed electron currents as follows (Fig. 3C): (a) the H+ current amplitude (IH) increased; (b) activation of H+ current during depolarizing pulses (τact) became faster; (c) deactivation of H+ currents (τtail) became slower; and (d) the threshold for activating H+ currents (Vthreshold) was shifted 32 mV toward more negative voltages. Each change increases the likelihood of H+ channel opening in intact cells. Because the increase in IHafter PMA stimulation might reflect the appearance of a distinct type of proton channel related to gp91phox (29Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), evaluating the PMA response of PLBKO cells was of great interest (Fig. 3B). No electron current was detected, consistent with the absence of a complete NADPH oxidase complex. PMA stimulation increased IH to a similar extent in PLBKO, X-CGD, PLB91 cells, and neutrophils (Fig. 3C). Because IH during a test pulse is an arbitrary measure, we also compared the maximumgH, which increased after PMA stimulation by a factor of 2.06 ± 0.39 (mean ± S.D.; n = 7) in PLBKO cells and 2.43 ± 1.37 (n = 9) in PLB91 cells (p > 0.5). In all cell types, H+ current activation became faster. In parallel, we studied granulocytes from three CGD patients with mutations that prevent expression of gp91phox (X-CGD). The X-CGD cells had normal or larger than normal H+ currents, and their response to PMA was similar to that of PLBKOcells. Although the mean change in τact was larger in PLB91 than PLBKO or X-CGD cells, our exclusion from analysis of PLB91 cells without electron currents may account for this difference, because this criterion could not be used to exclude non-responding PLBKO or X-CGD cells. The PMA-induced changes in H+ currents in the eight PLB91 cells with no detectable electron currents (not shown) were identical to those in PLBKO cells. BecauseIH increased to a similar extent in PLBKO, X-CGD, PLB91 cells, and human neutrophils, the increased gH during the respiratory burst (1Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Nanda A.

J. 1992; 281: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is not because of the appearance of proton currents conducted through the gp91phoxmolecule. AlthoughIH increased to the same extent after PMA stimulation, the response of H+ currents to PMA was different in cells expressing or lacking gp91phox. The slowing of τtail and large hyperpolarizing shift of Vthreshold were not observed in PLBKO or X-CGD cells (Fig. 3C). The slowing of τtail was less pronounced in PLB91 cells than in neutrophils and eosinophils. In most cells there was a distinct but relatively subtle slowing. The hyperpolarizing voltage shift was almost as large in PLB91cells (−32 mV) as in neutrophils (−39 mV) and in eosinophils (−43 mV) stimulated with PMA under similar conditions (24DeCoursey T.E.

This voltage shift was sufficient to result in the appearance of inward H+ currents in some cells, a hallmark property of the NADPH oxidase-related H+ channel (29Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of robust H+ currents in PLBKO cells demonstrates unequivocally that the voltage-gated proton channel in unstimulated phagocytes is not gp91phox nor does it require gp91phox expression. Similarly, granulocytes (this study) or monocytes (9Nanda A. Romanek R. Curnutte J.T. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from CGD patients lacking gp91phox exhibit normal levels of H+currents. Furthermore, genetic knockout of gp91phox did not detectably alter the amplitude or behavior of whole-cell H+ currents. Voltage-gated proton channels in whole-cell studies of unstimulated phagocytes function independently of gp91phox. Bánfi et al. (29Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) proposed that there were two types of H+ channels in eosinophils, one in resting cells and a novel variety that is observed only under conditions that permit NADPH oxidase function. This novel channel reportedly differs from that in resting cells in (a) activating at more negative voltages, (b) activating more rapidly, (c) deactivating more slowly, and (d) being more sensitive to inhibition by Zn2+. We observed novel H+ channel gating behavior during NADPH oxidase function in human neutrophils and eosinophils stimulated with PMA or arachidonic acid in permeabilized patch studies (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2001; 535: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we saw no evidence of multiple kinetic components in stimulated phagocytes, no correlation between the amplitude of the NADPH oxidase-generated electron currents and the amplitude of PMA-activated H+ currents (27DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and identical Zn2+ sensitivity of H+ currents in resting and activated cells displaying both types of channel behavior (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We conclude that there is one type of H+ channel in phagocytes, whose properties are greatly altered during the respiratory burst. Here we examined whether the increased H+ conductance in stimulated cells is because of the appearance of additional channels formed by gp91phox. PMA stimulation clearly increased IH in cells that lack gp91phox (PLBKO and X-CGD). This increase was not statistically different from that in cells expressing gp91phox (PLB91 and neutrophils). If a small gp91phox–mediated H+conductance were also activated in neutrophils and PLB91cells, it could be only a small fraction of the totalgH. It is conceivable that under some conditions, such as heterologous expression in non-phagocytes, gp91phox might function as a proton channel, but the evidence presented here indicates that it does not contribute significantly to the total proton conductance of phagocytes. In CHO cells transfected with gp91phox, arachidonic acid stimulated larger proton fluxes than in control cells (8Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem.

Although suggestive of enhanced H+ channel activity, these measurements are indirect. It is difficult to determine which part of these H+ fluxes was mediated by H+ channels, because suppression of flux by the H+ channel inhibitor Zn2+ was not demonstrated. Patch-clamp studies of CHO cells transfected with gp91phox (13Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reveal a large conductance with properties fundamentally different from H+ channels in native cells. A quintessential feature of H+ channels is potent inhibition by Zn2+, which slows τact(17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Cherny V.V. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 819-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The conductance in CHO cells was weakly inhibited by Zn2+, and no slowing of activation was evident at 200 μm Zn2+ (13Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas even 1 μmZn2+ slows τact 3–10-fold in cells expressing voltage-gated proton channels (24DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Cherny V.V. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 819-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In all cells with H+ channels, increasing pHi shifts the voltage-activation curve by ∼40 mV/unit pH (16Cherny V.V. Henderson L.M. DeCoursey T.E. Membr. Cell Biol. 1997; 11: 337-347PubMed Google Scholar, 17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog.

In contrast, the conductance in CHO cells was activated at −20 mV at pHi 6.9, but no H+ current was seen at pHi 7.5 at voltages up to +140 mV (13Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The failure to see H+ current at pHi 7.5 is especially surprising, because the currents at pHi 6.9 are an order of magnitude greater than in any mammalian cell. Finally, the outward currents in CHO cells activate anomalously rapidly, within <100 ms, whereas τact for phagocyte H+ channels is typically seconds (9Nanda A. Romanek R. Curnutte J.T. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Eder C. DeCoursey T.E. Prog.

Physiol. 2001; 535: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that transient gp91phox expression in COS-7 cells results in voltage-gated proton currents (15Maturana A. Arnaudeau S. Ryser S. Bánfi B. Hossle J.P. Schlegel W. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30277-30284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the currents shown appear to reverse roughly near 0 mV at pHo7.5 and pHi 5.7, where the Nernst potential for H+ is −105 mV; thus, this conductance is not H+–selective. Evidently, expression of gp91phox in alien cell lines can induce novel conductances that differ markedly from H+ currents in resting or activated phagocytes or any cell studied to date. The gating kinetics of H+ channels responded differently to PMA in cells lacking gp91phox. Although it is possible that gp91phox itself modulates H+ channels, we propose that these modulations of H+ channel function occur only in the presence of a functioning NADPH oxidase complex. The properties that are influenced by NADPH oxidase function, slower τtail and hyperpolarization of the gH-Vrelationship, promote activation of the gH at membrane potentials that might occur in intact phagocytes. The alterations in H+ channel gating during NADPH oxidase activity probably contribute more to activating H+ flux during the respiratory burst than does the increase ingH, max. We thank John T.

Very recently, pharmacologically active low molecular mass compounds were reported to stabilize the wild-type conformation of human p53 (47Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar).So far, little is known about the biochemical properties of the homologous DBDs, which share ∼60% identity with the p53 DBD and are highly conserved in residues involved in Zn2+ coordination and stabilization of the DNA-binding conformation (4Schmale H. Bamberger C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol.

In contrast to p53, mutational inactivation of p73 and p63 in human tumors is rare and does not seem to be important for carcinogenesis (49Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M93-M100PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the p63 DBD was biochemically characterized in comparison with the p53 DBD. In contrast to p53, the free p63 DBD is not capable of binding to specific p53 DNA consensus sites; however, in a dimerized state, GST-p63 DBD as well as GST-p53 DBD show comparable affinity and specificity for p53 consensus sites, supporting the notion that the DBDs might differ with respect to dimerization and consequently cooperative DNA binding, but not with respect to DNA specificity. Differential scanning calorimetry and urea-induced equilibrium unfolding showed that the p63 DBD is markedly stabilized in relation to p53. To understand these results on a molecular basis, a homology model of the p63 DBD was created. Some properties of the p63 DBD may rationalize the lack of cooperativity and enhanced thermostability.RESULTSCloning, Expression, and Purification of the p63 DBDThe DBD of the p63 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) using gene-specific primers. Unexpectedly, the cloned DNA sequence had a deletion of 12 base pairs encoding the exchange of five amino acids with alanine in the C-terminal region of the corresponding p63 DBD. This deletion in the DBD is also known for the γ-isoform of murine p63, but has not been described for the human p63 isoforms so far (Fig.1). Sequences containing this deletion can be retrieved in the EMBL Human dbEST Database (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The cloned p63 DBD therefore probably codes for a novel isoform of human p63, preliminarily designated as p63-δ. The encoded p63 DBD (residues 114–349) characterized in this study was chosen on the basis of the sequence alignment for the p53 family members (Fig. 1) and corresponds to the p53 DBD (residues 94–312) used in several studies (36Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 37Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R.

It includes short, presumably unstructured, N- and C-terminal residues in addition to the minimal DBD (33Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). The degree of identity between these two domains is 55.4%. The p63 DBD and GST-p63 DBD (data not shown) plasmids yielded high-level expression of soluble protein in E. coli after induction at 37 °C and showed almost no deposition in inclusion bodies (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and2). The p63 DBD was purified using a combination of cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. This purification scheme yielded ∼30 mg of >98% homogeneous and monomeric p63 DBD/liter of culture as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5), analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2B), and mass spectroscopy. Analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters by dynamic light scattering showed that the p63 DBD exhibits a hydrodynamic radius of 2.9 nm versus 2.74 nm for the p53 DBD; however, both DBDs exhibit a monomodal distribution with low polydispersity indices (data not shown). Purification of GST-p63 DBD fusion protein was performed using a combination of affinity chromatography and a final size-exclusion step. Yields were ∼20 mg of >95% homogeneous protein (Fig. 2A, lane 9) in a dimeric state (Fig.2B) per liter of culture.

Therefore, the DNA-binding activity of the isolated p63 DBD for the p53-responsive consensus site PG (53Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar) was analyzed in comparison with the p53 DBD. The p53 DBD bound to a single consensus quarter-site only with very low affinity so that DNA binding could not be detected by EMSA (data not shown). Upon addition of the PG p53 consensus site, the p53 DBD tetramerized and cooperatively bound with high affinity (Fig. 3A,lane 1) (35Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C.

In contrast, the free p63 DBD was not able to bind to the PG p53 consensus site under identical conditions (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Co-incubation of the p63 DBD with the p53 DBD did not interfere with DNA binding of the p53 DBD (data not shown). Consequently, the ability of GST-p63 DBD to bind to the PG p53 consensus site was analyzed since the GST part of the fusion protein acts as an artificial dimerization domain (Fig.2B) and thereby should enhance the affinity for DNA. Dimerized GST-p63 DBD fusion protein was capable of binding to the PG p53 consensus sequence with an affinity similar to that of GST-p53 DBD (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the affinity and specificity of the p63 and p53 DBDs are similar. To confirm that the p63 DBD is not differently folded in the context of the GST fusion protein, the fusion proteins were digested with thrombin, and the free DBDs were released. As expected, thrombin-cleaved GST-p53 DBD retained the DNA-binding activity of the released p53 DBD, whereas thrombin-cleaved GST-p63 DBD completely lost DNA-binding activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). The lack of measurable DNA-binding activity of the p63 DBD might therefore be explained by its failure to bind to DNA cooperatively. Fig. 9depicts a schematic model for the interpretation of the experimental results (see “Discussion” for details).Figure 3A, DNA-binding activity of p63 DBD and p53 DBD constructs. 50 ng of p53 DBD (lane 1), p63 DBD (lane 2), GST-p53 DBD (lane 3), and GST-p63 DBD (lane 4) were analyzed for their DNA-binding activity by EMSA. 50 ng of GST-p53 DBD (lanes 5 and 6) and GST-p63 DBD (lanes 7 and 8) were analyzed for their DNA-binding activity before (−) and after (+) cleavage with 1 μg of thrombin. BG probably indicates background binding of a small portion of monomeric GST-p53 that is in equilibrium with dimeric GST-p53 and not detectable by size-exclusion chromatography;FP indicates free probe. B, influence of 1,10-phenanthroline on the DNA-binding activity. 50 ng of GST-p53 DBD (lanes 1–5) and GST-p63 DBD (lanes 6–10) were incubated for 10 min with the indicated concentrations of 1,10-phenanthroline at 4 °C and subsequently subjected to an EMSA at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Schematic model for the DNA-binding properties of the p63 and p53 DBDs and the respective GST fusion proteins. The p53 DBD (black circles) contains a functional dimerization interface putatively formed by the H1 helix (represented by gray rectangles) and is capable of cooperative binding to its consensus DNA. The p63 DBD (white circles), in contrast, does not bind to DNA cooperatively due to a different or lacking dimerization interface (represented by gray rectangles). Artificial dimerization mediated via fusion with GST (gray circles) restores the DNA-binding activity of GST-p63 DBD. GST-p53 DBD and GST-p63 DBD bind to DNA with similar affinity and specificity. The arrows indicate a further putative intermolecular oligomerization interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Zn2+ Coordination Is Required for p63 DNA BindingThe presence of Zn2+ is required for the DNA-binding activity of the p53 protein (36Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the p53 DBD·DNA complex shows that the structure of the p53 DBD is stabilized by Zn2+ that is tetrahedrally coordinated by three cysteines (residues 176, 238, and 242) and one histidine (residue 179) (33Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). Treatment of wild-type p53 with metal chelators causes the removal of Zn2+ and oxidation of essential cysteine residues. This results in the disruption of the tertiary structure, with loss of DNA-binding activity, exposure of amino acids cryptic in the fully folded protein, and adoption of the monoclonal antibody PAb 240-positive phenotype identical to that of mutant forms of p53 (65Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 66Meplan C. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Primary structure data suggest that this metal-dependent structure is conserved in the p53 homolog p63 (4Schmale H. Bamberger C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), as all residues involved in Zn2+coordination are conserved (Fig. 1). Consequently, the effect of metal-chelating agents on DNA binding was examined. Fig. 3Bshows that incubation with the metal-chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline reduced the DNA-binding activities of GST-p53 DBD and GST-p63 DBD (lanes 1–10). It was surprising that the Zn2+ seemed to be bound with higher affinity by GST-p53 DBD, as concentrations of 1,10-phenanthroline >20 mm were needed to abolish DNA binding, whereas GST-p63 DBD lost DNA-binding activity at lower concentrations. As the effect of Zn2+chelation and loss of DNA-binding activity varied with incubation time and temperature, the effect of 1,10-phenanthroline on the DNA-binding activity was not quantitatively evaluated.Quantitative Analysis of the DNA-binding Activity and Specificity of p63FCS was applied to measure the apparent binding constants of fluorescently labeled DNA consensus oligonucleotides for p63 and p53 DBDs. In the first experiments, the effect of supercoiled unlabeled nonspecific pBS competitor DNA on the DNA-binding activities of p63 and p53 DBDs for a specific TAMRA-labeled PG oligonucleotide was determined (Fig. 4, A and B). Whereas binding of the p53 DBD and GST-p53 DBD (Fig. 4A) as well as GST-p63 DBD (Fig. 4B) to PG was specific and almost unaffected over a wide concentration range, DNA binding of the p63 DBD was nonspecific and could be competed at 5 nm nonspecific pBS DNA (Fig. 4B). This concentration of nonspecific pBS DNA was comparable to that used i"

A region of 9 conserved amino acid residues (residues Gln-337 through Lys-345) in the C terminus of human FEN-1 (hFEN-1) was shown to be responsible for the interaction with PCNA. Our current study indicates that 4 amino acid residues in hFEN-1 (Leu-340, Asp-341, Phe-343, and Phe-344) are critical for human PCNA (hPCNA) interaction. A conserved PCNA interaction motif in various proteins from assorted species has been defined as Q1X2X3(L/I)4X5X6F7(F/Y)8, although our results fail to implicate Q1 (Gln-337 in hFEN-1) as a crucial residue. Surprisingly, all hFEN-1 mutants, including L340A, D341A, F343A, and F344A, retained hPCNA-mediated stimulation of both exo- and flap endonuclease activities. Furthermore, our in vitro assay showed that hPCNA failed to bind to the scRad27 (yeast homolog of FEN-1) nuclease. However, its nuclease activities were significantly enhanced in the presence of hPCNA. Four additional Saccharomyces cerevisiae scRad27 mutants, including multiple alanine mutants and a deletion mutant of the entire PCNA binding region, were constructed to confirm this result. All of these mutants retained PCNA-driven nuclease activity stimulation. We therefore conclude that stimulation of eukaryotic hFEN-1 nuclease activities by PCNA is independent of its in vitrointeraction via the PCNA binding region.

This unique substrate-specific nature is based on structural elements that have been observed in the three-dimensional structures of prokaryotic FEN-1 homologues (6Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G.

The N-terminal region and the region located in between the two conserved nuclease motifs three-dimensionally form an arch, thus creating a hole in the middle of the protein. The dimensions of the hole only allow single-stranded DNA, but not double-stranded DNA, to thread through. The presence of positively charged and bulky residues in the helices of the arch region may directly interact with DNA substrate. Other structural features, such as the H3TH motif, dynamically hold the double-stranded portion of the flap substrate (7Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, hFEN-1 nuclease is able to recognize the ends of free 5′ single strand DNA and thread it through the hole, resulting in cleavage at the junction between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA portions of the substrate (11Murante R.S.

Under native conditions PCNA exists as a monomer and must homotrimerize in order for it to encircle DNA. PCNA can trimerize around double-stranded DNA by simple diffusion or trimerize first and slide onto DNA provided there are free ends. However, it is most efficiently loaded as a trimer onto closed circular double-stranded DNA by the accessory protein RF-C in an ATP-dependent process (28Burgers P.M.J. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephen S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of scPCNA shows that the trimer forms a closed ring with appropriate dimensions and electrostatic properties that enable it to encircle double-stranded DNA and to interact with DNA using nonspecific contacts (30Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Processivity during DNA synthesis is achieved by a direct protein-protein interaction between PCNA and polymerase δ as PCNA tethers the DNA polymerase at the primer terminus. Once loaded onto DNA, RF-C dissociates from the DNA template while PCNA remains encircled around the template in order to tether DNA polymerase δ to DNA, thus enabling it to participate in both leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. After PCNA is loaded onto DNA, it is able to freely slide on the DNA template in either direction (29Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephen S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The Lieber and Burgers group was the first to report that human and yeast PCNA (hPCNA and scPCNA) interacts with the hFEN-1 and scRad27 nucleases and stimulates their activities, respectively (5Wu X.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) demonstrated that yeast scRad27 directly binds to scPCNA. This specific interaction was further confirmed by affinity chromatography using scPCNA beads and yeast cell crude extract containing scRad27. Through protein-protein interactions, PCNA focuses hFEN-1 on a branched DNA substrate (flap endonuclease substrate) and on a nicked DNA substrate (exonuclease substrate), thereby stimulating its activity 10–50-fold depending on the salt concentrations used in the reactions (5Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.-L. Burgers P.M.J. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of stimulation remains unclear. Recent in vitro studies suggest that PCNA stimulates nuclease activities by lowering theKm value of hFEN-1 for DNA substrates (31Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are two regions in PCNA that have been shown to be potential binding sites for hFEN-1. The first of these regions is located in the interdomain connector loop (IDCL) of PCNA (32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the second sequence is found near the C terminus of PCNA (21Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jónsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). FEN-1 is critical during Okazaki fragment maturation on the lagging strand. FEN-1 helps remove RNA primers in a process during which it either functions alone as an endonuclease or as an exonuclease in cooperation with RNase H (34Qiu J. Qian Y. Frank P. Wintersberger U. Shen B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8361-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35Rumbaugh J.A. Murante R.S. Shi S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

In vitro stimulation of hFEN-1 endonuclease and exonuclease activities by PCNA suggests that this phenomenon may be important during DNA replication in vivo. In addition, the interaction of FEN-1 and PCNA has also been shown to be important for DNA repair, specifically for the removal of oxidative base damage via long patch base excision repair (36Gary R.

The absence of PCNA in reconstituted in vitro base excision repair reactions containing FEN-1 results in an accumulation of uncleaved or unprocessed damaged DNA intermediates (36Gary R. Kim K.

A defective hFEN-1·hPCNA complex may result in inefficient removal of certain types of DNA damage or improper processing of Okazaki fragments, which can produce DNA with secondary structure and eventually result in duplication mutations. The accumulation of DNA damage and increased rates of duplication mutations are examples of primary molecular events that may lead to human cancers and heritable genetic diseases such as colorectal cancers, Huntington's disease, and various ataxias (2Johnson R.E.

Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).Via peptide mapping experiments and protein truncation analysis, a conserved region in the C terminus of the hFEN-1 nuclease (337QGRLDDFFK345) has been shown to be the PCNA interaction region (23Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When this region is deleted, or, when two critical amino acid residues (Phe-343 and Phe-344) were mutated to alanines, the in vitro binding ability of hFEN-1 to hPCNA was eliminated (36Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to elucidate details of the structural and functional relationship of this interaction. Comprehensive alanine mutagenesis was performed in the entire proposed PCNA interaction region. Our results demonstrate that 4 amino acid residues in hFEN-1, Leu-340, Asp-341, Phe-343, and Phe-344, were critical for the in vitro interaction with hPCNA. Individual replacement of each of these 4 amino acid residues with alanine resulted in a loss of interaction with hPCNA in vitro. Unexpectedly, all hFEN-1 mutants, including L340A, D341A, F343A, and F344A, retained hPCNA-mediated stimulation properties of both exonuclease and flap endonuclease activities. Further functional interaction analyses of scRad27 nuclease mutants were also carried out. These mutants include multiple alanine mutations of L340/F343/F344, L340/D341/F343/F344, or 337QGRLDDFF344 or a deletion of these 8 amino acid residues (337) in the PCNA-binding region. These alterations resulted in the loss of PCNA binding but retained nuclease activity stimulation. Additionally, human PCNA fails to interact with the scRad27 nuclease, yet it is still able to stimulate the nuclease activities of scRad27. These results suggest that the in vitro interaction of hFEN-1/scRad27 to PCNA and stimulation of nuclease activities are mediated through independent mechanisms.DISCUSSIONEmploying a strategy of individually mutating each of the 8 amino acid residues to alanine residues in the C-terminal putative hPCNA binding motif of hFEN-1 (Table II) allowed us to systematically analyze hFEN-1's ability to bind to hPCNA as well as to determine the effect on the stimulation of its nuclease activities by hPCNA. Our intentions were to precisely determine which residues in hFEN-1 are crucial for binding to hPCNA and then correlate the binding results of individual mutants with their stimulation properties. Our results revealed interesting and novel findings that should expand our overall knowledge of hFEN-1's in vitro binding and stimulation characteristics and may help to further our understanding of previously published in vivo results.Previous biochemical analysis of PCNA and its interaction with various proteins revealed a conserved sequence in these proteins that is necessary for their ability to bind to PCNA. An 8-amino acid residue consensus PCNA binding motif was derived and is represented by the following sequence:Q1X2X3(L/I)4X5X6F7(F/Y)8. Traditionally, this motif is located at, or near, either the N or C terminus of PCNA-binding proteins. In Table II, boldface letters in the putative PCNA binding motifs of various proteins indicate that residues are highly conserved. Mutational analysis of this motif in hFEN-1 was performed in order to determine the identity of the residues essential for binding to PCNA. Previous analysis of five proteins has partially determined the residues that were essential for PCNA binding by the scRad27, hFEN-1, p21, ligase I, and MCMT proteins (23Gary R. Ludwig D.L.

Residues equivalent to (L/I)4, F7, and (F/Y)8 of the PCNA consensus binding motif are essential for PCNA binding by all five proteins. In our current study, point mutations in the consensus PCNA binding motif of hFEN-1 were created and characterized. Binding analysis of each mutant using crude cell extracts unambiguously showed which residues were essential for hFEN-1 to bind to hPCNA (Fig. 1). In the C-terminal PCNA binding region of hFEN-1, we determined that residues Leu-340, Asp-341, Phe-343, and Phe-344 (equivalent to Leu-343, Asp-344, Phe-346, and Phe-347 in scRad27) were essential for binding. Our experiments further confirmed that the glutamine residue is not essential for the hFEN-1-hPCNA interaction and may not actually be a part of the PCNA binding motif even though it is highly conserved. Instead, aspartate 341, which is conserved in the eukaryotic FEN-1/XPG nuclease family, is a crucial residue in the consensus motif (TableII). Our results suggest that the consensus PCNA binding motif for the FEN-1/XPG family could be better represented as (L/I)1(D/E)2X3(F/W)4F5.The most interesting and unexpected results obtained in this study involved the analysis of the hPCNA-mediated stimulation of the nuclease activities of hFEN-1 and scRad27 proteins that contained single or multiple mutations in the C-terminal PCNA interaction domain. In order to correlate the experimentally observed binding abilities of mutants with their stimulation properties, all mutant hFEN-1s were analyzed for their hPCNA-mediated flap endonuclease and exonuclease stimulation using in vitro assays (5Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.-L. Burgers P.M.J. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We predicted that all mutants that lost binding ability to hPCNA would also lose their ability to be stimulated, and, likewise, mutants that retained binding ability would also retain hPCNA-mediated stimulation of their endo/exonuclease activities. However, all mutants created still retained hPCNA-mediated stimulation of flap endonuclease (Fig. 2A) and exonuclease (Fig. 2B) activities. It was also considered that the presence of PCNA could produce an excluded volume effect similar to the mechanism in which the presence of excess BSA is able to enhance the activity of some restriction enzymes. This possibility was tested using BSA and polyethylene glycol 4000 and observed that this was not the case (data not shown). Alternatively, we also considered the possibility that an undetectable amount of residual binding to hPCNA may exist in any (or all) of the hPCNA binding deficient single mutants because our binding assay may not be sensitive enough to detect residual binding levels. Therefore, we addressed this possibility by mutating multiple conserved residues in combination. The following four mutants of scRad27 were also constructed for this experiment: 1) a triple mutant by changing Leu-343, Phe-346, and Phe-347 all to alanines (3A mutant), 2) a quadruple mutant by changing Gln-340, Leu-343, Phe-346, and Phe-347 all to alanines (4A mutant), 3) a mutant in which residues Gln-340 through Phe-347 were all changed to alanines (8A mutant), and 4) a mutant with a deletion of these 8 residues (ΔP mutant). We assayed binding of these mutants to scPCNA and flap endonuclease and exonuclease activity stimulation by scPCNA. As expected, all of these mutants lost their ability to bind to scPCNA (Fig. 5). All of the scRad27 proteins containing multiple mutations (3A, 4A, and 8A) or a deletion (ΔP) also retained normal nuclease activity stimulation mediated by scPCNA (Fig. 6).This finding was supported by our further observation that hPCNA was able to stimulate nuclease activities of scRad27 even though it can not bind to scRad27. The original purpose for performing the experiment on interspecific binding and stimulation of hFEN-1 and scRad27 proteins by human or yeast PCNAs was to verify the previous data that scPCNA could not stimulate hFEN-1 nuclease activities (5Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.-L. Burgers P.M.J. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our recent observation shows that hFEN-1 could fully complement scRad27 functions when it was used to rescue rad27 knockout strains (26Chen C. Merrill B.J. Lau P.J. Holm C. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7801-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This result led us to hypothesize that the scPCNA should be able to bind to hFEN-1 and stimulate its nuclease activities or vice versa. As expected, our present study indicated that the scPCNA could indeed bind to hFEN-1 protein (Fig. 3) and stimulate its nuclease activities (Fig. 4)in vitro. Unexpectedly, we also revealed that hPCNA could stimulates the nuclease activities of scRad27, but was not able to bind to the protein, which support our hypothesis that the binding and stimulation of FEN-1 proteins by PCNA are mediated via independent mechanisms.The above results led us to consider the possible existence of additional unidentified motif(s) and/or structural elements in RAD27 (or hFEN-1) that could be responsible for the stimulation properties of the wild type and various mutant proteins by PCNA. In a recent report, Gomes and Burgers (48Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) described that the ability of scRad27 to bind to two distinct regions in scPCNA (the IDCL and C terminus) was regulated by DNA. A yeast IDCL mutant, pcna-79 (IL126, 128AA), failed to interact with scRad27 in solution, but surprisingly, was still very active in stimulating scRad27 nuclease activity. In contrast, a C-terminal mutant, pcna-90 (PK252, 253AA), exhibited wild type binding to scRad27 in solution, yet poorly stimulated the nuclease activities of scRad27. When proteins were individually loaded onto a DNA substrate (resembling our exonuclease substrate) that was coupled to magnetic beads, wild type scPCNA and pcna-79, but not pcna-90, formed a complex with scRad27 and the DNA substrate. These results indicated that the presence of an appropriate DNA substrate dictated the region of PCNA to which Rad27 binds.The data presented here are contradictory to what Stucki et al. (43Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have published recently. Stucki et al.constructed a deletion mutant of hFEN-1 lacking the PCNA interaction motif, which is equivalent to our ΔP scRad27 mutant described here. The sequences of these regions in the two proteins are identical except for 1 residue. They have carried out PCNA interaction and stimulation assays with their mutant and concluded that the PCNA interaction motif is indispensable for stimulation of hFEN-1 activities by hPCNA. Our results using proteins containing single mutant, multiple mutants, or a deletion mutation in the C-terminal region required for in vitro PCNA interaction did not result in significant loss of stimulation. This discrepancy may have resulted from origins of proteins, differences in experimental design, how the mutant proteins were handled, or the removal of an additional amino acid residue, Phe-347, in the yeast enzyme (deletion of 8 residues in scRad27versus 7 residues in hFEN-1). Among these possibilities, the deletion mutant protein that Stucki et al. and the one that we have constructed may have different folding properties, solubility, and consequently different biochemical functions. We have found that the recombinant scRad27 proteins with multiple point mutations or deletions are not as stable as wild type scRad27 nuclease. The most deleterious case was the 8A mutant, where 8 amino acid residues (337) were converted into a large cluster of alanines. Despite this, we were able to purify the mutant proteins and perform the nuclease activity assays. All of the mutants included in this study have a wild type level of nuclease activities in PCNA-independent assays. Their nuclease activities could be stimulated by PCNA to a level similar to that of the wild type nucleases. Therefore, the stimulation that we observed with these mutants is most likely specific and real. Several mutants, including 3A and"

Tidal heating should not be significant for Callisto, and, in the absence of such heating, it is difficult to see how this internal ocean could have survived until today without freezing1,6. Previous work3,4 indicated that an outer ice layer on the ocean would be unstable against solid-state convection, which once begun would lead to total freezing of liquid water in about 108 years. Here I show that when a methodology7 for more physically reasonable water ice viscosities (that is, stress-dependent non-newtonian viscosities, rather than the stress-independent newtonian viscosities considered previously) is adopted, the outer ice shell becomes stable against convection. This implies that a subsurface ocean could have survived up to the present, without the need for invoking antifreeze substances or other special conditions."

PPARγ is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, and its central role as a key adipogenic determination factor is well established (12Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

Two classes of synthetic insulin-sensitizing compounds, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and phenoxyacetic acids, and the prostaglandin metabolite, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) serve as ligands of PPARγ and can promote the differentiation of cells into adipocytes (11Berger J.

PPARγ is also expressed in the skeletal muscle of rodents and humans, suggesting that it may play a role in myogenesis and/or muscle cell function (8Auboeuf D. Rieusset J. Fajas L. Vallier P.

Like adipogenesis, myogenesis is a multistep process subject to regulation by exogenous and endogenous signals, such as hormones and growth factors (20Buckingham M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This process is orchestrated principally by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors that includes MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4 (20Buckingham M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Myogenic regulatory factors function in a hierarchical manner and are differentially required for the establishment and maintenance of the myogenic phenotype in proliferating myoblasts and for the activation of muscle-specific gene expression in terminally differentiated muscle cells. A physiological role for PPARγ in muscle is suggested by the fact that insulin sensitizers such as the TZDs act in muscle, the main site for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (26Vidal-Puig A.J.

Also, TZDs have been shown to enhance the expression of adipogenic and lipid metabolic genes in skeletal muscle of type II diabetic patients (18Kruszynska Y.T. Mukherjee R. Jow L. Dana S.

Moreover, certain PPARγ ligands, including TZDs and fatty acid derivatives, have been shown to inhibit myogenesis in cultured myogenic cell lines and, under certain conditions, to induce an adipose-like phenotype in these cells (30Hu E.

Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, forced expression of PPARγ in myoblasts inhibits muscle cell differentiation and, under appropriate conditions, causes their transdifferentiation into mature adipocytes, suggesting that PPARγ can induce a developmental switch between two specialized cell types (30Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these findings remains to be established; however, in conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathy, obesity, and diabetes, fat cell accumulation in muscle tissue is observed. Also, ablation of MyoD and Myf-5 genes in mice results in the loss of muscle and its replacement by fat tissue (33Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R.

PPARγ ligands such as the TZDs and 15d-PGJ2 have been shown to elicit a diverse range of shared and distinct biological effects, some of which appear to be mediated through pathways that are independent of PPARγ (35Negishi M.

To further explore the role of PPARγ and its ligands on myogenesis and muscle cell-specific gene expression, we examined the effects of three different classes of PPARγ ligands, the TZD ciglitazone, the phenoxyacetic acid L-805645, and the prostaglandin derivative 15d-PGJ2, on the differentiation of mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 cells and on the expression of a reporter gene linked to the promoter/enhancer regulatory region of the MyoD gene (MyoDLuc). We show here that 15d-PGJ2 specifically represses the morphological and biochemical differentiation of C2C12 cells. In contrast, L-805645 and ciglitazone exhibited no effects. Moreover, saturating levels of L-805645 did not ablate the 15d-PGJ2-mediated effects on differentiation. In transient transfection assays, 15d-PGJ2 specifically inhibited expression by MyoDLuc and did so independently of exogenously expressed PPARγ, whereas repression of MyoDLuc by L805645 or ciglitazone was observed only in the presence of exogenously expressed PPARγ. These findings indicate that distinct PPARγ ligands can inhibit MyoD gene expression via PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent pathways and that the ability of 15d-PGJ2 to inhibit myogenesis is independent of its cognate receptor, PPARγ. Mammalian expression plasmids for mouse PPARγ2 (mPPARγ2) and human PPARγ2 (hPPARγ2) and PPARγ1, mPPARα, human 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXRα), and hPPARγ2Δ500 and the reporter plasmid pAOx(X2)GL, which contains two tandem copies of the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) from the promoter of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) gene, have been described (11Berger J.

MyoDLuc is a luciferase reporter gene construct that contains a 2.7-kbp fragment of the human MyoD gene, including the proximal promoter and the transcription start site (−2,500 nucleotides to +198 nucleotides), linked to the 4-kbp far upstream enhancer region of the human MyoD gene promoter (42Goldhamer D.J.

Biol. 1995; 171: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This plasmid was constructed by subcloning a 6.5-kbp XhoI-SalI fragment from F3/−2.5 MyoDCAT (42Goldhamer D.J. Faerman A. Shani M.

Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the HindIII-XhoI sites of the pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) after first filling the ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The cloning strategy removes the minimal SV40 promoter present in pGL2. A reporter construct lacking the 4-kbp distal enhancer region of the MyoD gene promoter was generated by digestion of MyoDLucwith EcoRI. A reporter construct containing the distal enhancer region of the MyoD gene promoter fused to the SV40 promoter was generated by insertion of a 4-kbp EcoRI fragment from MyoDLuc, made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, into the SmaI site of pGL2. A reporter construct containing the 258-bp MyoD core enhancer (44Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson C.P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed by excising a HindIII-XbaI fragment from the plasmid meiCAT (a gift of Michael Rudnicki, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), filling in the ends of the fragment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and inserting the blunt fragment into the SmaI site of pGL2. MyogLuc contains 200 bp of the proximal promoter, including the transcription start site and enhancer, of the human myogenin gene (21Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jurs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) cloned into the SmaI site of the modified pGL2 vector lacking its SV40 promoter. Mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts and C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For analysis of differentiation, C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10-cm dish and switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum) when the cells reached ∼90% confluence (day 0). The medium was changed at days 1 and 3. Cells were supplemented with 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), 10 μm l-805645 2-(2-(4-phenoxy-2-propylphenoxy)-indole-5-acetic acid) (a gift of Joel Berger; Merck) or 50 μm ciglitazone (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) on days 0, 1, and 2. Control transfections were performed with the equivalent volume of appropriate vehicle: ethanol for 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone and dimethyl sulfoxide for L-805645. For morphological analysis, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with cold 90% methanol for 5 min at day 0 (90% confluence) and at days 2 and 4 postconfluence. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and stored in PBS plus 0.01% Thimersol (Sigma). Immunostaining was performed with MF-20, a mouse monoclonal anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (45Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with MF-20 in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) in PBS plus 5% nonfat dry milk with gentle shaking for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS and counterstained with 1.7 mm diaminobenzidine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.06% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with water, and cells were photographed. Cell nuclei were visualized by staining with hematoxylin (Sigma) for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using a commercially available kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of RNA per sample was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose, 7% formaldehyde gel in borate buffer (0.02 m borate, pH 8.3, 0.2 mm EDTA). RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to radiolabeled probes essentially as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989Google Scholar). The blot was subjected to autoradiography, and radiolabeled bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and normalized to the signal from phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) RNA, which was used as an internal standard for RNA loading. The same blot was used, after extensive washing, for hybridization to each of the probes. Probes were prepared by random primer labeling of plasmid vectors or purified restriction endonuclease fragments from cDNAs for α-, β-, and γ-actins, PGK, human MyoD, human myogenin (a gift from Michael Rudnicki, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), and mouse PPARγ2, using a commercially available kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dATP. Probes were purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 prior to use. C2C12, C3H10T1/2, and BSC40 cells, as indicated in the figure legends, were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described (40Kassam A. Hunter J. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were incubated in medium lacking phenol red and containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and transfected with 1.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of the indicated receptor expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a β-galactosidase expression vector used as an internal reference. Plasmid and promoter dosage in each case was normalized by the addition of the appropriate amount of corresponding empty vector. The PPARα ligand, Wy-14,643, was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, while the PPARγ ligands were added to a final concentration of 10 μm for 15d-PGJ2 and for L-805645 and of 50 μm for ciglitazone. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h posttransfection as described (5Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All transfections were carried out in duplicate at least three independent times or in triplicate at least two independent times. C2C12 cells are a well characterized cell culture model of muscle differentiation. Under conditions permissive for differentiation, such as low serum concentration or confluence, C2C12 myoblasts undergo differentiation to form myocytes, subsequently fusing into multinucleated myotubes. Certain PPARγ ligands have been shown to inhibit the myogenic program in both C2C12 and G8 myoblast cells (30Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 31Teboul L. Gaillard D. Staccini L. Inadera H. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Different PPARγ ligands, however, are known to have distinct biological effects and to function, in some cases, via PPAR-independent pathways. To explore the generality of action of PPARγ ligands on muscle cell differentiation, three distinct classes of PPARγ ligands were examined for their effects on the myogenesis of C2C12 cells: 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural cyclopentenone prostanoid (13Kliewer S.A.

Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosley R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol.

Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). The last two compounds belong to distinct classes of insulin sensitizers. C2C12 cells were incubated under conditions permissive for differentiation in the presence of 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm), L-805645 (10 μm), or ciglitazone (50 μm). Myogenesis was monitored at different times by immunostaining with an antibody, MF-20, directed against the myosin heavy chain (45Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Extensive myotube formation was observed in untreated cells at days 2 and 4 postconfluence (Fig. 1,panels A), as expected under these conditions. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the ability of these cells to form myocytes and myotubes (Fig. 1, compare panels B with panels A). Conversely, L-805645 and ciglitazone had no observable effect on the differentiation process on either day 2 or day 4 postconfluence (Fig. 1, compare panels C or panels D, respectively, with panels A). To quantify the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on myogenesis, the fusion index was determined. The fusion index is the percentage of nuclei incorporated into myosin heavy chain-positive (MHC+) cells versus the total number of nuclei (21Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jurs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 47Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J.

Thus, 15d-PGJ2, but not the other two PPARγ-specific ligands, represses the myogenesis of C2C12 cells. mRNA profiles were examined by Northern analysis to determine if 15d-PGJ2-mediated inhibition of muscle cell differentiation is associated with reduced expression of genes encoding myogenic transcription factors. C2C12 cells were incubated under the different conditions reported above, and mRNA levels for the myogenic markers MyoD, myogenin, and skeletal α-actin were determined for cells incubated in the absence or presence of 15d-PGJ2, L-805645, or ciglitazone at day 0 (90% confluence) and at 24-h intervals thereafter. MyoD is present both in myoblasts and myotubes, myogenin is a marker for C2C12 commitment to the differentiation pathway, and α-actin is a marker of terminal differentiation (25Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were quantified and standardized to the signal for PGK mRNA. Fig. 2, A–C, shows the results of Northern analysis with RNA isolated from 15d-PGJ2-, L-805645-, and ciglitazone-treated cells, respectively. The levels of MyoD mRNA remained constant relative to the signal for PGK mRNA in cells treated with vehicle during the time course of 3 days (compare day 0 with days 1, 2, and 3), while the levels of myogenin and α-actin mRNA increased ∼30-fold, as has been previously reported (25Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J.

To determine the spatial relationship and functional properties of the integrin β2 NTR and mid-region, we constructed β2/β7 chimeras in which the NTR, I-like domain, and the mid-region of the β2 subunit were replaced by those of β7. Changing either the β2 NTR or mid-region, but not the I-like domain to that of β7 did not affect LFA-1 (αLβ2) formation and surface expression. Thus, the specificity of αLβ2 pairing is conferred by the I-like domain but not the NTR or mid-region. Using these chimeras, the epitopes of six anti-β2 mAbs (H52, 7E4, AZN-L18, AZN-L27, KIM202, and MEM-148) were mapped. All except H52 require both the NTR and mid-region for epitope expression. Since these mAbs have distinct properties in terms of epitope expression and effect on LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1, we conclude that the β2 NTR and mid-region interact extensively. Although the I-like domain is located between the NTR and mid-region, its removal does not affect the folding of the β2NTR/mid-region complex because this complex alone can be expressed as a soluble protein and precipitated by the appropriate mAbs. Finally, the mAbs H52 and 7E4, abrogated KIM185- but not Mg/EGTAinduced LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding and the epitope of MEM-148 is expressed on Mg/EGTA-activated but not resting LFA-1. These results suggest that the NTR/mid-region complex is involved in the regulation of LFA-1 function.

N-terminal region Cys-rich region monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid fluorescein isothiocyanate bovine serum albumin The integrins are cell adhesion molecules formed by the non-covalent association of an α and a β subunit (1Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both subunits are type I membrane glycoproteins. The extracellular domain of the α subunits has been proposed to contain at the N-terminal a seven blade β-propeller structure (2Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), followed by 4–6 β-sandwich or β-barrel domains (3Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 9 of the 18 α subunits described to date have an inserted I-domain between the second and third blades of the β-propeller. For the integrins with an I-domain in their α subunits, the I-domains are invariably involved in ligand binding via their MIDAS motifs (4Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (845) Google Scholar). There is virtually no gross anomaly among the extracellular domains of the eight β integrin subunits. A very conserved region proposed to assume an I-domain-like structure (I-like domain) is located between the N-terminal region (NTR)1 and the mid-region in the linear sequence (Fig. 1). The NTR consists of a cysteine-rich region, which shares sequence similarities with plexins and semaphorins, and is therefore referred to as the PSI (for plexins, semaphorins, and integrins) domain (7Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and a spacer segment of ∼50 residues. The major cysteine-rich region (CRR) was found C-terminal to the mid-region, and the transmembrane segment and the cytoplasmic tail complete the primary structure of the β subunits. Not all αβ combinations are permissive for integrin heterodimer formation. In the case of the β2 integrins, the αL, αM, αX, and αD subunits only interact with the β2subunit, and vice versa. Thus, there must be structural specifications that govern the compatibility of the α and β subunits. Previously, we have shown that replacing the CRR of the β2 subunit with that of β1 does not affect its capacity to combine with the αL subunit for the surface expression of a variant LFA-1, but the variant LFA-1 is constitutively active with respect to ICAM-1 binding (8Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H. Buckley C.D. Al Shamkhani A. Shaw J.M. Scarth S.L. Simmons D.L. Law S.K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results allowed us to conclude that the CRR of β2 does not confer specificity in its combining with the αL subunit but must play a role in maintaining LFA-1 in its inactive conformation. Subsequently, using a series of β2 subunits truncated at different points from the C-terminal, we showed that the CRR is not required for combining with a full-length αL subunit for surface expression, but truncation into the mid-region abolished this activity (9Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the minimal β2 subunit that can support LFA-1 formation and surface expression contains the NTR, I-like domain, and the mid-region. What is the structural organization and functions of these regions? The I-like domain is the key region that interacts with the α subunits. Extensive analyses of mAb epitope expression on the LFA-1 αLβ2 heterodimer and on the individual αL and β2 subunits showed that the β-propeller of the αL subunit and the I-like domain of the β2 subunit require each other for the proper assembly of the LFA-1 heterodimer (10Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The folding of other regions do not appear to require interaction with the counter subunit. In addition, the epitope of the mAb YTA-1 was found to composed of elements located both in the αL β-propeller and β2 I-like domain, thus providing direct evidence that the two regions interact with each other (12Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The I-like domain is also involved in ligand binding because the epitopes of many anti-β2function-blocking mAbs, such as MHM23 and IB4, are mapped to the I-like domain (13Xiong Y.M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations have been identified in the I-like domain of the β subunits, which appear to have no effect on its capacity to form an integrin heterodimer but abolish the ligand binding capacity of the resultant integrins (14Hogg N. Stewart M.P. Scarth S.L. Newton R. Shaw J.M. Law S.K.A. Klein N. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 103: 97-106Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20913-20919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The I-like domain was modeled to assume a variant dinucleotide binding fold in which the N and C termini are found in close proximity (18Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting the NTR and mid-region flanking the I-like domain are close to each other. This model is consistent with the work by Calveteet al. (19Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) who proposed that Cys-5 and Cys-435 of the β3 subunit are engaged in a disulfide bond. By analogy, this would predict a disulfide bond between Cys-25 and Cys-447 of the β2 subunit. This proposed disulfide bond, however, is not necessary since a β2 subunit truncated at Cys-445 was shown to support LFA-1 expression and function (9Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, other evidence is needed to establish the interaction between the NTR and mid-region. Many mAbs against the β1, β2, and β3 integrins have been reported to promote integrin-mediated adhesion. The current view is that they act like a wedge to perturb the interaction between the α and β subunit, which is necessary to constrain the integrins in a resting state (8Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H. Buckley C.D. Al Shamkhani A. Shaw J.M. Scarth S.L. Simmons D.L. Law S.K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although most of these mAbs are mapped to the CRR of the β subunits, several are mapped to the NTR or the mid-region. For example, N29 and AP5 have been mapped to the NTR of β1 and β3 subunits, respectively, and the HUTS mAbs to the mid-region of the β1 subunit (21Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11067-11075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus the NTR and mid-region may also contribute to the regulation of integrin functions. In order to further define the structural and functional roles of the NTR and mid-region, we have constructed β2/β7 chimeras in which the NTR, I-like domain, and the mid-region of the β2 subunit were replaced by those of β7 and studied their ability to support surface expression of LFA-1. Using these chimeras, we also mapped a panel of anti-β2 mAbs and found that they required both the NTR and mid-region for expression, suggesting an extensive interaction between the two regions. Finally, we showed that the NTR/mid-region complex can adopt a proper fold independent of other regions of the β2 integrin subunit and the α subunit. The mAbs MHM23 (dimer-specific) and MHM24 (anti-αL) (24Hildreth J.E. Gotch F.M. Hildreth P.D. McMichael A.J. Eur. J.

Puklavec (MRC Cellular Immunology Unit, Oxford, UK). ICAM-1/Fc was prepared as described previously (26Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: a practical approach.

The αLcDNA in expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) and the β2 cDNA in pBluescript (pBS) KS− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (pBS-J8.1E) were described previously (8Douglass W.A.

The β7 cDNA was cloned from a human peripheral blood monocyte cDNA library in λ vector λGT10 (BDCLONTECH, Hampshire, UK). The β2/β7 chimeras, the β2I-negative variant, and the soluble β2 NTR/mid-region constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques. The truncated variant β2C445* was described previously (9Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K.A. J.

The authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing before subsequent subcloning into expression vector pcDNA3. The X (XbaI), Y (StyI), B (BsmI), and N (NcoI) are restriction enzyme sites in the β2 cDNA (28Kishimoto T.K. O'Connor K. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A.

Ruegg C. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11009-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The XY region would approximately correspond to the PSI with the spacer region collectively referred to as the NTR. The YB region approximates the I-like domain, BN the mid-region, and NV the CRR. Hence β2XY7, for example, would represent the β2 construct with its XY region exchanged with that of β7. COS-7 cells (monkey kidney fibroblast) (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in complete medium: RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (Sigma) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). MOLT-4 cells (T Lymphoblast) (ATCC) were grown in complete medium with penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). COS-7 transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method (9Tan S.M.

To detect intracellular proteins (in the case of COS-7 transfectants expressing β2XY7 and β2C445*), cells were harvested and washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed with 50 μl of PBS containing 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed once with 150 μl of PBS and incubated in 50 μl of cytoskeletal stabilizing (CSK) buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm PIPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) containing 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were washed once in 150 μl of CSK buffer and incubated in 50 μl of CSK buffer containing primary mAb (20 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequent washing steps, secondary mAb incubation, and detection were performed as described before. For determining the effect of Mg/EGTA (5 mmMgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) on the epitope expression of the mAbs, MOLT-4 cells (∼2 × 104) were incubated with primary mAbs (20 μg/ml) in either 50 μl of wash buffer (RPMI 1640 with 5% (v/v) HI-FBS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), or wash buffer with Mg/EGTA. The cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were washed twice with the corresponding wash buffer, stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, and analyzed as described above. mAb KIM185 (∼2 mg/ml) was prepared in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). FITC (1 mg/ml, Sigma) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the mAb solution to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, NH4Cl was added to the reaction mixture to 50 mm and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Unconjugated FITC was removed from the mAb solution using the Nick Spin column-G50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) equilibrated with PBS according to the manufacturer's instructions. KIM185-FITC in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA was stored in the dark at 4 °C. Analysis of LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 was carried out in wells of Polysorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with 100 μl/well of goat-anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) (Sigma), at 5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2) for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 50 μl of ICAM-1/Fc (1 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.1%(w/v) BSA was added to each well of the coated plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. This coating was shown to be saturating for detection of LFA-1-mediated adhesion (8Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H. Buckley C.D. Al Shamkhani A. Shaw J.M. Scarth S.L. Simmons D.L. Law S.K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MOLT-4 cells were harvested and labeled with 3.0 mm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF, AM) fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were washed once in wash buffer, resuspended, and dispensed into each well of the ligand-coated plates at ∼2 × 104cells/well followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For different adhesion assays, cells were incubated with various combinations of activating and blocking reagents. The mAbs MHM24 or KIM185 were used at 10 μg/ml. Mg/EGTA was also used to activate LFA-1. Total cell fluorescence was determined using a fluorescence plate reader (CytoFluor 4000, PerSeptive Biosystem, Framingham, MA). Plates were washed three times with wash buffer, and the fluorescence of cells bound was determined. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 transfectants were detached with trypsin and ∼1 × 106 cells were transferred into wells of 6-well tissue culture plate and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell surface labeling was carried out by washing adherent cells twice in PBS followed by incubation in EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Perbio, Cheshire, UK) at 0.5 mg/ml in PBS for 20 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by washing the surface-labeled cells once in PBS containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and cell lysates were prepared. For detecting soluble NTR/mid-region protein, COS-7 transfectants were incubated for 30 min in Met/Cys-free RPMI 1640 (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Hampshire, UK) at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated for 6 h in 3 ml of Met/Cys-free RPMI 1640 containing 300 mg/Ll-glutamine, 5% (v/v), dialyzed HI-FBS, and 120 μCi/ml of Translabel [35S]Met/Cys (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The spent medium was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. One milliliter of spent medium was used for immunoprecipitation. Labeled cells were lysed by incubating on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 mm iodoacetamide, 3 mm NaN3). Cell nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 15 min, 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. Cell lysate (200 μl) or spent medium (1 ml) was precleared with an irrelevant antibody MRC OX33 (IgG1) (50 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant) and rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) before immunoprecipitation with the desired mAb (3 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed once with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, followed by another wash with lysis buffer, and then loaded onto a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion. After centrifugation for 3 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C, beads were washed once with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer containing 30 mmdithiothreitol at 85 °C for 5 min. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For surface labeling studies, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) by electrophoresis and biotinylated protein bands detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase followed by ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For metabolic labeling analysis, the protein gel was fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 20% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol for 20 min, incubated in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min, vacuum-dried at 80 °C onto a 3 MM Whatman filter paper, and exposed to Fuji x-ray film for 48 h at −70 °C. We have previously shown that the CRR of the β2 subunit does not confer the specificity in its interaction with the αL subunit (8Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H. Buckley C.D. Al Shamkhani A. Shaw J.M.

Chimeric β2/β7 cDNAs in which the NTR, I-like domain or the mid-region was exchanged were constructed (the naming of the chimeras are described in “Materials and Methods”) (Fig.1). They were co-transfected into COS-7 cells with the full-length αL cDNA. The transfectants were surface labeled with biotin, and the lysates of LFA-1 variants were immunoprecipitated with the αL-specific mAb MHM24 (Fig. 2A). Both β2XY7 and β2BN7 chimeras, but not the β2YB7 chimera, co-precipitated with the αL subunit. Hence β2YB7 failed to support LFA-1 surface expression. This could not be due to defective β2YB7 biosynthesis because it was detected on the cell surface by the mAb KIM185, which is specific for the CRR of the β2 subunit (Fig.2B) (31Stephens P. Romer J.T. Spitali M. Shock A. Ortlepp S. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The low level of expression of the αL subunit in the αLβ2YB7 transfectant is in agreement with the absence of heterodimer on the cell surface, and the observation that the αL subunit can be expressed on the surface on its own at a reduced level (8Douglass W.A.

The β7 NTR has 28 more amino acids than that of β2 (28Kishimoto T.K. O'Connor K. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11009-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), accounting for the slight elevation in the Mr of β2XY7. The β7 mid-region, though only having three extra residues than that of β2, has two extraN-glycosylation sites. Glycosylation of these sites may account for the significant increase in the Mrof β2BN7. The above panel of β2/β7 chimeras, together with the variants β2NV7 and β2C445*, were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the expression of the epitopes of various β2-specific mAbs was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig.3). Two points should be noted. 1) Since the epitope of certain mAbs of the integrin β subunit may be masked by the α subunit (Ref. 20Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar; see later section for the mAb MEM-148) the cells were transfected with the β subunits only; and 2) since the chimera β2XY7 and the truncated variant β2C445* were not expressed on the cell surface in the absence of the αLsubunit, these transfectants were fixed and permeabilized before analyses. β2wt showed positive staining with all the β2-specific mAbs while β7wt only stained with the β7-specific mAb BP6. β2XY7 only showed positive staining with mAbs H52 and KIM185. β2YB7 showed positive staining with all anti-β2 mAbs except for AZN-L27. β2BN7 only stained with mAb KIM185. β2NV7 showed positive staining with all anti-β2 mAbs except KIM185. In addition, β2NV7 also stained positive with BP6, thus the epitope of BP6 is located in the CRR of β7. The truncated β2C445* variant showed positive staining with mAbs H52, 7E4, KIM202, MEM-148, and at a lower level with AZN-L27 but not AZN-L18. Thus, changing either the β2 NTR (β2XY7) or mid-region (β2BN7), but not the I-like domain (β2YB7), to that of β7 abolished the epitope expression of most of the anti-β2 mAbs with the exception of KIM185. Furthermore, the exchange of the β2 I-like domain also abrogated the epitope expression of AZN-L27. These results suggest that the NTR and the mid-region, in addition to interacting with the I-like domain, must also interact with each other to form a complex structure. Based on their expression on the chimeric β2/β7 subunits and the truncated variant β2C445*, the six mAbs can be segregated into four groups: H52, whose epitope is located to the β2 mid-region; AZN-L27, whose epitope expression requires the β2 NTR, I-like domain, and the mid-region; KIM202, 7E4, and MEM148, whose epitopes require the β2 NTR and mid-region, but not the I-like domain for expression; and AZN-L18 whose epitope, although also requiring the β2 NTR and mid-region for expression, is not expressed on β2C445* (see Table I). We reasoned that investigation into the effects of these mAbs on LFA-1-mediated adhesion would yield information on the functional properties of the NTR/mid-region complex. The adhesion of MOLT-4 cells to immobilized ICAM-1 was studied (Fig.4). MOLT-4 cells did not adhere to ICAM-1 unless stimulated with an activating mAb, in this case we used KIM185, or with Mg/EGTA. None of the six mAbs promoted adhesion. Both Mg/EGTA- and KIM185-induced adhesions were inhibited by AZN-L27. In addition, H52 and 7E4 were able to inhibit KIM185-induced adhesion but not Mg/EGTA-induced adhesion. KIM202, AZN-L18, and MEM-148 had no effect on adhesion induced by either reagent.Table IProperties of the six β2 specific mAbs studiedmAbRegions affecting Epitope ExpressionaThe region(s) on the integrin β2 subunit when exchanged with the corresponding one of β7 abrogates the mAb epitope expression.
