https://openalex.org/W2152310279,"Inflammation is linked clinically and epidemiologically to cancer, and NF-kappaB appears to play a causative role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that transient activation of Src oncoprotein can mediate an epigenetic switch from immortalized breast cells to a stably transformed line that forms self-renewing mammospheres that contain cancer stem cells. Src activation triggers an inflammatory response mediated by NF-kappaB that directly activates Lin28 transcription and rapidly reduces let-7 microRNA levels. Let-7 directly inhibits IL6 expression, resulting in higher levels of IL6 than achieved by NF-kappaB activation. IL6-mediated activation of the STAT3 transcription factor is necessary for transformation, and IL6 activates NF-kappaB, thereby completing a positive feedback loop. This regulatory circuit operates in other cancer cells lines, and its transcriptional signature is found in human cancer tissues. Thus, inflammation activates a positive feedback loop that maintains the epigenetic transformed state for many generations in the absence of the inducing signal."
https://openalex.org/W2141964964,"Theta oscillations are believed to play an important role in the coordination of neuronal firing in the entorhinal (EC)-hippocampal system but the underlying mechanisms are not known. We simultaneously recorded from neurons in multiple regions of the EC-hippocampal loop and examined their temporal relationships. Theta-coordinated synchronous spiking of EC neuronal populations predicted the timing of current sinks in target layers in the hippocampus. However, the temporal delays between population activities in successive anatomical stages were longer (typically by a half theta cycle) than expected from axon conduction velocities and passive synaptic integration of feed-forward excitatory inputs. We hypothesize that the temporal windows set by the theta cycles allow for local circuit interactions and thus a considerable degree of computational independence in subdivisions of the EC-hippocampal loop."
https://openalex.org/W2007886976,"Previous work has shown that mature B cells depend upon survival signals delivered to the cells by their antigen receptor (BCR). To identify the molecular nature of this survival signal, we have developed a genetic approach in which ablation of the BCR is combined with the activation of specific, BCR dependent signaling cascades in mature B cells in vivo. Using this system, we provide evidence that the survival of BCR deficient mature B cells can be rescued by a single signaling pathway downstream of the BCR, namely PI3K signaling, with the FOXO1 transcription factor playing a central role.

Mature B cells in the peripheral immune system depend on two central survival determinants, the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and the receptor for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokine, BAFF (Lam et al., 1997Lam K.P.

Whereas the BCR controls the response of the cells to cognate antigen, the BAFF-R senses BAFF produced by neighboring cells in the B cell habitat and is thus critically involved in controlling B cell numbers. In BAFF or BAFF-R deficient mice, mature B cells scarcely develop, and BAFF depletion in adult animals leads to rapid apoptosis of these cells (Batten et al., 2000Batten M. Groom J. Cachero T.G.

This indicated that the BCR on resting, mature B cells transmits “tonic” survival signals into the cells, either upon interaction with ligands in the environment or spontaneously. The notion of “tonic” BCR signals keeping mature B cell alive is supported by additional, more indirect evidence (Bannish et al., 2001Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G.

Upon BAFF engagement, the BAFF-R signals mainly through the alternative NF-κB pathway, and there is evidence that BAFF-R-mediated activation of the latter is critical for mature B cell survival, although additional factors may be involved (Mecklenbrauker et al., 2004Mecklenbrauker I.

However, in the case of the BCR, which can activate multiple signaling cascades, the nature of the survival signal has remained unresolved. One recent hypothesis is based on evidence that BCR engagement can activate the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and mature B cells require canonical NF-κB signals for their in vivo maintenance (Cariappa et al., 2000Cariappa A.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar to propose a model in which mature B cell survival is based on an NF-κB-mediated crosstalk between BCR and BAFF-R. In this model, BCR-mediated canonical NF-κB signals enhance BAFF-R signaling by transcriptional upregulation of the genes encoding BAFF-R on the one hand and p100, a critical component of the alternative NF-κB pathway, on the other (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004Bonizzi G. Karin M. The two NF-kappaB activation pathways and their role in innate and adaptive immunity.Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). However, while this mechanism may well play a role upon B cell activation, its role in B cell maintenance remained speculative and is not easily compatible with other experimental evidence (Ruland et al., 2001Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In an attempt to directly assess the molecular nature of the BCR-mediated survival signal for mature B cells, we have developed a system, in which conditional ablation of the BCR in mature B cells in vivo is combined with the conditional activation of candidate signaling cascades in the same cells. Using this approach, we find that mature B cells losing their BCR are fully rescued by activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, but not that of canonical NF-κB. Thus, PI3K signaling, which has recently emerged as a critical determinant of B cell development (Aiba et al., 2008Aiba Y. Kameyama M. Yamazaki T. Tedder T.F. Kurosaki T.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 6332-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) also provides a critical survival signal for mature B cells. For targeted deletion of the BCR in mature B cells, we used the CD21-cre transgene, expressed when B cells differentiate from transitional to mature cells (Kraus et al., 2004Kraus M. Alimzhanov M.B. Rajewsky N. Rajewsky K. Survival of resting mature B lymphocytes depends on BCR signaling via the Igalpha/beta heterodimer.Cell. 2004; 117: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), in combination with the B1-8f allele, in which the B1-8 VDJ gene segment, sitting in its physiological position in the IgH locus, is flanked by loxP sites (Lam et al., 1997Lam K.P. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. In vivo ablation of surface immunoglobulin on mature B cells by inducible gene targeting results in rapid cell death.Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). We complemented this system by a third genetic element, which would rescue the BCR deficient cells by concomitant, Cre-mediated activation of a survival signal mimicking the one normally provided by the BCR. Following a strategy which we had previously developed (Sasaki et al., 2006Sasaki Y. Derudder E. Hobeika E. Pelanda R. Reth M. Rajewsky K. Schmidt-Supprian M. Canonical NF-kappaB activity, dispensable for B cell development, replaces BAFF-receptor signals and promotes B cell proliferation upon activation.Immunity. 2006; 24: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we generated a series of ROSA26 alleles harboring cDNAs of constitutively active signaling molecules, preceded by a loxP flanked STOP cassette and marked by a GFP gene under the control of an internal ribosomal entry site downstream of the inserted cDNA. In combination with CD21-cre and B1-8f, cDNA and GFP expression would coincide with BCR deletion in mature B cells, allowing us to determine whether a signaling pathway is activated which rescues BCRneg mature B cells (Figure 1A). One of the constitutively active signaling molecules that we conditionally expressed from the ROSA26 locus was MP110∗, a constitutively active form of P110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3K (Klippel et al., 1996Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is sufficient to activate multiple signal-transducing kinase pathways.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will refer to this allele, which is described in Figure S1 (available online), as P110∗ throughout the paper. As compound mutant mice expressing P110∗ in mature B cells died soon after birth, possibly due to the expression of CD21-cre, and consequently P110∗, in the forebrain (Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007Schmidt-Supprian M. Rajewsky K. Vagaries of conditional gene targeting.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we studied the requirement of PI3K activity for the survival of BCRneg B cells in chimeric mice, generated by transfer of fetal liver cells of the compound mutants into syngeneic RAG2/common γ chain deficient recipients, which are lymphocyte deficient (Cao et al., 1995Cao X. Shores E.W. Hu-Li J. Anver M.R. Kelsall B.L. Russell S.M. Drago J. Noguchi M. Grinberg A. Bloom E.T. et al.Defective lymphoid development in mice lacking expression of the common cytokine receptor gamma chain.Immunity. 1995; 2: 223-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Lymphocyte development was reconstituted in the chimeric mice, and no lethality was observed in recipients of either CD21-cre;B1-8f/JHT or P110∗/+;CD21-cre;B1-8f/JHT fetal liver cells. JHT is a null allele of the IgH locus (Gu et al., 1993Gu H. Zou Y.R. Rajewsky K. Independent control of immunoglobulin switch recombination at individual switch regions evidenced through Cre-loxP-mediated gene targeting.Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), introduced into the system to limit IgH expression to the B1-8f allele. In accord with our previous work (Kraus et al., 2004Kraus M. Alimzhanov M.B. Rajewsky N. Rajewsky K. Survival of resting mature B lymphocytes depends on BCR signaling via the Igalpha/beta heterodimer.Cell. 2004; 117: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), IgMneg B cells were detectable in spleens from CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT fetal liver chimeric mice, but did not accumulate beyond around 10% of total mature B cells in steady state (Figure 1B). In striking contrast, 77% of splenic mature B cells (B220+, AA4.1-) from P110∗/+; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT chimeras were IgMneg. Essentially all and only those cells expressed GFP, indicating that Cre-mediated recombination occurred at the IgH and the ROSA26 locus with equal efficiency, and consistent with a requirement of P110∗ expression for the survival of these cells. The increased percentage of mature (B220+, AA4.1-) B cells in the chimeras carrying the P110∗ allele is consistent with the counter selection of such cells when they loose their BCR in the absence of P110∗ expression (Kraus et al., 2004Kraus M. Alimzhanov M.B. Rajewsky N. Rajewsky K. Survival of resting mature B lymphocytes depends on BCR signaling via the Igalpha/beta heterodimer.Cell. 2004; 117: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Rescue of BCRneg mature B cells by P110∗ was also seen in other lymphoid organs. Thus, a large fraction of mature (B220 high) B cells in the bone marrow of P110∗/+; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT chimeras were IgMneg and expressed GFP, whereas in the absence of the P110∗ allele all B220 high cells were IgMpos (Figure 1B, bottom row). Large numbers of GFP expressing IgMneg B cells also accumulated in the peritoneal cavity and lymph nodes of compound mutant chimeras carrying the P110∗ allele (Figure 1C). Numerically, the rescue of BCRneg mature B cells by P110∗ was extremely effective. P110∗/+; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT chimeras had more than twice the number of splenic B cells of their P110∗-negative counterparts, with almost all of the increase being due to the accumulation of IgMneg cells (Figure 1D). In comparison to mice without ongoing BCR ablation in mature B cells (B1-8f/JHT), the P110∗ rescue of IgMneg B cells generated a somewhat expanded peripheral B cell compartment (Figure 1D), partly due to a moderate expansion of the Marginal Zone (MZ) B cell subset (Figure S2). Histologically, a normal organization of BCRneg B cells into follicles and adjacent MZ was seen in the spleen, with a majority of BCRneg, B220+ cells intermingled with a minority of BCRpos, B220+ cells that had not undergone Cre-mediated recombination (Figures 2A and 2B). When analyzed by flow cytometry, mutant and control cells were identical in forward scatter analysis and expressed similar levels of the B cell markers B220, CD19 and CD21 (Figure 2C). CD23 was about 2-fold downregulated on the cells compared to controls, a phenomenon that will be further discussed below. Significantly, no upregulation of the activation markers CD95, CD69 and MHC II was seen in the rescued cells, suggesting that they were in a resting state like normal, mature B cells (Figure 3A). Accordingly, 84% of these cells did not incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into their DNA over a 20 day feeding period, similar to the 80% unlabelled cells in the controls (Figure 3B,C; Forster and Rajewsky, 1990Forster I. Rajewsky K. The bulk of the peripheral B-cell pool in mice is stable and not rapidly renewed from the bone marrow.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 4781-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, 50% of the IgMneg B cells in compound mutants lacking the P110∗ allele incorporated BrdU, indicative of their rapid turnover (Kraus et al., 2004Kraus M. Alimzhanov M.B. Rajewsky N. Rajewsky K. Survival of resting mature B lymphocytes depends on BCR signaling via the Igalpha/beta heterodimer.Cell. 2004; 117: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). An unexpected finding was the low degree of BrdU incorporation in the population of IgMpos B cells in the CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT mutant chimeras (Figure 3C). Apparently, many of these cells escaped Cre-mediated recombination by an unknown mechanism.Figure 3P110∗-Rescued IgMneg B Cells Are Resting B Cells Dependent on BAFF for SurvivalShow full caption(A) Comparison of surface expression of activation markers on IgMpos (gray histograms) and IgMneg (black histograms) mature follicular B cells (gated on B220+, AA4.1- and CD23 high) from the spleen of CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT (left column) and P110∗/+; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT (right column) mice.(B) Representative FACS plots showing BrdU incorporation in B lymphocytes from spleen after 20 days of BrdU feeding of mice of indicated genotype.

Data are plotted as percent recovery of viable cells. As the P110∗-rescued BCRneg cells are well controlled in terms of overall cell numbers, one would predict that they retain the dependence of normal mature B cells on the survival factor BAFF. On the other hand, BAFF:BAFF-R induced activation of the alternative NF-kB pathway leads to the phosphorylation of Akt, which is a main downstream target of PI3K (Patke et al., 2006Patke A. Mecklenbrauker I. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Tarakhovsky A. BAFF controls B cell metabolic fitness through a PKC beta- and Akt-dependent mechanism.J. Exp.

We therefore assayed the BAFF dependence of P110∗-rescued BCRneg B cells in cell culture experiments (Batten et al., 2000Batten M. Groom J. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Browning J.L.

The P110∗-rescued BCRneg B cells are thus resting, long-lived cells, living in their normal habitats in the peripheral immune system and subject to normal homeostatic control. The efficient rescue of BCRneg B cells by P110∗ contrasted with our failure to rescue such cells by activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. We used for this purpose the conditional IKK2ca allele, from which constitutively active IκB kinase 2 (IKK2) is expressed, activating the canonical NF-κB pathway and rescuing B cells from BAFF dependency (Sasaki et al., 2006Sasaki Y. Derudder E. Hobeika E. Pelanda R. Reth M. Rajewsky K. Schmidt-Supprian M. Canonical NF-kappaB activity, dispensable for B cell development, replaces BAFF-receptor signals and promotes B cell proliferation upon activation.Immunity. 2006; 24: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Compound mutant mice of the genotypes CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT and IKK2ca/+; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT developed normally, so that the analysis of the B cell compartment did not require the generation of fetal liver chimeras. As shown in Figure 4, IKK2ca expression led to only a very limited rescue of BCRneg B cells in the spleen. This was also the case in other lymphoid organs (data not shown). Essentially all IgMneg cells expressed GFP, indicating that the cells had activated the IKK2ca transgene. The inefficient rescue of IgMneg cells by IKK2ca is not due to inefficient Cre-mediated recombination in this system, because 80% of mature B cells in IKK2ca/+;CD21-cre mice expressed GFP, indicative of efficient excision of the STOP cassette in the IKK2ca allele (Figure S3). The inefficient rescue by IKK2ca suggests that the rescue of BCRneg B cells by P110∗ is not mediated by NF-κB activation. Indeed, when we analyzed the expression of genes of the NF-κB pathway in such cells by quantitative RT-PCR, we saw little change in comparison to BCRpos controls or BCRneg cells lacking P110∗ (Figure S4). Only c-Rel transcripts were about 2-fold downregulated in the latter cells compared to their BCRpos counterparts, and this downregulation was not seen in the P110∗-rescued BCRneg cells. This result is in agreement with Matsuda et al., 2009Matsuda S. Mikami Y. Ohtani M. Fujiwara M. Hirata Y. Minowa A. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S.

We also analyzed the ability of two additional signaling molecules, which are rapidly activated upon BCR engagement, to rescue BCRneg B cells, namely MEK1, a member of the Raf-MEK-Erk MAP Kinase pathway, and the Rho GTPase Rac1 (Genot and Cantrell, 2000Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Ras regulation and function in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac1 upon BCR engagement leads to rapid actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangements, and ablation of Rac1 and 2 blocks B cell development (Walmsley et al., 2003Walmsley M.J.

Activation of the MAP Kinase pathway and Rac1 was done with the help of newly constructed ROSA26 alleles, from which constitutively active MEK1, MEK1DD (Cowley et al., 1994Cowley S. Paterson H.

When we used these alleles in our experimental in vivo system, they failed to rescue BCRneg B cells in the spleen, despite their ability to increase phospho-Erk levels and PAK1 binding activity, respectively, in splenic B cells (Figure S5; Bokoch, 2003Bokoch G.M. Biology of the p21-activated kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To corroborate that PI3K signaling is indeed the central survival signal in mature B cells downstream of the BCR, we assessed whether rescue of BCRneg B cells can also be achieved by deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor, the key negative regulator of the PI3K pathway via its phosphatase directed conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 (Suzuki et al., 2008Suzuki A.

Because Pten deletion by CD21-cre, like activation of P110∗, produces lethality in the compound mutant mice (data not shown), chimeric mice were generated, whose lymphocytes had either the CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT or Ptenf/Δ; CD21-cre; B1-8f/JHT genotype. The analysis of these mice revealed that Pten ablation rescued BCRneg B cells almost as efficiently as the P110∗ transgene (Figure 5).

In the bone marrow, the Pten deleted, rescued IgMneg (B220 high) B cells constituted 17% of all lymphocytes (Figure 5B).

The underlying mechanism by which tetherin functions and whether it directly or indirectly causes virion retention are unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which tetherin exerts its antiviral activity. We demonstrate, through mutational analyses and domain replacement experiments, that tetherin configuration rather than primary sequence is critical for antiviral activity. These findings allowed the design of a completely artificial protein, lacking sequence homology with native tetherin, that nevertheless mimicked its antiviral activity. We further show that tetherin is incorporated into HIV-1 particles as a parallel homodimer using either of its two membrane anchors. These results indicate that tetherin functions autonomously and directly and that infiltration of virion envelopes by one or both of tetherin's membrane anchors is necessary, and likely sufficient, to tether enveloped virus particles that bud through the plasma membrane."

In this study we demonstrate that the dorsal forebrain meninges communicate with the adjacent radial glial endfeet and influence cortical development. We took advantage of Foxc1 mutant mice with defects in forebrain meningeal formation. Foxc1 dosage and loss of meninges correlated with a dramatic reduction in both neuron and intermediate progenitor production and elongation of the neuroepithelium. Several types of experiments demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) is the key component of this secreted activity. In addition, Rdh10- and Raldh2-expressing cells in the dorsal meninges were either reduced or absent in the Foxc1 mutants, and Rdh10 mutants had a cortical phenotype similar to the Foxc1 null mutants. Lastly, in utero RA treatment rescued the cortical phenotype in Foxc1 mutants. These results establish RA as a potent, meningeal-derived cue required for successful corticogenesis."

Using a general linear model, we show that in single trials, EEG power in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) and phase in delta band (2–4 Hz) are significant predictors of the MUA response. Specifically, we found that the MUA response was strongest only when increases in EEG gamma power occurred during the negative-going phase of the delta wave, thus revealing a frequency-band coupling mechanism that can be exploited to infer population spiking activity.

This finding may open up a new dimension in the use and interpretation of EEG in normal and pathological conditions. The first electroencephalogram (EEG) recording was made over 80 years ago, and since then has become one of the most widely used tools for studying brain activity in humans (Lopes da Silva and Van Rotterdam, 1987Lopes da Silva F. Van Rotterdam A. Biophysical aspects of EEG and MEG generation.in: Neidermeyer E. Lopes da Silva F.H. Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications and Related Fields. Urban & Schwarzenberg, Baltimore1987: 15-28Google Scholar). Its noninvasive nature makes it an ideal neuroimaging method that is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in neurophysiological research even after the advent of other noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nevertheless, despite advancements in EEG technology that allow for the recording and localization of neural activity with ever increasing spatial resolution, it remains unknown which cortical processes are represented in the EEG signal and which are not. In particular, its relationship to the underlying spiking activity of a neuronal population is far from clear, especially when the neural processes under investigation reflect cognitive behavior. For years, the dominant view has been that the surface EEG signal reflects synchronized afferent or efferent activity of cells in an open-field arrangement (e.g., the pyramidal cells of the cortex that are arranged parallel to each other with all apical dendrites on one side and somata on the other) (Eccles, 1951Eccles J.C. Interpretation of action potentials evoked in the cerebral cortex.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1951; 3: 449-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Some modeling studies have suggested that stellate cells (classic closed-field generators) also contribute to the EEG (Tenke et al., 1993Tenke C.E. Schroeder C.E. Arezzo J.C. Vaughan Jr., H.G. Interpretation of high-resolution current source density profiles: a simulation of sublaminar contributions to the visual evoked potential.Exp. Brain Res. 1993; 94: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), though the net contribution from a large population of stellate neurons may be much weaker (due to geometrical cancellation) than the values based on a linear summation of individual neurons (Murakami and Okada, 2006Murakami S. Okada Y. Contributions of principal neocortical neurons to magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography signals.J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated a close correspondence between EEG activity and synaptic potentials (Creutzfeldt et al., 1966aCreutzfeldt O.D. Watanabe S. Lux H.D.

Cross-correlation analysis of electroencephalographic potentials and slow membrane transients.Science. 1965; 147: 519-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that the population excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of cortical neurons are major components of the EEG signal. Yet the aforementioned studies had also shown the existence of EEG responses that are not directly coupled to stimulation and do not relate to local cellular activity, such as after-discharges in the form of damped oscillations (Creutzfeldt et al., 1966aCreutzfeldt O.D. Watanabe S. Lux H.D. Relations between EEG phenomena and potentials of single cortical cells. I. Evoked responses after thalamic and erpicortical stimulation.Electroencephalogr. Clin.

Such activity was attributed to larger spatial summation of associational subcortical inputs or cortico-cortical interactions that affect local processing. Indeed, different frequency bands of the extracellularly measured local field potential (LFP), a more localized variant of the EEG, were later shown to reflect other types of neural activity unrelated to synaptic events (Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995Buzsaki G.

The properties and functional significance of different frequency bands of the LFP signal have recently received increased attention in neuroscience. Studies have reported that LFP bands with higher frequencies are spatially well localized (Goense and Logothetis, 2008Goense J.B. Logothetis N.K.

Biol. 2008; 18: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), ranging from several hundred micrometers to a few millimeters (Berens et al., 2008Berens P. Keliris G.A.

A question of paramount practical importance is whether different aspects of the EEG signal itself could also provide information regarding the spiking activity of cortical projections neurons, i.e., the output of cortical site. EEG certainly reflects a much larger integration area than LFPs, and therefore its ability to infer local neural activity (especially spiking activity) must be experimentally verified rather than inferred as an extrapolation from the LFP studies. Moreover, it is particularly important to investigate this in alert monkeys (thereby removing any potential effects of anesthesia, which is known to directly alter the EEG signal), and by using complex natural stimulus conditions (because artificial stimuli might not directly generalize to the processing of every day visual input) (Kayser et al., 2004Kayser C. Kording K.P. Konig P. Processing of complex stimuli and natural scenes in the visual cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the features of the EEG signal that yield reliable estimates of different types of neuronal activity, with emphasis on the EEG's ability to predict neuronal spiking of a population of neurons. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded the surface EEG together with LFP and multiunit activity (MUA) in behaving non-human primates while presenting natural movies. We first characterized the relationship between the well-known visual evoked potential (VEP) and the MUA. We then examined the relationship of power and phase of each frequency band of the EEG signal with MUA. Overall, we observed that the combination of EEG power in the gamma band (>30 Hz) along with the phase in the delta (2–4 Hz) yielded the most reliable estimate of population spiking activity during attentive visual processing. Specifically, the MUA response was strongest during periods where a burst of gamma power coincided with the negative trough of the ongoing delta wave. In contrast, the MUA response was smaller if a similar burst in gamma power occurred at an arbitrary delta phase. Intracortical recordings in the primary visual cortex, in combination with surface EEG were made in two awake, behaving monkeys. Figure 1A shows the trial average of evoked EEG, LFP, and MUA responses from a representative session. The evoked EEG and LFP were positively correlated to each other (r = 0.25 ± 0.03, p ≪ 0.01), while we also observed negative correlations for both evoked EEG (r = −0.12 ± 0.04, p = 0.06) and LFP (r = −0.21 ± 0.03, p ≪ 0.01) with respect to the mean spiking activity (MUA). The evoked EEG response consisted of a series of positive and negative-going deflections that varied in amplitude and latency depending on the movie. We were interested in how such deflections were related to the simultaneously acquired MUA. Therefore, we analyzed time periods where the evoked EEG response exceeded ± 2 standard deviations (SD) of the baseline activity. Within these time periods (which we define as “components”), we calculated the mean MUA activity during positive-going components and negative-going components. On average (two monkeys, four different movies), we found that the MUA associated with negative EEG components tended to be greater than the MUA associated with positive EEG components (p = 0.0508, Figure 1B). Additionally, the MUA underlying these negative EEG components was stronger than its mean value over the entire movie time course (dashed line in Figure 1B). In other words, the MUA tended to increase during periods of the movie eliciting a negative EEG component (p = 0.17), while the MUA tended to decrease during positive EEG components (p = 0.16). A comparison between power modulations of different EEG bands and the MUA from one representative session is shown in Figure 2A. In this example, power modulations of gamma activity (for example, at 43 Hz) are closely associated with modulations in MUA. In contrast, modulations in the alpha range (for example, at 12 Hz) are only minimal, and poorly correlated to the MUA. The mean correlation coefficient between modulations in EEG oscillatory power (obtained by band-pass filtering the data into the traditional frequency bands) and MUA, averaged over all experiments in both animals, is shown in Figure 2B. Both low frequency (delta and theta) and high frequency (low gamma and high gamma) power modulations were positively correlated to MUA, whereas midrange oscillations (alpha and beta) were not significantly correlated to MUA (summary of statistics are shown in Table S1 [available online]). Given that these frequency bands are based on human studies that might not be applicable to primates, we additionally performed time-dependent spectral analysis from which we correlated the power of each oscillatory time course (frequency resolution ∼1Hz) with the MUA. Here, we found that EEG power modulations in the 11–20 Hz range were not significantly correlated to MUA. This finding was similar to the LFP, where the 9–23 Hz range was not significantly correlated to the MUA (Figure S1). This range of frequencies overlaps the alpha and beta range and is similar to the results we obtained with standard band separation techniques using band-pass filters. Therefore, all subsequent findings reported here are based on band-limited EEG oscillations in the six aforementioned frequency bands. The observed low correlation between midrange oscillatory power and MUA might reflect slight temporal discrepancies between the two time courses. To rule out temporal offsets as the cause of the low correlation observed between alpha/beta oscillatory power and MUA, we shifted their EEG time courses in various time steps and recalculated their correlation coefficient with MUA. These results are shown in Figure S2. The gamma power showed the strongest correlation with MUA at approximately zero lag, whereas for alpha and beta power the correlation was similar across all time lags, further indicating that modulations in EEG alpha/beta power are indeed uncorrelated to MUA activity. To test whether the modulation of phase of different EEG bands carries any information about spiking activity, we extracted the instantaneous phase of each of the six frequency bands and compared it with the corresponding MUA. We computed the probability of finding enhanced MUA (exceeding 5 SD above its baseline) as a function of oscillatory phase. These results are shown in Figure 3A. Rayleigh testing revealed a significant preferred phase-of-firing distribution for delta oscillations (median p ≪ 0.001, Figure 3B). That is, enhanced spiking was strongly tuned to the phase of the EEG delta oscillation. In agreement with other studies, we also found that EEG gamma power was significantly tuned to low-frequency phase (data not shown) (Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E. Dalal S.S. Soltani M. Nagarajan S.S. Kirsch H.E. Berger M.S. Barbaro N.M. Knight R.T. High gamma power is phase-locked to theta oscillations in human neocortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, Lakatos et al., 2005Lakatos P. Karmos G.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). However, this effect was much weaker than that observed in the MUA (the mean p value obtained from Rayleigh testing was 0.0047 ± 0.0035 for MUA/delta phase and 0.06 ± 0.04 for gamma/delta phase). That is, the coupling between MUA and EEG delta phase was significantly stronger than that observed between EEG gamma power and delta phase. In over 80% of all experimental sessions (acquired from both monkeys), the preferred phase of spiking was in the [π/2, π] range. This range corresponds to the negative-trough of the delta oscillation, and thus is consistent with our earlier finding where negative evoked components coincided with a high firing rate (Figure 1). It should be noted that theta also had a significant phase-of-firing (Rayleigh test, median p value < 0.01), though was considerably less tuned to the MUA than the delta. The remaining oscillatory bands were not significantly tuned to MUA (Figure S3). Our current EEG observations are directly compatible with earlier findings from our lab (Montemurro et al., 2008Montemurro M.A. Rasch M.J. Murayama Y. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Phase-of-firing coding of natural visual stimuli in primary visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) showing robust LFP phase-of firing in anesthetized animals for frequencies below 12 Hz. However, the current analysis suggests that it might be mainly the delta band that shows a particular EEG phase-of-firing in awake, behaving monkeys. Given our results, we wanted to know whether the spiking activity from a population of neurons could be modeled by using the surface EEG alone. Put more specifically, we were interested in whether EEG information in the power and phase domain could be combined to estimate the underlying MUA time course. To answer this question, we constructed six general linear models (GLM), each consisting of two regressors. The first regressor consisted of the EEG power time course from one of the six frequency bands; the second, a time course representing the phase of the delta oscillation, normalized to its preferred phase-of-firing. We chose delta as the sole phase regressor given that it had the strongest phase-of-firing probability. An example of GLM construction is shown in Figure 4. The mean goodness-of-fit values (R2) evaluated for each of the six GLM models are shown in Figure S4A. The distribution of these fits was similar when using LFP data, though the R2 values were considerably larger (Figure S4B). For EEG data, only models 5 (gamma L. power and delta phase, p ≪ 0.01) and 6 (gamma H. power and delta phase, p ≪ 0.01) could significantly predict the underlying MUA. F-testing revealed that the phase regressor added significant information to the model which could not be explained by the power alone. Furthermore, their respective beta values were statistically similar (βpower = 0.15 ± 0.03, βphase = 0.14 ± 0.02, p = 0.70) indicating that their contribution to modeling the MUA was comparable. Overall, the GLM results reveal two important findings: (1) certain aspects of the EEG signal (e.g., power and phase of individual frequency bands) can be used to reliably estimate modulations in the underlying MUA during presentation of natural movies (R2 = 0.12 ± 0.01, p ≪ 0.01), and (2) the model is not equivalent for all oscillatory bands. There exists only a specific combination of oscillatory power and phase that yields a significant estimate of MUA, whereas the remaining combinations yield low or insignificant MUA fits. The GLM results suggest that the MUA is dependent on the specific interaction between high frequency power and low frequency phase (from here on, we refer to this as cross-frequency coupling, or frequency-band coupling). Should this indeed be the case, we would expect to see strong MUA responses when an increase in EEG gamma power coincides with the preferred (∼π) delta phase, and weaker MUA responses when similar increases in EEG gamma power appear at a different delta phase. This is highlighted in the two shaded areas of Figure 4 (t1 and t2). In Figure 4, increases in gamma power that occur during the preferred delta phase result in increased MUA, which is accurately portrayed by the GLM model (label t1 in Figure 4E). However, at a different time point (label t2 in Figure 4E), a similar gamma power is observed as at time point t1, but it coincides with the antipreferred delta phase. Here, spiking activity is modeled as being low, which is consistent with the measured data. In other words, had only gamma power been used to model the MUA, the GLM would have incorrectly modeled the MUA as having a response equal to that in time point t1. To investigate this further, we expressed the raw MUA as a function of gamma power and delta phase in single trials and then averaged over all trials and animals. This is shown in Figure 5A. As expected, we found that the MUA increased with increasing gamma power, though delta phase also played a role in shaping the MUA. We found that the MUA was highest only when a high gamma power coincided with the preferred delta phase (Figure 5A). Such robust frequency-band coupling (FBC) was not observed when using shuffled data (Figure 5B) and was weak in other EEG frequency bands (Figure S5). In other words, MUA power depends on the precise interaction between gamma power and delta phase. In the current study, we made simultaneous recordings of surface EEG and spiking activity from a population of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys during the presentation of natural stimuli, i.e., movie clips. To the best of our knowledge, our results unveil for the first time features of the surface EEG signal that correlate best with the concomitant population firing rate (MUA) under natural viewing conditions. Moreover, our examination of the relationship between power and phase of different frequency bands reveals the existence of a coupling mechanism between the power of one band and the phase of another, i.e., FBC. This FBC can be exploited for estimating the relative MUA amplitude solely from the surface EEG. We first examined the relationship of MUA with the trial-averaged EEG signal—the so-called VEP that is assumed to reflect synchronous changes of slow postsynaptic potentials occurring within a large number of similarly oriented cortical pyramidal neurons (Nunez, 1981Nunez P.L. Electric Fields of the Brain: The Neurophysics of EEG. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1981Google Scholar, Schroeder et al., 1991Schroeder C.E. Tenke C.E. Givre S.J. Arezzo J.C. Vaughan Jr., H.G. Striate cortical contribution to the surface-recorded pattern-reversal VEP in the alert monkey.Vision Res. 1991; 31: 1143-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). VEPs usually consist of brief deflections (components) embedded in the background EEG that are commonly characterized by their polarity and latency. They are widely used to study cognitive processes in both basic and clinical research settings, though the cortical events underlying the generation of VEPs under natural stimulus conditions remain poorly understood. We found that the MUA associated with negative-going VEP components was slightly larger compared to positive-going VEP components (Figure 1B). Additionally, the MUA tended to increase (relative to its mean activity over the entire movie time course) during negative VEP deflections, which is consistent with previous macaque studies using a combined surface VEP and MUA methodology (Schroeder et al., 1990Schroeder C.E. Tenke C.E. Givre S.J. Arezzo J.C. Vaughan Jr., H.G.

Our findings that negative VEP components are linked to spiking activity during natural viewing conditions may be used to better interpret VEPs in healthy humans (Whittingstall et al., 2007Whittingstall K. Stroink G. Schmidt M. Evaluating the spatial relationship of event-related potential and functional MRI sources in the primary visual cortex.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2007; 28: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and help in noninvasively assessing the effects of different neurological disorders in patients. For instance, in patients with optic neuritis, studies have reported a complete absence of the early negative VEP component though the ensuing positive component is preserved (albeit slightly delayed in time) (Andersson and Siden, 1995Andersson T. Siden A. An analysis of VEP components in optic neuritis.Electromyogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1995; 35: 77-85PubMed Google Scholar). Although trial-averaged MUA and surface VEP responses are related, it should be noted that the analysis of trial-averaged VEP assumes that evoked components are consistent across trials, which is not always valid (Jung et al., 2001Jung T.P. Makeig S. Westerfield M. Townsend J. Courchesne E. Sejnowski T.J. Analysis and visualization of single-trial event-related potentials.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2001; 14: 166-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important test is to further investigate EEG-MUA correlations in single trials. For this, we performed a spectral analysis of the EEG signal and investigated the relationship between EEG oscillations and MUA in single trials. First, we observed significant modulation in the oscillatory power of the EEG and LFP, as well as in the neuronal firing rate while the monkeys were fixating and viewing movies. Our results show that the EEG power in the low and high gamma frequency range (30–100 Hz) is strongly correlated to MUA (Figures 2 and S1). Similar results were found in the LFP signal, which is consistent with other findings linking gamma power and spiking activity in monkey V1 (Belitski et al., 2008Belitski A. Gretton A. Magri C. Murayama Y. Montemurro M.A. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Low-frequency local field potentials and spikes in primary visual cortex convey independent visual information.J.

Fisch L. Mukamel R. Gelbard-Sagiv H. Arieli A. Fried I. Malach R. Coupling between neuronal firing rate, gamma LFP, and BOLD fMRI is related to interneuronal correlations.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, alpha (8–15 Hz) and beta (15–30 Hz) power were not correlated to MUA. This finding agrees with, and extends previous work on, LFPs recorded from the anaesthetized macaque (Belitski et al., 2008Belitski A. Gretton A. Magri C. Murayama Y. Montemurro M.A. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Low-frequency local field potentials and spikes in primary visual cortex convey independent visual information.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5696-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and is compatible with the hypothesis that this frequency range is primarily driven by a neuromodulatory pathway not influenced by either the stimulus or the cortical spiking activity (Belitski et al., 2008Belitski A. Gretton A. Magri C. Murayama Y. Montemurro M.A. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Low-frequency local field potentials and spikes in primary visual cortex convey independent visual information.J.

Having shown the relationship between EEG oscillatory power and MUA, we also investigated how the MUA response was modulated at different phases of the EEG. We found that both the firing rate and probability of enhanced firing were greatest during the negative-trough (∼π phase) of the delta (2–4 Hz) oscillation, which is consistent with"

Polycystins are proposed to form a flow-sensitive ion channel complex in the primary cilium of both epithelial and endothelial cells. However, how polycystins contribute to cellular mechanosensitivity remains obscure. Here, we show that TRPP2 inhibits stretch-activated ion channels (SACs). This specific effect is reversed by coexpression with TRPP1, indicating that the TRPP1/TRPP2 ratio regulates pressure sensing. Moreover, deletion of TRPP1 in smooth muscle cells reduces SAC activity and the arterial myogenic tone. Inversely, depletion of TRPP2 in TRPP1-deficient arteries rescues both SAC opening and the myogenic response. Finally, we show that TRPP2 interacts with filamin A and demonstrate that this actin crosslinking protein is critical for SAC regulation. This work uncovers a role for polycystins in regulating pressure sensing.

Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a multisystem disorder characterized by renal and extrarenal cysts, as well as cardiovascular abnormalities (Arnaout, 2001Arnaout M.A. Molecular genetics and pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.Annu.

Mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 gene, encoding polycystin-1 (TRPP1) or -2 (TRPP2), respectively (for recent nomenclature see Nilius et al., 2007Nilius B. Owsianik G. Voets T. Peters J.A.

Med. 2009; 60: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). TRPP1 is a large integral membrane glycoprotein with 11 transmembrane domains and an extensive amino-terminal extracellular domain involved in cell-cell, cell-matrix interaction and signaling pathways (for review see Wilson, 2004Wilson P.D. Polycystic kidney disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). TRPP1 interacts with TRPP2, a six transmembrane domain protein of the TRP ion channel family (for review see Giamarchi et al., 2006Giamarchi A. Padilla F. Coste B. Raoux M. Crest M. Honoré E. Delmas P. The versatile nature of the calcium-permeable cation channel TRPP2.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Polycystins also interact with multiple partners, including the TRP channel subunits TRPC1 and TRPV4 (Kottgen et al., 2008Kottgen M. Buchholz B. Garcia-Gonzalez M.A. Kotsis F. Fu X. Doerken M.

Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). By associating through the coiled-coil motifs in their cytosolic carboxy-terminal domains, TRPP1 and TRPP2 have been proposed to form a “receptor-ion channel complex” (Hanaoka et al., 2000Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Co-assembly of polycystin-1 and −2 produces unique cation-permeable currents.Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). TRPP1 and TRPP2 colocalize at the membrane of the primary cilia of renal epithelial cells and endothelial cells where they are proposed to transduce luminal shear stress (i.e., fluid flow parallel to the cell surface) into a calcium signal (Nauli et al., 2003Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. et al.Polycystins 1 and 2 mediate mechanosensation in the primary cilium of kidney cells.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, Nauli et al., 2008Nauli S.M. Kawanabe Y. Kaminski J.J. Pearce W.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Endothelial cilia are fluid shear sensors that regulate calcium signaling and nitric oxide production through polycystin-1.Circulation. 2008; 117: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). With its large extracellular amino-terminal domain, TRPP1 has been suggested to be a mechanical sensor regulating the opening of the associated calcium-permeable channel TRPP2 (Nauli et al., 2003Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. et al.Polycystins 1 and 2 mediate mechanosensation in the primary cilium of kidney cells.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Loss of this mechanosensory function (i.e., flow sensing) is thought to result in altered cellular signaling subsequently leading to cyst formation (Nauli and Zhou, 2004Nauli S.M. Zhou J. Polycystins and mechanosensation in renal and nodal cilia.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In endothelial primary cilia, as reported in kidney epithelial cells (Nauli et al., 2003Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. et al.Polycystins 1 and 2 mediate mechanosensation in the primary cilium of kidney cells.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), TRPP1 and TRPP2 are also involved in fluid shear sensing and regulate calcium signaling and nitric oxide release, thus contributing to vasodilation in response to an increase in blood flow (Aboualaiwi et al., 2009Aboualaiwi W.A. Takahashi M. Mell B.R. Jones T.J. Ratnam S. Kolb R.J. Nauli S.M. Ciliary polycystin-2 is a mechanosensitive calcium channel involved in nitric oxide signaling cascades.Circ.

However, polycystins are also abundantly expressed in arterial myocytes (Boulter et al., 2001Boulter C. Mulroy S. Webb S. Fleming S. Brindle K. Sandford R. Cardiovascular, skeletal, and renal defects in mice with a targeted disruption of the Pkd1 gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Analysis of the polycystins in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2280-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which respond to intraluminal pressure that causes wall stretch, instead of flow. An increase in intraluminal pressure causes a gradual depolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that is linked to the opening of nonselective stretch-activated cation channels (SACs), followed by the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and myocyte constriction (the myogenic or Bayliss response) (Brayden et al., 2008Brayden J.E. Earley S. Nelson M.T. Reading S. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, vascular tone and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2008; 35: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Hill et al., 2006Hill M.A. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Potocnik S.J. Murphy T.V.

TRPCs, GPCRs and the Bayliss effect.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 4-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of polycystins in pressure sensing has not yet been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that the TRPP1/TRPP2 ratio regulates SAC activity via the filamin A (FLNa)/F-actin cytoskeletal network and modulates the arterial myogenic response to intraluminal pressure. To determine the effect of TRPP1 and TRPP2 on SAC activity, we expressed the proteins either individually or together in COS cells, an expression system previously used to study mechanosensitive ion channels (Gottlieb et al., 2007Gottlieb P. Folgering J. Maroto R. Raso A. Wood T.G. Kurosky A. Bowman C. Bichet D. Patel A. Sachs F. et al.Revisiting TRPC1 and TRPC6 mechanosensitivity.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Honoré et al., 2006Honoré E. Patel A.J. Chemin J. Suchyna T. Sachs F. Desensitization of mechano-gated K2P channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In cell-attached recordings of mock-transfected cells, brief negative pressure pulses applied through the recording electrode evoked a gradual and reversible opening of endogenous cation nonselective SACs (Figure 1A), with a single-channel conductance of 29.2 ± 0.3 pS and a reversal potential (Erev) of 0.1 ± 0.3 mV (n = 13; Figure 1B). Surprisingly, while overexpression of TRPP1 alone had no significant effect (Figure 1C), overexpression of TRPP2 produced a dramatic and dose-dependent inhibition of SAC activity (Figures 1C and 1D, inset, and Figure 1E). Neither single-channel conductance, ionic selectivity (see Figure S1 available online), or open probability in patches with a single channel were changed by TRPP2 overexpression. The percentage of active patches was reduced from 94% ± 1% (n = 264) in mock-transfected cells to 70% ± 5% in cells expressing TRPP2 (p < 0.001, n = 90; data not shown). Interestingly, SAC inhibition was also observed with a disease-causing TRPP2 mutant in which a nonsense mutation generates a truncated form of TRPP2 (hTRPP2-742X or the mouse equivalent mTRPP2-740X) lacking the ER retention signal (Figures 1E, S2A, and S6) (Mochizuki et al., 1996Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. et al.PKD2, a gene for polycystic kidney disease that encodes an integral membrane protein.Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of TRPP2 on SACs was also present in cell lines originating from different tissues including renal epithelium (LLC-PK1), dorsal root ganglion neurons (F11), and vascular smooth muscle (MOVAS, A7R5, and mouse aortic explants), thus probably representing a fundamental cellular property (Figure S2A). The effect of TRPP2 expression was selective for SACs, as the activity of other channel types, including ASIC and Kv, were not modified by TRPP2 overexpression (Figures S2B and S2C). Moreover, other TRP channels shown to directly interact with TRPP2 and/or claimed to be implicated in mechanotransduction (Christensen and Corey, 2007Christensen A.P. Corey D.P.

Interestingly, coexpression of TRPP1 with TRPP2 reversed the inhibitory effect of TRPP2 on SACs (Figures 1C and 1E). To examine whether the reversal by TRPP1 requires an interaction with TRPP2, we expressed TRPP1 with TRPP2-742X, which lacks the coiled-coil TRPP1 binding domain. TRPP1 could not rescue SAC activity in TRPP2-742X-transfected COS cells (Figure 1E), demonstrating that the reversal of SAC inhibition is dependent on an interaction between TRPP1 and TRPP2. Moreover, this reversal was specific to TRPP1, as coexpression with either TRPC1 or TRPV4, also known to interact with TRPP2 (Kottgen et al., 2008Kottgen M. Buchholz B. Garcia-Gonzalez M.A. Kotsis F. Fu X. Doerken M. Boehlke C. Steffl D. Tauber R. Wegierski T. et al.TRPP2 and TRPV4 form a polymodal sensory channel complex.J.

USA. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), failed to reverse SAC inhibition by TRPP2 (Figure S2D). These observations indicate that the dosage of TRPP2 relative to TRPP1 modulates the activity of SACs in expression systems. Here, we detected no significant exogenous channel current expression at the plasma membrane after transient transfection of TRPP1 and/or TRPP2 (wild-type [WT] or 742X) in both MOVAS (data not shown) and COS cells using either single channel or whole cell patch clamp recording configurations (Figure S7). If the TRPP1/TRPP2 dosage modulates SAC activity in a native system known to express both polycystins, we would expect that lowering the expression of TRPP1 may cause a TRPP2-mediated inhibition of SAC activity. We inactivated the Pkd1 gene selectively in mouse smooth muscle cells using the Cre/lox strategy (with no alteration in the level of expression of Pkd2 or other relevant TRP subunits; see Experimental Procedures) (Holtwick et al., 2002Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Smooth muscle-selective deletion of guanylyl cyclase-A prevents the acute but not chronic effects of ANP on blood pressure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and examined SAC activity in VSMCs acutely dissociated from resistance mesenteric arteries of Pkd1+/+, Pkd1SMdel/+, or Pkd1SMdel/del mice. Measurements of arterial pressure revealed no significant difference between the Pkd1 genotypes (Figure S8). In cell-attached patches, brief negative pressure pulses applied through the recording electrode evoked a gradual and reversible opening of SACs (Figure 2A) with biophysical properties similar to those found in COS cells (single-channel conductance: 28.5 ± 0.4 pS; n = 11). The variability in kinetics (Figures 1C and 2B) can be explained by different viscoelastic properties between VSMCs and COS cells (Sachs and Morris, 1998Sachs F. Morris C.E. Mechanosensitive ion channels in nonspecialized cells.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 132: 1-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ionic substitutions (Erev: −3.5 ± 2.1 mV, n = 11, with NaCl; −5.2 ± 3.2 mV, n = 12, with sodium gluconate; −30.5 ± 3.8 mV, n = 4, with choline chloride; Figure 2D and data not shown), as well as pharmacological experiments, indicated that these channels were cationic, nonselective, and inhibited by classical blockers of SACs (−78.0 ± 14.0%, n = 13, with 30 μM Gd3+ and −89.0 ± 9.0%, n = 7, with 5 μM GsTMx4). Moreover, pressure-induced inward SAC currents at negative membrane potentials could be recorded when Ca2+ (or Ba2+) was the only possible charge carrier, thus indicating Ca2+ permeability of the channel (Figure S9). Remarkably, the activity of SACs was significantly lower in VSMCs from Pkd1SMdel/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del compared to Pkd1+/+ mice (Figures 2B and 2C). The GsTMx4-sensitive SACs component was significantly smaller in arterial myocytes from Pkd1SMdel/del mice, as compared to those isolated from Pkd1+/+ mice (Figure S10). Neither the single-channel conductance (Figure 2D) nor the open channel probability (Po) changed in patches with a single channel, indicating that the number of active SACs is decreased in VSMCs from Pkd1SMdel/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del mice. Indeed, the percentage of active patches (i.e., with SAC opening) was significantly lower in VSMCs of Pkd1SMdel/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del mice (Figure 2E). The density of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium current, which plays a key role in arterial excitation-contraction coupling, was not different between mesenteric VSMCs isolated from Pkd1+/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del mice (5.61 ± 0.81 pA/pF in Pkd1+/+ compared to 6.05 ± 1.17 pA/pF in Pkd1SMdel/del; at +10 mV; Figure 2F). These data show that in VSMCs reducing TRPP1 expression causes a specific decrease in SAC activity. Stretch-activated channels are known to be involved in the myogenic tone, a key function of resistance arteries in response to an increase in intraluminal pressure (Brayden et al., 2008Brayden J.E.

Indeed, specific pharmacological inhibition of SACs with the spider toxin GsMTx4 (Suchyna et al., 2000Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) significantly reduced the myogenic tone of resistance mesenteric arteries (Figure S11). Because the activity of SACs was significantly reduced in the absence of TRPP1, we examined whether the myogenic contractility of resistance arteries may also be affected. Mesenteric arteries isolated from Pkd1+/+ mice produced a robust myogenic contraction when intraluminal pressure was increased (Figures 3A and 3B). However, arteries isolated from Pkd1SMdel/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del mice showed a profound decrease in myogenic tone (Figures 3A and 3B). Furthermore, the threshold pressure for myogenic contraction was significantly shifted to higher pressure in arteries with decreased Pkd1 expression (Figure 3B). This indicates that these arteries have to be distended further before triggering mechanosensory feedback (Figures 3A and 3B). Additionally, we observed no change in vascular reactivity to KCl or phenylephrine in mesenteric arteries from 12- to 16-week-old Pkd1SMdel/del mice (Figure 3C), which confirms findings from a related study using 20-week-old Pkd1 (global) heterozygote mice (Morel et al., 2009Morel N. Vandenberg G. Ahrabi A.K. Caron N. Desjardins F. Balligand J.L. Horie S. Devuyst O. PKD1 haploinsufficiency is associated with altered vascular reactivity and abnormal calcium signaling in the mouse aorta.Pflugers Arch. 2009; 457: 845-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results support the assumption that L-type calcium channel activity was unchanged and that intracellular calcium stores, as well as the contractile apparatus, were not significantly altered by Pkd1 deletion. Finally, the wall/lumen ratio did not vary between genotypes (Figure S3A). Moreover, the stress-strain curves of mesenteric arteries were identical (Figure S3B), indicating that the contribution of elastin and collagen to arterial wall elasticity was unaltered by Pkd1 inactivation. Thus, the expression of TRPP1 in VSMCs appears essential for pressure-dependent mesenteric artery SAC activity and myogenic tone, but does not affect other arterial properties. We hypothesized that when TRPP2 is released from its interaction with TRPP1, either by lowering TRPP1 expression (Pkd1SMdel/+ or Pkd1SMdel/del) or by overexpressing TRPP2, it impairs SAC activity and lowers myogenic tone. Therefore, reducing the expression of TRPP2 in arteries lacking Pkd1 should restore SAC opening and consequently the myogenic tone. Indeed, knocking down Pkd2 by about 80% with an siRNA (Figure S4) increased SAC activity in Pkd1SMdel/del VSMCs and the percentage of active patches (Figures 4A–4C). Additionally, Pkd2 knockdown restored myogenic tone in Pkd1SMdel/del mesenteric arteries (Figures 4D and 4E). These results suggest that free TRPP2 (unbound to TRPP1) is responsible, at least in large part, for the decrease in SAC function and myogenic tone in Pkd1SMdel/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del arteries. The cortical F-actin cytoskeleton exerts a tonic inhibitory control over SAC activity, presumably by reducing the amount of stretch-induced increase in bilayer tension sensed by the channel protein (Lauritzen et al., 2005Lauritzen I. Chemin J. Honoré E. Jodar M. Guy N. Lazdunski M. Jane Patel A.

Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), we examined whether SAC inhibition by the F-actin cytoskeleton may be enhanced in the presence of TRPP2. Using the actin monomer-sequestering agent latrunculin A, we demonstrate that disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton increased SAC activity in COS cells (Figures 5A and 5B), thus confirming the tonic inhibitory influence of the actin cytoskeleton. A similar effect on SAC activity was observed when we used the barbed-end capping agent cytochalasin D at concentrations known to induce F-actin depolymerization through capping-induced growth arrest and actin dimer formation (Figure 5B). Remarkably, these treatments fully reversed SAC inhibition by TRPP2 in COS cells and restored channel activity (Figures 5A and 5B). Latrunculin A similarly increased SAC activity in VSMCs from Pkd1SM+/+ and Pkd1SMdel/del arteries and suppressed the difference between both genotypes (Figure 5C). However, microtubule-disrupting agents, including colchicine or nocodazole, did not modify SAC inhibition by TRPP2 (Figure 5B). Conversely, actin stabilization by jasplakinolide inhibited SAC activity and mimicked the effect of TRPP2 in COS cells (Figure 5B). These data demonstrate that the F-actin cytoskeleton is involved in SAC inhibition by TRPP2. In a search for proteins that bind to TRPP2, we performed a proteomic screen in the mouse VSMC line MOVAS. Besides known TRPP2 partners, including TRPP1 and the InsP3 receptor, we identified the actin crosslinking protein FLNa (Glogauer et al., 1998Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P.

Immunoprecipitation in cotransfected cells confirmed this interaction (Figures 6A and S12). To determine whether the effect of TRPP2 on SAC activity is dependent on FLNa, we expressed TRPP2 in a human melanoma cell line (M2 or FLNa KO) that does not express FLNa and in M2 cells stably transfected with FLNa (A7 or FLNa WT) (Cunningham et al., 1992Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Actin-binding protein requirement for cortical stability and efficient locomotion.Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Figure S5). The single-channel conductance of SACs was similar in both cell lines (29.1 ± 0.8 pS for FLNa KO cells, n = 37, compared to 29.2 ± 0.8 pS for FLNa WT cells, n = 27; p = 0.888), but the net channel activity was significantly higher in FLNa KO cells (Figures 6B–6D). Importantly, while the inhibition of SAC activity by TRPP2 was prominent in FLNa WT cells, it was absent in FLNa KO cells (Figure 6D). This indicates that FLNa is critically required for the inhibitory effect of TRPP2 on SACs.

All hexameric helicases fall into two families with opposing translocation polarities: the 3'-->5' AAA+ and 5'-->3' RecA-like enzymes. To understand how a RecA-like hexameric helicase engages and translocates along substrate, we determined the structure of the E. coli Rho transcription termination factor bound to RNA and nucleotide. Interior nucleic acid-binding elements spiral around six bases of RNA in a manner unexpectedly reminiscent of an AAA+ helicase, the papillomavirus E1 protein. Four distinct ATP-binding states, representing potential catalytic intermediates, are coupled to RNA positioning through a complex allosteric network. Comparative studies with E1 suggest that RecA and AAA+ hexameric helicases use different portions of their chemomechanical cycle for translocating nucleic acid and track in opposite directions by reversing the firing order of ATPase sites around the hexameric ring.

Although the catalytic function of the exosome core has been lost during evolution, the substrate recruitment and binding properties have been conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The progressive removal of ribonucleotides from the 3′ end of RNAs plays a key role in RNA metabolism (reviewed in Ibrahim et al., 2008Ibrahim H. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J.

Structural RNAs are synthesized as longer precursors with 3′ end extensions that are removed to generate the mature, functional RNA species. 3′ to 5′ RNA degradation is also key in the clearance of messenger RNAs in constitutive pathways (such as messenger RNA [mRNA] turnover or the degradation of intron lariats) and in regulated quality-control pathways (such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or nonstop decay). The main cellular 3′→5′ nuclease activity for the partial shortening or complete breakdown of a wide variety of RNA transcripts is imparted by a macromolecular complex known as the RNA exosome (reviewed in Lebreton and Seraphin, 2008Lebreton A.

The exosome is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells from protozoa and yeast to mammals. The structural core of the eukaryotic exosome is composed of nine subunits, which we refer to as Exo-9 (Hernandez et al., 2006Hernandez H. Dziembowski A. Taverner T. Seraphin B. Robinson C.V.

Six of the subunits share overall structural similarity with the bacterial phosphorolytic nuclease RNase PH and assemble into a hexameric ring. The other three subunits are positioned on one side of the ring and are characterized by S1/KH domains, folds often found in RNA-binding proteins. The overall molecular architecture of the eukaryotic Exo-9 core is conserved in RNA-degrading complexes of simpler subunit compositions present in bacteria and archaea (reviewed in Lorentzen et al., 2008aLorentzen E.

Prokaryotic Exo-9-like complexes cleave 3′ ribonucleotides processively via a phosphorolytic mechanism that is catalyzed by three of the RNase PH-like subunits (Büttner et al., 2005Büttner K.

In the case of Exo-9 complexes in yeast and humans, the six proteins containing RNase PH folds have lost the phosphorolytic active site and are catalytically inert (Liu et al., 2006Liu Q.

Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the yeast exosome is provided by Rrp44 and Rrp6, two hydrolytic nucleases that associate with Exo-9 (hereby referred to as the 10th and 11th subunits) and that have no functional counterpart in prokaryotic exosome-like complexes. Rrp6 has distributive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activity that is not significantly altered upon binding to Exo-9 (Liu et al., 2006Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Reconstitution, activities, and structure of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Rrp44 (also known as Dis3) is an essential exosome subunit. It contains an endonuclease activity in the N-terminal PilT N terminus (PIN) domain and a processive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activity in the C-terminal region that is similar to bacterial RNase II (Lebreton et al., 2008Lebreton A.

In isolation, Rrp44 can also unwind and degrade substrates with secondary structures, but upon binding to Exo-9 this activity is significantly reduced (Liu et al., 2006Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D.

Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). How the exosome core modulates the activity of Rrp44 is unclear. All Exo-9 subunits are essential for the viability of yeast cells and are conserved in higher eukaryotes. What is their functional role, given that they lack catalytic activity? One possibility is that Exo-9 only plays an architectural role by providing a docking platform for the Rrp6 and Rrp44 nucleases and other factors required for RNA degradation. Another possibility is that Exo-9 might have an active role in binding or selecting RNA substrates. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the exosome, we set out to study how RNAs reach the Rrp44 nuclease active sites in the yeast exosome and identify the function of structural features that have been conserved from the prokaryotic to the eukaryotic complexes. To assess the RNA-binding properties of exosome components, we used an RNase protection assay similar to that previously used to study proteins in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (Ballut et al., 2005Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. The exon junction core complex is locked onto RNA by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A body-labeled 60-mer RNA was incubated with purified proteins and treated with RNase A and RNase T1. The size of the RNA fragments (that upon protein binding become protected from RNase digestion) was analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 1A). As a control, the RNA helicase UPF1 protected between 9 and 11 nucleotides (nt) of RNA (Figure 1A, lane 1), consistent with previous reports (Chamieh et al., 2008Chamieh H. Ballut L. Bonneau F. Le Hir H. NMD factors UPF2 and UPF3 bridge UPF1 to the exon junction complex and stimulate its RNA helicase activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fragments of 9 to 10 nt accumulated upon incubation with the RNase II-like region of yeast Rrp44 (Rrp44ΔPIN, residues 242–1001) containing the inactivating D551N mutation at the exoribonuclease site (Figure 1A, lane 2). This protection pattern is in agreement with the crystal structure of RNA-bound Rrp44ΔPIN D551N, which showed a binding site for 9 nt of single-stranded RNA (Lorentzen et al., 2008bLorentzen E. Basquin J. Tomecki R. Dziembowski A. Conti E. Structure of the active subunit of the yeast exosome core, Rrp44: diverse modes of substrate recruitment in the RNase II nuclease family.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Full-length Rrp44 D551N (residues 1–1001) protected fragments between 9 and 12 nt (Figure 1A, lane 3), suggesting the presence of longer or different RNA-binding paths than the one observed in the absence of the N-terminal PIN domain. As expected (Lebreton et al., 2008Lebreton A. Tomecki R. Dziembowski A. Seraphin B. Endonucleolytic RNA cleavage by a eukaryotic exosome.Nature. 2008; 456: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Schneider et al., 2009Schneider C. Leung E. Brown J. Tollervey D.

The PIN domain alone (residue 1–242) did not result in the protection of detectable fragments (Figure 1A, lane 4). However, mutation of full-length Rrp44 D551N at one of the metal-binding residues in the PIN active site (D171N) resulted in the accumulation of shorter (eight to nine) oligoribonucleotides than those observed in the full-length protein with an intact PIN domain (Figure 1A, lane 5, compare with lane 3). We conclude that, under exonucleolytic conditions, the PIN domain can contribute to the RNA-binding path of Rrp44, either directly or via conformational changes. We next tested the effect of the exosome core Exo-9, which we reconstituted with protocols similar to those previously described (Greimann and Lima, 2008Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Reconstitution of RNA exosomes from human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cloning, expression, purification, and activity assays.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2006Liu Q.

While we did not detect RNase protection with Exo-9 alone (Figure 1A, lane 6), addition of the catalytically inactive Rrp44 full-length D551N to Exo-9 resulted in the prominent accumulation of 31–33 nt long RNA fragments (Figure 1A, lane 7). This protection pattern depended on the presence of both the PIN and the RNase II-like regions of Rrp44 (Figure 1A, lanes 7–9), which could also be added in trans (Figure 1A, lane 10). When lacking the PIN domain, Rrp44 gave a similar protection pattern whether in the presence or absence of Exo-9 (Figure 1A, compare lanes 8 and 2). It was recently shown that deletion of the PIN domain disrupts the interaction of Rrp44 with Exo-9 (Schneider et al., 2009Schneider C. Leung E. Brown J. Tollervey D. The N-terminal PIN domain of the exosome subunit Rrp44 harbors endonuclease activity and tethers Rrp44 to the yeast core exosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1127-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In CBP (calmodulin-binding protein) pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins, the RNase II-like region of Rrp44 did not precipitate Exo-9 (Figure 1B, lane 5), while the PIN domain alone precipitated Exo-9 with seemingly similar efficiency to full-length Rrp44 (Figure 1B, compare lanes 4 and 3). The PIN domain also bound the RNase II-like region in trans when in the presence of Exo-9 (Figure 1B, lane 7), consistent with the results of the RNase assay (Figure 1A, lane 10). The RNase protection experiment with the Exo-9 - Rrp44 complex (Exo-10) also showed the presence of shorter oligoribonucleotides similar to the Rrp44 protection pattern, although only the 11–12 nt fragments could be detected (Figure 1A, lane 7, compare with lane 3). Mutation of D171N in the PIN active site abolished the presence of the 11–12 nt fragments, while the long fragments were still detectable (Figure 1A, lane 11). One interpretation of these results is that the 31–33 nt and the 11–12 nt fragments reflect the presence of alternative routes to the exoribonuclease site. It is also possible that this bimodal protection pattern originates from a single path where an exposed region of RNA connecting the Rrp44 and Exo-9 binding sites would be accessible to RNases. The presence of the 31–33 nt path indicates that RNA is recognized by Exo-10 via a surface that spans about 20 nt more than the RNA-binding site in Rrp44, pointing to an active role of the catalytically inert Exo-9 core in substrate binding. In this scenario, an attractive hypothesis is that Exo-9 may have retained functional similarities with the archaeal exosome. One RNA-binding site in the archaeal exosome is at the phosphorolytic active site within the interface of the Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimers, at the bottom of the RNase PH-like ring (“ring exit site” in Figure 2A) (Büttner et al., 2005Büttner K.

Insights into the mechanism of progressive RNA degradation by the archaeal exosome.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14120-14131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another RNA-binding site is present at the top of the RNase PH-like ring, at a narrow constriction formed by a loop of Rrp41, where one nucleotide binds (“ring entry site” in Figure 2B) (Lorentzen et al., 2007Lorentzen E. Dziembowski A. Lindner D. Seraphin B. Conti E. RNA channelling by the archaeal exosome.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similar structural features are present in the human exosome (Figure S1 available online). The human Rrp41-Rrp45 dimer has conserved positively charged residues at the corresponding structural position to that of the archaeal ring exit site (Figures 2C and S1) (Lorentzen and Conti, 2005Lorentzen E.

Human Rrp41 also has a loop at the ring entry site that maps to the loop responsible for RNA binding in the archaeal exosome (Figures 2D and S1). The yeast exosome is predicted to have a similar structure from sequence conservation, data from native mass spectrometry and negative-stain electron microscopy (Lorentzen and Conti, 2005Lorentzen E.

Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 16844-16849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We can thus extrapolate that yeast Rrp41 Arg95 and Arg96 form the equivalent of the “ring exit site” and yeast Rrp45 Arg106 and Lys110 lie more internally, nearer to the position where archaeal Rrp41 binds the phosphate ( Figures 2C and 3A). Yeast Rrp41 Lys62 and Ser63 are predicted to be at similar positions in the loop that shapes the “ring entry site” (Figures 2D and 3A). The S1/KH proteins form the periphery of the channel, and, in the case of yeast Rrp40, NMR studies (Oddone et al., 2007Oddone A. Lorentzen E. Basquin J. Gasch A. Rybin V. Conti E. Sattler M. Structural and biochemical characterization of the yeast exosome component Rrp40.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown weak RNA-induced changes in the chemical shifts of Lys107 and Lys108 (corresponding to Lys150 and Arg151 in human Rrp40, Figure S1). Guided by this structural comparison, we substituted the residues identified as putative RNA-binding sites (Figure 3A) to negatively charged amino acids. We reconstituted the Exo-9 mutant complexes and verified that they could all form the corresponding Exo-10 complexes by using pull-down assays with CBP-tagged Rrp44 (Figure 3B). An Exo-10-D551N complex containing either the Rrp41 R95E-R96E mutation or the Rrp41 K62E-S63D mutation abolished the 31–33 nt protection pattern (Figure 3C, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that both the “ring exit site” and the “ring entry site” contact RNA in the wild-type complex. The 31–33 nt fragments accumulated to a significant extent with the more internal mutant, Rrp45 R106E-K110E (Figure 3C, lane 6). The Rrp40 K107E-K108E mutation caused no significant difference in RNase protection as compared to the wild-type (Figure 3C, lane 3). These residues are located at the periphery of the S1/KH ring (Figure S1), in an open area where a substrate would not be buried within the protein complex and would thus be accessible to RNases. Therefore, we cannot rule out a potential weak contribution of these residues to RNA binding in the complex. When Exo-9 was incubated with the 60-mer body-labeled RNA used in the protection assay and subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254 nm, all bands corresponding to exosome subunits were apparently crosslinked, including those corresponding to S1/KH subunits (Figure 3D, compare lane 5 and lane 1). The crosslinking was reduced with the entry or exit site mutants (Figure 3D, lanes 6 and 7) and abolished when both sites were mutated (Figure 3D, lane 8), The RNA crosslinking behavior of these mutants correlates with their decreasing ability to degrade RNA in the context of Exo-10 (Figure S2). The downregulation of RNA degradation with the entry/exit site mutants suggests that the channel is the major path to the exoribonuclease site in Exo-10 with the substrate tested. The prediction from these results is that single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) shorter than 33 nt would bind with the 3′ end at the Rrp44 exonucleolytic site (D551) and with the 5′ end buried along the Exo-9 path (Figure 3A). Indeed, a 20-mer RNA was protected from RNA degradation (Figure 3C, lane 9). This RNA was not protected when incubated with the exit site mutant (Rrp41 R95E-R96E, Figure 3C, lane 11), but remained intact with the entry site mutant (Rrp41 K62E-S63D mutant; Figure 3C, lane 12, compare with lane 5), suggesting that this substrate does not reach the ring entry site. The protection patterns of RNA substrates of different lengths ranging from 16 to 34 nt suggest that the ring exit and entry sites are the main RNA-binding sites in the channel and are reached with 20–22 nt and 30–32 nt, respectively (Figures S3 and 3A). We conclude that the yeast exosome binds RNA in the central channel of the RNase PH-like ring, contacting sites conserved from prokaryotic to eukaryotic exosome-like complexes. For visualization of the position of the Rrp44 active sites with respect to Exo-9, structural information is ultimately required. Although a 20 Å negative-stain EM study of yeast Exo-10 is available (Wang et al., 2007Wang H.W. Wang J. Ding F. Callahan K. Bratkowski M.A. Butler J.S. Nogales E. Ke A.

USA. 2007; 104: 16844-16849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we were unable to unambiguously fit the atomic structure of the Rrp44 RNase II-like region (Lorentzen et al., 2008bLorentzen E.

We proceeded by identifying the Rrp44-binding proteins of the yeast exosome core. The Rrp41-Rrp45 subcomplex was the only exosome core component that could be precipitated by CBP-tagged Rrp44 in pull-down assays (Figure S4). A ternary complex between yeast Rrp41-Rrp45 and Rrp44 (residues 25–1001, see the Experimental Procedures) was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Figure S4) and yielded diffracting crystals. The crystal structure of the Rrp41-Rrp45-Rrp44 complex was determined by molecular replacement. The final model (Figure 4A) has been refined at 3.0 Å resolution to an Rfree 27.3% and Rfactor of 20.7% (data collection and refinement statistics in Table 1). It contains residues 3–239 of Rrp41, residues 7–303 of Rrp45, residues 36–231 of the Rrp44 PIN domain, and residues 253–1001 of the Rrp44 RNase II-like region, with the exception of a few disordered loops.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsData CollectionData setRrp41-Rrp45-Rrp44Space groupP212121Unit cell (Å)a = 110.9, b = 125.7, c = 139.4Wavelength (Å)0.978Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.20.0–3.0Unique reflections39,670Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.100 (100)I/σ(I)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.21.6 (5.7)Rsym(%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.11.3 (52.2)RefinementResolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.20.0–3.0Rfree (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.27.3Rwork (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.20.7rmsd bond (Å)0.014rmsd angle (°)1.508Number of protein atoms10,796Ramachandran ValuesbValues are according to the program Molprobity.Most favored (%)94.9Additionally allowed (%)4.81Generously allowed (%)0.0Disallowed (%)0.29a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell.b Values are according to the program Molprobity.

https://openalex.org/W2001679254,"Modification of NMDA receptor function and trafficking contributes to the regulation of synaptic transmission and is important for several forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we report that NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B have two distinct clusters of palmitoylation sites in their C-terminal region. Palmitoylation within the first cluster on a membrane-proximal region increases tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine-based internalization motifs by Src family protein tyrosine kinases, leading to enhanced stable surface expression of NMDA receptors. In addition, palmitoylation of these sites regulates constitutive internalization of the NMDA receptor in developing neurons. In marked contrast, palmitoylation of the second cluster in the middle of C terminus by distinct palmitoyl transferases causes receptors to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus and reduces receptor surface expression. These data suggest that regulated palmitoylation of NR2 subunits differentially modulates receptor trafficking and might be important for NMDA-receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity."

Our work reveals surprising and important mechanistic differences between light- and temperature-synchronization and advances our understanding of how clock resetting is accomplished in nature. Circadian clocks regulate many biological processes so that they occur at beneficial times for the organism. Although these clocks are self-sustained and continue to run under constant conditions, they are synchronized with the environment by so called “Zeitgebers” (Dunlap et al., 2004Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. DeCoursey P.J. Chronobiolgy: Biological Timekeeping. Sinauer Associates, Inc, Sunderland, Massachusetts2004Google Scholar). Two prominent Zeitgebers are the natural light-dark and temperature cycles that are able to synchronize the circadian clock of Drosophila and other organisms (see Boothroyd and Young, 2008Boothroyd C.E.

Synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock by temperature cycles.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2007; 72: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Although our knowledge regarding light entrainment of both fly and mammalian clocks is quite advanced, relatively little is known about temperature synchronization. Light is generally considered to be the more powerful Zeitgeber, but a temperature cycle with only 2°C–3°C amplitude robustly synchronizes Drosophila behavioral rhythms (Wheeler et al., 1993Wheeler D.A. Hamblen-Coyle M.J. Dushay M.S. Hall J.C. Behavior in light-dark cycles of Drosophila mutants that are arrhythmic, blind, or both.J. Biol. Rhythms. 1993; 8: 67-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In mammals, chick, and zebrafish, similar low-amplitude temperature rhythms (equivalent to body-temperature rhythms) are able to synchronize clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clock cells (Barrett and Takahashi, 1995Barrett R.K.

Circadian rhythm generation and entrainment in astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), exemplifying the potential strength of this Zeitgeber. Moreover, as shown for Drosophila (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), temperature synchronization of clock gene expression in these organisms occurs in tissue- or cell-autonomous manners, indicating that similar mechanisms are involved in ectothermic and endothermic animals. Drosophila's daily locomotor rhythmicity profile is bimodal, exhibiting major activity peaks in the morning and evening (e.g., Wheeler et al., 1993Wheeler D.A. Hamblen-Coyle M.J. Dushay M.S. Hall J.C. Behavior in light-dark cycles of Drosophila mutants that are arrhythmic, blind, or both.J. Biol. Rhythms. 1993; 8: 67-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This bimodality is regulated by several groups of clock neurons in the fly brain (see Sheeba et al., 2008Sheeba V. Kaneko M. Sharma V.K. Holmes T.C. The Drosophila circadian pacemaker circuit: Pas De Deux or Tarantella?.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 37-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar for a recent review). Recent work has revealed that a group of ventrally located neurons controls mainly the morning activity peak of fly behavior (M-cells), whereas more dorsally located cells regulate evening activity (E-cells) (Sheeba et al., 2008Sheeba V. Kaneko M. Sharma V.K. Holmes T.C. The Drosophila circadian pacemaker circuit: Pas De Deux or Tarantella?.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 37-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These neurons control locomotor rhythms, and cyclically express several clock genes and proteins in synchrony with light-dark or temperature cycles (e.g., Yoshii et al., 2005Yoshii T. Heshiki Y. Ibuki-Ishibashi T. Matsumoto A. Tanimura T. Tomioka K. Temperature cycles drive Drosophila circadian oscillation in constant light that otherwise induces behavioural arrhythmicity.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Zerr et al., 1990Zerr D.M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Siwicki K.K. Circadian fluctuations of Period protein immunoreactivity in the CNS and the visual system of Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2749-2762PubMed Google Scholar). While clock neurons are mainly cell autonomously synchronized by light via Cry, it is not known how temperature signals reach the brain clock. It is formally possible that temperature sensitive neurons express a circadian temperature receptor that is able to synchronize the molecular clock within the pacemaker neurons (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Alternatively, temperature could be sensed by other neurons in the brain or by sensory structures in other parts of the fly, which then signal to the clock neurons. Two mutations that interfere with temperature entrainment, both molecularly and behaviorally, have been identified and could therefore shed light on the temperature entrainment mechanism (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mutants in the norpA gene, which encodes for the enzyme phospholipase C, are not able to synchronize to temperature cycles (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), indicating that a G protein-coupled signal transduction cascade might be involved. The mutated gene of the other temperature-entrainment-deficient variant (nocte) was not known until now. Here we demonstrate that isolated Drosophila brains are not able to synchronize to temperature cycles. Since they do synchronize to light-dark cycles, these findings indicate that the brain requires temperature input from the periphery. We further reveal the molecular identity of the nocte gene, which encodes a large glutamine-rich protein with unknown function. Downregulation of nocte in peripheral tissues, including neurons of specific sensory structures (chordotonal [ch] organs), thoroughly disrupts temperature entrainment of behavioral rhythms. Similarly, other mutants known to affect the structure and function of ch organs also interfere with temperature entrainment, and mutant nocte alleles exhibit structural as well as physiological defects of sensory organ function. Moreover we show that a functional clock within these sensory structures is not required for behavioral temperature entrainment to occur, indicating that temperature information must be interpreted in a temporal fashion by downstream clock neurons in the thoracic central nervous system (CNS), or by the brain pacemaker neurons themselves. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a periphery-to-brain signaling pathway, identify the responsible sensory structures, and uncover fundamental differences between the light- and temperature-entrainment pathways of the fly circadian clock. The Drosophila circadian clock can easily be entrained by temperature cycles (or steps), both in constant darkness (DD) and constant light (LL) (Busza et al., 2007Busza A. Murad A. Emery P.

We previously showed that molecular synchronization can occur on a tissue-autonomous level. Isolated body parts of flies expressing two different period-luciferase (per-luc) constructs showed entrained bioluminescence oscillations when kept in LL and temperature cycles (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When we performed these experiments, we noticed that isolated brains showed a 12 hr phase-advanced bioluminescence peak compared to all other isolated tissues (Figure 1A and Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This phase advance was not observed in LD cycles at constant temperature (Figure 1A), perhaps indicating a prominent role of the brain in synchronizing the phase of other tissues during temperature cycles. Alternatively, because the rise in luc-reported per expression occurs immediately after the temperature increase, it could reflect a mere response to the environmental transition, rather than bona fide synchronization of clock gene expression. To address this issue we next analyzed brain per-luc expression in various mutant backgrounds known to interfere with temperature entrainment. We applied the BG-luc and XLG-luc transgenes, encoding 2/3 or the entire Per protein fused to Luc, respectively; both expressed under control of a 4.2-kb DNA fragment from the per promoter (Stanewsky et al., 1997Stanewsky R.

Next, we analyzed per-luc oscillations in the clock mutant backgrounds of tim01 and ClkJrk (Allada et al., 1998Allada R. White N.E. So W.V. Hall J.C. Rosbash M.

Although temperature-induced oscillations were strongly suppressed in most clock mutant tissues analyzed, the brains again showed sharp increases of expression immediately after the change to the warm temperature (Figure 1B). Because the rise in Luc activity occurred in clock-less mutant genetic backgrounds, the increase in reported per expression reflects a response to the temperature increase, rather than meaningful entrainment (which is read out as a cyclical phenomenon requiring an underlying oscillator). To address if this temperature-induced rise in Per-Luc expression occurs in clock neurons within the brain or in ectopic locations, we imaged brain bioluminescence signals using a highly sensitive imaging system (Figure 2). Brains were kept in cell culture medium in LL and temperature cycles and imaged at a time corresponding to the peak of luc-reported per expression (ZT8, Figures 1A and 1B). In a control experiment, brains were kept in LD cycles and constant temperature and imaged at ZT0, a time of high bioluminescence levels in brains (and other tissues) kept in LD (Figure 1A). In the LD control brains, luminescence signals could be detected in regions corresponding to various groups of clock neurons, presumably large and small Lateral Neurons ventral (LNvs), the dorsal Lateral Neurons (LNds), and two groups of the Dorsal Neurons (DNs) (Figure 2A, upper panel). Expression was also found in the ocelli and in the retina (Figure 2A, upper panel), previously shown to express per (Hall, 2003Hall J.C. Genetics and molecular biology of rhythms in Drosophila and other insects.Adv. Genet. 2003; 48: 1-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, brain expression in temperature cycles was not confined to cells that usually express clock genes. In a clock-normal genetic background, bioluminescence signals were restricted to the dorsal brain (Figure 2A). Compared to the LD expression pattern, the dorsal expression domain appeared broader, indicating that in addition to the DN located in this region, other cells now express the XLG-luc construct. Moreover, signals were clearly absent from brain regions where the lateral clock neurons are usually located. This cannot be explained by the constant presence of light (LL) (cf. Zerr et al., 1990Zerr D.M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Siwicki K.K. Circadian fluctuations of Period protein immunoreactivity in the CNS and the visual system of Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2749-2762PubMed Google Scholar), because Per is expressed in these clock neurons under LL and temperature cycling conditions in the intact animal (Yoshii et al., 2005Yoshii T. Heshiki Y. Ibuki-Ishibashi T. Matsumoto A. Tanimura T. Tomioka K. Temperature cycles drive Drosophila circadian oscillation in constant light that otherwise induces behavioural arrhythmicity.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Strikingly, an almost identical expression pattern was observed in the tim01 genetic background, further indicating the non-clock-related nature of luc-reported per expression (Figure 2A). Similarly, in a ClkJrk mutant background, BG-luc expression occurred in a central brain region corresponding to the calyces of the mushroom bodies not known to contain any clock-gene-expressing cells (Figure 2A). Note that both XLG-luc and BG-luc transgenes are expressed in clock neurons during LD cycles (Stanewsky et al., 1997Stanewsky R. Jamison C.F. Plautz J.D. Kay S.A. Hall J.C. Multiple circadian-regulated elements contribute to cycling period gene expression in Drosophila.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5006-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Veleri et al., 2003Veleri S. Brandes C. Helfrich-Forster C. Hall J.C. Stanewsky R. A self-sustaining, light-entrainable circadian oscillator in the Drosophila brain.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1758-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar; Figure 2A), indicating that the dramatic difference of spatial signal distribution between the two transgenic types observed in isolated brains during temperature cycling conditions depends more on the transgenic insertion site than on regulatory per sequences contained within the transgene. Importantly, in neither case does the spatial expression pattern significantly overlap with that of clock-gene-expressing cells under LD conditions, pointing to a complete lack of spatial regulation of per under these conditions. The ectopic Per-Luc expression observed in cultured brains—along with the lack of such signals from clock neurons—raised the possibility that spatial clock gene expression is generally altered in LL and temperature cycles compared to LD cycles at constant temperature. To test this, we imaged tissues known to synchronize under these conditions as well as in LD cycles (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). Both legs and wings showed very similar spatial Per-Luc bioluminescence expression patterns under the two entrainment regimes, showing that peripheral clock tissues can be synchronized by light and temperature (Figure 2B). In agreement with an earlier study describing per-gal4-driven GFP expression (Plautz et al., 1997Plautz J.D. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Kay S.A. Independent photoreceptive circadian clocks throughout Drosophila.Science. 1997; 278: 1632-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we also observe Per-Luc expression in potential mechanosensory and chemosensory cells along the wing margin and veins. In addition to what has been reported, we detected strong Per-Luc signals originating from the base of the wing, from the joints of the various leg segments (Figure 2B), and from segments of the haltere (inset in Figure 2B). The 8.0-luc:9 line contains a promoterless per-luc fusion gene, which is expressed within a subpopulation of the DNs and occasionally in some LNd cells, but not in peripheral clock cells (Veleri et al., 2003Veleri S. Brandes C. Helfrich-Forster C. Hall J.C. Stanewsky R. A self-sustaining, light-entrainable circadian oscillator in the Drosophila brain.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1758-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When 8.0-luc:9 adults were tested in LL and temperature cycles, bioluminescence peaks (presumably reflecting Per expression in brain clock neurons only) occurred late in the cold phase, similar as for the other Per-Luc transgenics tested (Figure 1C). When isolated brains were analyzed, we again observed a 12 hr phase shift, indicated by increased bioluminescence levels immediately following the temperature step up (Figure 1C). Our results show that the brain has to be in the context of the intact fly in order for clock-neuronal gene expression to be synchronized by temperature cycles, and implies that in whole flies temperature entrainment involves signaling from peripheral tissues to the brain. As we will show below, this involves the gene nocte, a locus previously identified to play a role in temperature entrainment (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In order to learn more about the function of nocte in temperature entrainment, we cloned the gene. Using meiotic mapping involving visible marker mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), nocte was mapped to the 9A2–9D3 interval on the X chromosome (Experimental Procedures). Fine mapping using deficiencies placed nocte within the 9C1–9D2 interval containing 12 genes, flanked by the proximal breakpoint of Df(1)c52,flwc52 (which removes 8E3-5;9C1; Tweedie et al., 2009Tweedie S. Ashburner M. Falls K. Leyland P. McQuilton P. Marygold S. Millburn G. Osumi-Sutherland D. Schroeder A. Seal R. Zhang H. FlyBase: enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology annotations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D555-D559Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and the distal breakpoint of Df(1)ED7010 (removing 9D3;9D4; Ryder et al., 2004Ryder E. Blows F. Ashburner M. Bautista-Llacer R. Coulson D. Drummond J. Webster J. Gubb D. Gunton N.

A chromosomal duplication covering this region (Dp(1;2)v+75d 9A2;10C2) rescued the molecular temperature entrainment defects of the original nocte mutant (Figure 3A), which confirmed the results of our mapping experiments. Next, we analyzed available mutations for the 12 candidate genes (Tweedie et al., 2009Tweedie S. Ashburner M. Falls K. Leyland P. McQuilton P. Marygold S. Millburn G. Osumi-Sutherland D. Schroeder A. Seal R. Zhang H. FlyBase: enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology annotations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D555-D559Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). One P element insertion line exhibited a temperature entrainment phenotype comparable to that observed in the original nocte mutant (Figures 3A, 4B, and 4C): wild-type flies anticipate the transition to the cold phase by an increase of their activity levels, which usually peak several hours before the actual transition (Busza et al., 2007Busza A.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10722-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), while flies carrying the chemically induced nocte allele do not show this anticipation, and simply react to temperature changes (Figure 4B) (Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005Glaser F.T. Stanewsky R. Temperature synchronization of the Drosophila circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1352-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, 80% of the flies carrying the insertion P{lacW}CG17255d07154, or females heterozygous for the insertion and the original nocte allele, do not synchronize properly to temperature cycles, though they do entrain to LD (Figures 4C, 4G, and S1 available online). The insertion associated with this line is located in the first intron of the gene CG17255 (Tweedie et al., 2009Tweedie S. Ashburner M. Falls K. Leyland P. McQuilton P. Marygold S. Millburn G. Osumi-Sutherland D. Schroeder A. Seal R. Zhang H. FlyBase: enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology annotations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D555-D559Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B and S2) and results in the generation of abnormally spliced CG17255 transcripts (Figure S2). We sequenced the open reading frame (ORF) of this gene in the original nocte mutant and in the background strain used to induce the original mutation (Experimental Procedures) and found that this mutant contains a single base pair change at nucleotide 5119 of the CG17255 cDNA. This alteration introduces a premature stop codon (CAG → TAG) at position 1707 of the predicted protein, which normally is 2309 amino acids long (Figure 3C). Both mutations interfere with molecular and behavioral temperature entrainment, fail to complement each other, and affect the same transcription unit (Figures 3A, B, 4B, 4C, and S1). We therefore conclude that disruption of CG17255 causes the observed phenotypes and named this gene nocte. The original ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced allele will from now on be referred to as nocte1; the P element insertion as nocteP. The nocte1 mutation maps to a portion of the gene's ORF that encodes one of several poly-glutamine stretches of Nocte. Apart from this feature and several poly-alanine stretches, Nocte has no apparent homologies to any other protein in the databases, except for a small region of similarity to the mammalian BAT2 domain at its N terminus (the overall similarity to the 70 N-terminal residues is weak, but it includes 11 identical amino acids).

https://openalex.org/W2047719630,"During development, retinal axons project coarsely within their visual targets before refining to form organized synaptic connections. Spontaneous retinal activity, in the form of acetylcholine-driven retinal waves, is proposed to be necessary for establishing these projection patterns. In particular, both axonal terminations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the size of receptive fields of target neurons are larger in mice that lack the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (beta2KO). Here, using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array to record activity from hundreds of RGCs simultaneously, we present analysis of early postnatal retinal activity from both wild-type (WT) and beta2KO retinas. We find that beta2KO retinas have correlated patterns of activity, but many aspects of these patterns differ from those of WT retina. Quantitative analysis suggests that wave directionality, coupled with short-range correlated bursting patterns of RGCs, work together to refine retinofugal projections."
https://openalex.org/W2044304894,The C. elegans cell lineage provides a unique opportunity to look at how cell lineage affects patterns of gene expression. We developed an automatic cell lineage analyzer that converts high-resolution images of worms into a data table showing fluorescence expression with single-cell resolution. We generated expression profiles of 93 genes in 363 specific cells from L1 stage larvae and found that cells with identical fates can be formed by different gene regulatory pathways. Molecular signatures identified repeating cell fate modules within the cell lineage and enabled the generation of a molecular differentiation map that reveals points in the cell lineage when developmental fates of daughter cells begin to diverge. These results demonstrate insights that become possible using computational approaches to analyze quantitative expression from many genes in parallel using a digital gene expression atlas.
https://openalex.org/W2014689400,"Background The clinical significance and cellular sources of residual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) production despite suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) remain unclear and the effect of low-level viremia on T-cell homeostasis is still debated. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized the recently produced residual viruses in the plasma and short-lived blood monocytes of 23 patients with various immunological responses to sustained suppressive cART. We quantified the residual HIV-1 in the plasma below 50 copies/ml, and in the CD14high CD16− and CD16+ monocyte subsets sorted by flow cytometry, and predicted coreceptor usage by genotyping V3 env sequences. We detected residual viremia in the plasma of 8 of 10 patients with poor CD4+ T-cell reconstitution in response to cART and in only 5 of 13 patients with good CD4+ T-cell reconstitution. CXCR4-using viruses were frequent among the recently produced viruses in the plasma and in the main CD14high CD16− monocyte subset. Finally, the residual viremia was correlated with persistent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation in patients with poor immune reconstitution. Conclusions Low-level viremia could result from the release of archived viruses from cellular reservoirs and/or from ongoing virus replication in some patients. The compartmentalization of the viruses between the plasma and the blood monocytes suggests at least two origins of residual virus production during effective cART. CXCR4-using viruses might be produced preferentially in patients on cART. Our results also suggest that low-level HIV-1 production in some patients may contribute to persistent immune dysfunction despite cART."

https://openalex.org/W2142803231,"DYRKs are kinases that self-activate in vitro by autophosphorylation of a YTY motif in the kinase domain, but their regulation in vivo is not well understood. In C. elegans zygotes, MBK-2/DYRK phosphorylates oocyte proteins at the end of the meiotic divisions to promote the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Here we demonstrate that MBK-2 is under both positive and negative regulation during the transition. MBK-2 is activated during oocyte maturation by CDK-1-dependent phosphorylation of serine 68, a residue outside of the kinase domain required for full activity in vivo. The pseudotyrosine phosphatases EGG-4 and EGG-5 sequester activated MBK-2 until the meiotic divisions by binding to the YTY motif and inhibiting MBK-2′s kinase activity directly, using a mixed-inhibition mechanism that does not involve tyrosine dephosphorylation.

IntroductionThe Eph receptors represent the largest family of tyrosine kinases, with 16 members divided into two classes, EphA and EphB. This subdivision is based on sequence conservation and binding preferences for their ligands, the ephrins, which are also divided into A and B classes. There are 10 EphA and 6 EphB receptors in mammals and chick, which can bind to six glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A ligands or three transmembrane ephrin-B ligands to mediate an extremely wide spectrum of biological responses through signals that are generated by both receptor and ligand activation (1Pasquale E.B.

Other interfaces contribute to Eph-ephrin binding, including (i) additional residues on both the receptor and ephrin surfaces; (ii) a low affinity interface also involving the Eph receptor ligand-binding domain, which was identified in the EphB2-ephrin-B2 complex and appears to mediate the association of two receptor-ephrin dimers (tetramerization) (4Himanen J.P.

A variety of factors appear to contribute to class specificity.

However, examples of interclass binding also exist: EphB2 can bind ephrin-A5, and EphA4 can bind all three ephrin-B ligands (12Pasquale E.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The structure of the EphB2 ephrin-binding domain in complex with ephrin-A5 has been determined (5Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J.

EphA4 binding to ephrin-B ligands is also weaker than to ephrin-A ligands. However, the physiological relevance of EphA4-ephrin-B interclass interactions has been demonstrated in many biological systems. For example, EphA4 interaction with ephrin-B1 stabilizes blood clot formation (13Prévost N. Woulfe D.S. Jiang H. Stalker T.J. Marchese P. Ruggeri Z.M. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we report the crystal structure of the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex and identify a polar contact region, structurally separated from the ephrin-binding channel, as critical for EphA4-ephrin-B2 binding. We also characterized the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex in solution by NMR spectroscopy, which represents the first NMR visualization of an Eph-ephrin complex. Interestingly, our results show that EphA4 uses different strategies for binding ephrin-A versus ephrin-B ligands, thus achieving remarkable promiscuity.DISCUSSIONThe binding promiscuity between Eph receptors and ephrin ligands appears to be a key strategy enabling Eph-ephrin signaling networks to control a wide array of biological functions. Understanding the structural principles governing promiscuity versus selectivity of Eph receptor-ephrin binding is therefore important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the biological functions of the Eph system and is also critical for the design of antagonists to target Eph-ephrin interactions. EphA4 is the only Eph receptor that can bind with substantial affinity all ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands (12Pasquale E.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we have reported the structure of the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex, which represents the first structure of a complex between an EphA receptor and an ephrin-B ligand.The overall architecture of the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex is very similar to those determined previously for other Eph-ephrin complexes. The high affinity interface of the complex can be divided into two relatively independent regions. One mostly involves the hydrophobic interactions between the EphA4 ligand-binding channel and the ephrin-B2 G-H loop. The other, which was observed in EphB-ephrin-B complexes (4Himanen J.P.

We did not obtain evidence for a distinct lower affinity binding interface that may mediate tetramerization of two EphA4-ephrin-B2 heterodimers similar to that described for the EphB2-ephrin-B2 complex (4Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Such an interface is also not evident in the EphB4-ephrin-B2, EphA2-ephrin-A1, and EphB2-ephrin-A5 complexes (5Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J. Lackmann M. Li C. Barton W.A. Jeffrey P.D. Vearing C.

Significant structural rearrangements in these regions have also been reported for EphB receptors upon ephrin binding (4Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B.

Commun. 2009; 65: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, only minor structural changes have been observed upon formation of the EphA2-ephrin-A1 complex (8Himanen J.P. Goldgur Y. Miao H. Myshkin E. Guo H. Buck M. Nguyen M. Rajashankar K.R. Wang B. Nikolov D.B. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The EphA4-ephrin-B2 structure also explains the relatively weak affinity of the EphA4-ephrin-B2 interclass binding (Kd = 203 nm) compared with intraclass interactions, such as those of EphB2 with ephrin-B2 (Kd = 22 nm) and EphB4 with ephrin-B2 (Kd = 40 nm). Because of sequence variations, a hydrophobic patch present in the EphB2-ephrin-B2 complex is absent in the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex. As a consequence, half of the EphA4 J-K loop remains open and does not make any contacts with the ephrin-B2 G-H loop (Fig. 4a). Given that the structurally equivalent EphB2 loop region is more open in the complex with ephrin-A5 and that the binding affinity of EphB2 for ephrin-A5 is even lower (Kd = 320 nm) (5Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J. Lackmann M. Li C. Barton W.A. Jeffrey P.D. Vearing C. Geleick D. Feldheim D.A. Boyd A.W. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), this feature likely accounts at least in part for the low binding affinity between EphA4 and ephrin-B2. However, comparing Kd values for wild-type and mutant proteins shows that the surface contacts formed between EphA4 residues Gln12 and Glu14 and ephrin-B2 residues Gln109 and Lys112 increase by ∼10-fold the binding affinity and thus play a critical role in EphA4-ephrin-B2 interclass binding.Mutation of the two EphA4 residues involved in the interface yields an EphA4 mutant that does not appear to undergo global structural changes or modifications in the ephrin-binding channel. This is evident from the unchanged binding affinity of the EphA4 mutant for two small molecule antagonists that bind within the channel. Interestingly, the polar surface contact region of EphA4 does not appear to be necessary for the intraclass binding with ephrin-A ligands, which probably involves a more intimate fit between the EphA4 ligand-binding channel and the ephrin-A G-H loop. This is the case for the EphA2-ephrin-A1 complex, where the surface contact region is extremely reduced (8Himanen J.P. Goldgur Y. Miao H. Myshkin E. Guo H. Buck M. Nguyen M. Rajashankar K.R. Wang B. Nikolov D.B. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, this region is likely not present or minimal in EphA4-ephrin-A complexes.On the other hand, Gln109 and Lys112 of ephrin-B2 have been shown to also interact with residues on the surface of EphB receptors (4Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Kraus M.L. Recht M.I. Kolatkar A.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28185-28192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which could explain the 2–3-fold decrease in the affinity of mutant ephrin-B2 for EphB receptors. However, we cannot exclude that the decrease in binding may be due to the changes in the overall conformation of the mutant ephrin observed by CD spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the much more pronounced impairment in the binding of mutant ephrin-B2 to EphA4 than to EphB receptors suggests that the surface contact region is much more critical for the EphA4-ephrin-B2 interclass binding than the EphB-ephrin-B2 intraclass binding. Interestingly, the residue corresponding to ephrin-B2 Gln109 is a Leu in ephrin-B3 and therefore cannot be involved in the hydrogen bond with EphA4 Gln12 that is instead present in the EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex. However, the binding affinity of the EphA4 mutant for ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 is equally reduced compared with wild-type EphA4, suggesting that the salt bridge between ephrin-B2 Lys112 and EphA4 Gln14 might play a more important role in EphA4-ephrin-B interclass binding than the hydrogen bond between ephrin-B2 Gln109 and EphA4 Gln12.NMR characterization also provides the first insight into the dynamic aspects associated with EphA4-ephrin-B2 binding in solution, which could not be achieved from analysis of the more static crystallized complex. Interestingly, the NMR results show that many EphA4 residues perturbed upon ephrin-B2 binding (corresponding to HSQC peaks that shift or disappear) are located outside the high affinity EphA4-ephrin-B2 binding interface. For example, many residues in the EphA4 L and H strands are significantly perturbed even though they are far away from the binding interface. Interestingly, in the crystal structure, these residues do not appear to undergo any detectable conformational changes upon ephrin-B2 binding (Fig. 1b). In contrast, once the interactions mediated by EphA4 Gln12 and Glu14 are removed, the residues perturbed by the binding of ephrin-B2 are limited only to the EphA4 interface in direct contact with ephrin-B2. Thus, contacts mediated by Gln12 and/or Glu14 have far-reaching effects over the entire EphA4 ligand-binding domain. It is tempting to speculate that these perturbations, involving peak shifts and disappearances, may reflect dynamic changes in EphA4 that are initiated by ephrin-B binding and are critical for biological function. However, although we did not obtain evidence for complexes larger than heterodimers, it cannot be completely excluded that a very weak tendency might exist for EphA4-ephrin-B2 heterodimeric complexes to form high order complexes such as tetramers, in analogy to what is observed with EphB2-ephrin-B2 complexes (4Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate this possibility in future NMR studies as exemplified previously (43Jee J. Ishima R. Gronenborn A.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2008; 112: 6008-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The new EphA4-ephrin-B2 complex structure that we have characterized, together with those determined previously for other Eph receptor-ephrin pairs, highlights a surprising diversity in the use of the two regions of the high affinity interface to accomplish intraclass or interclass Eph receptor-ephrin binding. For example, it appears that intraclass binding is mediated almost exclusively (A class) or predominantly (B class) by the hydrophobic Eph channel-ephrin G-H loop region of the interface. Accordingly, the fit of the ephrin G-H loop into the Eph channel is more intimate for the A than the B class. EphB2-ephrin-A5 interclass binding relies only on the channel region of the interface, although the loose interclass fit of the EphB channel and the ephrin-A G-H loop results in the lowest binding affinity among the complexes structurally characterized so far. Interestingly, we found that EphA4-ephrin-B2 interclass binding uses a unique strategy, where the presumably very weak binding through the Eph channel-ephrin G-H loop is supplemented by interactions in the polar surface contact region of the interface. In this manner, EphA4 achieves the highest promiscuity among the Eph receptors.As a consequence of this variability in Eph receptor-ephrin interfaces, the design of antagonists to target Eph-ephrin interactions may be more challenging than previously thought, and diverse strategies may be needed depending on the Eph receptor and the ephrin involved. Consistent with this notion, we previously found that two small molecule antagonists that target the ephrin-binding channel of EphA4 inhibit the binding of some ephrins but not others. For example, we did not detect inhibition of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-A4 binding to EphA4 at concentrations that completely inhibited the binding of other ephrins (40Noberini R. Koolpe M. Peddibhotla S. Dahl R. Su Y. Cosford N.D. Roth G.P. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29461-29472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The structural information we obtained and the effects of the EphA4 and ephrin-B2 mutations also suggest that it is possible to selectively inhibit EphA4 binding to ephrin-B but not ephrin-A ligands by disrupting the polar surface region of the high affinity interface, whereas the binding of ephrin-A ligands to EphA4 may be selectively inhibited by disrupting appropriate contacts in the channel region. Such strategies may help dissect the biological roles of intraclass versus interclass EphA4-ephrin binding and guide more selective approaches for the design of EphA4 inhibitors. IntroductionThe Eph receptors represent the largest family of tyrosine kinases, with 16 members divided into two classes, EphA and EphB. This subdivision is based on sequence conservation and binding preferences for their ligands, the ephrins, which are also divided into A and B classes. There are 10 EphA and 6 EphB receptors in mammals and chick, which can bind to six glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A ligands or three transmembrane ephrin-B ligands to mediate an extremely wide spectrum of biological responses through signals that are generated by both receptor and ligand activation (1Pasquale E.B.

Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar).All of the Eph receptors share the same modular structure, which comprises a juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain, a C-terminal sterile α-motif domain, and a PDZ-binding motif in the intracellular region. In the extracellular portion, there are an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region, and two fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin-binding domain is responsible for ligand recognition and is composed of 11 antiparallel β-strands organized in a jellyroll β-sandwich architecture, which is conserved among EphA and EphB receptors (3Himanen J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2006184695,"The presynaptic active zone is composed of a protein network that contains ELKS2α (a.k.a. CAST) as a central component. Here we demonstrate that in mice, deletion of ELKS2α caused a large increase in inhibitory, but not excitatory, neurotransmitter release, and potentiated the size, but not the properties, of the readily-releasable pool of vesicles at inhibitory synapses. Quantitative electron microscopy revealed that the ELKS2α deletion did not change the number of docked vesicles or other ultrastructural parameters of synapses, except for a small decrease in synaptic vesicle numbers. The ELKS2α deletion did, however, alter the excitatory/inhibitory balance and exploratory behaviors, possibly as a result of the increased synaptic inhibition. Thus, as opposed to previous studies indicating that ELKS2α is essential for mediating neurotransmitter release, our results suggest that ELKS2α normally restricts release and limits the size of the readily-releasable pool of synaptic vesicles at the active zone of inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2161272864,"Nutrient overload is associated with the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. High plasma concentrations of amino acids have been found to correlate with insulin resistance. At the cellular level, excess amino acids impair insulin signaling, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. Here, we report that STAT3 plays a key role in amino acid dampening of insulin signaling in hepatic cells. Excess amino acids inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis in mouse primary hepatocytes as well as in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. STAT3 knockdown protected insulin sensitivity from inhibition by amino acids. Amino acids stimulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser(727), but not Tyr(705). Replacement of the endogenous STAT3 with wild-type, but not S727A, recombinant STAT3 restored the ability of amino acids to inhibit insulin signaling, suggesting that Ser(727) phosphorylation was critical for STAT3-mediated amino acid effect. Furthermore, overexpression of STAT3-S727D was sufficient to inhibit insulin signaling in the absence of excess amino acids. Our results also indicated that mammalian target of rapamycin was likely responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser(727) in response to excess amino acids. Finally, we found that STAT3 activity and the expression of its target gene socs3, known to be involved in insulin resistance, were both stimulated by excess amino acids and inhibited by rapamycin. In conclusion, our study reveals STAT3 as a novel mediator of nutrient signals and identifies a Ser(727) phosphorylation-dependent and Tyr(705) phosphorylation-independent STAT3 activation mechanism in the modulation of insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2149674824,"Lignin is a complex polymer derived from the oxidative coupling of three classical monolignols. Lignin precursors are methylated exclusively at the meta-positions (i.e. 3/5-OH) of their phenyl rings by native O-methyltransferases, and are precluded from substitution of the para-hydroxyl (4-OH) position. Ostensibly, the para-hydroxyls of phenolics are critically important for oxidative coupling of phenoxy radicals to form polymers. Therefore, creating a 4-O-methyltransferase to substitute the para-hydroxyl of monolignols might well interfere with the synthesis of lignin. The phylogeny of plant phenolic O-methyltransferases points to the existence of a batch of evolutionarily ""plastic"" amino acid residues. Following one amino acid at a time path of directed evolution, and using the strategy of structure-based iterative site-saturation mutagenesis, we created a novel monolignol 4-O-methyltransferase from the enzyme responsible for methylating phenylpropenes. We show that two plastic residues in the active site of the parental enzyme are vital in dominating substrate discrimination. Mutations at either one of these separate the evolutionarily tightly linked properties of substrate specificity and regioselective methylation of native O-methyltransferase, thereby conferring the ability for para-methylation of the lignin monomeric precursors, primarily monolignols. Beneficial mutations at both sites have an additive effect. By further optimizing enzyme activity, we generated a triple mutant variant that may structurally constitute a novel phenolic substrate binding pocket, leading to its high binding affinity and catalytic efficiency on monolignols. The 4-O-methoxylation of monolignol efficiently impairs oxidative radical coupling in vitro, highlighting the potential for applying this novel enzyme in managing lignin polymerization in planta."
https://openalex.org/W1999770380,"Extensive studies performed in nonexcitable cells and expression systems have shown that type 1 transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC1) channels operate mainly in plasma membranes and open through phospholipase C-dependent processes, membrane stretch, or depletion of Ca(2+) stores. In skeletal muscle, it is proposed that TRPC1 channels are involved in plasmalemmal Ca(2+) influx and stimulated by store depletion or membrane stretch, but direct evidence for TRPC1 sarcolemmal channel activity is not available. We investigated here the functional role of TRPC1 using an overexpressing strategy in adult mouse muscle fibers. Immunostaining for endogenous TRPC1 revealed a striated expression pattern that matched sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) pump immunolabeling. In cells expressing TRPC1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), the same pattern of expression was observed, compatible with a longitudinal SR localization. Resting electric properties, action potentials, and resting divalent cation influx were not altered in TRPC1-YFP-positive cells. Poisoning with the SR Ca(2+) pump blocker cyclopiazonic acid elicited a contracture of the fiber at the level of the overexpression site in presence and absence of external Ca(2+) which was not observed in control cells. Ca(2+) measurements indicated that resting Ca(2+) and the rate of Ca(2+) increase induced by cyclopiazonic acid were higher in the TRPC1-YFP-positive zone than in the TRPC1-YFP-negative zone and control cells. Ca(2+) transients evoked by 200-ms voltage clamp pulses decayed slower in TRPC1-YFP-positive cells. In contrast to previous hypotheses, these data demonstrate that TRPC1 operates as a SR Ca(2+) leak channel in skeletal muscle."

V-ATPase activity has also been associated with cancer invasiveness. Here, we report on a new V-ATPase-associated protein, which we identified in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor-transformed cells, and which was separately identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as HRG-1, a member of a family of heme-regulated genes. We found that HRG-1 is present in endosomes but not in lysosomes, and it is trafficked to the plasma membrane upon nutrient withdrawal in mammalian cells. Suppression of HRG-1 with small interfering RNA causes impaired endocytosis of transferrin receptor, decreased cell motility, and decreased viability of HeLa cells. HRG-1 interacts with the c subunit of the V-ATPase and enhances V-ATPase activity in isolated yeast vacuoles. Endosomal acidity and V-ATPase assembly are decreased in cells with suppressed HRG-1, whereas transferrin receptor endocytosis is enhanced in cells that overexpress HRG-1. Cellular uptake of a fluorescent heme analogue is enhanced by HRG-1 in a V-ATPase-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that HRG-1 regulates V-ATPase activity, which is essential for endosomal acidification, heme binding, and receptor trafficking in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2135600333,"Beta-arrestin1 is a multifunctional protein critically involved in signal transduction. Recently, it is also identified as a nuclear transcriptional regulator, but the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance remain to be explored. Here, we identified beta-arrestin1 as an evolutionarily conserved protein essential for zebrafish development. Zebrafish embryos depleted of beta-arrestin1 displayed severe posterior defects and especially failed to undergo hematopoiesis. In addition, the expression of cdx4, a critical regulator of embryonic blood formation, and its downstream hox genes were downregulated by depletion of beta-arrestin1, while injection of cdx4, hoxa9a or hoxb4a mRNA rescued the hematopoietic defects. Further mechanistic studies revealed that beta-arrestin1 bound to and sequestered the polycomb group (PcG) recruiter YY1, and relieved PcG-mediated repression of cdx4-hox pathway, thus regulating hematopoietic lineage specification. Taken together, this study demonstrated a critical role of beta-arrestin1 during zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis, as well as an important regulator of PcG proteins and cdx4-hox pathway."

This “microblogging” service has gained tremendous popularity in the 2 years since its launch. Yet, most scientists are steering clear of it. Laura Bonetta speaks to some who have found value in tweeting. Twitter, the online service (http://www.twitter.com) that launched publicly in August 2006, enables users to send and receive short messages. Known as tweets, these messages get displayed online on an author's Twitter page and are delivered to all of the author's subscribers, or followers, via the Internet or cell phones. Twitter is most renowned for its celebrity “Twitterers,” who have huge followings. But a growing number of science Twitterers are starting to take up their share of cyberspace. They have found that Twitter provides a useful way to share their insights about recently published papers and science presentations or discussions, as well as information about grants, careers, science policy, and other items of interest. One scientist who has found value in Twitter is Brent Stockwell, associate professor of biology and chemistry at Columbia University. “I use it to collect information from science newsfeeds and from various individuals,” he says. “It provides a single source where you can go to scan news and papers.” There are many ways to stay abreast of research findings, including automated PubMed searches and Google alerts. But, says Stockwell, Twitter provides a unique way to hear about papers “tangentially related to what I am doing, so that they would not come up through my usual alerts, and not sufficiently high profile that I would read about them in The New York Times.” He continues, “Sometimes four or five people I follow will mention a paper that I did not come across and I will look it up. I think I am much more up to date on science literature since I started following Twitter.” Although few established academic researchers have embraced Twitter, Stockwell says there is a large enough group of science journalists, science magazines, science organizations, and grad students and postdocs posting online to make the service valuable. Stockwell himself regularly highlights papers worth looking at and other items of interest on his account at http://twitter.com/bstockwell. Chris Gunter started to explore Twitter about a year ago, shortly after taking up her current position as director of research affairs at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama. “One thing that I have to do as part of my job is to communicate our science. I started to explore Twitter as a tool to do this, and I have seen a steady growth in followers.” Her Twitter account, “girlscientist” (http://twitter.com/girlscientist), currently has close to 1000 followers. Like Stockwell, Gunter says Twitter is valuable for keeping up with the scientific literature. “It does not have to be a time sink, like people might think,” she says. “Some people will browse through science journals when they have a break. I look at the Twitter headlines from the people I follow—mostly scientists and science journalists. It just depends on how you choose to spend your time.” Some scientists also use Twitter to report on interesting (or sometimes dreadful) presentations heard at a scientific conference—a practice that has stirred some controversy. In May of this year, Daniel MacArthur, a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, who writes a popular blog called Genetic Future (at http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture) and a related Twitter feed, reported live from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) meeting Biology of Genomes. The blogs and tweets came to the attention of Genomeweb, an online news service, that took issue with the fact that MacArthur, a meeting participant, was reporting without having obtained permission from the presenters, a rule that professional journalists attending the conference had to abide by. Because of the complaints, a month later CSHL released a statement that “any participant intending to blog, twitter or otherwise communicate or disseminate results or discussion presented at the meeting to anonymous third parties must obtain permission from the relevant presenting author before communicating any results or discussion to third party groups, message boards, blogs or other online resources (other than your own lab or departments).” One of the concerns of conference organizers and speakers is that tweets, unlike regular blogs or news articles, have the potential to spread like wild fire. Anyone who receives an interesting tweet can re-tweet the message, sending it to all of his or her followers. Jonathan Eisen, evolutionary biologist and professor at the University of California, Davis, regularly blogs and twitters from meetings because his followers have found such postings useful. “Scientists live tweet to provide people who were not able to attend the meeting a sense of what someone is saying, exactly as they say it,” says Eisen. A vocal supporter of open access publishing, Eisen tries to avoid attending “closed” meetings that do not allow unrestricted reporting. “I am not interested in breaking the rules,” he explains. “I will find out ahead of time what the rules about blogging from the conference are, and if it's not allowed, I won't go.” Eisen was introduced to Twitter by following Lance Armstrong's Twitter postings while the cyclist was in Davis for the Tour of California. Since then, he has embraced the service as a tool for promoting open communication in science. “My main mission is to get science information out there and to reach as many people as possible,” says Eisen, whose Twitter account (http://twitter.com/phylogenomics) has over 1200 followers. Disseminating scientific information is a driving mission for many Twitter users. “One thing everyone agrees with is that scientists have to learn to communicate their work to non-scientists. Twitter allows anyone to see science in a way that is more accessible, such as scientists reporting on their daily failures and successes,” says Gunter. “In addition, many science writers are on Twitter and that is one place where they get their news tips. They can then write stories that educate and publicize science, and more accurately explain what scientists do to lay people.” “Twitter and regular blogging are more effective than anything else I do to publicize a paper, which was really surprising to me,” says Eisen. “If you do it right, Twitter is an effective way of telling people about your work.” Twitter posts can be viewed by anyone on the Twitter website. But by signing up (registration on Twitter is free and without commitments to post anything), users can select particular authors to follow. The authors' postings will then appear as a string of entries—each no more than 140 characters in length—on a personal webpage. Users can also sign up to receive messages by mobile texting or instant messaging. With more than 5000 followers at http://twitter.com/sciencebase, sciencebase is one of the most popular Twitter feeds in science. “I am a small fry though compared to some of the much more successful Twitter users in other niches and I don't just mean celebrities,” says sciencebase author David Bradley, a chemist by training and freelance science writer based in Cambridge, UK. (In comparison, Richard Dawkins has almost 25,000 followers on his Twitter feed; the actor Ashton Kutcher has 3.8 million.) Bradley tweets about scientific discoveries and policy matters, typically linking his tweets to articles that appeared in newspapers or blogs, including his own at http://www.sciencebase.com. He has collected the names of fellow “scientwists”—a name he coined—in a list that now includes over 600 members (http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/100-scientific-twitter-friends). Other collections of science Twitterers include the scientists Twibe (http://www.twibes.com/group/scientists?id=431277)—also created by Bradley—and Science Pond (http://sciencepond.com/). These websites provide good starting points for anyone who wants to get a taste of what science Twitterers write about and to choose authors to follow. Although science Twitterers, and their followers, are out there, “those are still small numbers compared to the numbers of scientists who could join,” says Bradley. “But I don't think it's just Twitter that [scientists] are not into. I have spoken to a lot of people who either just don't get online social networking or, if they do get it, they see it as a waste of time.” Part of the problem is that Twitter has a reputation for being a social venue for friends to tell each other about their daily activities. “There would be little point in scientists joining simply to tweet about their coffee breaks, walking holidays, or showering schedule,” says Bradley. “However, if they wish to share their successes and failures in the lab, swap useful information and tips, or seek advice, then Twitter could be a useful way to do that.” But how can truly useful information be conveyed when faced with a 140-character limit? The maximum number of characters for a Twitter post was set for compatibility with short message service (SMS)—the type of text messaging used on mobile phones. “I was reluctant to like Twitter because of the character limit,” says Eisen. “But after I started using it I found out it forces people to be concise and creative and makes others more likely to read the messages. That one piece of restriction is actually the reason why Twitter is so useful.” But short messages do pose some limitations. “It is a double-edged sword. The majority of my tweets are pointers to other resources, so there is a headline—an enticement in other words—and a link to the resource. You don't need more than 140 characters for that,” says Bradley. “However you cannot have a decent, full-blown, high-level scientific debate via text message, and Twitter is just the same.” That limitation is one of the reasons that Jonathan Weissman, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of California, San Francisco, has stayed away from Twitter. “I could see something similar to Twitter might be useful as a way for a group of scientists to share information. To ask questions like ‘Does anyone have a good antibody?’ ‘How much does everyone pay for oligos?’ ‘Does anyone have experience with this technique?’” he says. But such discussions, he adds, could not be carried out with strict restrictions on text length. Although Weissman has not adopted Twitter, he does not dismiss the value of connecting communities of scientists. “I think scientists should embrace using the Internet to connect with each other and to advance career goals and technical aspects,” he says. “There are many exciting possibilities, especially for scientists who tend to be a technically savvy group.” Twitter has taken cyberspace by storm, but it's still hard to know how big a role it will play in the scientific exchange of information. Those who have experimented with it have found it a valuable tool to keep abreast of discoveries and to disseminate information. And many of them believe the service will grow in popularity as more scientists become familiar with it. On the other hand, new online networking services may become available that will have wider appeal among researchers. If that happens, chances are we will hear about them first on Twitter."
https://openalex.org/W1999497004,"A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 9 (ADAMTS9) is a highly conserved metalloprotease that has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene and is required for normal mouse development. The secreted ADAMTS9 zymogen undergoes proteolytic excision of its N-terminal propeptide by the proprotein convertase furin. However, in contrast to other metalloproteases, propeptide excision occurs at the cell surface and leads to decreased activity of the zymogen. Here, we investigated the potential cellular mechanisms regulating ADAMTS9 biosynthesis and cell-surface processing by analysis of molecular complexes formed by a construct containing the propeptide and catalytic domain of pro-ADAMTS9 (Pro-Cat) in HEK293F cells. Cross-linking of cellular proteins bound to Pro-Cat followed by mass spectrometric analysis identified UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase I, heat shock protein gp96 (GRP94), BiP (GRP78), and ERdj3 (Hsp40 homolog) as associated proteins. gp96 and BiP were present at the cell surface in an immunoprecipitable complex with pro-ADAMTS9 and furin. Treatment with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of the HSP90alpha family (including gp96), led to decreased furin processing of pro-ADAMTS9 and accumulation of the unprocessed pro-ADAMTS9 at the cell surface. gp96 siRNA down-regulated the levels of cell-surface pro-ADAMTS9 and furin, whereas the levels of cell-surface pro-ADAMTS9, but not of cell-surface furin, were decreased upon treatment with BiP siRNA. These data identify for the first time the cellular chaperones associated with secretion of an ADAMTS protease and suggest a role for gp96 in modulating pro-ADAMTS9 processing."
https://openalex.org/W2051106146,"During embryogenesis, brain neurons receiving the same sensory input may undergo potentiation or depression. While the origin of variable plasticity in vivo is unknown, it plays a key role in shaping dynamic neural circuit refinement. Here, we investigate effects of natural visual stimuli on neuronal firing within the intact, awake, developing brain using calcium imaging of 100 s of central neurons in the Xenopus retinotectal system. We find that specific patterns of visual stimuli shift population responses toward either potentiation or depression in an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-dependent manner. In agreement with Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro metaplasticity, our results show that functional potentiation or depression can be predicted by individual neurons' specific receptive field properties and historic firing rates. Interestingly, this activity-dependent metaplasticity is itself NMDA-R dependent. Furthermore, network analysis reveals increased correlated firing of neurons that undergo potentiation. These findings implicate metaplasticity as a natural property regulating experience-dependent refinement of nascent embryonic brain circuits."

Zicam (zinc gluconate; Matrixx Initiatives, Inc), a homeopathic substance marketed to alleviate cold symptoms, has been implicated in olfactory dysfunction. Here, we investigated Zicam and several common intranasal agents for their effects on olfactory function. Zicam was the only substance that showed significant cytotoxicity in both mouse and human nasal tissue. Specifically, Zicam-treated mice had disrupted sensitivity of olfactory sensory neurons to odorant stimulation and were unable to detect novel odorants in behavioral testing. These findings were long-term as no recovery of function was observed after two months. Finally, human nasal explants treated with Zicam displayed significantly elevated extracellular lactate dehydrogenase levels compared to saline-treated controls, suggesting severe necrosis that was confirmed on histology. Our results demonstrate that Zicam use could irreversibly damage mouse and human nasal tissue and may lead to significant smell dysfunction."

The physiological implications of plant sulfite oxidase as a copious generator of superoxide are discussed. IntroductionMolybdenum-containing enzymes are found in most organisms and (with the notable exception of nitrogenase) fall into three families, as epitomized by xanthine oxidase, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase, and sulfite oxidase. The sulfite oxidase family consists of vertebrate sulfite oxidases, plant sulfite oxidases, bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase, and assimilatory nitrate reductases (1.Feng C. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Each of these enzymes catalyzes oxygen atom transfer to (or from) a substrate lone pair of electrons.In vertebrates, sulfite oxidase catalyzes the final step in the metabolism of sulfur derived from compounds such as the amino acids methionine and cysteine, as well as the sulfatides and related components of the myelin sheath and other cellular membranes (2.Cohen H.J. Fridovich I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Niknahad H. O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 174: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 47-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Its action ensures that intracellular levels of the otherwise deleterious sulfite ion remain at acceptably low levels. The plant form of sulfite oxidase not only plays a role in sulfite detoxification, but it also serves as an intermediate enzyme in the assimilatory reduction of sulfate (5.Hänsch R. Lang C. Rennenberg H. Mendel R.R. Plant Biol. 2007; 9: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sulfite dehydrogenase is the bacterial equivalent of sulfite oxidase, oxidizing sulfite to sulfate in the course of chemolithotrophic growth with thiosulfate as an energy source (6.Aguey-Zinsou K.F. Bernhardt P.V. Kappler U. McEwan A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the various physiological roles of these enzymes, they all catalyze the same overall reaction. SO32-+H2O→SO42-+2H++2e-(Eq. 1) All three enzymes possess a molybdenum center with the metal in a square-pyramidal LMoVIO2(S-Cys) geometry, where L represents a pyranopterin cofactor (common to all mononuclear molybdenum and tungsten enzymes) coordinated to the metal through a dithiolene bond (Fig. 1) (7.Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The molybdenum-binding portions of all three types of sulfite-oxidizing enzymes exhibit a high degree of sequence identity and structural homology (8.Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The similarity in the reaction mechanisms with sulfite (i.e. the reductive half-reaction of the catalytic cycle) notwithstanding, these sulfite-oxidizing enzymes differ substantively with regard to the substrate used in the oxidative half of the catalytic sequence. Both vertebrate sulfite oxidases and bacterial sulfite dehydrogenases possess heme prosthetic groups (b5- and c552-like, respectively) which accept electrons from the molybdenum centers in the course of catalysis and eventually pass them on to cytochrome c and the respiratory chain and the electron transport chain of the organism (9.Kessler D.L.

The vertebrate forms of sulfite oxidase are α2 dimers, with the heme domain only loosely tethered to the molybdenum domain via a flexible 10- amino acid linker. The bacterial sulfite dehydrogenases are αβ dimers, with separate heme and molybdenum subunits bound in a more stable, yet noncovalent, interaction (10.Kappler U. Bailey S. J. Biol.

The data points are the average of at least three transients with error bars shown for each point. The reaction was performed in Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain a better understanding of plant sulfite oxidase, we have examined its oxidative half-reaction in some detail. Here, we present results demonstrating effectively quantitative generation of superoxide by plant sulfite oxidase, both in the reaction of reduced enzyme with O2 and during steady-state turnover. We further demonstrate explicitly that reoxidation of the fully reduced Mo(IV) state of the enzyme occurs in two sequential one-electron steps.DISCUSSIONThe molybdenum center of sulfite oxidase is very unusual in exhibiting significant reactivity toward O2; the molybdenum centers of other well characterized enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and vertebrate sulfite oxidases (with their heme prosthetic groups) react only very sluggishly with O2 and their reduced forms are essentially air-stable. We have demonstrated here that plant sulfite oxidase does not simply react rapidly with O2, but it does so in a way that produces superoxide essentially quantitatively. Hydrogen peroxide is only subsequently generated, as reported previously (5.Hänsch R. Lang C. Rennenberg H. Mendel R.R. Plant Biol. 2007; 9: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in what is presumably the spontaneous dismutation of superoxide initially generated.The reaction of plant sulfite oxidase with oxygen is strictly second-order, with a rate constant of 5.3 ± 0.3 × 104 m−1s−1 in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 4 °C. Time courses following the generation of superoxide in the course of enzyme reoxidation by its reduction of cytochrome c are biphasic, indicating that enzyme reoxidation occurs in two one-electron transfer steps. An initial fast transfer is followed by a slow second transfer with rates of 47.7 ± 0.4 s−1 and 7.5 ± 0.1 s−1, respectively. Given the very rapid rate of plant sulfite oxidase by sulfite (>1000 s−1) (8.Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hänsch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it is evident that that the limiting step occurs during the oxidative half. We can, therefore, make a comparison between the reported kcat and the electron transfer rates that we have determined. Our data indicate an overall kox of 28 s−1 at 4 °C and an oxygen concentration of 532 μm. At 25 °C, kox is 116 s−1, which agrees with our value for kcat at 25 °C of 122 ± 1.1 s−1 and the published value of ∼100 s−1 (13.Hemann C. Hood B.L. Fulton M. Hänsch R. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Kirk M.L. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16567-16577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From the temperature dependence of kox over the range of 4–30 °C, an activation energy of Ea = 46.9 ± 1.2 kJ mol−1 can be estimated (data not shown). Our experimentally determined electron transfer rates for the oxidative half-reaction are in good agreement with previously published kinetic data. These data fully support the conclusion that plant sulfite oxidase generates superoxide.Plant sulfite oxidase becomes one of only five peroxisomal proteins known to generate superoxide, the others being NADPH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase (27.López-Huertas E. Corpus F.J. Sandalio L.M. del Rio L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) monodehydroascorbate reductase (27.López-Huertas E. Corpus F.J. Sandalio L.M. del Rio L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and a protein of unidentified function that utilizes NADH as reductant (27.López-Huertas E. Corpus F.J. Sandalio L.M. del Rio L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28.López-Huertas E. Sandalio L.M. Gomez M. del Rio L.A. Free Rad.

Plant. 1998; 104: 673-680Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These are each believed to be the components of a peroxisomal membrane electron transport chain, with all three proteins found in the membrane. Although their superoxide generation may simply be adventitious and not represent a significant proportion of catalytic throughput, this is not the case with the plant sulfite oxidase. It is possible that the significant levels of superoxide (and peroxide) generated by these enzymes plays a physiological, possibly antipathogenic, role in plants.Interestingly, neither vertebrate nor bacterial forms of sulfite oxidase seem to be able to react with oxygen at an appreciable rate. It is not known what determinants of the active site of plant sulfite oxidase render it so reactive toward O2. Indeed, the molybdenum center itself is virtually indistinguishable structurally from that of the vertebrate form of the enzyme, and most nearby amino acid residues, and in particular those responsible for binding substrate, are strictly conserved. Of known molybdenum centers in biology, only that of arsenite-complexed xanthine oxidase has been shown capable of direct reduction of oxygen, resulting in the production of superoxide (30.Stewart R.C. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8892-8904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IntroductionMolybdenum-containing enzymes are found in most organisms and (with the notable exception of nitrogenase) fall into three families, as epitomized by xanthine oxidase, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase, and sulfite oxidase. The sulfite oxidase family consists of vertebrate sulfite oxidases, plant sulfite oxidases, bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase, and assimilatory nitrate reductases (1.Feng C. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Each of these enzymes catalyzes oxygen atom transfer to (or from) a substrate lone pair of electrons.In vertebrates, sulfite oxidase catalyzes the final step in the metabolism of sulfur derived from compounds such as the amino acids methionine and cysteine, as well as the sulfatides and related components of the myelin sheath and other cellular membranes (2.Cohen H.J. Fridovich I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Niknahad H. O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 174: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4.Schindelin H. Kisker C. Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 47-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Its action ensures that intracellular levels of the otherwise deleterious sulfite ion remain at acceptably low levels. The plant form of sulfite oxidase not only plays a role in sulfite detoxification, but it also serves as an intermediate enzyme in the assimilatory reduction of sulfate (5.Hänsch R. Lang C. Rennenberg H. Mendel R.R. Plant Biol. 2007; 9: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sulfite dehydrogenase is the bacterial equivalent of sulfite oxidase, oxidizing sulfite to sulfate in the course of chemolithotrophic growth with thiosulfate as an energy source (6.Aguey-Zinsou K.F. Bernhardt P.V. Kappler U. McEwan A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the various physiological roles of these enzymes, they all catalyze the same overall reaction. SO32-+H2O→SO42-+2H++2e-(Eq. 1) All three enzymes possess a molybdenum center with the metal in a square-pyramidal LMoVIO2(S-Cys) geometry, where L represents a pyranopterin cofactor (common to all mononuclear molybdenum and tungsten enzymes) coordinated to the metal through a dithiolene bond (Fig. 1) (7.Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The molybdenum-binding portions of all three types of sulfite-oxidizing enzymes exhibit a high degree of sequence identity and structural homology (8.Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hänsch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The similarity in the reaction mechanisms with sulfite (i.e. the reductive half-reaction of the catalytic cycle) notwithstanding, these sulfite-oxidizing enzymes differ substantively with regard to the substrate used in the oxidative half of the catalytic sequence. Both vertebrate sulfite oxidases and bacterial sulfite dehydrogenases possess heme prosthetic groups (b5- and c552-like, respectively) which accept electrons from the molybdenum centers in the course of catalysis and eventually pass them on to cytochrome c and the respiratory chain and the electron transport chain of the organism (9.Kessler D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2088613543,"Src kinases are key regulators of cellular proliferation, survival, motility, and invasiveness. They play important roles in the regulation of inflammation and cancer. Overexpression or hyperactivity of c-Src has been implicated in the development of various types of cancer, including lung cancer. Src inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for non-small cell lung cancer in Phase I and II clinical trials. The mechanisms of Src implication in cancer and inflammation are linked to the ability of activated Src to phosphorylate multiple downstream targets that mediate its cellular effector functions. In this study, we reveal that inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme also implicated in cancer and inflammation, is a downstream mediator of activated Src. We elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the association between Src and iNOS in models of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide and/or cytokines and in cancer cells and tissues. We identify human iNOS residue Tyr(1055) as a target for Src-mediated phosphorylation. These results are shown in normal cells and cancer cells as well as in vivo in mice. Importantly, such posttranslational modification serves to stabilize iNOS half-life. The data also demonstrate interactions and co-localization of iNOS and activated Src under inflammatory conditions and in cancer cells. This study demonstrates that phosphorylation of iNOS by Src plays an important role in the regulation of iNOS and nitric oxide production and hence could account for some Src-related roles in inflammation and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2097266323,"All mitochondrial tRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei derive from cytosolic tRNAs that are in part imported into mitochondria. Some trypanosomal tRNAs are thiolated in a compartment-specific manner. We have identified three proteins required for the thio modification of cytosolic tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Glu), and tRNA(Lys). RNA interference-mediated ablation of these proteins results in the cytosolic accumulation non-thio-modified tRNAs but does not increase their import. Moreover, in vitro import experiments showed that both thio-modified and non-thio-modified tRNA(Glu) can efficiently be imported into mitochondria. These results indicate that unlike previously suggested the cytosol-specific thio modifications do not function as antideterminants for mitochondrial tRNA import. Consistent with these results we showed by using inducible expression of a tagged tRNA(Glu) that it is mainly the thiolated form that is imported in vivo. Unexpectedly, the imported tRNA becomes dethiolated after import, which explains why the non-thiolated form is enriched in mitochondria. Finally, we have identified two genes required for thiolation of imported tRNA(Trp) whose wobble nucleotide is subject to mitochondrial C to U editing. Interestingly, down-regulation of thiolation resulted in an increase of edited tRNA(Trp) but did not affect growth."
https://openalex.org/W2056364214,"Background In the northern hemisphere winter of 2003–04 antigenic variant strains (A/Fujian/411/02 –like) of influenza A H3N2 emerged. Circulation of these strains in the UK was accompanied by an unusually high number of laboratory confirmed influenza associated fatalities in children. This study was carried out to better understand risk factors associated with fatal cases of influenza in children. Methodology/Principal Findings Case histories, autopsy reports and death registration certificates for seventeen fatal cases of laboratory confirmed influenza in children were analyzed. None had a recognized pre-existing risk factor for severe influenza and none had been vaccinated. Three cases had evidence of significant bacterial co-infection. Influenza strains recovered from fatal cases were antigenically similar to those circulating in the community. A comparison of protective antibody titres in age stratified cohort sera taken before and after winter 2003–04 showed that young children had the highest attack rate during this season (21% difference, 95% confidence interval from 0.09 to 0.33, p = 0.0009). Clinical incidences of influenza-like illness (ILI) in young age groups were shown to be highest only in the years when novel antigenic drift variants emerged. Conclusions/Significance This work presents a rare insight into fatal influenza H3N2 in healthy children. It confirms that circulating seasonal influenza A H3N2 strains can cause severe disease and death in children in the apparent absence of associated bacterial infection or predisposing risk factors. This adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the burden of severe illness due to seasonal influenza A in childhood."

The first cullin-RING ligase discovered, yeast SCFCdc4, functions with the conjugating enzyme Cdc34 to regulate the cell cycle. Cdc34 orthologs are notable for their highly acidic C-terminal extension. Here we confirm that the Cdc34 acidic C-terminal tail has a role in Cdc34 binding to SCFCdc4 and makes a major contribution to the submicromolar Km of Cdc34 for SCFCdc4. Moreover, we demonstrate that a key functional property of the tail is its acidity. Our analysis also uncovers an unexpected new function for the acidic tail in promoting catalysis. We demonstrate that SCF is functional when Cdc34 is fused to the C terminus of Cul1 and that this fusion retains partial function even when the acidic tail has been deleted. The Cdc34-SCF fusion proteins that lack the acidic tail must interact in a fundamentally different manner than unfused SCF and wild type Cdc34, demonstrating that distinct mechanisms of E2 recruitment to E3, as is seen in nature, can sustain substrate ubiquitylation.

The ubiquitin-charged E2s engage ubiquitin ligases (E3) that recognize and bind to protein substrates targeted for ubiquitylation. This results in the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to substrate, either directly or via a covalent E3-ubiquitin intermediate. Subsequent ubiquitins can be attached to the ubiquitin conjugated to substrate to initiate formation of an ubiquitin chain. Transfer of at least four ubiquitins in the form of a polyubiquitin chain constitutes a signal for recognition by proteasomes and ensuing degradation (3.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M.

Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar), a seemingly daunting statistic for those who wish to understand molecular mechanisms of ubiquitylation. However, up to 350 of these ligases may belong to a single family called cullin-RING-ligases (CRLs) (4.Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev.

The C-terminal domain of Cdc53 binds Hrt1, whereas the N-terminal end of Cdc53 binds to Skp1, which binds to an array of different F-box proteins such as Cdc4. The x-ray structure of the cullin protein reveals an elongated, platform-like shape, such that the cullin acts as a scaffold that brings the F-box-substrate complex and the E2 into proximity (14.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 16.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The E2-conjugating enzyme for SCFCdc4 is a protein named Cdc34 (18.Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Although all of the E2s share a common catalytic domain that has a conserved sequence and structure, some of them have additional domains appended to either their N or C termini. In budding yeast, there are three E2s that have unique C-terminal extensions that are remarkable for the abundance of acidic residues in the amino acid sequence: Cdc34, Ubc8, and Rad6. However, the acidic tail of Cdc34 is much longer than the extension on Rad6 and is far more conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution than is the tail on Ubc8. For these reasons, Cdc34 stands alone in the E2 family for its unique acidic tail (supplemental Fig. S1). Mutants lacking all or part of the acidic tail have profound phenotypes by biochemical and genetic analysis. For instance, deletion of the acidic tail is lethal in yeast (19.Kolman C.J. Toth J. Gonda D.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20.Silver E.T. Gwozd T.J. Ptak C. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a Cdc34 null mutant can be rescued by grafting the acidic tail onto the E2 Rad6, suggesting that the function of the tail is portable (19.Kolman C.J. Toth J. Gonda D.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20.Silver E.T. Gwozd T.J. Ptak C. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GST pulldown assays with both wild type and tail-truncated yeast or human Cdc34 demonstrated that the acidic tail is likely involved in binding to SCF (21.Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22.Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a different study found no defect in SCF binding for a tail-truncated human Cdc34 mutant (23.Block K. Appikonda S. Lin H.R. Bloom J. Pagano M. Yew P.R. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but nevertheless tail deletion mutants of human Cdc34 have been reported to be extremely defective in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay (22.Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SCFCdc4 was the first CRL to be fully reconstituted in an in vitro ubiquitylation system, and SCF ligases remain the best understood members of the CRL family. Nevertheless, we still have only rudimentary insight into how the essential acidic tail of Cdc34 enables ubiquitylation of SCF substrates. To address this gap in our knowledge, we have taken an enzymological approach to understand the role of the acidic tail in Cdc34-SCF function. Our work extends previous observations that the Cdc34 tail is important for SCF binding and establishes that the acidity of the tail is its key functional attribute. We also provide evidence that the tail promotes ubiquitin transfer within the substrate-SCF-Cdc34·Ub Michaelis complex. Finally, we show that the acidic tail is not the only means by which Cdc34 can be productively tethered to SCF, a finding that has important implications for understanding the evolution of ubiquitylation mechanisms. Our results illustrate how kinetic analysis can provide important insights into the function of E2-E3 complexes. All of the Cdc34 coding sequences were amplified by PCR to encode a six-histidine tag at the C terminus and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Bacterial cell pellets were sonicated in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% detergent (Igepal CA-630 or Triton X-100), 10% glycerol, and proteasome inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C, and afterward the beads were briefly washed with lysis buffer. The beads were loaded into a disposable column, which was then washed with at least 10 column volumes of lysis buffer. His-tagged proteins were eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole. This sample was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (storage buffer). Fractions containing Cdc34 were pooled, concentrated, and then aliquoted before storage at −80 °C. Note that yeast Cdc34-Δ271–295 (RDB929), which lacks the distal 25 residues from the tail (for simplicity, we now refer to all Cdc34 truncation proteins by the final C-terminal position (i.e. Cdc34-Δ270)), has been shown to have activity comparable with full-length yeast Cdc34 (24.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (in the prior work Cdc34-Δ270 was referred to as Cdc34-ΔC). We initially chose to work with Cdc34-Δ270 because it is easier to purify and work with than the full-length protein. Cdc34-Δ230 (RDB2322), which was used as the starting point for analysis of a series of progressive tail truncations, has nearly the same activity as Cdc34-Δ270 (supplemental Fig. S2). Other yeast Cdc34 truncation proteins used in this study include: Cdc34-Δ225 (RDB2340), Cdc34-Δ220 (RDB2341), Cdc34-Δ210 (RDB2323), Cdc34-Δ205 (RDB2342), and Cdc34-Δ190 (RDB2343). Sequences encoding yeast acidic tail residues 171–270 were fused downstream of the GST coding region to generate RDB2344 (GST-YACT). GST fusion to the human acidic tail sequence comprised residues 175–238 (RDB2345) (GST-HACT). These proteins were expressed in and purified from E. coli cells. Briefly, bacterial cell pellets were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Clarified lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) resin for 2 h. The resin was washed with lysis buffer, followed by elution with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm glutathione. The purified protein was then equilibrated into storage buffer by gel filtration and then aliquoted for long term storage at −80 °C. Recombinant Cul1-Rbx1 was purified as previously described (25.Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used the split-n-co-express method for expression in E. coli, where the Cul1 subunit is divided and expressed as two fragments, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) (26.Li T. Pavletich N.P. Schulman B.A. Zheng N. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The NTD is expressed from a plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance (RDB2080), and the CTD is expressed along with GST-Rbx1 from a different plasmid with ampicillin resistance (RDB2081). These two plasmids were co-transformed into BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells. Transformants were cultured to an OD of ∼1.0, and expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Induction was carried out at 16 °C overnight. Bacterial pellets were lysed, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) resin for 2 h. The resin was washed with lysis buffer, followed by elution with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm glutathione. Thrombin was added to the eluate, and the proteolysis reaction was incubated at 4 °C overnight. This mixture was then loaded onto a HiTrap S HP ion exchange column and eluted by salt gradient (note that GST does not bind to this column). Fractions containing Cul1-Rbx1 were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column equilibrated in storage buffer. Fractions with Cul1-Rbx1 were concentrated, and the purified protein was frozen at −80 °C for long term storage. Cul1-Cdc34 fusion constructs were prepared using an E. coli expression system similar to the one described above. Sequences used for fusion assembly were derived from the human proteins. Wild type Cdc34 and Cdc34-Δ190 were fused to the C-terminal end of the CTD sequence using the amino acid sequence KGTREGKGSPEGKGTR as a linker between CTD and Cdc34. CTD-wild type and CTD-Cdc34-Δ190 were cloned into plasmids with chloramphenicol resistance (RDB2346 and RDB2347, respectively), whereas NTD and GST-Rbx1 were cloned into a plasmid with ampicillin resistance (RDB2348). Either the CTD-Cdc34 or the CTD-Cdc34-Δ190 plasmid was co-transformed with the plasmid encoding NTD and GST-Rbx1 into BL21(DE3) cells. The resulting transformants were used for protein expression. The fusion proteins were purified in an identical manner as for the CTD-NTD-Rbx1 complex, with the exception that anion exchange using a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) was used for the fusion constructs. Purified proteins were equilibrated into storage buffer by gel filtration and frozen at −80 °C for long term storage. Note that the activities of the fusion proteins, as well as the unfused human Cdc34 proteins, were negatively affected by multiple freeze-thaw cycles as well as long term storage (more than 1 month) at concentrations higher than 100 μm. G1-CDK and yeast SCF were expressed in insect cells by baculovirus infection as previously described (27.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Wild type Sic1 (RDB1706) was expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Stocks of purified 100 μm wild type Sic1 were equilibrated into storage buffer using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and frozen at −80 °C. Phosphorylation of Sic1 was performed in a similar manner as was previously described (27.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with the exception that the final concentration of 32P labeled wild type Sic1 was ∼12 μm. K48R ubiquitin was purified from E. coli expressing K48R ubiquitin coding sequences fused to GST coding sequences (RDB1882). The fusion protein contained a protein kinase A phosphorylation site immediately upstream of the ubiquitin N terminus and downstream of a TEV protease recognition site. Phosphorylation was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and protein kinase A for 1 h at 30 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by desalting with a G25 column (GE Healthcare). Afterward, TEV protease and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol were added, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, followed by heating at 65 °C for 15 min to inactivate TEV protease. The reaction was then cooled on ice for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min in an Eppendorf 5415D bench top centrifuge (this step pellets the denatured GST protein). The supernatant containing labeled K48R ubiquitin was collected and frozen at −20 °C. D77 ubiquitin (RDB2226) was purified by virtue of its histidine tag at the N terminus as previously described (25.Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). All of the ubiquitylation reactions were carried out in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (see figure legends for the time of reaction and the concentrations of the reaction components). Sic1 ubiquitylation reactions were quenched with reducing SDS-PAGE buffer and separated on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for analysis. Quantification was performed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) and plotted using Prism. The Km of Cdc34 for SCF reported in this study was substantially lower than that reported in a prior publication from this laboratory (25.Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is due to differing salt concentrations in the reactions. We have recently discovered that binding of Cdc34 to SCF (and thus the Km of Cdc34 for SCF) was exquisitely sensitive to salt (45.Kleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the maximal rates of Sic1 ubiquitylation reported here (2 min−1) are substantially slower than what we reported previously (12 min−1) (24.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This is due to inadvertent overestimation of Sic1 concentration in the prior study. The yeast proteome was scanned for protein sequences with acidic stretches using the following algorithm. A defined length of residues (between 15 and 25) was used as a sliding window over each protein sequence in the yeast proteome. If an acidic stretch of residues (defined as containing aspartate or glutamate residues in greater than 60, 70, or 80% of the positions within the window) was encountered at least once during this process, this protein is counted once, and the next sequence was analyzed. Therefore, the total possible number of hits can be no greater than the number of protein sequences in the data base (5,862 protein sequences). To determine the statistical significance of the results, the sequence of each protein was randomized and then analyzed for the presence of acidic stretches using identical criteria as above. This process was repeated 10 times for each sequence in the proteome. This was used to estimate the expected value of acidic stretches for each protein sequence where the expectation is the average number of hits for all 10 randomized sequences. Therefore, the expectation for each sequence will have a range between 0 and 1. The expected value of the number of proteins from the proteome is the total sum of the individual expectations. The entire process was repeated three times. These estimates were then used to calculate the means and standard deviations of the expected values (supplemental Table S1). The proteomic search was done using custom PERL software. Deletion of the acidic tail of human Cdc34 results in a severe loss of Cdc34-SCF activity in an “autoubiquitylation” assay (22.Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This loss of activity can be explained by one of three possible hypotheses. First, deletion of the tail may affect binding of Cdc34 to SCF. Second, tail deletion may result in a loss of catalytic activity of the Cdc34-SCF complex. Finally, the acidic tail of Cdc34 may confer both binding and catalytic properties to the conjugating enzyme. Prior pulldown studies in yeast have pointed to a role for the acidic tail in binding to SCF (21.Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22.Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this conclusion was supported by a biochemical study of human Cdc34 that utilized autoubiquitylation as a functional read-out (22.Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent analysis of p27 ubiquitylation by human Cdc34 concluded that the acidic tail is dispensable for binding to SCF and instead appears to play a catalytic function (23.Block K. Appikonda S. Lin H.R. Bloom J. Pagano M. Yew P.R. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To deconvolve the functions of the acidic tail, we sought to measure its quantitative contribution to the kinetic parameters of ubiquitylation with an authentic substrate. We began our investigation by comparing the activities of yeast Cdc34-Δ270 and Cdc34-Δ190. Cdc34-Δ270 lacks the distal 25 amino acids of the tail but retains multiple highly acidic stretches, is fully active in vitro (24.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and supplies CDC34 function in vivo. Cdc34-Δ190 lacks ∼85% of the tail (which starts approximately at residue 171), including the major acidic stretches, and is unable to supply Cdc34 function in vivo. The assay we employed was a steady-state di-ubiquitin synthesis assay (28.Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), a key advantage of which is that it can be used to assess both SCF-independent and SCF-dependent activities for Cdc34. Radiolabeled K48R ubiquitin was added to reactions containing E1, Cdc34, and ATP in either the presence or the absence of SCF. Because Cdc34 forms Lys48 ubiquitin chains with high specificity, K48R ubiquitin can form thioesters with Cdc34 but will not attack Cdc34·ubiquitin thioesters. Once Cdc34 was charged fully with the K48R ubiquitin, the reactions were initiated by the addition of unlabeled D77 ubiquitin, which cannot form thioesters with E2 because the terminal glycine residue is blocked but is nevertheless able to attack Cdc34·ubiquitin thioesters because Lys48 remains intact. The product appears in the form of radiolabeled D77-K48R di-ubiquitin. Using a concentration of both Cdc34-Δ270 and Cdc34-Δ190 (2 μm) that was sufficient for Δ270 to saturate SCF, we measured the rate of di-ubiquitin synthesis in both the presence and the absence of SCFCdc4 (for simplicity, we will refer to SCFCdc4 hereafter as SCF unless noted otherwise). Both Cdc34-Δ270 and Cdc34-Δ190 formed di-ubiquitin with nearly identical rates (Fig. 1, A and B). The addition of SCF stimulated Cdc34-Δ270 activity by ∼30-fold (Fig. 1C). In stark contrast, the rate of di-ubiquitin formed by Cdc34-Δ190 was not enhanced at all by SCF (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that although deletion of the acidic tail had no effect on the SCF-independent catalytic activity of Cdc34, it completely vitiated the SCF-enhanced boost in activity that was observed for Cdc34-Δ270. Prior work has demonstrated that the C-terminal tail of Cdc34 is both necessary and sufficient for binding SCF in a pulldown assay (21.Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We next sought to test whether this binding is sufficient to inhibit SCF activity. Titration of GST yeast tail into Sic1 ubiquitylation reactions resulted in the nearly complete inhibition of product formation at 200 μm GST-tail (Fig. 2) with an IC50 of 16 ± 6 μm. Note that inhibition was not an artifact of the high concentration of protein because 200 μm GST had no obvious effect on Sic1 ubiquitylation. This result is consistent with the observation that the acidic tail is important for Cdc34 function (21.Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and furthermore indicates that the function of the tail cannot be supplied in trans. Our next goal was to characterize Cdc34-Δ270 and Cdc34-Δ190 by measuring the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for these E2s. To accomplish this, E2 was titrated into multi-turnover Sic1 ubiquitylation reactions. The initial rate of Sic1 ubiquitylation (defined as molecules of substrate modified with one or more ubiquitins as a function of time) was plotted against Cdc34 concentration, and data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. If Cdc34 is in rapid equilibrium with SCF relative to the rate of ubiquitin transfer, the Km may be interpreted as a pseudo equilibrium binding constant between E2 and enzyme. Because numerous ubiquitin molecules may be transferred to substrate during the time course of a reaction, it is important to note that kcat, the maximum rate of Sic1 ubiquitylation, is a function of all the first order rate constants, including the ubiquitin transfer rate and product dissociation, and cannot be simply interpreted as the rate of the chemical step. However, it seems very unlikely that tail truncation would affect the dissociation of ubiquitylated product from SCF, and thus any reduction in kcat (as well as a reduction in the number of ubiquitins attached per substrate when E2 is saturating SCF) is likely to be indicative of a defect in catalysis. We first measured Km and kcat for Cdc34-Δ230, which has nearly the same activity for Sic1 ubiquitylation as Cdc34-Δ270 (supplemental Fig. S2). Cdc34-Δ230 had a Km of ∼160 nm and a kcat of ∼3 min−1 (Fig. 3, A and G). Saturating concentrations of Cdc34-Δ230 resulted in highly ubiquitylated products that barely migrated into the SDS-PAGE gel. To complement the Km determination, we also measured the intracellular concentration of Cdc34 by a combination of quantitative immunoblotting and quantitative fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S3). Cdc34 was present at ∼10 μm in the nucleus and 2.9 μm in the cytoplasm. It should be noted that Km was measured at 50 mm NaCl, and interactio"
https://openalex.org/W2031547130,"Ski is an oncoprotein that negatively regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. It acts as a transcriptional co-repressor by binding to TGF-beta signaling molecules, Smads. Efficient TGF-beta signaling is facilitated by rapid proteasome-mediated degradation of Ski by TGF-beta. Here we report that Ski is phosphorylated by Akt/PKB kinase. Akt phosphorylates Ski on a highly conserved Akt motif at threonine 458 both in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of Ski at threonine 458 is induced by Akt pathway activators including insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and hepatocyte growth factor. The phosphorylation of Ski causes its destabilization and reduces Ski-mediated inhibition of expression of another negative regulator of TGF-beta, Smad7. Induction of Smad7 levels leads to inactivation of TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta signaling cascade, as indicated by reduced induction of TGF-beta target p15. Therefore, Akt modulates TGF-beta signaling by temporarily adjusting the levels of two TGF-beta pathway negative regulators, Ski and Smad7. These novel findings demonstrate that Akt pathway activation directly impacts TGF-beta pathway."

N-Arachidonylglycine (NAGly) is an endogenous inhibitor of GLYT2 with little or no effect on GLYT1 and is analgesic in rat models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Understanding the molecular basis of NAGly interactions with GLYT2 may allow for the development of novel therapeutics. In this study, chimeric transporters were used to determine the structural basis for differences in NAGly sensitivity between GLYT1 and GLYT2 and also the actions of a series of related N-arachidonyl amino acids. Extracellular loops 2 and 4 of GLYT2 are important in the selective inhibition of GLYT2 by NAGly and by the related compounds N-arachidonyl-γ-aminobutyric acid and N-arachidonyl-d-alanine, whereas only the extracellular loop 4 of GLYT2 is required for N-arachidonyl-l-alanine inhibition of transport. These observations suggest that the structure of the head group of these compounds is important in determining how they interact with extracellular loops 2 and 4 of GLYT2.

Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous processes that influence glycine transporter function may also provide leads in the development of novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of pain.

Molecular Pain. 2007; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the actions of NAGly on the glycine transporter GLYT2 and found that it inhibits GLYT2 with an IC50 of 3 μm, with little or no activity at GLYT1 or the GABA transporter GAT1 at concentrations up to 100 μm (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, NAGly may be considered an endogenous inhibitor of GLYT2 that has the capacity to modulate nociception. It is of interest to understand the molecular basis of NAGly/GLYT2 interactions to further develop the analgesic potential of this class of compounds. N-arachidonylglycine extracellular loop N-arachidonyl-γ-aminobutyric acid N-arachidonyl-d-alanine N-arachidonyl-amino acid N-arachidonyl-l-alanine. Glycine transporters are members of the neurotransmitter Na+ symporter family of transporters that includes transporters for GABA, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (11.Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a bacterial homolog of this family, LeuTAa, has recently been determined in the presence and absence of a noncompetitive blocker, clomipramine (12.Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 13.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). There are two lines of evidence that suggest that extracellular loops 2 and 4 may play important roles in formation of noncompetitive inhibitor binding sites. First, one of the crucial changes in the structure of LeuTAa when bound to clomipramine is that extracellular loop 4 (EL4) is displaced relative to the structure in the absence of the inhibitor (12.Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 13.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Second, it has previously been demonstrated that Zn2+ ions noncompetitively inhibit glycine transport by GLYT1, and histidine residues located on extracellular loops 2 and 4 have been shown to mediate these effects (14.Ju P. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22983-22991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests that restrictions or alterations in the movement of these extracellular loops may provide a mechanism for inhibiting glycine transport. GLYT2 contains a significantly larger extracellular loop 2 (EL2) than GLYT1 (supplemental Fig. 1), and we hypothesized that this loop may contain structural features that mediate the actions of NAGly. In this study, we demonstrate that EL2 and EL4 of GLYT2 are required for NAGly inhibition. The related compound N-arachidonyl-l-alanine (NALAla) also inhibits GLYT2, but although EL4 of GLYT2 is required for this activity, EL2 is not. We also investigated the specificity of interactions by utilizing the additional related compounds N-arachidonyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (NAGABA) and N-archidonyl-d-alanine (NADAla). Furthermore, we have shown that the GLYT2 EL4 residues Arg531, Lys532, and Ile545 influence NAGly and NALAla sensitivity. The structures of the N-arachidonyl-amino acids (NAAAs) used in this study are depicted (see Fig. 1A). NAGly, NALAla, and NAGABA were obtained from Cayman Chemical Company. Synthesis of the d-alanine analogue was performed using a procedure adapted from Bezuglov et al. (15.Bezuglov V. Bobrov M. Gretskaya N. Gonchar A. Zinchenko G. Melck D. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Kuklev D. Rossi J.C. Vidal J.P. Durand T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This involved initial formation of the mixed anhydride derived from arachidonic acid and isobutyl chloroformate in acetonitrile at 0 °C followed by reaction with the d-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride. Saponification of the ester provided the desired compound in modest yield as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see supplemental data for a more detailed description). All NAAAs were stored at −20 °C in ethanol, and stocks were diluted on the day of use and kept on ice. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega Industries Ltd. QIAprep Miniprep and QIAquick Spin kits were obtained from Qiagen. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. GLYT1 and GLYT2 transporters were used to construct chimeric transporters in which EL2 and/or EL4 were switched. A variation of the fusion PCR technique, described by Shevchuk et al. (16.Shevchuk N.A. Bryksin A.V. Nusinovich Y.A. Cabello F.C. Sutherland M. Ladisch S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e19Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), was used. Supplemental Table 1 shows the DNA sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to construct the chimeras. Briefly, PCR amplification of fragments of GLYT1 and GLYT2 were performed using tailed oligonucleotides to introduce sequences homologous to GLYT2 or GLYT1, respectively, at the desired chimeric junction sites. Individual fragments were “fused” together in a separate reaction, with the overlapping homologous regions of each fragment serving as priming sites for elongation by DNA polymerase (see supplemental Fig. 2). The resulting chimeras were then amplified with oligonucleotides containing restriction enzyme recognition sites to facilitate subcloning into pOTV (oocyte transcription vector) (17.Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the junction sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fig. 1B is a schematic diagram of the predicted topology of each of the chimeras. Chimeras are named according to the parent transporter with the region switched in brackets. For example, GLYT2(EL4) refers to a chimera that is derived from GLYT2 but contains EL4 from GLYT1, and GLYT1(EL2) refers to a chimera that is derived from GLYT1, with EL2 from GLYT2. All residues in EL4 of GLYT2 that differed from GLYT1 were mutated to the corresponding residue in GLYT1. Eleven mutations in GLYT2 were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) including E530H, R531L, K532G, N534D, I535V, E536S, N537R, Q541H, I545L, V549A, and R556L. The wild type, chimera, and point mutation cDNAs were linearized with SpeI and cRNA transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and capped with 5′-7-methyl guanosine using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc.). Oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis, as previously described (18.Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with all procedures in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the prevention of cruelty to animals. 50 nl of cRNA was injected into defoliculated, stage V oocytes and incubated at 16 °C in standard frog ringers solution (ND96; 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 μg/ml gentamicin. 2–5 days later, glycine and sarcosine transport current recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADI Instruments, Sydney, Australia) using Chart software (ADI Instruments). Concentration-dependent glycine and sarcosine transport current measurements were fitted to an equation derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation, I/Imax=[substrate]/([substrate]+EC50)(Eq. 1) where I is the current, Imax is the current produced by a maximal concentration of substrate, and EC50 is the concentration of substrate required to produce half-maximal response. NAGly, NALAla and NAGABA inhibit GLYT2 with little or no activity on GLYT1 (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The actions of these compounds and also of NADAla on the chimeric transporters were assessed by applying a fixed concentration of glycine at approximately the EC50 for the particular transporter together with the NAAA at concentrations up to 30 μm. It was not possible to use higher concentrations of the NAAAs because of the capacity of these compounds to form micelles at higher concentrations and to cause irreversible changes in the resting current of the oocyte. The concentration response data were fitted to Equation 2, I/Imax=1-([NAAA]/([NAAA]+IC50))+C(Eq. 2) where IC50 is the concentration at which half maximal inhibition by the NAAA tested is produced, and C is the fraction of current remaining in the presence of a maximal concentration of inhibitor. IC30 values are presented because complete inhibition was not achieved for a number of chimeras at concentrations up to 30 μm. If the estimated IC30 value is greater than 30 μm, then it is presented as >30 μm. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis for the differences in NAAA inhibition between the human glycine transporters GLYT1 and GLYT2. We have previously established that NAGly inhibits GLYT2 and suggested that it is a noncompetitive inhibitor of transport (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have characterized the noncompetitive nature of the inhibition more fully by measuring the glycine concentration dependent transport currents mediated by GLYT2 in the presence of varying NAGly concentrations. Although the Imax for glycine transport is reduced by NAGly in a concentration-dependent manner, the EC50 for glycine transport currents is not changed for the different NAGly concentrations (Fig. 2). Thus, NAGly is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT2. We have focused on the role of EL2 and EL4 in determining differences in NAAA sensitivity by creating chimeric transporters in which EL2, EL4, or both loops are switched between GLYT1 and GLYT2 (Fig. 1B). Application of glycine to oocytes expressing GLYT2, GLYT2(EL2), and GLYT2(EL4) generates glycine concentration dependent transport currents (Fig. 3A). EC50 values for glycine transport currents mediated by GLYT2(EL2) and GLYT2(EL4) are similar to GLYT2 (Table 1). Application of up to 3 mm glycine to oocytes expressing the double chimera GLYT2(EL2,EL4) do not generate measurable currents, and this chimera was not further characterized. Sarcosine (N-methyl-glycine), a GLYT1 selective substrate (19.Guastella J. Brecha N. Weigmann C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, EL2 and EL4 of GLYT1 do not appear to play a role in substrate selectivity.TABLE 1The EC50 of substrate and IC30 values (±S.E.) for NAAA inhibition of glycine transport by wild type and chimeric transportersTransporterEC50IC30GlycineSarcosineNAGlyNALAlaNADAlaNAGABAμmμmGLYT218 ± 23.4 ± 0.65.9 ± 0.717 ± 222 ± 4GLYT2(EL2)19 ± 228 ± 46 ± 1>30>30GLYT2(EL4)24 ± 2>30>30>30>30GLYT122 ± 213 ± 1>30>30>30>30GLYT1(EL4)139 ± 2228 ± 11>3021 ± 2>3035 ± 9GLYT1(EL2,EL4)176 ± 8209 ± 8>3022 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Application of glycine to oocytes expressing either GLYT1(EL4) or GLYT1(EL2,EL4) generates concentration dependent transport currents that are similar to wild type GLYT1 (Fig. 3B). Application of up to 3 mm glycine to GLYT1(EL2) generates very small currents that are too unreliable to accurately characterize. The EC50 values for glycine transport currents mediated by GLYT1(EL4) and GLYT1(EL2,EL4) are increased by ∼7-fold compared with both GLYT1 and GLYT2 (Fig. 3B and Table 1). The GLYT1-selective substrate, sarcosine, generates transport currents for GLYT1, GLYT1(EL4), and GLYT1(EL2,EL4) but not for GLYT2 and the GLYT2-based chimeras (Table 1). These results indicate that switching the EL2 and EL4 between GLYT1 and GLYT2 does not influence relative substrate selectivity but does moderately reduce the affinity of substrates in the GLYT1-based chimeras. NAGly, NALAla, and NAGABA inhibit GLYT2 but have little or no activity at GLYT1 at concentrations up to 100 μm (Table 1) (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Glycine was applied to GLYT2- and the GLYT2-based chimeras at approximately the EC50 concentration (30 μm) for each transporter followed by co-application of glycine with the NAAAs at concentrations up to 30 μm. We did not test concentrations above 30 μm, as the holding current at −60 mV does not remain stable, which may be due to the formation of micelles by the NAAAs. Upon washout of NAAAs for 2 min, reapplication of glycine generated transport currents that were similar to control transport currents measured prior to NAAA application (data not shown). Glycine transport by GLYT2 is inhibited by NAGly (Fig. 4, A and B), NALAla (Fig. 5A and B), and NAGABA (Table 1) in a concentration-dependent manner with IC30 values of 3.4 ± 0.6 μm; 5.9 ± 0.7 μm; and 22 ± 4 μm, respectively. The four NAAAs do not affect glycine transport by GLYT1 with IC30 values >30 μm. We tested the activity of the NAAAs on the chimeric transporters to identify domains responsible for conferring this differential sensitivity. GLYT2(EL2) showed reduced sensitivity to NAGly and NAGABA, with IC30 values of 28 ± 4 μm (Fig. 4B) and >30 μm (Table 1) respectively, compared with wild type GLYT2. In contrast, NALAla inhibits glycine transport by GLYT2(EL2) with similar potency to that for GLYT2 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that EL2 of GLYT2 is important for NAGly and NAGABA selectivity but not for NALAla.FIGURE 5The effect of NALAla on both wild type and chimeric transporters.

C, NALAla concentration-dependent modulation of glycine transport currents for GLYT1 (●), GLYT1(EL4) (▴), and GLYT1(EL2,EL4) (◇), respectively (n ≥5/curve). In the cases of GLYT1(EL4) and GLYT1(EL2,EL4), the glycine concentration used was 200 μm and 300 μm, respectively. For most concentration response curves, the S.E. errors were smaller than the symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The differential sensitivity of the GLYT2(EL2) chimera to NAGly, NALAla, and NAGABA suggests that the conformation and size of the head group of these compounds may play an important role in their ability to bind to GLYT2. The carboxyl groups of NAGly and NAGABA may have the capacity to adopt a larger range of conformations than the carboxyl group of NALAla due to its chiral center, which may impose constraints on the orientation of the head group. To investigate the role of the head group in determining the specificity of the interactions with the wild type and chimeric transporters, we synthesized NADAla and tested its activity. NADAla inhibits GLYT2 with an IC30 of 17 ± 2 μm and does not inhibit glycine transport by GLYT1 (Table 1). We also tested this compound on the GLYT1 and GLYT2 chimeric transporters and found that although NADAla has a reduced affinity for the transporters, it has a similar profile to NAGly; it did not inhibit glycine transport by GLYT2(EL2) or GLYT2(EL4) (Table 1). These results are in contrast to those obtained with NALAla, which only appears to interact with EL4 of GLYT2 and indicates that the position of the head group is important for interactions between the NAAAs and EL2. Glycine was applied to GLYT1, GLYT1(EL4), and GLYT1(EL2,EL4) at approximately the EC50 for each transporter (30 μm, 200 μm, and 300 μm, respectively) followed by co-application of glycine with the NAAAs at concentrations up to 30 μm. None of the four NAAAs tested affect glycine transport by wild type GLYT1 (Table 1). We then investigated whether the insertion of EL2 and/or EL4 from GLYT2 into GLYT1 could introduce NAAA sensitivity. The GLYT1(EL4) chimera maintains similar sensitivity to NAGly and NADAla as GLYT1 (no activity), but is inhibited by NALAla and NAGABA, albeit with reduced potency to that of GLYT2 (Fig. 5C and Table 1). We did not test the effects of the NAAAs on the GLYT1(EL2) chimera because we could not measure reliable glycine transport currents. However, the GLYT1(EL2,EL4) double chimera behaved in a similar manner to GLYT1(EL4); it is insensitive to NAGly (Fig. 4C) but is inhibited by NALAla (Fig. 5C). NADAla and NAGABA were not tested on GLYT1(EL2,EL4) because their potency is lower than NAGly and NALAla, and any changes in the small glycine currents by GLYT1(EL2,EL4) would be too small to measure accurately. The results from the GLYT2 and GLYT1 chimera studies demonstrate that EL4 of GLYT2 is important for NAGly, NALAla, NAGABA, and NADAla selectivity, whereas EL2 of GLYT2 is required for NAGly, NAGABA, and NADAla selectivity but not NALAla. We have focused our mutation studies on the EL4 domain of GLYT2 for a number of reasons. First, NAGly, NALAla, NADAla, and NAGABA all interact with EL4 of GLYT2, whereas not all of the NAAAs interact with EL2. Second, EL4 has also been implicated in the mechanism of inhibition of transport by other transporters including the bacterial homolog, LeuTAa (12.Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22.Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E.

Science. 2007; 317: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and appears to play an important role in NAAA GLYT2 selectivity. Third, the GLYTs share 60% amino acid sequence identity in EL4 with the most diverse region being EL4a compared with EL4b (Fig. 6A). In contrast, EL2 is very divergent between GLYT1 and GLYT2 and is considerably larger in GLYT2 than GLYT1 (see supplemental Fig. 1). To identify the residues in EL4 that play a role in determining the differential sensitivity of GLYT2 compared with GLYT1, 11 mutations in GLYT2 were constructed: E530H, R531L, K532G, N534D, I535V, E536S, N537R, Q541H, I545L, V549A, and R556L. All residues in EL4 of GLYT2 that differed from GLYT1 were mutated to the corresponding residue in GLYT1 (Fig. 6A). The 11 GLYT2 EL4 point mutations transported glycine in a concentration-dependent manner similar to GLYT2 (Table 2) and did not transport 1 mm sarcosine. Therefore, these mutations do not appear to affect substrate transport affinity or selectivity.TABLE 2The EC50 of glycine and IC30 values (±S.E.) for NAGly and NALAla inhibition of glycine transport by wild type and GLYT2 EL4 mutant transportersTransporterEC50 of glycineIC30NAGlyNALAlaμmμmGLYT218 ± 23.4 ± 0.65.9 ± 0.7GLYT122 ± 2>30>30E530H11.2 ± 0.92.1 ± 0.7R531L10 ± 413 ± 214 ± 1K532G39 ± 29 ± 112 ± 1N534D19 ± 25 ± 1I535V13 ± 22.2 ± 0.4E536S13 ± 32.3 ± 0.5N537R10 ± 14.9 ± 1.5Q541H12.7 ± 0.82.6 ± 0.4I545L8.4 ± 0.842 ± 721 ± 1V549A9 ± 11.3 ± 0.2R556L6 ± 18 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Glycine was applied to the mutant transporters at approximately the EC50 for each transporter (30 μm) followed by co-application of glycine with NAGly at concentrations up to 30 μm. Glycine transport by eight of the mutants was inhibited by NAGly similar to GLYT2 (Table 2). R531L and K532G had reduced sensitivity to NAGly (IC30 values of 13 ± 2 μm and 9 ± 1 μm, respectively) compared with GLYT2 (IC30; 3.4 ± 0.6 μm), whereas I545L had markedly reduced sensitivity to NAGly with an IC30 value of >30 μm (Fig. 6B). R531L, K532G, and I545L were further investigated by determining their sensitivity to NALAla (Fig. 6C). R531L, K532G, and I545L had reduced sensitivities to NALAla with IC30 values of 14 ± 1 μm, 12 ± 1 μm, and 21 ± 1 μm, respectively, compared with GLYT2 (IC30; 5.9 ± 0.7 μm). Therefore, the GLYT2 residues Arg531, Lys532, and Ile545 are required for NAGly and NALAla inhibition of GLYT2. There have been limited studies on how lipids interact with and modulate the functions of neurotransmitter transporters. NAGly, NALAla, and NAGABA have previously been shown to inhibit GLYT2 with a rank order of potency of NAGly ≥ NALAla > NAGABA (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with little or no activity at GLYT1. In this study, we have utilized chimeric transporters to demonstrate that EL2 and EL4 contain molecular determinants that are responsible for NAAA sensitivity of GLYT2. Furthermore, point mutations in EL4 of GLYT2 demonstrate that the EL4 residues Arg531, Lys532, and Ile545 are required for NAGly inhibition. I545L is a relatively conservative mutation, and yet, it shows the most marked changes in NAGly affinity. In most other transporters in this family, the corresponding residue is a leucine. Interestingly, we have previously shown that NAGly does not inhibit GAT1 (10.Wiles A.L. Pearlman R.J. Rosvall M. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and GAT1 also contains a leucine residue at this position. Thus, an isoleucine for leucine difference may play a crucial role in determining how NAGly interacts with the transporter. At this stage, it is difficult to explain why such a conservative mutation causes the most marked changes. Two possibilities are: first, NAGly may bind to Ile545, and the I545L mutation may distort the way that NAGly fits into the binding site; or second, Ile545 is located at the apex of the EL4 loop, and the I545L mutation may alter the conformation of the two arms of EL4 (Fig. 7), which then impacts on the way that this domain interacts with other elements that may be crucial for NAGly binding. The other two residues identified in this study, Arg531 and Lys532, are located at the edge of EL4. It is possible that the carboxyl groups of the NAAAs may interact with these positively charged residues. Further structural studies will be required to fully characterize the specific interaction sites between the NAAAs and GLYT2. The four NAAAs used in this study have the same lipid core structure combined with subtle variations in the head group. The different head groups influence potency of the compounds and also their specificity for the various chimeric transporters. The studies with the GLYT2-based chimeras are the most informative because it is possible to selectively knock out the activity of some of the NAAAs but not all. The inhibitory activity of NAGly, NADAla, and NAGABA on GLYT2(EL2) was greatly reduced compared with wild type GLYT2, which suggests that EL2 contains important binding determinants for these compounds. However, NALAla inhibits GLYT2(EL2) with similar potency to that of GLYT2. In contrast, the inhibitory activity of all four NAAAs is abolished in the GLYT2(EL4) chimera. Thus, EL4 of GLYT2 contains molecular determinants that are required for all four of the NAAAs, whereas EL2 is important for NAGly, NADAla, and NAGABA binding but not NALAla. The differential sensitivity of the GLYT2 chimeras to NALAla and NADAla and the reduced affinity of NADAla are intriguing. The only difference between NALAla and NADAla is the chiral center within the head group, which appears to be crucial in determining interactions with EL2. The chiral center of the two compounds influences the orientation of the carboxyl group relative to the methyl group of the alanine moiety, which may then impact on the way in which the inhibitor fits into the binding site. The different orientation may result in the carboxyl group adopting different positions and thereby interacting with GLYT2 in a different manner. The binding could also be influenced by interactions between the methyl group and hydrophobic residues and or pockets. EL2 and EL4 have previously been implicated in forming noncompetitive inhibitor binding sites in GLYT1 (14.Ju P. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22983-22991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and also the related bacterial leucine transporter, LeuTAa(12,23), which suggests that the conformation and flexibility of these domains may contribute to a general mechanism for noncompetitive inhibition of this class of transporters. Glycine transporters are predicted to share a similar structure to LeuTAa with the core protein consisting of transmembrane domains 1–10, and are also predicted to share similar mechanisms of transport and inhibition. The crystal structure of LeuTAa in complex with the noncompetitive inhibitor clomipramine reveals possible mechanisms of transport inhibition that may apply to NAGly inhibition of GLYT2 (12.Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). There are at least three conformational states of the transporter: open-to-outside, occluded, and open-to-inside (12.Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The open-to-outside and open-to-inside states of the transporter are controlled by the extracellular and intracellular gates, respectively. Clomipramine inhibits the transporter by stabilizing the occluded state through interactions with EL4, as well as transmembrane domains 1, 3, 6, and 10. In the clomipramine-bound state of LeuTAa, the tip of EL4 is displaced, and this is thought to contribute to the inhibitory mechanism. The isoleucine residue in EL4 of GLYT2 (Ile545) that is crucial for NAGly inhibition is two residues from the tip of EL4 (Fig. 7). If the formation of an occluded state in GLYT2 is generated by a similar process to LeuTAa, then it is possible that NAAAs interactions with EL4 inhibit glycine transport through a similar mechanism. Tryptophan is a competitive inhibitor of LeuTAa and traps the transporter in an open-to-out conformation (22.Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Singh et al. (22.Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of LeuTAa in complex with tryptophan and identified four separate tryptophan molecules in the crystal structure. This may represent transient binding sites of the inhibitor, and possibly even the substrate, that form part of the transport pathway from the extracellular space to the primary binding site located in the center of the transporter. Interestingly, one of these tryptophan molecules is bound in a pocket formed by EL2 and EL4. This result emphasizes that EL2 and EL4 are indeed in close proximity in LeuTAa, but also that if similar structures exist in GLYT2, then the NAAAs may sit in a similar cleft in GLYT2. By analogy with the tryptophan model for inhibition of LeuTAa, the NAAAs may inhibit GLYT2 by binding to EL2 and EL4, thereby restricting the movement of the transporter and hence substrate translocation. Furthermore, the role of EL2 and EL4 in forming a possible inhibitor/substrate permeation pathway may explain why the GLYT1(EL4) and GLYT1(EL2,EL4) chimeras have reduced affinity for substrates. In summary, we have used a series of chimeric GLYT transporters to demonstrate that NAGly, NALAla, NADAla and NAGABA interact with EL4 of GLYT2, while only NAGly, NADAla and NAGABA interact with EL2 of GLYT2. The subtly different structural requirements for NALAla inhibition of transport highlights the role of different conformations of the head groups of these lipid modulators in determining how they bind to GLYT2. We also tested a series of EL4 mutants to demonstrate that the GLYT2 residues Ile545, Arg531 and Lys532 are required for NAGly and NALAla inhibition of GLYT2. This study is the first to describe the molecular determinants for lipid modulation of neurotransmitter transporters and further work may develop the therapeutic potential of this class of compounds.

https://openalex.org/W2085351326,"Apoptosis is controlled by a signaling equilibrium between prosurvival and proapoptotic pathways, such that unwanted apoptosis is avoided, but when required it occurs rapidly and efficiently. Many apoptosis regulators display dual roles, depending upon whether a cell has received an apoptotic stimulus or not. Here, we identify a novel and unexpected function for X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) that occurs when apoptosis is triggered under physiological conditions. We show that in response to loss of survival signals provided by cell adhesion, endogenous XIAP translocates from the cytosol into a mitochondrial 400-kDa complex and that this occurs very early in the apoptosis process. Membrane-associated XIAP induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization leading to cytochrome c and Smac release, which is dependent on Bax and Bak. Thus, although XIAP suppresses apoptosis in healthy cells, our data indicate that XIAP may contribute to it in response to a proapoptotic signal such as loss of extracellular matrix-dependent survival signaling. We suggest that, as with Bcl-2 family proteins, more diverse functions for XIAP exist than previously identified. Moreover, switching the function of proteins from anti- to proapoptotic forms may be a common theme in the efficient execution of cell death."

The “minor” breakpoint in Ph+ ALL encodes p185BCR/ABL from der22 and p96ABL/BCR from der9. The “major” breakpoint in CML encodes p210BCR/ABL and p40ABL/BCR. Herein, we investigated the leukemogenic potential of the der9-associated p96ABL/BCR and p40ABL/BCR fusion proteins and their roles in the lineage commitment of hematopoietic stem cells in comparison to BCR/ABL. Methodology All t(9;22) derived proteins were retrovirally expressed in murine hematopoietic stem cells (SL cells) and human umbilical cord blood cells (UCBC). Stem cell potential was determined by replating efficiency, colony forming - spleen and competitive repopulating assays. The leukemic potential of the ABL/BCR fusion proteins was assessed by in a transduction/transplantation model. Effects on the lineage commitment and differentiation were investigated by culturing the cells under conditions driving either myeloid or lymphoid commitment. Expression of key factors of the B-cell differentiation and components of the preB-cell receptor were determined by qRT-PCR. Principal Findings Both p96ABL/BCR and p40ABL/BCR increased proliferation of early progenitors and the short term stem cell capacity of SL-cells and exhibited own leukemogenic potential. Interestingly, BCR/ABL gave origin exclusively to a myeloid phenotype independently from the culture conditions whereas p96ABL/BCR and to a minor extent p40ABL/BCR forced the B-cell commitment of SL-cells and UCBC. Conclusions/Significance Our here presented data establish the reciprocal ABL/BCR fusion proteins as second oncogenes encoded by the t(9;22) in addition to BCR/ABL and suggest that ABL/BCR contribute to the determination of the leukemic phenotype through their influence on the lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2025146318,"Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), a 200 kDa protein, is an essential virulence factor for Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium that causes whooping cough. ACT is a member of the pore-forming RTX (repeats-in-toxin) family of proteins that share a characteristic calcium-binding motif of Gly- and Asp-rich nonapeptide repeats and a marked cytolytic or cytotoxic activity. In addition, ACT exhibits a distinctive feature: it has an N-terminal calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase domain. Translocation of this domain into the host cytoplasm results in uncontrolled production of cAMP, and it has classically been assumed that this surge in cAMP is the basis for the toxin-mediated killing. Several members of the RTX family of toxins, including ACT, have been shown to induce intracellular calcium increases, through different mechanisms. We show here that ACT stimulates a raft-mediated calcium influx, through its cAMP production activity, that activates PKA, which in turn activates calcium channels with L-type properties. This process is shown to occur both in CD11b(+) and CD11b(-) cells, suggesting a common mechanism, independent of the toxin receptor. We also show that this ACT-induced calcium influx does not correlate with the toxin-induced cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2167911314,"Parkin is a multidomain E3 ligase associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease. The N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubld) of parkin functions with the S5a proteasomal subunit, positioning substrate proteins for degradation. In addition the parkin Ubld recruits the endocytotic protein Eps15, allowing the E3 ligase to ubiquinate Eps15 distal from its parkin-interacting site. The recognition sequences in the S5a subunit and Eps15 for the parkin Ubld are ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM). Each protein has two UIM sequences separated by a 50-residue spacer in S5a, but only ∼5 residues in Eps15. In this work we used NMR spectroscopy to determine how the parkin Ubld recognizes the proteasomal subunit S5a compared with Eps15, a substrate for ubiquitination. We show that Eps15 contains two flexible α-helices each encompassing a UIM sequence. The α-helix surrounding UIM II is longer than that for UIM I, a situation that is reversed from S5a. Furthermore, we show the parkin Ubld preferentially binds to UIM I in the S5a subunit. This interaction is strongly diminished in a K48A substitution, found near the center of the S5a interacting surface on the parkin Ubld. In contrast to S5a, parkin recruits Eps15 using both its UIM sequences resulting in a larger interaction surface that includes residues from β1 and β2, not typically known to interact with UIM sequences. These results show that the parkin Ubld uses differential surfaces to recruit UIM regions from the S5a proteasomal subunit compared with Eps15 involved in cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2065406942,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function, widely used to treat excessive bone resorption associated with bone metastases, that also have anti-tumor activity. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) represents a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. ZOL is the most potent nitrogen-containing BPs, and it inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. Recently we demonstrated that accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and the consequent formation of a new type of ATP analog (ApppI) after mevalonate pathway inhibition by nitrogen-containing BPs strongly correlates with ZOL-induced cell death in cancer cells in vitro. In this study we show that ZOL-induced apoptosis in HF28RA human follicular lymphoma cells occurs exclusively via the mitochondrial pathway, involves lysosomes, and is dependent on mevalonate pathway inhibition. To define the exact signaling pathway connecting them, we used modified HF28RA cell lines overexpressing either BclXL or dominant-negative caspase-9. In both mutant cells, mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (MMP and LMP) were totally prevented, indicating signaling between lysosomes and mitochondria and, additionally, an amplification loop for MMP and/or LMP regulated by caspase-9 in association with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase inhibition. Additionally, the lysosomal pathway in ZOL-induced apoptosis plays an additional/amplification role of the intrinsic pathway independently of caspase-3 activation. Moreover, we show a potential regulation by Bcl-XL and caspase-9 on cell cycle regulators of S-phase. Our findings provide a molecular basis for new strategies concomitantly targeting cell death pathways from multiple sites."

However, it has become evident in recent years that a growing number of soluble proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are targeted for secretion (3.Nickel W. Rabouille C. Nat. Rev. Mol.

This group of secretory proteins usually shares several common features, including the lack of conventional signal peptides, the absence of post-translational modifications, and the presence of free cysteines (5.Cleves A.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins play key roles in diverse biological processes. Among them are galectins (7.Pohlschröder M. Hartmann E. Hand N.J. Dilks K. Haddad A. Annu. Rev.

Several viral proteins, such as HIV-Tat and herpes simplex VP22, are also known to be secreted via ER-Golgi-independent routes (14.Denny P.W. Gokool S. Russell D.G. Field M.C. Smith D.F. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Multiple unconventional transport mechanisms have been discovered, and cells can utilize one or more pathways to target soluble proteins for secretion. The interleukin-1β export mechanism involves intracellular vesicles in its secretory pathway (17.Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18.Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Talio M. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), whereas the muscle lectin galectin-1 is externalized by the shedding of membrane vesicles (19.Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) or through a protein transporter (20.Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Tews I. Künzler M. Aebi M. Nickel W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Secretion of the growth factor FGF-2 is also likely mediated by a plasma membrane-resident transporter (21.Schäfer T. Zentgraf H. Zehe C. Brügger B. Bernhagen J. Nickel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6244-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell surface counter receptors are essential components in the export machinery of galectin-1 because they can provide an extracellular trap mechanism (20.Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Tews I. Künzler M. Aebi M. Nickel W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Several soluble proteins expressed by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum have been found to be targeted for secretion by unconventional pathways (22.Siu C.H.

Recent Research Developments in Cell Biology.in: Pandalai S.G. Vol. 3. Research Signpost, Trivandrum2007: 9-21Google Scholar). At the onset of development, amoeboid cells undergo chemotactic migration to form large aggregates of ∼105 cells, which eventually culminate in the formation of fruiting bodies (24.Aubry L. Firtel R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 469-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The endogenous soluble lectin discoidin-I, which is externalized to facilitate cell-substratum adhesion (25.Crowley T.E. Nellen W. Gomer R.H. Firtel R.A.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Multicellularity during Dictyostelium development is maintained by the expression of several cell adhesion molecules (22.Siu C.H. Harris T.J. Wang J. Wong E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of them is the Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecule DdCAD-1 that is encoded by the cadA gene. DdCAD-1 lacks the classical signal peptide and is synthesized as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm (28.Brar S.K. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24902-24909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Wong E.F. Brar S.K. Sesaki H. Yang C. Siu C.H. J. Biol.

Differentiation. 1997; 61: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is imported into contractile vacuoles for transport to the plasma membrane (31.Sesaki H. Wong E.F. Siu C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DdCAD-1 contains two distinct domains with β-sandwich architecture. Although the N-terminal domain is involved in homophilic binding, the C-terminal domain tethers the protein to a membrane anchor, thus allowing it to function as a cell adhesion molecule on the cell surface (32.Lin Z. Sriskanthadevan S. Huang H. Siu C.H. Yang D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both DdCAD-1 and discoidin-I have been found to be enriched in contractile vacuoles (31.Sesaki H. Wong E.F. Siu C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the osmoregulatory organelles that regulate water balance during the growth and the initial stages of development (33.Gerisch G. Heuser J. Clarke M. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34.Heuser J. Zhu Q. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1311-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As they fuse with the plasma membrane, the contents of the contractile vacuoles are released into the medium.In this study, we investigated the structural requirements for the import of DdCAD-1 into contractile vacuoles. Using transfectants that express DdCAD-1-GFP fusion proteins, we observe that DdCAD-1 is imported through the invagination of contractile vacuole membranes. However, the whole protein is required because neither the N-terminal domain nor the C-terminal domain alone is sufficient for transport into the contractile vacuole. Additionally, the import mechanism is dependent on Ca2+ and proper protein conformation, suggesting that the secretory targeting motif of DdCAD-1 lies in its three-dimensional structure rather than in a linear stretch of amino acids.DISCUSSIONIn Dictyostelium, the contractile vacuoles serve as the major vehicle for the transport of DdCAD-1 to the plasma membrane for either secretion or cell surface presentation. Our in vivo analysis using time-lapse microscopy has revealed transient membrane budding into the lumen of contractile vacuoles. DdCAD-1 docked on the contractile vacuoles is mobilized to fill these invaginations, which are then pinched off to become vesicles inside the lumen. DdCAD-1 is released upon the burst of these vesicles. In many ways, the export of DdCAD-1 via contractile vacuole is similar to the budding of vesicles in yeast vacuoles (41.Müller O. Sattler T. Flötenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or the formation of multivesicular bodies in murine macrophages (42.Qu Y. Franchi L. Nunez G. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In yeast, the tubular structures facilitate that lateral sorting of proteins and lipids into vesicles inside the vacuole (41.Müller O. Sattler T. Flötenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In macrophages, the multivesicular bodies are the primary vehicle for the transport of interleukin-1β trapped inside the exosomes (42.Qu Y. Franchi L. Nunez G. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, both vesicles and tubules are only transient structures in the lumen of contractile vacuoles in Dictyostelium cells, and multivesicular structures are rarely observed. It is possible that the water collected in the contractile vacuole creates a hypo-osmotic environment that can cause the rapid rupture of vesicles soon after they bud off into the lumen.To further investigate the structural mechanisms involved in DdCAD-1 import into contractile vacuoles, individual domains were transfected into cadA-null cells. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses show that neither the N-terminal domain nor the C-terminal domain of DdCAD-1 alone is sufficient for import into the contractile vacuole. Because the docking of His6-DdCAD-1 to contractile vacuoles is not affected by the presence by either His6-N or His6-C, the import signal is likely integrated in the three-dimensional structure of DdCAD-1.Further analysis has revealed a role for Ca2+ because the import of DdCAD-1 is abrogated by EGTA. Mutations that disrupt the Ca2+-binding capability of DdCAD-1 also inhibit its import. Also, Ca2+ enhances the binding of DdCAD-1 to contractile vacuoles as well as its entry into the lumen. DdCAD-1 is a Ca2+-binding protein. However, the Ca2+-binding affinity of DdCAD-1 is relatively low (Kd 12–15 μm) (32.Lin Z. Sriskanthadevan S. Huang H. Siu C.H. Yang D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration is estimated to be ∼56 nm in aggregation-competent cells (43.Yumura S. Furuya K. Takeuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most of the intracellular DdCAD-1 probably exists in the Ca2+-free form. On the other hand, contractile vacuoles are enriched in Ca2+ pumps (44.Moniakis J. Coukell M.B. Janiec A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 405-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and they constitute a highly efficient acidic Ca2+ store (45.Malchow D. Lusche D.F. Schlatterer C. De Lozanne A. Müller-Taubenberger A. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the release of Ca2+ from contractile vacuoles may serve as an attractant to DdCAD-1. Moreover, the negatively charged surface of membranes is known to determine the targeting of proteins with polybasic clusters (46.McLaughlin S. Murray D. Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 47.Yeung T. Gilbert G.E. Shi J. Silvius J. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2008; 319: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The bound Ca2+ would increase the overall positive charge on the surface of DdCAD-1. The positively charged regions as well as the His6 tag would promote electrostatic interactions with acidic lipids and facilitate the binding of DdCAD-1 to the contractile vacuole membrane. Structural studies have shown that Ca2+-binding interfacial membrane proteins, such as annexin V, complex with phospholipid head groups via Ca2+ bridges (48.Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Such a phenomenon may explain the nonspecific binding of the C- and N-terminal fusion proteins.Because neither the C-terminal domain nor the N-terminal domain competes with DdCAD-1 for binding to the contractile vacuole, it is likely that DdCAD-1 binds to a specific docking element in the midst of negatively charged lipids on the vacuolar membrane. In addition to Ca2+ pumps, an abundance of the ubiquitous Ca2+ regulator, calmodulin, is associated with the surface of contractile vacuoles (36.Zhu Q. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37.Zhu Q. Liu T. Clarke M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1119-1127PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin is also found on endosomal and lysosomal membranes (49.Enrich C. Jäckle S. Havel R.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 226-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Nielsen T.B. Field J.B. Dedman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 327-336PubMed Google Scholar) and is known to play a role in the endosome-mediated transport system (51.Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Interestingly, bioinformatic analysis shows that DdCAD-1 contains a putative binding site for calmodulin in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that the Ca2+-bound form of calmodulin may serve as a potential docking partner for DdCAD-1. Indeed, direct interaction between DdCAD-1 and calmodulin has been detected in far Western blots, whereas pharmacological inhibition of calmodulin function by W7 leads to a reduction in DdCAD-1 binding to contractile vacuoles. 4S. Sriskanthadevan, T. Lee, and C.-H. Siu, unpublished data. DdCAD-1 contains three Ca2+-binding pockets, and the NMR solution structures of DdCAD-1 have shown that binding of Ca2+ leads to more ordered side chain packing in the Ca2+-binding sites and stabilizes the whole structure of DdCAD-1 (32.Lin Z. Sriskanthadevan S. Huang H. Siu C.H. Yang D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An analysis of the CD spectra of the Ca2+-binding site mutants suggests conformational perturbations in regions that contain tryptophan. A tryptophan (Trp-37) is situated in the loop structure connecting SI and SII. Substitution of Trp-37 with alanine results in alterations in CD spectra similar to those observed for the SI and SII mutants. The W37A mutation as well as mutations in either the SI or SII Ca2+-binding site results in the loss of DdCAD-1 import into contractile vacuoles, implicating a role for the three-dimensional structure in DdCAD-1 transport. It is possible that the Ca2+-binding sites may serve a dual function. Although contributions by Ca2+ to the surface charge can influence the docking of DdCAD-1 to contractile vacuoles, conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding may regulate its import into the lumen.In both animal and plant cells, several unconventional pathways are known to utilize transporters to import or export soluble proteins across cellular membranes (52.Teter S.A. Klionsky D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Matrix components of peroxisomes are transported in folded form from the cytoplasm into the peroxisomal matrix (53.Brocard C.B. Jedeszko C. Song H.C. Terlecky S.R. Walton P.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 54.Nickel W. Traffic. 2005; 6: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Other pathways that can accommodate folded substrates include the bacterial twin-arginine translocation pathway (55.Cline K. McCaffery M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 56.Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12058-12062Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the ΔpH-dependent pathway of plant plastids (57.Clark S.A. Theg S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (58.Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the direct translocation of proteins, such as FGF-2 and galectin-1, across the plasma membrane in mammalian cells (20.Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Tews I. Künzler M. Aebi M. Nickel W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Schäfer T. Zentgraf H. Zehe C. Brügger B. Bernhagen J. Nickel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6244-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among them, only the peroxisomal and twin-arginine translocation pathways involve targeting signals, whereas the others do not seem to require a generalized signal for protein transport (59.Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 60.Wickner W. Schekman R. Science. 2005; 310: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Similarly, there has been no targeting motif detected in the primary sequence of DdCAD-1, and the import signal is likely integrated in its three-dimensional structure.The export of soluble proteins may involve more than one unconventional pathway (3.Nickel W. Rabouille C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 4.Nickel W. Seedorf M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro studies suggest that the translocation of DdCAD-1 across the contractile vacuole membrane may involve a membrane transporter (31.Sesaki H. Wong E.F. Siu C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Exogenously added ATP and an ATP regeneration system enhance the import of DdCAD-1, suggesting the involvement of specific ATP-dependent transporter(s) in the contractile vacuole membrane. Also, the import of DdCAD-1 is inhibited by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (61.Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62.Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), implicating a role for the V-ATPase in the import mechanism. Among other secreted proteins in Dictyostelium, the acyl-CoA-binding protein (AcbA), which is required for the terminal differentiation of prespore cells, is also externalized through an unconventional protein secretion pathway. Interestingly, this pathway involves GRASP (the Golgi reassembly stacking protein) and a membrane transporter (63.Kinseth M.A. Anjard C. Fuller D. Guizzunti G. Loomis W.F. Malhotra V. Cell. 2007; 130: 524-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the transporter for AcbA remains to be elucidated. It is therefore evident that multiple unconventional pathways are employed by eukaryotic cells to target soluble proteins for surface expression and secretion. The combination of genetic and biochemical analyses in Dictyostelium should provides a useful model for the future dissection of these pathways. IntroductionIn eukaryotes, soluble secretory proteins are typically transported through the classical ER 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumFGFfibroblast growth factorGFPgreen fluorescence proteinNN-terminal domainCC-terminal domainmAbmonoclonal antibodyMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. -Golgi transport pathway (1.Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 2.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). However, it has become evident in recent years that a growing number of soluble proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are targeted for secretion (3.Nickel W. Rabouille C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 4.Nickel W. Seedorf M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This group of secretory proteins usually shares several common features, including the lack of conventional signal peptides, the absence of post-translational modifications, and the presence of free cysteines (5.Cleves A.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins play key roles in diverse biological processes. Among them are galectins (7.Pohlschröder M. Hartmann E. Hand N.J. Dilks K. Haddad A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 91-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8.Cleves A.E. Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), interleukin-1β (9.Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), thioredoxin (10.Rubartelli A. Bajetto A. Allavena G. Wollman E. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24161-24164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (11.Flieger O. Engling A. Bucala R. Lue H. Nickel W. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF-1 and FGF-2) (12.Engling A. Backhaus R. Stegmayer C. Zehe C. Seelenmeyer C.

Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Several viral proteins, such as HIV-Tat and herpes simplex VP22, are also known to be secreted via ER-Golgi-independent routes (14.Denny P.W. Gokool S. Russell D.G. Field M.C. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11017-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15.Elliott G. O'Hare P.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Multiple unconventional transport mechanisms have been discovered, and cells can utilize one or more pathways to target soluble proteins for secretion. The interleukin-1β export mechanism involves intracellular vesicles in its secretory pathway (17.Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18.Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Talio M. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), whereas the muscle lectin galectin-1 is externalized by the shedding of membrane vesicles (19.Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) or through a protein transporter (20.Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Tews I. Künzler M. Aebi M. Nickel W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Secretion of the growth factor FGF-2 is also likely mediated by a plasma membrane-resident transporter (21.Schäfer T. Zentgraf H. Zehe C. Brügger B. Bernhagen J. Nickel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6244-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell surface counter receptors are essential components in the export machinery of galectin-1 because they can provide an extracellular trap mechanism (20.Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Tews I. Künzler M. Aebi M. Nickel W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Several soluble proteins expressed by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum have been found to be targeted for secretion by unconventional pathways (22.Siu C.H. Harris T.J. Wang J. Wong E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23.Sriskanthadevan S. Ivanov I. Yang C. Siu C.H. Recent Research Developments in Cell Biology.in: Pandalai S.G. Vol. 3. Research Signpost, Trivandrum2007: 9-21Google Scholar). At the onset of development, amoeboid cells undergo chemotactic migration to form large aggregates of ∼105 cells, which eventually culminate in the formation of fruiting bodies (24.Aubry L. Firtel R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 469-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The endogenous soluble lectin discoidin-I, which is externalized to facilitate cell-substratum adhesion (25.Crowley T.E. Nellen W. Gomer R.H. Firtel R.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 633-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26.Springer W.R. Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Multicellularity during Dictyostelium development is maintained by the expression of several cell adhesion molecules (22.Siu C.H. Harris T.J. Wang J. Wong E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of them is the Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecule DdC"

Methods for high throughput screening against these targets are generally limited to in vitro biochemical assays that can suffer many technical limitations, as well as failing to capture the biological context of proteases within the cellular pathways that lead to their activation. METHODS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;We describe here a versatile system for reconstituting protease activation networks in yeast and assaying the activity of these pathways using a cleavable transcription factor substrate in conjunction with reporter gene read-outs. The utility of these versatile assay components and their application for screening strategies was validated for all ten human Caspases, a family of intracellular proteases involved in cell death and inflammation, including implementation of assays for high throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries and functional screening of cDNA libraries. The versatility of the technology was also demonstrated for human autophagins, cysteine proteases involved in autophagy.Altogether, the yeast-based systems described here for monitoring activity of ectopically expressed mammalian proteases provide a fascile platform for functional genomics and chemical library screening."
https://openalex.org/W2055961179,"The SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP2 contains several interacting domains that are important for scaffolding properties. We and others have previously reported that SHIP2 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Here, we identified human SHIP2 monoubiquitination on lysine 315. SHIP2 could also be polyubiquitinated but was not degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Furthermore, we identified a ubiquitin-interacting motif at the C-terminal end of SHIP2 that confers ubiquitin binding capacity. However, this ubiquitin-interacting motif is dispensable for its monoubiquitination. We showed that neither c-Cbl nor Nedd4-1 play the role of ubiquitin ligase for SHIP2. Strikingly, monoubiquitination of the DeltaSH2-SHIP2 mutant (lacking the N-terminal SH2 domain) is strongly increased, suggesting an intrinsic inhibitory effect of the SHIP2 SH2 domain on its monoubiquitination. Moreover, SHIP2 monoubiquitination was increased upon 30 min of epidermal growth factor stimulation. This correlates with the loss of interaction between the SHIP2 SH2 domain and c-Cbl. In this model, c-Cbl could mask the monoubiquitination site and thereby prevent SHIP2 monoubiquitination. The present study thus reveals an unexpected and novel role of SHIP2 SH2 domain in the regulation of its newly identified monoubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2000508351,"Adult skeletal muscle in vertebrates contains myoendothelial cells that express both myogenic and endothelial markers, and which are able to differentiate into myogenic cells to contribute to muscle regeneration. In spite of intensive research efforts, numerous questions remain regarding the role of cytokine signalling on myoendothelial cell differentiation and muscle regeneration. Here we used Hirudo medicinalis (Annelid, leech) as an emerging new model to study myoendothelial cells and muscle regeneration. Although the leech has relative anatomical simplicity, it shows a striking similarity with vertebrate responses and is a reliable model for studying a variety of basic events, such as tissue repair. Double immunohistochemical analysis were used to characterize myoendothelial cells in leeches and, by injecting in vivo the matrigel biopolymer supplemented with the cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), we were able to isolate this specific cell population expressing myogenic and endothelial markers. We then evaluated the effect of VEGF on these cells in vitro. Our data indicate that, similar to that proposed for vertebrates, myoendothelial cells of the leech directly participate in myogenesis both in vivo and in vitro, and that VEGF secretion is involved in the recruitment and expansion of these muscle progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043356729,"The liver possesses distinct tolerogenic properties because of continuous exposure to bacterial constituents and nonpathogenic food antigen. The central immune mediators required for the generation of effective immune responses in the liver environment have not been fully elucidated. In this report, we demonstrate that the liver can indeed support effector CD8+ T cells during adenovirus infection when the T cells are primed in secondary lymphoid tissues. In contrast, when viral antigen is delivered predominantly to the liver via intravenous (IV) adenovirus infection, intrahepatic CD8+ T cells are significantly impaired in their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines and lyse target cells. Additionally, intrahepatic CD8+ T cells generated during IV adenovirus infection express elevated levels of PD-1. Notably, lower doses of adenovirus infection do not rescue the impaired effector function of intrahepatic CD8+ T cell responses. Instead, intrahepatic antigen recognition limits the generation of potent anti-viral responses at both priming and effector stages of the CD8+ T cell response and accounts for the dysfunctional CD8+ T cell response observed during IV adenovirus infection. These results also implicate that manipulation of antigen delivery will facilitate the design of improved vaccination strategies to persistent viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2109970160,"Background Targeting the biosynthetic pathway of Coenzyme A (CoA) for drug development will compromise multiple cellular functions of the tubercular pathogen simultaneously. Structural divergence in the organization of the penultimate and final enzymes of CoA biosynthesis in the host and pathogen and the differences in their regulation mark out the final enzyme, dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (CoaE) as a potential drug target. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here a complete biochemical and biophysical characterization of the M. tuberculosis CoaE, an enzyme essential for the pathogen's survival, elucidating for the first time the interactions of a dephosphocoenzyme A kinase with its substrates, dephosphocoenzyme A and ATP; its product, CoA and an intrinsic yet novel inhibitor, CTP, which helps modulate the enzyme's kinetic capabilities providing interesting insights into the regulation of CoaE activity. We show that the mycobacterial enzyme is almost 21 times more catalytically proficient than its counterparts in other prokaryotes. ITC measurements illustrate that the enzyme follows an ordered mechanism of substrate addition with DCoA as the leading substrate and ATP following in tow. Kinetic and ITC experiments demonstrate that though CTP binds strongly to the enzyme, it is unable to participate in DCoA phosphorylation. We report that CTP actually inhibits the enzyme by decreasing its Vmax. Not surprisingly, a structural homology search for the modeled mycobacterial CoaE picks up cytidylmonophosphate kinases, deoxycytidine kinases, and cytidylate kinases as close homologs. Docking of DCoA and CTP to CoaE shows that both ligands bind at the same site, their interactions being stabilized by 26 and 28 hydrogen bonds respectively. We have also assigned a role for the universal Unknown Protein Family 0157 (UPF0157) domain in the mycobacterial CoaE in the proper folding of the full length enzyme. Conclusions/Significance In view of the evidence presented, it is imperative to assign a greater role to the last enzyme of Coenzyme A biosynthesis in metabolite flow regulation through this critical biosynthetic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2121362716,"I present the idea that a human being, like other mammals, emits a bouquet of weakly acid, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which serve two purposes. In their uncharged state they are permeable, volatile, have a distinctive aroma, and collectively can identify an individual. When ionized they bond to and neutralize MHC sites, freeing cell surfaces of electrical charge, thus making them invisible to the organism’s immune surveillance system. Like edge pieces in jigsaws they will only fit the unique puzzle for which they were made. Understanding the properties of VOCs may permit them to be used to reduce immune response to transplanted organs. The lack of maternal immune response to a developing fetus is an example of how a foreign tissue can become accepted, and VOCs may be one mechanism."
