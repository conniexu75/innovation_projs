https://openalex.org/W2010953919,"Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) hold promise for a number of scientific and technological applications. In particular, NEMS oscillators have been proposed for use in ultrasensitive mass detection1,2, radio-frequency signal processing3,4, and as a model system for exploring quantum phenomena in macroscopic systems5,6. Perhaps the ultimate material for these applications is a carbon nanotube. They are the stiffest material known, have low density, ultrasmall cross-sections and can be defect-free. Equally important, a nanotube can act as a transistor7 and thus may be able to sense its own motion. In spite of this great promise, a room-temperature, self-detecting nanotube oscillator has not been realized, although some progress has been made8,9,10,11,12. Here we report the electrical actuation and detection of the guitar-string-like oscillation modes of doubly clamped nanotube oscillators. We show that the resonance frequency can be widely tuned and that the devices can be used to transduce very small forces."

To better understand the role of AMPK in the regulation of hepatic lipids, we studied the effect of metformin on AMPK and its downstream effector, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), as well as on lipid content in cultured human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Metformin increased Thr-172 phosphorylation of the α subunit of AMPK in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In parallel, phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79 was increased, which was consistent with decreasing ACC activity. Intracellular triacylglycerol and cholesterol contents were also decreased. These effects of metformin were mimicked or completely abrogated by adenoviral-mediated expression of a constitutively active AMPKα or a kinase-inactive AMPKα, respectively. An insulin-resistant state was induced by exposing cells to 30 mm glucose as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effector, glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β. Under these conditions, the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was also decreased, and the level of hepatocellular triacylglycerols increased. The inhibition of AMPK and the accumulation of lipids caused by high glucose concentrations were prevented either by metformin or by expressing the constitutively active AMPKα. The kinase-inactive AMPKα increased lipid content and blocked the ability of metformin to decrease lipid accumulation caused by high glucose concentrations. Taken together, these results indicate that AMPKα negatively regulates ACC activity and hepatic lipid content. Inhibition of AMPK may contribute to lipid accumulation induced by high concentrations of glucose associated with insulin resistance. Metformin lowers hepatic lipid content by activating AMPK, thereby mediating beneficial effects in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

AMPK is activated by physiological stimuli, such as exercise, muscle contraction, and hormones including adiponectin and leptin, as well as by pathological stresses, glucose deprivation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and osmotic shock (2Kemp B.E.

AMPK serine/threonine protein kinase is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (5Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Regulation of AMPK activity is complex; it involves allosteric activation by AMP, which increases during states of stress where ATP is depleted, and phosphorylation via the presumptive upstream activator AMPK kinase (6Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 7Woods A. Johnstone S.R.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of Thr-172 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain of the α subunit is necessary for AMPK activity because site-directed mutagenesis of Thr-172 to Ala completely abolishes AMPK activity (10Crute B.E.

Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates its downstream substrates to reduce ATP-consuming anabolic pathways, including cholesterol, fatty acid, and triacylglycerol synthesis, and increases ATP-generating catabolic pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis. Phosphorylation by AMPK of two key substrates, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), which are the rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively, results in their inactivation and thus reduces cellular ATP consumption during metabolic stress. Type II diabetes is associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance leading to elevated hepatic glucose production, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia (13Gerich J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 14Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of the AMPK activator, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR), improves glucose tolerance and lipid profiles in the insulin-resistant Zucker rat (15Buhl E.S. Jessen N. Pold R. Ledet T. Flyvbjerg A. Pedersen S.B. Pedersen O. Schmitz O. Lund S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that AMPK activity regulates insulin sensitivity and the associated dyslipidemia. Metformin is an oral biguanide antidiabetic drug that improves insulin sensitivity and reduces plasma glucose and lipids in patients with type II diabetes (16Fedele D. Tiengo A. Nosadini R. Marchiori E. Briani G. Garotti M.C. Muggeo M. Diabetes Metab. 1976; 2: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hermann L.S. Diabetes Metab. 1979; 5: 233-245PubMed Google Scholar, 18Davidson M.B. Peters A.L.

In fructose-fed rats with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, metformin decreases liver triacylglycerol and free fatty acid levels and increases lipoprotein lipase activity (19Anurag P. Anuradha C.V. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2002; 4: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Metformin may increase insulin sensitivity through up-regulation of insulin signaling as reflected by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (20Yuan L. Ziegler R. Hamann A. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2003; 24: 55-60PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which metformin lowers lipids is unknown. Recently, activation of AMPK by metformin has been shown to decrease glucose production and increase fatty acid oxidation in the liver (21Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar, 22Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E.

The present studies were performed to determine 1) the extent to which the effect of metformin on hepatocellular lipids is mediated by AMPK and 2) whether AMPK regulates lipid accumulation in insulin-resistant states. We utilized the cultured human hepatoma HepG2 cell line as a model system and presented biochemical evidence that AMPK serves as a critical regulator of hepatocellular lipid content. Metformin increased ACC phosphorylation in an AMPK-dependent manner, which in turn decreased intracellular triacylglycerol and cholesterol contents. Importantly, the ability of metformin to reduce lipids was mimicked by adenoviral-mediated expression of a constitutively active AMPKα and was blocked by a kinase-inactive AMPKα, suggesting that AMPK is required for the hypolipidemic actions of metformin. In addition, exposing cells to high glucose concentrations induced a model of insulin resistance in which AMPK was inhibited and lipids accumulated. Expression of the kinase-inactive AMPKα also led to triacylglycerol accumulation, suggesting a pivotal role for AMPK in lipid accumulation associated with insulin resistance. This study also provides a model for developing potential therapeutic agents to target AMPK in insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in type II diabetes.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mm d-glucose. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passaged every 3 days by trypsinization. For experiments, HepG2 cells were incubated in complete medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm-diameter dishes, grown to 70% confluence, and maintained in serum-free DMEM overnight as described elsewhere (23Yu-Poth S.

To ensure cell viability during prolonged incubation of metformin in serum-free medium, cell viability was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay performed according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Sigma). In addition, cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release into the culture medium using the cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (26Riebeling C.

Under the conditions of our studies, treatment of HepG2 cells with metformin had no detectable cell toxicity.Fig. 3Metformin reverses the suppression of AMPKα and ACC phosphorylation and the accumulation of triacylglycerol by high concentrations of glucose. HepG2 cells were quiesced in serum-free medium overnight and incubated in DMEM containing either normal (5.5 mm) or high (30 mm) glucose concentrations in the absence or presence of 2 mm metformin for an additional 24 h. A, metformin restores the suppression of AMPK signaling by high glucose concentrations. Total cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with phospho-Thr-172 AMPK (α-pAMPK), total AMPKα2 (α-AMPKα2), and phospho-Ser-79 ACC (α-pACC) antibodies, respectively. All Western blots shown represent three independent experiments. B and C, metformin lowers the lipid accumulation caused by high glucose concentrations.

HepG2 cells were transfected with adenoviral vectors encoding GFP (Ad-GFP) or a Myc-tagged constitutively active form of AMPKα1 (Ad-CA-AMPK) in serum-free medium for 24 h, followed by incubation with or without 2 mm metformin for an additional 24 h. A, expression of the CA-AMPK is sufficient to increase baseline ACC phosphorylation as well as enhance metformin-induced ACC phosphorylation. Expression of the CA-AMPK recombinant protein (∼31 kDa) was detected by immunoblots using anti-Myc antibody (α-Myc). The phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC and expression of total AMPK protein were analyzed by immunoblots with the phospho-Thr-172 AMPKα antibody (α-pAMPK), phospho-Ser-79 ACC antibody (α-pACC), and anti-AMPKα2 antibody (α-AMPKα2), respectively. Immunoblots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.

HepG2 cells were transfected with the adenovirus vector encoding either Ad-GFP or a Myc-tagged dominant-negative AMPKα2 (Ad-DN-AMPK) in serum-free medium for 24 h, followed by incubation with or without 2 mm metformin in medium containing either normal (5.5 mm) or high (30 mm) glucose concentrations for an additional 24 h. A, the ability of metformin to phosphorylate AMPK and ACC is diminished by the DN-AMPK in cells exposed to normal or high glucose concentrations. Expression of the DN-AMPK recombinant protein (∼64 kDa) was detected by immunoblots using anti-Myc antibody (α-Myc) or anti-AMPKα2 antibody (α-AMPKα2), respectively. The phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was immunoblotted with the phospho-Thr-172 AMPKα (α-pAMPK) or phospho-Ser-79 ACC (α-pACC) antibodies. All Western blots shown represent three independent experiments. B and C, inhibition of lipid levels by metformin was abrogated by the DN-AMPK. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E.

The phosphorylation of Akt and its down-stream target, GSK3α/β, was analyzed with anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt and anti-phospho-Ser-21/9 GSK3α/β antibodies. Insulin stimulated 6- and 3-fold increases in the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3α/β, respectively, over the basal level in cells maintained in normal glucose concentrations (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, high glucose concentrations diminished the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt as well as both basal and insulin-stimulated GSK3α/β phosphorylation. There was no change in the expression of total Akt and GSK3β protein or β-actin (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). Adenoviral-mediated Gene Transfer—A replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP) was used as a control (27Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vector expressing a dominant-negative mutant of AMPKα2 (Ad-DN-AMPKα2) was constructed from AMPKα2 bearing a mutation of lysine 45 to arginine (K45R) as described previously (27Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 28Zou M.H. Hou X.Y. Shi C.M. Nagata D. Walsh K. Cohen R.A. J. Biol.

To generate the adenoviral vector expressing a constitutively active mutant of AMPKα1 (Ad-CA-AMPKα1), a rat cDNA encoding residues 1–312 of AMPKα1 and bearing a mutation of threonine 172 into aspartic acid (T172D) was subcloned into a shuttle vector (p-shuttle cytomegalovirus). The c-Myc epitope tag was fused in frame to the 5′ terminus of the coding sequence. The resulting plasmid was linearized by digestion with PmeI and co-transformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1. Homologous recombinants were selected with kanamycin. The linearized recombinant plasmid was transfected into transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified on human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified by two ultracentrifugation steps on cesium chloride gradients. The number of viral particles was assessed by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. HepG2 cells were transfected overnight with 30–100 plaque-forming units/cell in serum-free medium. After fresh serum-free medium was added, cells were treated with metformin (0.5–2 mm) for the indicated times. Preliminary studies revealed that within 48 h of transfection with control Ad-GFP, 80–90% of HepG2 cells expressed green fluorescent protein. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (30Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In brief, HepG2 cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (cell lysate) was used for Western blotting and analysis of lipid content. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For Western blotting, 20–50 μg of protein were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a transfer buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 154 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with specific antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The intensity of bands was quantified using a model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). Determination of Triacylglycerol and Cholesterol Contents—Triacylglycerol and total cholesterol contents were determined in cell lysates using a colorimetric assay and expressed as μg of lipid/mg of cellular protein as described (32Wang Y.X. Lee C.H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In brief, HepG2 cells were maintained in serum-free medium overnight and incubated with either normal or high glucose concentrations in the absence or presence of metformin. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Triacylglycerols and total cholesterol levels in cell lysates were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions for Infinity™ reagents. Statistics—Results are expressed as the means ± the standard error of the mean (S.E.). Significance was analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Metformin Stimulates AMPK and ACC Phosphorylation, Decreases Lipid Content, and Attenuates the Hyperlipidemic Effects of High Glucose Concentrations in Insulin-resistant HepG2 Cells—We first determined the phosphorylation state of the α subunit of AMPK (AMPKα) by using a specific antiphospho-Thr-172 AMPK antibody. In HepG2 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of metformin for various times (Fig. 2A), phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172 was stimulated by as much as 3.6-fold by metformin (2 mm) at 24 h (Fig. 2B). No change in the expression of endogenous AMPKα protein was noted by immunoblotting with AMPKα2 antibody (Fig. 2A). At the lower concentrations used (0.5 mm and 1 m m), no change in phosphorylation was evident at 6 h, but there was a significant increase at 24 h (Fig. 2C). Metformin (2 mm) caused a more rapid and potent increase in AMPKα phosphorylation, with a significant increase noted at 6 h, reaching levels comparable with those caused by 1 mm at 24 h (Fig. 2C). To assess AMPK activity, we next determined the phosphorylation of its downstream target, ACC. Western blot analysis showed that metformin markedly induced phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79 in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, which paralleled the stimulation of Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPKα at 6 and 24 h (Fig. 2, A and D). When cells were treated with metformin for 24 h, phosphorylation of ACC was significantly increased by 3-fold at 1 mm and up to 5.5-fold at 2 mm (Fig. 2B). Metformin at 0.5 mm had little effect, whereas the effect of metformin at 1 mm caused a 3.2-fold rise at 6 h and was sustained for 24 h. Metformin at 2 mm caused a robust and sustained increase in ACC phosphorylation over 24 h (Fig. 2D). Intracellular levels of triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells exposed to metformin for 1, 6, and 24 h were also measured. Increasing concentrations of metformin (0.5–2 mm) decreased intracellular triacylglycerol and cholesterol content at 24 h in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). Treatment for 1 h had little effect, but significant reductions in both triacylglycerol and cholesterol content were observed at 6 h, although they were less pronounced than those shown at 24 h (data not shown). At the highest metformin concentration utilized (2 mm), there was approximately a 30 and 40% decrease in triacylglycerol content and a 21 and 33% decrease in cholesterol content at 6 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2E and data not shown). Using a model of insulin resistance induced by high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 1), we determined the effects of these high glucose concentrations on the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172, on the phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79, and on lipid levels. Exposure of HepG2 cells to glucose (30 mm, 24 h) decreased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC without a change in total AMPK protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). In concert with these changes in phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, triacylglycerol content dramatically increased by almost 3-fold in insulin-resistant hepatocytes without a significant change in cholesterol content (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine whether metformin reverses lipid accumulation induced by high glucose concentrations, HepG2 cells were incubated with either normal or high glucose concentrations in the absence or presence of metformin (2 mm) for 24 h. Consistent with our earlier observations, the phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC was markedly up-regulated by metformin in normal concentrations of glucose (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), and the intracellular contents of triacylglycerol and cholesterol were lowered ∼40% by metformin (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, the inhibition of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in cells exposed to high glucose concentrations was restored by metformin (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with this, the intracellular contents of triacylglycerol that were increased by high glucose concentrations were reduced 40% by metformin (Fig. 3, B and C). The Effect of Metformin on Hepatic Lipids Is Mimicked by a Constitutively Active Form of AMPK—To confirm the role of the catalytic α subunit of AMPK in regulating lipid metabolism, we determined the effect of adenoviral-mediated expression of a Myc-tagged constitutively active mutant of AMPKα1 (Ad-CA-AMPKα1) on the changes in ACC phosphorylation and lipid levels. As expected, after adenoviral transfection, the recombinant AMPKα1 protein that contained a T172D mutation and was truncated at residue 312 (∼31 kDa) was expressed as detected by immunoblotting for the Myc tag at its N terminus (Figs. 4A and 5A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, endogenous α1or α2 AMPK protein level was not obviously affected by the transfection (Figs. 4A and 5A). As predicted, ACC phosphorylation was higher in the basal state following transfection with the CA-AMPK (Figs. 4A and 5A, lane 3). It was evident that the cells remained sensitive to metformin because expression of the CA-AMPK potentiated the effect of metformin on ACC phosphorylation over the effect observed in Ad-GFP transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). Similar to the effect of metformin in GFP-transfected cells, the CA-AMPK transfection also reduced triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels by ∼35%, and the levels were further significantly reduced by metformin (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that there is a synergistic effect of metformin and the CA-AMPK on the phosphorylation of ACC and reduction of lipi"

https://openalex.org/W2124881367,"Increasing evidence suggests an important role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic exposure to increasing concentrations of amyloid β (Aβ) on mitochondrial function and nitric oxide (NO) production in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that PC12 cells and human embryonic kidney cells bearing the Swedish double mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APPsw), exhibiting substantial Aβ levels, have increased NO levels and reduced ATP levels. The inhibition of intracellular Aβ production by a functional γ-secretase inhibitor normalizes NO and ATP levels, indicating a direct involvement of Aβ in these processes. Extracellular treatment of PC12 cells with comparable Aβ concentrations only leads to weak changes, demonstrating the important role of intracellular Aβ. In 3-month-old APP transgenic (tg) mice, which exhibit no plaques but already detectable Aβ levels in the brain, reduced ATP levels can also be observed showing the in vivo relevance of our findings. Moreover, we could demonstrate that APP is present in the mitochondria of APPsw PC12 cells. This presence might be directly involved in the impairment of cytochrome c oxidase activity and depletion of ATP levels in APPsw PC12 cells. In addition, APPsw human embryonic kidney cells, which produce 20-fold increased Aβ levels compared with APPsw PC12 cells, and APP tg mice already show a significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential under basal conditions. We suggest a hypothetical sequence of pathogenic steps linking mutant APP expression and amyloid production with enhanced NO production and mitochondrial dysfunction finally leading to cell death.

The pathology of AD is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques (2Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5186) Google Scholar) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and pronounced cell death. The amyloid plaque is composed of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide (3Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3679) Google Scholar), which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through an initial β-secretase cleavage followed by an intramembraneous cut of γ-secretase (4Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5188) Google Scholar, 5Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Autosomal dominant forms are caused by mutations in APP, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2, mainly associated with the early onset of AD (6Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The Swedish double mutation in the APP gene (K670M/N671L) results in a 6–8-fold increased Aβ production compared with human wild type APP cells (APPwt) (7Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 8Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the APPsw mutation enhances the vulnerability to secondary insults, e.g. oxidative stress, finally leading to apoptotic cell death through the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and caspases 3 and 9 (9Marques C.A. Keil U. Bonert A. Steiner B. Haass C. Muller W.E. Eckert A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28294-28302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The latter observation provided evidence that mitochondria-mediated apoptosis might play an important role in these processes. Intrinsic apoptotic pathway via mitochondria is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family (10Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). They are mainly localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis, whereas other members such as Bax, Bak, Bid, Bik, and Bim are proapoptotic (11Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Their most frequently reported mode of action is the regulation of cytochrome c release from the intermembrane space (12Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Once released from the mitochondria, cytochrome c interacts with Apaf 1 and procaspase 9 to activate caspase 3, finally leading to cell death. Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) is another mitochondrial intermembrane protein that is released in the cytosol during apoptosis (13Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Smac interacts with several inhibitors of apoptosis, thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of inhibitors of apoptosis on caspases (14Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). As an early event in the apoptotic pathway, typically, a rapid reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) takes place (15Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which reflects a block of the respiratory chain finally leading to the reduction of ATP levels. Some previous findings suggest that neurotoxicity of Aβ (16Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 17Yankner B.A. Dawes L.R. Fisher S. Villa-Komaroff L. Oster-Granite M.L. Neve R.L. Science. 1989; 245: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) seems to be mediated via oxidative stress probably leading to mitochondrial damage, e.g. Aβ inhibited cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in isolated brain mitochondria (18Canevari L. Clark J.B. Bates T.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Parker Jr., W.D. Parks J. Filley C.M. Kleinschmidt-DeMasters B.K. Neurology. 1994; 44: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in neuronal cultures, Aβ caused a loss of activity of all mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (20Casley C.S. Land J.M.

Bennett Jr., J.P. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 29: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, activity changes in mitochondrial enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase have been described in AD brain (24Gibson G.E. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. J. Neural Transm. 1998; 105: 855-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, patients with AD showed impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity in the central nervous system and even in other tissues including platelets (19Parker Jr., W.D. Parks J. Filley C.M. Kleinschmidt-DeMasters B.K. Neurology. 1994; 44: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maurer I. Zierz S. Moller H.J. Neurobiol.

Neurology. 1994; 44: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, p0 cells repopulated with mitochondria from AD patients also showed a reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity (28Swerdlow R.H. Parks J.K. Cassarino D.S. Maguire D.J. Maguire R.S. Bennett Jr., J.P. Davis R.E. Parker Jr., W.D. Neurology. 1997; 49: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, the defects in mitochondrial energy metabolism that lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to underlie the pathology of AD (29Hirai K. Aliev G. Nunomura A. Fujioka H. Russell R.L. Atwood C.S. Johnson A.B. Kress Y. Vinters H.V. Tabaton M. Shimohama S. Cash A.D. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L. Jones P.K. Petersen R.B. Perry G. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria represent not only the major source of ROS but also the main target for ROS damage. Nitric oxide (NO) and its derivative (reactive nitrogen species), also belonging to the group of ROS, are known to inhibit the mitochondrial respiration (30Brown G.C. Borutaite V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Hereby, NO itself causes a selective reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (31Sarti P. Arese M. Giuffre A. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 2003; 52: 37-42PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RNS inactivate multiple respiratory chain complexes and ATP synthase (32Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In accordance, both oxidative and nitrosative stress seem to represent early events in the pathogenesis of AD (33Smith M.A. Rottkamp C.A. Nunomura A. Raina A.K. Perry G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 34Nunomura A. Perry G. Aliev G. Hirai K. Takeda A. Balraj E.K. Jones P.K. Ghanbari H. Wataya T. Shimohama S. Chiba S. Atwood C.S.

Investig. 2003; 83: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, we set out to investigate the precise mechanisms underlying the action of Aβ and/or expression of mutant APP on mitochondrial function in multiple experimental designs mimicking different in vivo situations that are discussed to occur in AD patients: 1) in cell lines overexpressing different levels of Aβ (APPsw PC12 cells exhibiting low physiological concentrations of Aβ within picomolar range and APPsw HEK cells expressing Aβ levels within low nanomolar range) to study dose-dependent effects of Aβ in an in vitro setting characterized by chronic Aβ production due to increased APP processing; 2) after extracellular Aβ treatment to distinguish chronic from acute and/or extracellular actions from effects of intracellular Aβ or APP-processing products on mitochondria; and 3) in a secondary insult model to examine the additional impact of oxidative stress. Finally, we checked the in vivo relevance of our in vitro findings by studying mitochondrial function in brain cells from APP transgenic (tg) mice. Materials—Rhodamine 123 and tetramethylrhodamineethylester (TMRE) were purchased from Molecular Probes. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein diacetate was obtained from Calbiochem. ViaLight HT kit was purchased from Cambrex. Cytochrome c oxidase assay kit, hydrogen peroxide, rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, antimycin, sodium azide (NaN3), and oligomycin were obtained from Sigma. l-NAME was purchased from Cayman. Nω-propyl-l-arginine and 1400W were purchased from Biotrend. Aβ1–42 was supplied by Bachem. DAPT was obtained from Merck Biosciences. Aβ1–42 was dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1 mm and stored at -20 °C. The stock solution was diluted in Tris-buffered saline to the desired concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to have aged preparations of Aβ1–42. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells and HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs harboring human mutant APP (APPsw, K670M/N671L) gene, the APPwt gene, inserted downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter using the FUGENE 6 technique (Roche Diagnostics) (37Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The transfected cells APPwt PC12, APPsw PC12, and control PC12 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.

The ELISA was performed according to the instructions given in the Abeta-ELISA kit by BIOSOURCE. The assay principle is that of a standard sandwich ELISA, which utilizes a monoclonal mouse anti-human Abeta1–16 capture antibody, a cleavage site-specific rabbit anti-human Abeta1–40 C-terminal detection antibody, and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Transgenic Animal Brain Tissue—Female C57BL/6 mice bearing the human Swedish and London mutations in the 751 amino acid form of human amyloid precursor protein (tg APP) under the control of a murine Thy-1 promoter at an age of 3 months and non-transgenic littermate animals were used for the experiments (38Wirths O. Multhaup G. Czech C. Feldmann N. Blanchard V. Tremp G. Beyreuther K. Pradier L. Bayer T.A. Brain Pathol. 2002; 12: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). APP tg mice exhibited the onset of Aβ plaques at an age of 6 months, but intracellular Aβ load was already detectable at the age of 3 months (39Blanchard V. Moussaoui S. Czech C. Touchet N. Bonici B. Planche M. Canton T. Jedidi I. Gohin M. Wirths O. Bayer T.A. Langui D. Duyckaerts C. Tremp G. Pradier L. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 184: 247-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and brains were quickly dissected on ice (method modified after Stoll et al. (40Stoll L. Schubert T. Muller W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). After removing the cerebellum, the tissue was minced into 2 ml of medium I (138 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.17 Na2HPO4, 0.22 K2PO4, 5.5 glucose, and 58.4 sucrose, all in mmol/liter, pH 7.35) with a scalpel and further dissociated by trituration through a nylon mesh (pore diameter 1 mm) with a Pasteur pipette. The resulting suspension was filtered by gravity through a fresh nylon mesh with a pore diameter of 102 μm, and the dissociated cell aggregates were washed twice with medium II (110 NaCl, 5.3 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2·H2O, 1 MgCl2·6 H2O, 25 glucose, 70 sucrose, and 20 HEPES, all in mmol/l, pH 7.4) by centrifugation (400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C). 100 μl of the suspension were used for protein determination. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 500 μl/well were distributed on a 24-well plate for the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential. For the measurement of ATP levels, 100 μl/well were distributed on a white 96-well plate. The preparations of APP tg mice and non-transgenic littermate mice (overcross design) were made under the same conditions and in parallel. Quantification of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (37Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PC12 cells and HEK cells were lysed in buffer (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Cells with a lower DNA content showing less propidium iodide staining than G1 have been defined as apoptotic cells (sub-G1 peak). Determination of Intracellular Nitric Oxide Levels—PC12 cells and HEK cells were plated the day before at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. To measure the NO levels, the fluorescence dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate was used in a concentration of 10 μm for 30 min (41Kojima H. Hirata M. Kudo Y. Kikuchi K. Nagano T. J Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the fluorescence was determined with a fluorescence reader (Victor® multilabel counter) at 490/535 nm. NO levels were also determined after a 48-h incubation in the absence or in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitors 20 mm l-NAME, 1 mmNω-propyl-l-arginine, and 1 mm 1400W. Determination of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Ψm)—PC12 cells and HEK cells were plated the day before at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. PC12 cells were incubated with H2O2 (0.5 mm) for different periods of time. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the fluorescence dye Rhodamine 123 (42Baracca A. Sgarbi G. Solaini G. Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Transmembrane distribution of the dye depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential. The dye was added to the cell culture medium in a concentration of 0.4 μm for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the fluorescence was determined with a fluorescence reader (Victor multilabel counter) at 490/535 nm. The mitochondrial membrane potential of dissociated neurons was also measured with Rhodamine 123 in a concentration of 0.4 μm for 15 min. For detailed information regarding the preparation, see “Transgenic Animal Brain Tissue.” To test acute and fast changes in Ψm, the fluorescence dye TMRE (43Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) was used in a concentration of 0.4 μm for 15 min. TMRE exhibits a characteristic increase in fluorescence at 490/590 nm after challenging mitochondria with membrane potential-decreasing drugs (44Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial membrane potential was recorded, and then the complex inhibitors (2 μm rotenone, 10 μm thenoyltrifluoroacetone, 2 μm antimycin, 10 μm oligomycin, and 10 mm sodium azide) were added. Determination of ATP Levels with a Bioluminescence Assay (ViaLight HT)—PC12 cells and HEK cells were plated the day before at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in a white 96-well plate. PC12 cells were incubated for different periods of time with H2O2 (0.1 mm). The ATP levels of dissociated neurons were also measured with the bioluminescence assay. For detailed information regarding this preparation, see “Transgenic Animal Brain Tissue.” The kit is based upon the bioluminescent measurement of ATP (45Crouch S.P. Kozlowski R. Slater K.J. Fletcher J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The bioluminescent method utilizes an enzyme, luciferase, which catalyzes the formation of light from ATP and luciferin. The emitted light is linearly related to the ATP concentration and is measured using a luminometer. Confocal Microscopy—The amount of mitochondria was measured using the cell-permanent mitochondrion-selective dye Mitotracker Red. This probe can accumulate in active mitochondria and then react with accessible thiol groups of proteins and peptides to form fluorescent aldehydic-fixable conjugates. PC12 cells were plated the day before at a density of 2 × 105 cells/chamber slide. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Mitotracker Red or for 15 min with Rhodamine 123. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were embedded in Mowiol and analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Isolation of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Fractions—Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were isolated by digitonin permeabilization (46Gottlieb R.A. Granville D.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were resuspended for 15 min on ice in permeabilization buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, additional protease inhibitors, and 0.05% digitonin. Following a centrifugation step at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was separated from the pellet consisting of cellular debris. The crude mitochondrial pellet was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins was stored at -20 °C for further investigation. The pellet consisting of mitochondria was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline for the cytochrome c oxidase assay and resuspended in 0.1% Triton X-100 and mechanically lysed for the Western blot. The total protein content was determined by the method of Lowry (Bio-Rad).

Cell Biochem. 2000; 208: 37-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)—The colorimetric assay is based on the observation of the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm of ferrocytochrome c caused by its oxidation to ferricytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase. The cytochrome c oxidase assay was performed according to the instructions given in the kit. Western Blot—After determination of the total protein content by the method of Lowry, the cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer and denatured for 10 min at 95 °C. An equal amount (10–20 μg) of protein was loaded per lane on acrylamide gels and examined by SDS-PAGE. Dependent on the protein to be detected, we performed glycine or Tricine Western blots with acrylamide amounts of 10–18% at 90 V for 2–3 h. For proteins with a molecular mass <30 kDa, Tricine Western blots were more convenient. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 25 V for 90 min. After this procedure, membranes were saturated with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 1 h after antibody exposure. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes then were exposed to the following antibodies overnight: rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-Bax (Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (Chemicon); rabbit anti-Smac (Chemicon); rabbit anti-cytochrome c (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-COX4 (BD Biosciences); goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-calreticulin (Chemicon); mouse anti-Na+/K+-ATPase (Chemicon); rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine (Merck Biosciences); and mouse anti-human APP W02 (Abeta; W02 antibody is directed against amino acids 4–10 of the human Aβ sequence, thereby detecting the mature and immature APP695). After treatment for 1 h with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Merck Biosciences), the protein bands were detected by ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). After detection, the membranes were treated with stripping buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5) for 2 h after reprobing with different antibodies. Statistical Analysis—The data are given as the mean ± S.E. For statistical comparison, Student's t test and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test, repeated measures ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA were used. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. APP Expression and Aβ Levels of APP-transfected PC12 Cells and HEK Cells—Increasing knowledge was obtained that Aβ is produced intracellularly (48Bayer T.A. Wirths O. Majtenyi K. Hartmann T. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Czech C. Brain Pathol. 2001; 11: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ precedes plaque formation in APP tg mice bearing the Swedish double mutation (49Wirths O. Multhaup G. Czech C. Blanchard V. Moussaoui S. Tremp G. Pradier L. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 306: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 50Hartmann T. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1999; 249: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, intracellular accumulation of Aβ might be a primary step in the neurotoxicity cascade of Aβ in vivo and in vitro. APP containing the Swedish mutation resulted in an overall increase of Aβ including both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. In our cell model, the APPsw mutation resulted in a markedly increased Aβ secretion of PC12 cells (0.20 nmol/liter) as well as in HEK cells (5.42 nmol/liter) compared with APPwt PC12 cells and APPwt HEK cells. APPsw PC12 cells secreted low Aβ levels, reflecting the physiological situation in vivo during cellular metabolism (7Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), whereas human APP was equally expressed in APPwt and APPsw PC12 cells and was increased 2-fold compared with the endogenous APP expression of control PC12 cells (37Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of note, HEK cells bearing the APPsw mutation exhibited an ∼20-fold increased Aβ secretion compared with APPsw-bearing PC12 cells (Table I), a scenario that might occur in familial AD and that could explain the more drastic effects in some assay designs. Furthermore, this might indicate that, in APPsw HEK cells, the secretion pathway is more pronounced than in PC12 cells. The endogenous human APP expression of control HEK cells was increased 2-fold compared with APPs"
https://openalex.org/W1964170347,"Human lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcriptional co-activator p75 (LEDGF/p75) protein was recently identified as a binding partner for HIV-1 integrase (IN) in human cells. In this work, we used biochemical and bioinformatic approaches to define the domain organization of LEDGF/p75. Using limited proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis we show that the protein contains a pair of evolutionarily conserved domains, assuming about 35% of its sequence. Whereas the N-terminal PWWP domain had been recognized previously, the second domain is novel. It is comprised of ∼80 amino acid residues and is both necessary and sufficient for binding to HIV-1 IN. Strikingly, the integrase binding domain (IBD) is not unique to LEDGF/p75, as a second human protein, hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP2), contains a homologous sequence. LEDGF/p75 and HRP2 IBDs avidly bound HIV-1 IN in an in vitro GST pull-down assay and each full-length protein potently stimulated HIV-1 IN activity in vitro. LEDGF/p75 and HRP2 are predicted to share a similar domain organization and have an evident evolutionary and likely functional relationship.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1997: 161-203Google Scholar). Its activity is essential for viral replication and spread in primary cells and contributes to the persistence of the viral infection in vivo (4Nakajima N. Lu R. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7944-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5LaFemina R.L. Schneider C.L. Robbins H.L. Callahan P.L. LeGrow K. Roth E. Schleif W.A. Emini E.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking HIV-1 IN activity by specific inhibitors was shown to arrest viral spread in cell culture (6Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN, born to the transposase family of DNA transferases, is structurally and mechanistically similar to Mu phage and Tn5 transposases. Its active site formed by the three acidic residues Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152 (known as the “DDE motif”) is located within the structurally conserved catalytic core domain. The core domain is contained within residues 50–212 of the protein and flanked by the N-terminal HHCC-type zinc finger and the C-terminal DNA binding domains. Similar to the related bacterial transposases, retroviral INs form multimers, although the true stoichiometry of IN within the retroviral preintegration complex (PIC) is not known (7Rice P.A. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 302-307Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mutations in HIV-1 IN display a wide range of phenotypes, affecting viral replication at the integration step (class I mutants), or causing various pleiotropic effects on virion morphogenesis and reverse transcription (class II) (8Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pleiotropic phenotypes of many IN mutants advocate that IN might have additional functions in viral replication. Thus, a role for IN in reverse transcription has been proposed (9Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Hehl E. Kalpana G.V. Prasad V. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2126-2135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex phenotypes of class II mutants could potentially be explained by failure of the mutant INs to interact with viral reverse transcriptase and/or a host cell factor(s). A number of cellular and viral proteins were suggested to participate in retroviral integration (for a review see Ref. 10Engelman A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 281: 209-238PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several proteins were reported to directly interact with HIV-1 IN, including viral reverse transcriptase (9Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Hehl E. Kalpana G.V. Prasad V. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2126-2135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a component of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex INI1 (11Kalpana G.V.

However, when HIV-1 or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) INs are expressed separately from other viral proteins, endogenous host-cell LEDGF/p75 appears to be the dominant interactor, accounting for their nuclear/chromosomal accumulation (16Cherepanov P.

LEDGF/p75 protein markedly stimulated HIV-1 IN activity in vitro and was recently reported to be associated with functional HIV-1 PICs (16Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B.

Chung S. Peretz M. Poeschla E.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9524-9537Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These data cumulatively suggest that LEDGF/p75 and possibly its homologs pose as cellular host factors in retroviral replication likely acting at the levels of chromosomal targeting, and/or integration of viral cDNA (17Turlure F. Devroe E. Silver P.A. Engelman A. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3187-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 belongs to a family of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF)-related proteins (HRPs). Five mammalian HRPs are known: HDGF, HRP1, HRP2, HRP3, HRP4, and LEDGF/p75 (see Supplementary Table I) (20Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K. Nakamura H. Kappler J. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The characteristic feature of these proteins is a high degree of sequence homology within their N-terminal 90–95 residues, spanning the PWWP domain (InterPro accession number IPR000313) (20Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Stec I. Nagl S.B. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This domain, named for a conserved although not invariant Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro motif, extends for about 70 residues (22Stec I. Nagl S.B. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Several dozen other PWWP domain-containing proteins have been described, including Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 gene product WHSC1, mismatch repair protein MSH6, mammalian DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, and a plant homolog of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein kinase (22Stec I. Nagl S.B. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PWWP domains seem to be distantly related to the Tudor and Chromo domains and are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions involved in regulation of chromatin structure (22Stec I. Nagl S.B. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Maurer-Stroh S. Dickens N.J. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Eisenhaber F. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 69-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, the PWWP domain of Dnmt3b methyltransferase was recently shown to be essential for chromatin association of the protein (24Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A. Xu G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recognizable orthologs of mammalian HRPs seem to be present in all vertebrates, although proteins containing PWWP domains are more wide-spread and occur throughout eukaryota, including yeast (22Stec I. Nagl S.B. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Apart from their homologous N-terminal PWWP domains, HRPs show little sequence similarity. Cellular functions of LEDGF/p75 and other HRPs have not been studied in detail. Like other PWWP domain-containing proteins, HRPs are imported into the nucleus (21Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K. Nakamura H. Kappler J. Gieselmann V. Biochem.

Singh D.P. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Kimura A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 was implicated in the regulation of expression of stress response related genes, such as Hsp27, αB-crystallin, and antioxidant protein 2, presumably through binding to heat shock and stress-related regulatory elements in the promoters of the target genes (28Fatma N.

Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overexpression of LEDGF/p75 was reported to enhance cell viability under conditions of serum starvation, thermal, and oxidative stress (28Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48899-48907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Wu X. Daniels T. Molinaro C. Lilly M.B. Casiano C.A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, LEDGF/p75 is subject to cleavage by caspases that abolishes its activity as a cell-survival factor (30Wu X. Daniels T. Molinaro C. Lilly M.B. Casiano C.A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the evolutionary conservation and domain organization of LEDGF/p75. We identified the HIV-1 IN binding domain (IBD) in this protein and found that another human protein, HRP2, can bind HIV-1 IN via a homologous domain and stimulate its activity in vitro. Isolation and Sequence Analysis of LEDGF/p75 and HRP2 cDNAs—A wealth of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) representing fragments of cDNAs encoding homologs of human LEDGF/p75 from various vertebrate sources were readily identified by searching the NCBI sequence data base with translating basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). ESTs with the following GenBank™ accession numbers gave sufficient sequence information to design primers for PCR amplification of the complete coding regions of Gallus gallus LEDGF/p75 cDNA: BU112216, AJ394255, BU332575, BU129859, and CN231179. ESTs for the Xenopus laevis ortholog were: BJ042207, BJ055881, BX852842, BU912001, and BQ729240. Total RNA isolated from G. gallus pro-B cell line DT40 or kidney tissue from an adult male X. laevis specimen was reverse-transcribed using random-primed SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The complete coding region of chicken LEDGF/p75 cDNA was amplified using Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and primers: 5′-CACGGCGGCGAGACAAC/5′-AGATTTCAAATGCAATCCTCTTC. The primers used to amplify the frog cDNA were: 5′-TGCCTGAATTTCGTCGAG and 5′-AATGACCACACGAGTGTGA. The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and three independent clones for each cDNA were sequenced. The 3′-terminal part of the Danio rerio (zebrafish) HRP2 cDNA was obtained from the following ESTs: BI886683, AW154327, CD586524, BQ480774, and AL916221. The resulting contig was used to search through the zebrafish genome assembly (www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/) using nucleotide BLAST. The gene was identified on chromosome 22 and four exons containing the available portion of HRP2 cDNA sequence could be readily matched to the genomic sequence. Only one fragment predicted to encode a PWWP domain could be identified within the upstream 30 kb genomic sequence using PROSITE (us.expasy.org/prosite/). Assuming this sequence to represent the beginning of the HRP2 open reading frame (ORF), two sets of PCR primers were designed to amplify the cDNA: 5′-GTGGACGGATAGAAACG/5′-GAAGGAAGCCAAGGTGTG and 5′-AACGAGCAGAACGAGGAG/5′-GTTTGTGAGCATAAAAGGAG. Random-primed cDNA prepared from a sample of D. rerio kidney total RNA was used as template. PCRs with both primer pairs readily amplified fragments with the expected size of about 2.1 kb. Sequence analysis agreed with the chromosomal sequence and confirmed homology to human and mouse HRP2. The D. rerio HRP2 gene spans about 24.6 kb on the chromosome 22; the coding region of the cDNA is derived from 18 exons. The complete ORF from the X. laevis HRP2 cDNA was reconstructed from the following ESTs: CA789647, AW643477, BJ039312, BJ626283, BJ619541, BF612425, BU916767, CA981423, BJ054046, BJ642669, BE678817, BE678996, BX853753, BF426654, BJ622360, CD363094, BJ639036, BG234506, BJ086552, BJ050372, and BG812065. Partial G. gallus HRP2 cDNA sequence was obtained from a contig of the following ESTs: BU261466, BU324804, BU392278, CD727797, BU351707, BU347241, AI981158, BU141299, BU428133, BU236024. Protein Secondary Structure Prediction and Sequence Analysis— Secondary structure prediction was done using the PROFsec and NORSp programs accessed through the PredictProtein server (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu) (31Rost B.

Hydrophobicity profiles (33Cowan R. Whittaker R.G. Pept. Res. 1990; 3: 75-80PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed using BioAnnotator software (InforMax Inc.). Multiple sequence alignments were done with AlignX (InforMax Inc.) using BLO-SUM62 or GONNET matrices (34Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Homology between IBDs and the N-terminal domain of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) was found using InterProScan release 7.2 (www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) (36) and SMART version 4.0 (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) (37Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Constructs for Bacterial Protein Expression—All glutathione S-transferase (GST)-LEDGF/p75 fusion constructs used for protein expression in this work were based on the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length LEDGF/p75 ORF and its fragments were PCR-amplified using Pfu-Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Sense primers were designed to incorporate a BamHI restriction site followed directly by the first codon of the relevant LEDGF/p75 fragment; anti-sense primers contained a stop codon (TGA) directly following the last codon. PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and subcloned between BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX-4T1. To clone the putative IBD of HRP2, a fragment coding for residues 470–593 of the human protein was PCR-amplified from random-primed HeLa cDNA using Expand DNA polymerase and the following primers: 5′-GCGTGGATCCTCCGTGGAGGAGAAGCTGCAG/5′-CCCTCACTTGTCCTCCGCCTTCTCC. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated into BamHI/SmaI-digested pGEX-4T1. The full-length HRP2 ORF was PCR-amplified from cDNA clone MGC2641 (American Type Culture Collection) using primers 5′-GCGTGGATCCATGCCACACGCCTTCAAGCC and 5′-GCTCAGCTCTCCTCGTCCAGGGCCTC; the PCR fragment digested with BamHI was subcloned between BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX-6P3, resulting in pCP-GSTHRP2. For expression of non-tagged full-length HRP2, the entire HRP2 ORF was amplified using primers 5′-TGCCACACGCCTTCAAGCC and 5′-GTTTTCACCGTCATCAC, the resulting PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and cloned between NdeI and XhoI sites of pRSETB (Invitrogen) (the vector NdeI terminus was filled-in using T4 DNA polymerase) giving pCP-NatHRP2. Non-modified pGEX-4T1 was used to produce GST as a control for pull-down experiments. Plasmids pCPNat75 and pKB-IN6H were described previously (18Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs for Expression in Human Cells—Plasmids pBHA-P75 and pCPHA-HRP2 expressed human LEDGF/p75 and HRP2 with N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tags, respectively, under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. To make pBHA-P75, the LEDGF/p75 ORF was PCR-amplified using 5′-CCGCGGATCCGACACCATGGCATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTACTCGCGATTTCAAACCTGGAGACC/5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTAGTTATCTAGTGTAGAATCC and Pfu-Ultra DNA polymerase. The resulting amplicon was digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated into BamHI/NotI-digested pcDNA6-V5-HisB (Invitrogen). The BamHI/XhoI fragment of pCP-GSTHRP2 carrying the entire HRP2 ORF was re-cloned between BglII/XhoI sites of the pCPHA-NLS vector, fusing the 5′-end of the HRP2 ORF directly to the HA tag coding sequence, resulting in pCPHA-HRP2. The HA tag fusion vector pCPHA-NLS was made by first disrupting the BglII site in pcDNA6-V5-HisB by digesting it with BglII, filling-in using Pfu polymerase, and religation resulting in pcDNA6ΔBgl. A DNA fragment obtained by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGAAGCTTAGACACCATGGCCTACCCTTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCAGATCTG and 5′-GGTGGGATCCCTCCACCTTCCGCTTCTTCTTGGGAGGGCCAGATCTGGCGTAGTCG followed by extension using Sequenase Version 2.0 T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) was restricted with HindIII and BamHI and then ligated with HindIII/BamHI-digested pcDNA6ΔBgl. The resulting pCPHA-NLS vector encodes for the HA tag fused to the simian virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS), with an intervening BglII restriction site. The construct from Bram et al. (38Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was used to express human cyclophilin A (CypA) with a C-terminal HA tag. This plasmid will be referred to here as pCypA-HA. The construct pED-FLAG-IN was used to express FLAG-tagged HIV-1 IN (39Limon A. Devroe E. Lu R. Ghory H.Z. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10598-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All expression constructs were verified to be free of inadvertent mutations by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli B strain BL21. Shake-flask cultures grown to an optical density of 0.9–1.0 at 600 nm were induced for 3 h by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. The temperature of induction was reduced to 28 °C to increase the stability of full-length GST-LEDGF/p75, GST-LEDGF-(1–325), and GST-LEDGF-(1–471). Bacteria were disrupted by sonication in 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Because the fusion proteins differed in terms of stability, expression levels, and solubility, purification procedures had to be adjusted accordingly. Briefly, GST fusions containing full-length LEDGF/p75 and fragments LEDGF-(1–471) and LEDGF-(1–325) were isolated from soluble fractions of bacterial lysates by adsorption onto glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins eluted with 25 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich) in 500 mm NaCl/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 were further purified by chromatography on 5-ml HiTrap heparin and SP-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) to partially remove proteolytic fragments. Both columns were operated in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2 m to 0.8 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted 1:3 with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2 before injection onto SP-Sepharose. GST fusions of LEDGF/p75 fragments 326–530, 326–471, 347–471, 366–471, the HRP2 fragment 326–530, as well as free GST protein were purified from soluble fractions in one step on glutathione-Sepharose. GST fused to LEDGF-(347–429) was expressed in an insoluble form. To purify this protein, inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 and refolded by dilution into 10-fold excess of cold 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The protein was purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. GST fusion proteins dialyzed against excess 200 mm NaCl/25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 were concentrated using Centricon-30 (Millipore) when necessary, supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –70 °C after flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Non-tagged HRP2 was induced in Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen) for 3 h at 28 °C by addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were disrupted by sonication in 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm PMSF, pH 7.7. The lysate precleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min was diluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2 to reduce conductivity to 24 mS/cm and injected into a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2. HRP2 protein eluting at ∼500 mm NaCl was collected, the peak fractions were pooled, diluted 1:3 in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2 and injected into a 5-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1.0 m in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2. Fractions containing HRP2 were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon device, and further separated on a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.25 ml/min in 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2. The purified protein was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml, supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –70 °C after flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Non-tagged LEDGF/p75 and His6-tagged HIV-1 IN were produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), pLysS using pCPNat75 and pKB-IN6H, respectively, and purified according to published procedures (18Maertens G.

LEDGF-(326–530), LEDGF-(347–471), and HRP2-(470–593) fragments released from GST by digestion with thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) were further purified by cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose using a linear 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad) employing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. N-terminal Microsequencing and Mass Spectrometry—To determine the N-terminal residues of trypsin-resistant (TR) 1 and TR2 peptides, tryptic fragments resulting from digestion of 10 μg of LEDGF/p75 were separated by 10–20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Bands excised from Coomassie Blue R250-stained membranes were subjected to Edman degradation in a Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). In-gel trypsin digestion and peptide extraction were done as described (41Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). To determine molecular masses of the intact TR1 and TR2 peptides, a mixture of digestion products was separated on a 2.1 × 250 mm Vidyac C8 column. Fractions containing the TR1 and TR2 fragments were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). GST Pull-down Assay—Purified GST fusion proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, using 125 μl (settled volume) beads per 40 μg of protein. After 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed in excess buffer and stored on ice. To test for IN binding, 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying GST fusion proteins were resuspended in 200 μl of cold PD buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 10 μg of BSA. After addition of 3.8 μgofHis6-tagged HIV-1 IN the samples were gently rocked for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C and left for a"

Glutathione, the most abundant thiol in the eukaryotic cells, the cyanobacteria, and the α, β, and γ groups of the proteobacteria, has long been suspected to be involved in selenium metabolism. Experiments with the phototrophic α proteobacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum showed that the rate of selenite reduction was decreased when bacteria synthesized lower than normal levels of glutathione, and in Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Escherichia coli the reaction was reported to induce glutathione reductase. In the latter organism superoxide dismutase was also induced in cells grown in the presence of selenite, indicating that superoxide anions (O-2) were produced. These observations led us to investigate the abiotic (chemical) reduction of selenite by glutathione and to compare the features of this reaction with those of the reaction mediated by R. rubrum and E. coli. Our findings imply that selenite was first reduced to selenodiglutathione, which reached its maximum concentration within the 1st min of the reaction. Formation of selenodiglutathione was paralleled by a rapid reduction of cytochrome c, a known oxidant for superoxide anions. Cytochrome c reduction was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, indicating that O-2 was the source of electrons for the reduction. These results demonstrated that superoxide was produced in the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione, thus lending support to the hypothesis that glutathione may be involved in the reaction mediated by R. rubrum and E. coli. The second phase of the reaction, which led to the formation of elemental selenium (Se°), developed more slowly. Se° precipitation reached a maximum within 2 h after the beginning of the reaction. Secondary reactions leading to the degradation of the superoxide significantly decreased the yield of Se° in the abiotic reaction compared with that of the bacterially mediated selenite reduction. Abiotically formed selenium particles showed the same characteristic orange-red color, spherical structure, and size as particles produced by R. rubrum, again providing support for the hypothesis that glutathione is involved in the reduction of selenite to elemental selenium in this organism.

Selenium is an essential trace element in the nutrition of many organisms, but it can be highly toxic depending on its concentration and speciation. High selenium concentrations may cause severe abnormalities in the development of various animals and plants (1Ohlendorf H.M. Jacobs L.W. Selenium in Agriculture and the Environment. American Society for Agronomy, Madison, WI1989: 133-177Google Scholar, 2Läuchli A. Bot. Acta. 1993; 106: 455-468Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3O'Toole D. Raisbeck M.F. Frankenberger W.T. Engberg R.A. Environmental Chemistry of Selenium. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 355-395Google Scholar). Deformation and structural modifications have been noted, especially in creatine-formed tissues (i.e. hooves, horns, hair, feather, beaks, and nails) in which appreciable quantities of selenium may accumulate. In these cases, selenium toxicity has been attributed to its ability to replace sulfur in proteins or other sulfur-containing biomolecules. In their investigations of selenite toxicity in prokaryotes, Kramer and Ames (4Kramer G.F. Ames B.N. Mutat. Res. 1988; 201: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) did not observe any nonspecific incorporation of selenium into proteins. They demonstrated that a mutant strain of Salmonella typhimurium, which is able to overexpress oxidative stress proteins such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DHPC, diheptanoyl-phosphatidylcholine; EDAX, energy dispersive x-ray analysis; GS-Se-, selenopersulfide of glutathione; GS-Se-SG, selenotrisulfide of glutathione (selenodiglutathione); RS-Se-SR, selenotrisulfides; Se°, elemental selenium.1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DHPC, diheptanoyl-phosphatidylcholine; EDAX, energy dispersive x-ray analysis; GS-Se-, selenopersulfide of glutathione; GS-Se-SG, selenotrisulfide of glutathione (selenodiglutathione); RS-Se-SR, selenotrisulfides; Se°, elemental selenium. is significantly more resistant to selenite toxicity than the wild type. Their results suggest that free radical formation might be involved. They also considered the high reactivity of selenite with sulfhydryl groups and the formation of oxygen radicals when selenium reacted with cysteine or glutathione and concluded that selenite toxicity in bacteria might be the result of oxidative damage. Consistent with these results Bébien et al. (5Bébien M. Lagniel G. Garin J. Touati D. Verméglio A. Labarre J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) observed that two types of SOD are induced in cultures of Escherichia coli exposed to selenite, thus confirming the involvement of free radicals in selenium toxicity. In addition, glutathione reductase was induced in cultures of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (6Bébien M. Chauvin J.-P. Adriano J.-M. Grosse S. Verméglio A. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4440-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and E. coli (5Bébien M. Lagniel G. Garin J. Touati D. Verméglio A. Labarre J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) amended with selenite. In the bacterial domain glutathione is present in the cyanobacteria and the α, β, and γ groups of the proteobacteria (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar). Considering these data we investigated the chemical reduction of selenite with glutathione and compared the features of this reaction with those of the dissimilatory selenite reduction in R. rubrum and E. coli. In a chemical approach, Painter (8Painter E.P. Chem. Rev. 1941; 28: 179-213Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar) observed the high reactivity of selenite with thiol groups. He was the first to demonstrate the formation of selenotrisulfides (RS-Se-SR), according to Reaction 1. 4 RSH+H2SeO3→RS-Se-SR+RSSR+3H2O (REACTION 1) Ganther (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) studied the reaction of selenite with glutathione (GSH), the most abundant thiol found in the eukaryotic cells, the cyanobacteria, and the α, β, and γ groups of the proteobacteria (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar). He showed that the selenotrisulfide of glutathione (GS-Se-SG), which was later renamed selenodiglutathione, is a very good substrate for glutathione reductase with Km and Vmax values comparable with those of glutathione itself. He described this with Reaction 2. GS-Se-SG+NADPH→Glutathione reductaseGSH+GS-Se−+NADP+ (REACTION 2) Ganther (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) also proposed that the unstable selenopersulfide of glutathione (GS-Se-) dismutates into elemental selenium (Se°) and reduced glutathione according to the following stoichiometry. GS-Se−+H+→GSH+Seo (REACTION 3) In experiments about the kinetics of selenite reduction in cultures of Rhodospirillum rubrum we observed that the rate of the reaction is decreased significantly when the organism synthesizes low levels of glutathione. 2J. Kessi, submitted for publication.2J. Kessi, submitted for publication. In the present study, we investigate the kinetics of formation of selenodiglutathione, superoxide anions, and elemental selenium during abiotic (chemical) reduction of selenite by glutathione, and we compare the features of this reaction with those of the reaction mediated by R. rubrum and E. coli. We also compare the properties of the abiotically formed Se° particles with those produced during the bacterial process. Selenite Reduction—Chemical reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at room temperature in tubes kept anoxic (Hungate, Bellco, Vineland, NJ) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The buffer was degassed with an aspirator pump for about 1 h before use. Anoxic stock solutions of selenite, glutathione, and cytochrome c were also prepared in Hungate tubes under nitrogen and with degassed buffer. The addition of reactants and sampling were performed using syringes purged with nitrogen. Selenite—SeO32- was determined using a colorimetric method based on the formation of a piazselenol complex with diaminonaphthalene (11Watkinson J.H. Anal. Chem. 1966; 38: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 12Kessi J. Ramuz M. Wehrli E. Spycher M. Bachofen R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selenodiglutathione—GS-Se-SG was detected by monitoring its absorbance at 260 nm (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Its appearance and disappearance were followed in a spectrophotometer (Uvikon 860, Kontron, Zürich, Switzerland). All measurements were performed in quartz cuvettes purged with nitrogen. Superoxide Anions—Because superoxide anions are known to reduce cytochrome c (13McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), relative superoxide levels can be determined by measuring the rate of cytochrome c reduction at various times during the reaction. The assays were performed in a thermostat-controlled compartment of the spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Samples were prepared in glass cuvettes purged with nitrogen and closed tightly with silicon stoppers. The reaction mixture was allowed to equilibrate to the indicated temperature for 20 min before cytochrome c was added with a syringe purged with nitrogen at various reaction times. The rate of reduction was recorded at 550 nm. The cytochrome c concentration in the samples varied between 40 and 160 μm, depending on the initial selenite concentration. A high concentration of 1 mg/ml or about 25 μm SOD was required to inhibit cytochrome c reduction markedly under the conditions described in this work. Oxygen—The oxygen (O2) concentration was monitored using a Clark cell (oxygen membrane polarographic detector; Rank Brothers Ltd., Cambridge, England). The reaction mixture was transferred quickly to the cell after the start of the reaction and monitored for 20–30 min. The Clark cell and syringe were purged with nitrogen before use. Hydrogen Peroxide—Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was determined using the horseradish peroxidase-coupled reaction described in Frew et al. (14Frew J.E. Jones P. Scholes G. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1983; 155: 139-150Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed 20–30 min after the start of the reaction to avoid inhibition of the peroxidase with superoxide anions. Elemental Selenium—Se° was determined after oxidation to selenite with concentrated nitric acid. Samples containing 20–200 nmol of Se° were centrifuged in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and 50–60 μl of concentrated nitric acid was added to the pellet. The tubes were closed carefully and incubated in boiling water until the orange-red color of Se° disappeared (about 2–4 min). Double-distilled water was added to the tubes for a final volume corresponding to the initial sample volume, and the samples were mixed well. The Se° transformed to selenite was determined using the method described above for selenite. The presence of Se° in the reaction mixture could also be observed qualitatively because of its turbidity visible at 400 nm, where GS-Se-SG does not absorb. Preparation and Purification of Chemically Produced Se° Particles— The Se° particles were prepared in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The chemically well defined detergent diheptanoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DHPC) (15Kessi J. Poirée J.-C. Wehrli E. Bachofen R. Semenza G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10825-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was added to the buffer for a final concentration of 5.0 mm, to avoid aggregation and stacking of the particles on the walls of the vials. The reaction was performed with 0.5 mm selenite and 2.0 mm glutathione (GSH:selenite ratio of 4:1). The reaction was allowed to develop for 2 h before the Se° particles were centrifuged for 40 min at 130,000 × g at room temperature. The supernatant fluid was discarded, and the particles were washed three times with 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mm DHPC (= 2 mm DHPC-Tris·HCl buffer). The DHPC concentration used is slightly higher than its critical micellar concentration (1.4 mm). Isolation of Biologically Produced Se° Particles—Phototrophically grown cultures of R. rubrum amended with 0.5 mm selenite were harvested 2 days after they entered the stationary phase and were processed immediately. After centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 5,000 × g, the cell pellet was discarded. The supernatant, containing Se° particles together with bilayer vesicles (16Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was centrifuged for 40 min at 130,000 × g. The resulting small pellet was resuspended in a volume of 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.0) corresponding to 1/10 of the initial volume of the culture. The contaminating bilayer vesicles were solubilized by adding the detergent DHPC to a final concentration of 15 mm (15Kessi J. Poirée J.-C. Wehrli E. Bachofen R. Semenza G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10825-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); solubilization was achieved at room temperature. Membrane debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min immediately after solubilization. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant containing the Se° particles was centrifuged again at 130,000 × g for 40 min. The small pellet was homogenized in a volume of 2 mm DHPC-Tris·HCl buffer corresponding to about 1/10 of the solubilization volume. This three-stage washing procedure (centrifugation of membrane debris and subsequent centrifugation and homogenization of particles) was repeated three times. Electron Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 60 min (samples were diluted with 5% aqueous glutaraldehyde), washed with running water, and embedded in low melting point agarose. Agar blocks (∼1 × 1 × 1 mm) were fixed in 1% OsO4, washed in running water for 60 min, dehydrated in ethanol and acetone, and embedded in Epon-Araldit. Sections cut from the Epon-Araldit preparation were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate as described by Hess (17Hess W.M. Stain Technol. 1966; 41: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For transmission electron microscopy 10 μl of Se° particles suspension with a selenium concentration of about 1 mm were transferred via pipette onto a grid of cellulose nitrate and observed without any additional treatment. For energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) three to four portions of 5–10 μl of Se° particle suspension with a Se° concentration of about 10 mm were deposited on a carbon plate, and the Se° layer was dried at room temperature after each addition of particles. Spectra were recorded with an EDAX-DX4 microanalysis system (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Transformation of Selenite by Glutathione—Selenite was transformed rapidly in the presence of glutathione at room temperature. The yield of the reaction was much improved by increasing the GSH:selenite ratio from 2:1 to 4:1. Approximately 40–50% and 80–95% of the initial selenite concentrations disappeared from the reaction mixtures in samples containing GSH:selenite ratios of 2:1 and 4:1, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B).

Open table in a new tab Formation of GS-Se-SG—The concentration of selenodiglutathione increased rapidly within the 1st min of the reaction. It attained a maximum within 30–60 s and decreased over the next 10–20 min. The higher rates of appearance and disappearance of selenodiglutathione were correlated with higher initial selenite concentrations and increased GSH:selenite ratios (Fig. 2). In samples with a starting GSH:selenite ratio higher than 2, turbidity was visible in the absorption spectra within a few minutes after initiation of the reaction (Fig. 2B). The appearance of turbidity paralleled the formation of orange-red Se° particles. Higher turbidity correlated with higher initial selenite concentration and higher GSH:selenite ratios. Inhibition of GS-Se-SG Degradation by SOD—The addition of SOD to the reaction mixture greatly diminished the decrease in selenodiglutathione during the first minutes of the reaction (absorption at 260 nm) (data not shown), suggesting that the superoxide anions participated to the degradation of the selenodiglutathione. Formation of Superoxide Anions—Fig. 3 shows that maximal superoxide concentrations were reached within the 1st min of the reaction for all conditions tested. In the samples containing the lowest selenite concentration (0.125 mm) and a GSH:selenite ratio of 2:1, redox equilibrium was observed for about 10 min before the cytochrome c reduction rate began to decrease again. The superoxide anions disappeared completely about 25 min after the reaction was started. Degradation of the superoxide was faster in reaction mixtures containing the GSH: selenite ratio of 4:1. Under this condition degradation of the superoxide proceeded in two steps: a rapid step that took place within the 1st min of the reaction was followed by a significantly slower step that extended up to 25 min after initiation of the reaction (Fig. 3). Higher initial concentrations of GSH and selenite correlated with a faster degradation of the superoxide (Table I). Cytochrome c reduction, which reveals the presence of superoxide, was inhibited by SOD; the inhibition was proportional to the SOD concentration (data not shown). Oxygen—O2 did not accumulate in the reaction mixtures; a constant low O2 concentration of 9.0 μm (±1.5 μm) was determined using the Clark cell. Hydrogen Peroxide—Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined in reaction mixtures containing 0.5 or 1.0 mm selenite and a GSH:selenite ratio of 4:1. In the 0.5 mm selenite mixture, low H2O2 concentrations of 9.05 ± 1.15 and 8.30 ± 0.056 μm were attained after 20 and 50 min, respectively. In assays with 1.0 mm selenite, H2O2 concentrations of 19.2 ± 0.17 and 9.94 ± 0.47 μm were measured 20 and 50 min, respectively, after the start of the reaction. H2O2 reacted rapidly with GSH. A decrease in hydrogen peroxide concentration in the presence of 0.5 mm glutathione was investigated for GSH:hydrogen peroxide ratios ranging from 4:1 to 1:1. The reaction reached equilibrium within a few seconds, with 55–70% of the H2O2 disappearing from the reaction mixtures (data not shown). H2O2 also reacted with Se°. A decrease of Se° of 30% was measured after 15 min in a reaction mixture containing 0.125 mm H2O2 and 0.150 mm Se°. Formation of Se° Particles—Kinetics of the abiotic formation of Se° are presented in Fig. 4A. Turbidity measurements (400 nm) of the reaction mixtures at different times showed that precipitation of Se° particles started a few minutes after the initiation of the reaction. Shorter precipitation lag times correlated with higher initial concentrations of selenite and glutathione (Table I). According to both spectrophotometric and chemical determinations, Se° formation was slow and leveled off after 20–90 min. In some cases, Se° concentrations decreased slowly after having reached a maximum value (Fig. 4A). The final yield of Se° was relatively low (45–80%) compared with that of the bacterially mediated reaction (see, e.g.6Bébien M. Chauvin J.-P. Adriano J.-M. Grosse S. Verméglio A. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4440-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Dungan R.S. Yates S.R. Frankenberger Jr., W.T. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Roux M. Sarret G. Pignot-Paintrand I. Fontecave M. Coves J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and was in most cases only slightly improved by increasing the ratio of GSH to selenite (Fig. 4B). For the GSH:selenite ratio of 2:1, as estimated from turbidity measurements, yields of Se° were low compared with those obtained in reaction mixtures with GSH:selenite ratios of 4:1 or higher. They increased with increasing initial selenite concentrations and varied between 4.5 and 27.5% in samples containing initial selenite concentrations between 0.125 and 1.00 mm (data not shown). The selenium particles formed during chemical reduction of selenite by glutathione showed the same characteristic orangered color as the particles that are produced in bacterial cultures amended with selenite (12Kessi J. Ramuz M. Wehrli E. Spycher M. Bachofen R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chemically produced particles, washed in buffer containing 2 mm DHPC (2 mm DHPC-Tris·HCl buffer), also had the same spherical morphology and diameter (35–45 nm) as the particles isolated from bacterial cultures (Fig. 5). Omission of the detergent in the reaction and/or the washing buffer led to the formation of large aggregates of both artificial and biological particles. It must be noted that the small bacterially produced selenium particles isolated from the culture medium after removing the cells by centrifugation (Fig. 5A) only represent about 3% of the total particle content of the culture. Most particles present in the culture medium had diameters varying between 250 and 350 nm (data not shown), and they sedimented during centrifugation of the cells. However, in cells of R. rubrum observed under the electron microscope the diameter of the particles varied between 35 and 45 nm, which corresponds to the size of the smallest particles isolated from the culture medium (Fig. 5C). EDAX of both chemically and biologically produced Se° particles shows the expected emission lines for selenium at 1.37, 11.22, and 12.49 keV corresponding to the SeLα, SeKα, and SeKβ transitions, respectively (Fig. 6). No additional sharp emission lines were present. A slightly larger background was observed for the biological particles (Fig. 6A) than for the abiotically produced particles (Fig. 6B). In the chemical reduction of selenite with glutathione much more selenite was reduced with a GSH:selenite ratio of 4:1 compared with a ratio of 2:1. This strongly supports the process outlined in Reaction 1 in the Introduction. However, the rapid increase in the production of O-2 within the 1st min of the reaction (as determined by cytochrome c reduction) and the concomitant formation of selenodiglutathione infer that the formation of oxygen radicals occurs during the first step of the reaction. The observed proportionality between inhibition of cytochrome c reduction and SOD concentration in the reaction mixture gives evidence that cytochrome c was reduced by the superoxide anion. These results suggest that Reaction 1 proposed by Painter (8Painter E.P. Chem. Rev. 1941; 28: 179-213Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and Ganther (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) must be modified to take into account the formation of O-2. We propose to describe the first step of the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione by Reaction 4. 6GSH+3SeO32−+4H+→3GS-Se-SG+2O2−+5H2O (REACTION 4) According to Bébien et al. (5Bébien M. Lagniel G. Garin J. Touati D. Verméglio A. Labarre J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), who observed a large induction of two types of SOD in E. coli grown in the presence of selenite, we propose that Reaction 4 also takes place in this organism and that it may constitute the first step of the dissimilatory reduction of selenite in all cells containing high levels of glutathione and performing intracellular selenite reduction. In the chemical reaction the superoxide spontaneously dismutates into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (13McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to Reaction 5. O2−+O2−+2H+→O2+H2O2 (REACTION 5) The fate of the hydrogen peroxide formed in this reaction is described below. In the biological reduction (Fig. 7) the highly reactive super-oxide produced during the first step of the reaction undergoes a cascade of degradation reactions catalyzed by enzymes that are induced during oxidative stress (SOD, catalase, peroxidase, and probably also cytochrome(s)). These enzymes catalyze the rapid disappearance of oxygen radicals, thus preventing oxidative damage and preserving metabolic functions and cell integrity. In a second step GS-Se-SG is converted to GS-Se- and reduced glutathione (GSH) by the glutathione reductase as described by Ganther (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and outlined in Reaction 2 in the Introduction. In a last step, the unstable selenopersulfide converts into the reduced glutathione and elemental selenium according to Reaction 3 in the Introduction. It is not known whether this reaction is enzymatically catalyzed or not. A comprehensive view of the entire process is summarized in Fig. 7. In cultures of many species of α, β, or γ proteobacteria amended with up to 1–2 mm selenite the reaction is performed to completion (see, e.g.6Bébien M. Chauvin J.-P. Adriano J.-M. Grosse S. Verméglio A. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4440-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Kessi J. Ramuz M. Wehrli E. Spycher M. Bachofen R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roux M. Sarret G. Pignot-Paintrand I. Fontecave M. Coves J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Lortie L. Gould W.D. Rajan S. McCready R.G.L. Cheng K.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 4042-4044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The threshold of selenite concentration that the cells are able to reduce may reflect, at least in part, the large requirement of oxidative stress enzymes for this process. Another challenge the cells are confronted with in the presence of selenite is the uptake of the oxyanions into the cytoplasm. Unregulated uptake would give rise to fast reactions of selenite with -SH groups of proteins, which would affect metabolic functions. Damages observed in keratine-rich tissues by higher organisms (1Ohlendorf H.M. Jacobs L.W. Selenium in Agriculture and the Environment. American Society for Agronomy, Madison, WI1989: 133-177Google Scholar, 2Läuchli A. Bot. Acta. 1993; 106: 455-468Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3O'Toole D. Raisbeck M.F. Frankenberger W.T. Engberg R.A. Environmental Chemistry of Selenium. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 355-395Google Scholar) may be the result of the absence of an efficient protective mechanism to prevent the penetration of selenite into the cell. The abiotic degradation of selenodiglutathione (Fig. 8) may be described by Reaction 6. GS-Se-SG+GSH⇆GS-Se−+H++GSSG (REACTION 6) In contrast to the biological reaction (Reaction 2), in which the reduced glutathione is continually regenerated by the action of the glutathione reductase, the abiotic reaction leads to an accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), which slows down the reaction rate. The last step of the abiotic reaction, the dismutation of GS-Se- to GSH and Se°, probably does not differ from that of the biological process. Another important difference between the abiotic and the biotic process is the persistence of the highly reactive peroxide anion in the reaction mixture, which gives rise to a cascade of secondary reactions that are summarized in Fig. 8. Because Se° can be reoxidized by H2O2 (Reaction 9) the yield of the abiotic reduction of selenite to elemental selenium largely depends on the relative rate of formation and degradation of H2O2 (Reactions 7 and 8, respectively). Because Reactions 6 and 7 proceed competitively (Fig. 8), the rate of formation of H2O2 also depends on the rate of Reaction 6, i.e. the supply of GSH. Reaction 7 is supported by the observed inhibition of GS-Se-SG degradation in the presence of SOD, i.e. the removal of the superoxide anion (O-2). This observation indicates that the superoxide anion participates in the transformation of selenodiglutathione to GS-Se-, according to Reaction 7. GS-Se-SG+2O2−+4H2O+H+→GS-Se−+GSH+4H2O2 (REACTION 7) Inhibition of the degradation of selenodiglutathione by SOD combined with the rapid degradation of the superoxide anion during the first minutes of the reaction, as shown in Fig. 3, suggests that the fast degradation of superoxide and selenodiglutathione proceeds according to Reaction 7. Spontaneous dismutation of the superoxide anion proceeds significantly slower (13McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of this last reaction possibly corresponds to the second, slower step of the superoxide degradation shown in Fig. 3. The abiotic degradation of hydrogen peroxide takes place in two ways. 1) The fast decrease of H2O2 concentrations in the presence of GSH (see “Results” and Ref. 21Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicates that hydrogen peroxide can be detoxified through reduction by GSH according to Reaction 8. 2GSH+H2O2⇆GSSG+2H2O (REACTION 8) 2) In agreement with the observed decrease of Se° in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 8) we propose Reaction 9. Se°+4H2O2→SeO32−+3H2O+O2+2H+ (REACTION 9) Considering that selenodiglutathione is a moderately stable intermediate that can be isolated from the reaction mixture (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 22Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that the oxidized glutathione accumulates in the reaction mixture, we propose that Reaction 6 develops more slowly than Reaction 7 (Fig. 8). This would promote the formation of hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent loss of Se° (Reaction 9) as shown in the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione (Fig. 4). Close correlations between the half-life of selenite, the rate of superoxide degradation, and the initiation of Se° particle formation at various initial selenite concentrations strongly support Reactions 3, 4, and 7 (Table I). In addition to Reactions 7 and 8, which describe the fast degradation of the superoxide anion shown in Fig. 3, we have to consider the spontaneous dismutation of O-2 (Reaction 5), which may represent the slower step of the reaction (Fig. 3). Because elemental oxygen (O2) was only detected in micromolar amounts in the abiotic reaction sequence we propose that the oxygen produced by this reaction was consumed in the radical chain of reactions involving O-2, O2, and GSH, as described by Winterbourn and Metodiewa (21Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Through these reactions GSH and O2 are consumed, and O-2 is regenerated, maintaining the consumption of reduced glutathione as long as O-2 and O2 are present. The entire process is summarized in Reaction 10. O2−+4GSH+O2→2GSSG+2H2O+O2− (REACTION 10) The efficiency of Reaction 10 depends on pH, pO2, and the superoxide generation rate. The reaction is very fast at neutral pH, in air, a thiol concentration of about 0.5 mm, and superoxide production rates in the μmol/min range. Estimates of the rate constants for GSH under these conditions are in the range of 103m-1 s-1 (21Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the GSH disappearance according to Reaction 10 will proceed slowly in the presence of the low O2 concentrations (9 μm) and the O-2 generation rates (10–180 μmol/ml/min) measured in our experiments. Consumption of GSH and production of GSSG according to Reaction 10 will contribute to lower the rate and the yield of the processes described by Reactions 6 and 8 (Fig. 8). This explains the weak enhancement of the yield of Se° in the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione when the GSH:selenite ratio is increased from 4:1 to 8:1 (Fig. 4). Considering 1) the high GSH levels (1–10 mm) in the cytoplasm of various α, β, and γ proteobacteria (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar, 23Apontoweil P. Berends W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 2Läuchli A. Bot. Acta. 1993; 106: 455-468Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar) the high efficiency of the glutathione reductase in catalyzing the degradation of the selenodiglutathione to selenopersulfide and oxidized glutathione (9Ganther H.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Reaction 2), 3O'Toole D. Raisbeck M.F. Frankenberger W.T. Engberg R.A. Environmental Chemistry of Selenium. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 355-395Google Scholar) the high reaction rate observed for selenite reduction by GSH under abiotic conditions (Reaction 4), 4Kramer G.F. Ames B.N. Mutat. Res. 1988; 201: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) the decrease of the selenite reduction rate in R. rubrum with decreased glutathione levels,2 and 5) the production of oxygen radicals in both the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione and the reaction mediated by E. coli, we suggest that glutathione may be the electron donor in the dissimilatory reduction of selenite in organisms performing this reaction intracellularly and containing high GSH levels in their cytoplasm. Other biomolecules containing -SH groups may also be involved in the reduction. The reduction of selenite and selenodiglutathione by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system of E. coli was described previously (24Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Involvement of this enzymatic system in the biological dissimilatory reduction of selenite is supported by the observed induction of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in cultures of E. coli amended with millimolar levels of selenite (5Bébien M. Lagniel G. Garin J. Touati D. Verméglio A. Labarre J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the bacterial domain only the cyanobacteria and representatives of the α, β, and γ groups of the proteobacteria are able to synthesize glutathione (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of glutathione in the dissimilatory reduction of selenite, various proteobacteria belonging to these groups have been shown to tolerate millimolar levels of selenite (6Bébien M. Chauvin J.-P. Adriano J.-M. Grosse S. Verméglio A. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4440-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Kessi J. Ramuz M. Wehrli E. Spycher M. Bachofen R. Appl.

Microbiol. 1992; 58: 4042-4044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a broad survey of selenite tolerance in bacteria (63 species) demonstrated that most species (81%) are not able to grow in the presence of 0.2 mm selenite (25Lapage S.P. Bascomb S. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1968; 31: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because the proposed mechanism of selenite reduction releases highly reactive oxygen species it cannot take place in strict anaerobes, which do not synthesize oxidative stress enzymes. A different mechanism of selenite reduction may take place in Gram-positive bacteria, which are not able to synthesize glutathione (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar) but can tolerate high levels of selenite. Bacillus subtilis, for example, has been shown to grow in the presence of up to 5 mm selenite (26Garbisu C. Gonzalez S. Yang W.-H. Yee B.C. Carlson D.L. Yee A. Smith N.R. Otero R. Buchanan B.B. Leighton T. BioFactors. 1995; 5: 29-37PubMed Google Scholar). As for proteobacteria, however, a significant induction of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase has been observed in B. subtilis exposed to millimolar concentrations of selenite (27Garbisu C. Carlson D. Adamkiewicz M. Yee B.C. Wong J.H. Resto E. Leighton T. Buchanan B.B. BioFactors. 1999; 10: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and, generally, Gram-positive bacteria accumulate coenzyme A and other organic compounds containing disulfide groups at millimolar levels (7Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 69-77Google Scholar). Additionally, a disulfide reductase capable of reducing coenzyme A disulfide and other related disulfides is produced by bacilli (28Swerdlow R.D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the mechanism of selenite reduction in these bacteria may be similar to that proposed for the proteobacteria with a high glutathione level. It must also be mentioned that reduction of disulfides can be catalyzed by selenols, which may be present in certain cells as secondary products of the selenium metabolism (29Singh R. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 6931-6933Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for a high tolerance toward selenite may therefore be a high cytoplasmic level of disulfide-containing molecules, catalysts for the reduction of disulfides, and a functional oxidative stress protection system. The small sizes of the Se° particles (35–45 nm) present in cells of R. rubrum grown in the presence of selenite (Fig. 5C) suggest that the smallest particles purified from the culture medium represent the original size of biologically produced Se° particles. The larger particles (250–300 nm), which sediment during centrifugation of the cells, are likely produced by aggregation of the 35–45-nm particles (Fig. 5A). EDAX provides evidence that Se° particles purified from both the bacterial cultures and from the chemical reaction mixtures contain nearly pure selenium. The larger background observed in the biological particles is possibly caused by the presence of small amounts of organic material present in the biological particles. We are presently analyzing these particles in more detail. The evidence for the formation of superoxide anions during the abiotic reduction of selenite with glutathione provided in this work is consistent with the observed production of superoxide in E. coli grown in the presence of selenite (5Bébien M. Lagniel G. Garin J. Touati D. Verméglio A. Labarre J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It lends support to the hypothesis that glutathione may be involved in the dissimilatory reduction of selenite in organisms containing high levels of glutathione. Involvement of glutathione in the dissimilatory reduction of selenite in proteobacteria is also consistent with the observed decrease of the selenite reduction rate in R. rubrum containing low levels of glutathione.2"

Gap junctions are highly dynamic, and modulation of the connexin turnover rate is considered to play an important role in the regulation of gap junctional intercellular communication. In the present study, we show that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces ubiquitination of connexin-43 (Cx43) in IAR20 rat liver epithelial cells. The accelerated ubiquitination of Cx43 in response to TPA occurred concomitantly with Cx43 hyperphosphorylation and inhibition of cell-cell communication via gap junctions. The TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 was mediated via protein kinase C and partly involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Following ubiquitination, Cx43 was internalized and degraded. The loss of Cx43 protein was counteracted by ammonium chloride, indicating that acidification of internalized Cx43 gap junctions is a prerequisite for its degradation. Furthermore, the Cx43 degradation was partly counteracted by leupeptin, an inhibitor of cathepsin B, H, and L. Cx43 internalization and subsequent degradation were blocked by inhibitors of the proteasome. Evidence is provided that Cx43 is modified by multiple monoubiquitins rather than a polyubiquitin chain in response to TPA. Moreover, the TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 was blocked by proteasomal inhibitors. Taken together, the data indicate that Cx43 ubiquitination is a highly regulated process. Moreover, the results suggest that the proteasome might play an indirect role in Cx43 degradation by affecting the level of monoubiquitin conjugation and trafficking of Cx43 to endosomal compartments.

Connexins constitute a family of transmembrane proteins that form channels between neighboring cells.

Previous work has shown that modulation of the Cx43 turnover rate might be important in the regulation of GJIC (14Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Degradation of Cx43 has been shown to involve both the lysosome and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (14Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol.

Lysosomes are considered to be involved in the destruction of internalized gap junctions, as well as in degrading Cx43 delivered from early secretory compartments (17Jordan K. Chodock R. Hand A.R. Laird D.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 763-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Larsen W.J. Hai N. Tissue Cell. 1978; 10: 585-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Naus C.C. Hearn S. Zhu D. Nicholson B.J.

The proteasome is required for the degradation of newly synthesized Cx43 during endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (21VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies indicate that proteasomal activity is required for internalization of Cx43 at the plasma membrane (14Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp.

However, the mechanism by which proteasomal inhibition interferes with Cx43 internalization is currently unknown. Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome system occurs via two distinct and successive steps. First, the target protein is conjugated to polyubiquitin chains on lysines. Second, the ubiquitin-conjugated protein is recognized by the 26 S proteasome, a large, multicatalytic protease, and degraded (24Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In contrast to polyubiquitin chains, monoubiquitin is involved in regulating proteins by proteasome-independent processes. One characterized function of monoubiquitin is as a signal for internalization and subsequent endosomal sorting of many cell surface proteins (25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinases were recently found to be monoubiquitinated at multiple sites in response to ligand binding (26Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 27Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In these cases, a single ubiquitin is sufficient for both receptor internalization and subsequent degradation. Targeting of proteins for ubiquitination is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases. Often, poly- or monoubiquitination of proteins is preceded by phosphorylation that generates a docking site for the E3 ligase (25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). For instance, the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is monoubiquitinated and undergoes endocytosis after activation of the tyrosine kinase Src (28Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Many growth factors, viral oncogenes, and carcinogenic chemicals influence gap junction channels (29Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces a rapid phosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC in a number of cell types (30Berthoud V.M. Ledbetter M.L. Hertzberg E.L. Saez J.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 40-50PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brissette J.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In many cell types, the TPA-induced block in GJIC is followed by loss of Cx43 gap junction plaques at the plasma membrane (34Rivedal E. Yamasaki H. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Asamoto M. Oyamada M. el Aoumari A. Gros D. Yamasaki H. Mol.

Cell Res. 1982; 139: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TPA has also been reported to cause a reduction in the Cx43 protein level (38Oh S.Y. Grupen C.G. Murray A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the TPA-induced delocalization and loss of Cx43 protein are poorly understood. We have previously reported that Cx43 is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane in response to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation (23Leithe E. Rivedal E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that Cx43 is ubiquitinated after TPA treatment, in a protein kinase C (PKC) dependent manner. The TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 is associated with internalization and degradation of Cx43. We provide evidence that TPA induces conjugation of multiple monoubiquitins rather than a polyubiquitin chain on Cx43. Furthermore, we show that proteasomal inhibitors counteract the TPA-induced Cx43 ubiquitination. Thus the proteasome might play an indirect role in Cx43 internalization and degradation by affecting the level of Cx43 monoubiquitination and subsequent trafficking of Cx43 to endosomal compartments. Reagents and Antibodies—TPA, epidermal growth factor (EGF), MG132, lactacystin, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), leupeptin, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. The purified polyubiquitin chain was obtained from Affinity Research Products (Exeter, UK). In this chain, ubiquitin is polymerized through lysine 48. The ubiquitin moiety carries a lysine to arginine mutation at residue 29 to block ubiquitin polymerization through this lysine. The anti-Cx43 antiserum was made in rabbits injected with a synthetic peptide consisting of the 20 C-terminal amino acids of Cx43 (39Rivedal E. Mollerup S. Haugen A. Vikhamar G. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The P4D1 (mouse IgG) and FK1 (mouse IgM) anti-ubiquitin antibodies were obtained from Babco (Covance, CA) and Affinity Research Products (Exeter, UK), respectively. Both antibodies have been extensively characterized by one-dimensional Western blotting (26Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat.

Anti-β-catenin (mouse IgG) and anti-EGF receptor (mouse IgG) were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-EGF receptor (mouse IgG, catalog number sc-120) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase were from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-mouse IgM were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Cell Culture and Treatment—The rat liver epithelial cell line IAR20 was obtained from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Lyon, France). The cells were originally isolated from normal inbred BD-IV rats and express endogenous Cx43 (35Asamoto M. Oyamada M. el Aoumari A. Gros D. Yamasaki H. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43Montesano R. Drevon C. Kuroki T. Saint V.L. Handleman S. Sanford K.K. DeFeo D. Weinstein I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 59: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A431 and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were plated onto 60-mm (10 × 105) or 100-mm (27 × 105) Petri dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) 48 h prior to experiments. The growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal bovine serum after 24 h. Determination of GJIC by Quantitative Scrape Loading—Quantitative scrape loading was performed as described previously (44Leithe E. Cruciani V. Sanner T. Mikalsen S.O. Rivedal E. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 45Opsahl H. Rivedal E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the confluent cell layer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with 0.05% (w/v) Lucifer Yellow (Sigma) dissolved in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and cut with a surgical scalpel. After 3.5 min the Lucifer Yellow solution was removed and the dishes were rinsed four times with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and mounted with a glass coverslip. Digital monochrome images were acquired by a COHU 4912 charge-coupled device camera (COHU, Inc., San Diego, CA) and a Scion LG-3 frame grabber card (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Analysis was conducted using NIH Image software. The levels of GJIC were determined as a relative area of dye coupled cells. Exposing the cells to 30 μm chlordane for 1 h was shown to result in a complete block of GJIC. Thus, the fluorescent cells following such exposure had obtained the dye directly through the scrape process and were used to define zero GJIC. For each treatment, 45 micrographs from three independent experiments were analyzed. The data are presented as means ± S.E. relative to control. Statistically significant differences between samples in a given experiment were identified using one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with PBS and scraped in 500 μl of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 15% w/v glycerol, 3% w/v SDS, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue and 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell lysates were sonicated and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (39Rivedal E. Mollerup S. Haugen A. Vikhamar G. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The blotting membranes were developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad) or chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling Technology). In some experiments, the intensity of Cx43 bands was quantified using Scion Image (Scion Corporation). Statistically significant differences between samples were identified using analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. Immunoprecipitation—Cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were treated as indicated and washed once with ice-cold PBS prior to treatment with lysis buffer (1× PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.45% sodium lauroyl sarcosine, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), and 2 mm EDTA) for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min with shaking. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was collected. To each aliquot was added anti-Cx43, anti-EGF receptor (sc-120), or anti β-catenin antibodies together with protein A-Sepharose beads. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with shaking. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer. After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS electrophoresis buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to protein separation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The IAR20 cell monolayer was fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with PBS containing 5% (w/v) dried milk and 0.1% Tween for 1 h and subsequently with anti-Cx43 for 1 h and then were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies for 1 h. The cells were mounted with Mowiol. Immunofluorescence images were captured using a Nikon E800 microscope with a Spot-2 Camera. TPA Induces Ubiquitination of Cx43—In gap junctional communication-competent cells, Cx43 usually forms three major bands in SDS-PAGE reflecting different phosphorylation states of Cx43. The fastest migrating band of Cx43, termed Cx43-P0, is converted to two slower migrating species, Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2, probably by phosphorylation on serine residues (46Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 47Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). TPA induced rapid hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 in IAR20 cells, seen as an increase in the Cx43-P2 band level and a loss of the Cx43-P0 and Cx43-P1 bands (Fig. 1A). The TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 was transient, and after 4 h of TPA treatment the level of the Cx43-P2 band was reduced and the level of the Cx43-P0 and Cx43-P1 bands recovered. In agreement with previous studies, TPA induced a rapid and transient inhibition of GJIC between IAR20 cells (Ref. 44Leithe E. Cruciani V. Sanner T. Mikalsen S.O. Rivedal E. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Covalent binding of ubiquitin serves as a signal for regulating the turnover of several plasma membrane proteins (25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 48Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC in response to EGF treatment is accompanied with increased Cx43 ubiquitination (23Leithe E. Rivedal E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here, we wanted to investigate whether the Cx43 ubiquitination level is affected by exposure to TPA. Immunoprecipitation of Cx43 and subsequent Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies revealed that the level of Cx43 ubiquitination was strongly increased in response to TPA treatment (Fig. 1B). As control, a ubiquitin smear was not detected when anti-Cx43 antibodies were replaced with preimmune serum. The TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 was transient and occurred concomitantly with the Cx43 hyperphosphorylation. Next we asked which signaling pathways are involved in the ubiquitination of Cx43 in response to TPA treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, the change in the Cx43 phosphorylation status and GJIC in response to TPA treatment was partly counteracted by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, indicating that PKC is involved in TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC in IAR20 cells. The effect of TPA on Cx43 phosphorylation status and GJIC was also partly counteracted by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. These observations are in accordance with previous studies in other cell types, indicating that TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 and GJIC inhibition involves the MAPK signaling pathway (49Rivedal E. Opsahl H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 50Ruch R.J. Trosko J.E. Madhukar B.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 was completely counteracted by GF109203X, indicating that this modification is mediated via PKC (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the TPA-induced ubiquitination of Cx43 was partly counteracted by PD98059, indicating a partial involvement of the MAPK pathway. TPA Induces Cx43 Internalization and Degradation—Next we investigated the fate of Cx43 after its TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation and ubiquitination. It has been shown previously that the Cx43-P0 isoform of Cx43 is localized in the Golgi region, whereas Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2 are mainly localized in the plasma membrane (46Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). As determined by fluorescence microscopy, most Cx43 protein in IAR20 cells is arranged as gap junctions at the plasma membrane, whereas faint Cx43 staining is also found in the Golgi area (Fig. 3A). This localization pattern of Cx43 is in accordance with the Western blot experiments showing that most Cx43 is in the Cx43-P1 or Cx43-P2 level (Fig. 1A). TPA treatment for 30 min induced disorganization of Cx43 gap junctions and internalization of Cx43 from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 3B). This TPA-induced loss of Cx43 gap junction plaques was strongly counteracted by GF109203X (Fig. 3C) and partly counteracted by PD98059 (Fig. 3D). It should be noted that longer incubations with GF109203X alone induced ubiquitination and internalization of Cx43 by an unknown mechanism. 2E. Leithe and E. Rivedal, unpublished observations. Together, these results indicate that the TPA-induced internalization of Cx43 gap junction plaques is largely mediated via PKC and that the MAPK pathway is partly involved in this process in IAR20 cells. TPA treatment alone for 60 min caused a nearly complete loss of Cx43 immunofluorescence staining except for a faint signal in the perinuclear area (Fig. 4). Internalized, annular gap junctions have previously been reported to be acidic (18Larsen W.J. Hai N. Tissue Cell. 1978; 10: 585-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether acidification is required for the TPA-induced loss of Cx43 staining, TPA was preincubated with ammonium chloride, which elevates the endosomal pH (51Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Cx43 staining remained in intracellular vesicles. Thus, loss of Cx43 protein in response to TPA treatment appears to require acidification of internalized Cx43 annular gap junctions. The loss of Cx43 staining observed after 60 min of TPA treatment was partly counteracted by leupeptin, an inhibitor of cathepsins B, H, and L. Several studies have shown that Cx43 internalization is counteracted by proteasomal inhibitors (16Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Qin H. Shao Q. Igdoura S.A. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30005-30014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Leithe E. Rivedal E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The TPA-induced internalization of Cx43 in IAR20 cells was partly counteracted by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with the mechanistically distinct proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin.2 Thus, proteasomal activity appears to be required for Cx43 internalization in response to TPA treatment. Interestingly, although the TPA-induced internalization of Cx43 was partly blocked by MG132, after 60 min of cotreatment with TPA and MG132 most Cx43 was not found in plaques as in untreated cells but rather was homogenously distributed at the plasma membrane, indicative of disorganization of gap junction plaques. To further examine the mechanisms underlying the loss of Cx43 protein in response to TPA treatment, the Cx43 protein level was examined by Western blotting. When TPA was coincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, Cx43 protein was rapidly lost compared with treatment with cycloheximide alone (Fig. 5, A and B). In accordance with the immunofluorescence data in Fig. 4, this loss was counteracted by ammonium chloride. Under these conditions, a low molecular weight band was observed after 2 h possibly representing incompletely degraded Cx43. The TPA-induced loss of Cx43 was only slightly counteracted by preincubation with leupeptin. Under these conditions we did not observe accumulation of low molecular weight Cx43 degradation products. Together, these results indicate that TPA-induced degradation of Cx43 in IAR20 cells involves lysosomes but also that other non-lysosomal proteases might play a role in the degradation process. In accordance with the immunofluorescence data, the TPA-induced loss in the Cx43 protein level was strongly counteracted by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Under these conditions, Cx43 remained in the P2 status at the time points investigated. Evidence That Cx43 Is Modified by Multiple Monoubiquitins in Response to TPA Treatment—The role of ubiquitin in the function and intracellular trafficking of Cx43 is not known. Conjugation of polyubiquitin chains at least four subunits long mediate recognition and proteasomal degradation of proteins (52Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 53Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A.

In contrast, conjugation of monoubiquitin is involved in regulating localization and activity of proteins by proteasome-independent processes (25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

ECM proteins such as those of the SIBLING family (small integrin-binding ligand glycoprotein) could possess inherent growth factor activity. In this study, we demonstrate that exon 5 of dentin matrix protein 3 (phosphophoryn (PP)), a non-collagenous dentin ECM protein and SIBLING protein family member, up-regulates osteoblast marker genes in primary human adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1), and a mouse fibroblastic cell line (NIH3T3). Quantitative real-time PCR technology was used to quantify gene expression levels of bone markers such as Runx2, Osx (Osterix), bone/liver/kidney Alp (alkaline phosphatase), Ocn (osteocalcin), and Bsp (bone sialoprotein) in response to recombinant PP and stably transfected PP. PP up-regulated Runx2, Osx, and Ocn gene expression. PP increased OCN protein production in hMSCs and MC3T3-E1. ALP activity and calcium deposition was increased by PP in hMSC. Furthermore, an αvβ3 integrin-blocking antibody significantly inhibited recombinant PP-induced expression of Runx2 in hMSCs, suggesting that signaling by PP is mediated through the integrin pathway. PP was also shown to activate p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, three components of the MAPK pathway. These data demonstrate a novel signaling function for PP in cell differentiation beyond the hypothesized role of PP in biomineralization.

A particular group of ECM proteins, the SIBLING protein family consisting of bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), and dentin matrix protein 3 (DMP-3), also called dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) (5Fisher L.W.

Although not extremely similar in protein sequence, members of the SIBLING family share common traits such as RGD integrin-binding domains and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (5Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). As it was shown more extensively in systems other than bone or dentin, the ECM plays an important role in growth factor function (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 4Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 6Bissell M.J.

This cooperative/synergistic process can involve a convergence of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by ECM proteins and growth factors and becomes important in tissue regeneration. Reports in the literature show evidence of type I collagen involvement in the ECM-directed differentiation of bone cells (8Jikko A. Harris S.E. Chen D. Mendrick D.L. Damsky C.H. J. Bone Miner.

Type I collagen regulates BMP-2 activity via an interaction with α1β2 integrins (8Jikko A. Harris S.E. Chen D. Mendrick D.L. Damsky C.H. J. Bone Miner.

BMP-7 and type I collagen demonstrated a synergistic activation of Ocn and Bsp gene expression via the MAPK pathway for accelerated osteogenesis (11Xiao G. Gopalakrishnan R. Jiang D. Reith E. Benson M.D. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is the major protein constituent of the bone and dentin ECM, comprising ∼90% of the total protein matrix (9Shi S. Kirk M. Kahn A.J. J. Bone Miner.

The remaining 5–10% is composed of non-collagenous proteins (NCPs), which have proposed functions in the formation of mineralized tissues (12Anselme K.

Bone and dentin formation share many properties, among which are several common ECM proteins (13Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem.

OCN, MEPE, osteonectin (ON), OPN, BSP, DMP-1 and DMP-3 are all acidic NCPs that possess Ca2+ and hydroxyapatite (HA) binding properties (16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T.

Initiation, nucleation, and inhibition of HA crystal growth is rigorously controlled by the NCPs (13Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem.

However, little is known regarding the role of these ECM proteins in signaling related to tissue morphogenesis. OPN (25Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30–31: 92-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MEPE (26Hayashibara T. Hiraga T. Yi B. Nomizu M. Kumagai Y. Nishimura R. Yoneda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and DMP-1 (15Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have been shown to regulate gene expression; thus there is building interest in the NCPs, specifically the SIBLINGS, and how they might also contribute to intracellular activities and synergize with growth factors (5Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). DMP-1, a SIBLING protein and NCP localized in dentin and bone ECM, was shown to stimulate mouse embryonic mesenchymal stem cells toward an osteoblastic lineage (15Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DMP-1 in C3H101/2 and MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in up-regulation of Runx2, Ocn, Bsp, Alp, On, and Opn and increased mineralized nodule formation (15Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DMP-1 is a highly acidic, phosphorylated protein consisting mainly of glutamic acid, serine, and aspartic acid residues (27George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments have shown that DMP-1 is expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and odontoblasts (28D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Another dentin ECM protein, phosphophoryn (PP), a cleavage product of DSPP (16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), has been implicated as a regulator of mineral crystal formation (16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X.

Bone Miner. 1990; 11: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). DSPP is localized to chromosome 4, linking mutations in the gene to dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (15Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although initially thought to be tooth-specific, the Dspp message is also localized in mouse calvaria and rat tibia, although at a much lower levels (30Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Tsujigiwa H. Nagatsuka H. Nagai N. Butler W.T. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). PP is the most abundant NCP in dentin ECM, comprising ∼50% of the ECM protein sector (16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Like other proteins in the bone/dentin microenvironment, PP is highly phosphorylated and anionic in character (18Veis A. Perry A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PP is exceedingly rich in aspartic acid and serine residues, and ∼85–90% of the serine residues are phosphorylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Linde A. Bhown M. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5931-5942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Richardson W.S. Munksgaard E.C. Butler W.T. J. Biol.

Odontoblasts secrete PP along the mineralization front (21MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Gorter de Vries I.

Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and, typical of other NCPs, the physiochemical properties of PP dictate high affinity for Ca2+, which implicates a role in the nucleation or modulation of HA crystal formation (13Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22Zanetti M. de Bernard B. Jontell M. Linde A. Eur. J.

An RGD domain is present at the N-terminal domain of PP (13Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19Veis A. Wei K. Sfeir C. George A. Malone J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting an auxiliary function in ECM-cell communication and in the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways. PP, like DMP-1, is a SIBLING protein family member and could have an important regulatory role in osteogenic signaling and growth factor activity. Consequently, we hypothesized that PP is a signaling molecule involved in the formation of mineralized tissues. To test this hypothesis, we quantified expression of Runx2, Osx, Ocn, and Bsp and measured phenotypic outcome by OCN protein release, ALP activity, and mineral deposition. In addition, PP might have alternative roles based on cell type and post-translational modifications. Therefore, we analyzed the outcome of PP treatment using a recombinant form of PP (non-phosphorylated) in three independent cell types, hMSC, MC3T3-E1, and NIH3T3. We also created a stably transfected NIH3T3 cell line that secretes PP. Our rationale was to assess the signaling role of PP that could be phosphorylated by the stably transfected fibroblasts. Here, we report that PP, an NCP and SIBLING protein, drives cell differentiation through integrin signaling and activation of the MAPK pathway. Materials—Vectors for the production of recombinant PP (pGEX) and stable transfection (pShooter-ER) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Invitrogen, respectively. BL21 cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Luria-Bertani medium, ampicillin and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were obtained from Sigma.

Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Generation of Recombinant PP and Transfected Cell Line—Isolated mouse genomic PP was used as a template to amplify exon 5 by PCR. The primers used were designed with SalI and XbaI at the 5′-ends of the gene-specific sequence (bold letters). In addition we inserted five random bases 5′ to the restriction site to allow SalI and XbaI digestions. The primers used were 5′-CTAATGTCGACATGGAGAGTGGCAGCCGTGGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCATTCTAGATTAAAGCACCCGCCATTCAAATCG 3′ (reverse). The thermocycling conditions were three cycles of 94 °C for 70 s (denaturation), 52 °C for 70 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 2 min (extension) followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 70 s (denaturation), 62 °C for 70 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 2 min (extension). The obtained PCR fragment was inserted into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and transformed into the bacterial host BL21. Cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin for 4 h at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The bacterial lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied directly to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After washing with PBS, the glutathione S-transferase-bound protein was eluted with thrombin. Thrombin was removed from eluates with p-aminobenzamidine immobilized on a Sepharose 4 Fast Flow matrix. The purified protein was electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel to verify the molecular mass (Fig. 1), and the amino acid composition matched the cloned sequence. Recombinant PP (rPP) was stored at –80 °C until use. The PP PCR product was also inserted into the pShooter-ER vector and transfected into NIH3T3 using the FuGENE 6 Transfection reagent. Stably transfected cells were selected using G418. Expression of the PP gene was verified by reverse transcription PCR, and PP protein secretion was verified by dot blot analysis (data not shown). The anti-PP was a generous gift from Dr. Arthur Veis at Northwestern University (39Veis A. Barss J. Dahl T. Rahima M. Stock S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 59: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PP produced by stably transfected NIH3T3 is denoted tPP. Cell Culture—hMSC, MC3T3-E1, and NIH3T3 were plated in 35-mm culture wells and grown in basal media to ∼70% confluence. The basal medium for stem cells was complete mesenchymal stem cell medium, and for MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 it was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were then treated with either rhBMP-2 (MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3, 50 ng/ml; hMSC, 100 ng/ml) or 50 ng/ml rPP in basal media. The 50 ng/ml rPP concentration was determined based on a pilot experiment using a dose curve of 50, 100, and 250 ng/ml rPP for MC3T3 and NIH3T3 cells. Cells were cultured for 2, 4, and 8 days prior to RNA extraction. Media was renewed every second day. Where noted, hMSCs were also cultured in the presence of 100 nm dexamethasone (dex) as the negative control. We chose these time points to analyze gene expression based on recommendations from the literature (40Frank O. Heim M. Jakob M. Barbero A. Schafer D. Bendik I. Dick W. Heberer M. Martin I. J. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Quantification—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit with DNase I treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA content was determined using the RiboGreen RNA quantification kit. Conventional RNA quantification using 260/280 absorbance readings proved to be too imprecise to match the specificity of qPCR. Total RNA content was photometrically analyzed with a Tecan Spectrafluor plate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 595 nm. RNA concentrations were calculated based on a standard curve of control ribosomal RNA. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Cells were harvested from the culture treatments at the time points described above. After extraction and quantification of RNA, quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis was carried out using Taqman® one-step RT-PCR Master Mix. 10–30 ng of total RNA were added per 50-μl reaction with sequence-specific primers (200 nm) and Taqman® probes (200 nm). Sequences for all target gene primers and probes are shown in Table I. 18S primers and probes were designed by and purchased from Applied Biosystems. qPCR assays were carried out in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Thermocycling conditions were 48 °C for 30 min (reverse transcription) and 95 °C for 10 min (initial denaturation) followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 45 s (annealing and extension). The threshold was set above the non-template control background and within the linear phase of target gene amplification to calculate the cycle number at which the transcript was detected (denoted CT).Table ISequences for target gene primers and probesGeneAccession numberForward primerReverse primerTaqman® probeHuman Runx2NM_0043485′-AACCCACGAATGCACTATCCA-3′5′-CGGACATACCGAGGGACATG-3′5′-CCTTTACTTACACCCCGCCAGTCACCTC-3′Human OsxAF4779815′-CCCCACCTCTTGCAACCA-3′5′-CCTTCTAGCTGCCCACTATTTCC-3′5′-CCAGCATGTCTTGCCCCAAGATGTCTA-3′Human AlpXM_0018265′-CCGTGGCAACTCTATCTTTGG-3′5′-GCCATACAGGATGGCAGTGA-3′5′-CATGCTGAGTGACACAGACAAGAAGCCC-3′Human OcnNM_0007115′-AGCAAAGGTGCAGCCTTTGT-3′5′-GCGCCTGGGTCTCTTCACT-3′5′-CCTCGCTGCCCTCCTGCTTGG-3′Human BspNM_0049675′-AACGAAGAAAGCGAAGCAGAA-3′5′-TCTGCCTCTGTGCTGTTGGT-3′5′-AAAACGAACAAGGCATAAACGGCACCA-3′Mouse Runx2NM_0098205′-AAATGCCTCCGCTGTTATGAA-3′5′-GCTCCGGCCCACAAATCT-3′5′-AACCAAGTAGCCAGGTTCAACGATCT-3′Mouse OsxNM_1304585′-CCCTTCTCAAGCACCAATGG-3′5′-AGGGTGGGTAGTCATTTGCATAG-3′5′-CAGGCAGTCCTCCGGCCCC-3′Mouse AlpXM_1244245′-CCGATGGCACACCTGCTT-3′5′-GAGGCATACGCCATCACATG-3′5′-CGGCGTCCATGAGCAGAACTACATTCC-3′Mouse OcnNM_0075415′-CCGGGAGCAGTGTGAGCTTA-3′5′-AGGCGGTCTTCAAGCCATACT-3′5′-CCCTGCTTGTGACGAGCTATCAG-3′Mouse BspL202325′-ACCCCAAGCACAGACTTTTGA-3′5′-CTTTCTGCATCTCCAGCCTTCT-3′5′-TTAGCGGCACTCCAACTGCCC-3′ Open table in a new tab Gene expression values were calculated based on the comparative ΔΔCT method (separate tubes) detailed in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin Number 2 (42Applied Biosystems (2001) Applied Biosystems User Bulletin Number 2, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar). For each primers/probe set, validation experiments demonstrated that the efficiencies of target and reference gene amplification were approximately equal; the absolute value of the slope of log input amount versus CT was <0.1. Target genes were normalized to the reference housekeeping gene at 18S. Fold differences were calculated for each treatment group using normalized CT values for the negative control at the appropriate time point as the calibrator. Ocn Gene Expression and Protein Release Analysis—hMSCs were cultured as before for 8 days in basal media or basal media plus 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 or 50 ng/ml rPP and supplemented with 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 for the final 48 h of culture (41Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 were cultured similarly but did not require vitamin D3 for the induction of Ocn. Total RNA was extracted as described above and analyzed via qPCR for Ocn gene expression. For the OCN ELISA, cells were cultured in rhBMP-2- or rPP-containing medium for 8 days. For the final 48 h of culture, cells were cultured in medium without serum added. Conditioned medium was collected and stored at –80 °C until use. The OCN ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. OCN concentration (nanograms per milliliter) was calculated from a standard curve and normalized to the total protein of the cell lysate as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. ALP Activity—Cells were cultured in the above mentioned media supplemented with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate for all treatment groups. hMSCs were additionally supplemented with 100 nm dex. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation after 7, 14, and 28 days in culture. MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 were cultured similarly without dex. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were frozen at –80 °C for at least 2 h prior to ALP activity assays. 5 μl of thawed cell lysates were incubated with 200 μl of ALP 10 reagent from the Sigma diagnostics kit for 30 min at 37 °C. An initial absorbance reading (time 0) was taken at 405 nm prior to a 30-min incubation at 37 °C and following it (time 30). ALP activity was calculated according the manufacturer's instructions. ALP activity was normalized to the total protein of the cell lysate. Quantitative Alizarin Red Staining—hMSCs were cultured as before in 100 nm dex and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate-containing media for 28 days. Cells were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol for 1 h and rinsed with double distilled H20. Cells were stained with 40 mm alizarin red S, pH 4.2, for 10 min with gentle agitation. Cells were rinsed five times with double distilled H20 and then rinsed for 15 min with 1× PBS and gentle agitation. Alizarin red was extracted from fixed cells by treatment with 500 μl 10% CPC for 20 min with gentle agitation. Absorbance of extracted alizarin red in CPC solution was measured at 570 nm. Amount of alizarin red (in micrograms) was determined according to an alizarin red standard curve and normalized to the total protein of the cell lysate. Integrin Blocking—hMSCs were seeded into 35-mm culture wells and allowed to reach ∼70% confluence in basal media. Cells were washed twice with 1× sterile PBS and treated with 15 or 25 μg/ml anti-αvβ3 diluted in serum-free basal media in a total volume of 500 μl. Cells were incubated with rocking for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with 1× sterile PBS and incubated in media containing 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid phosphate and either 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 or 50 ng/ml rPP for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted, and Runx2 gene expression was analyzed via qPCR. MAP Kinase Activation—hMSC and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in triplicate as specified above, except that the cells were cultured overnight in serum-free media prior to rPP treatment.

SHM entails the generation of point mutations in the V region of Ig genes at about million-fold higher rate than the rest of the genome, whereas CSR performs recombinational events with downstream sequences that delete the intervening constant regions (3Honjo T.

The two processes help to generate high affinity antibodies with an optimized fit to an antigen (V gene SHM) along with specialized Ig isotypes (CSR) enabling a more efficient clearing of systemic infections, and both require active transcription (4Peters A.

AID appears to be inactive on RNA, dsDNA, and RNA-DNA hybrid molecules in vitro (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), but it cannot be ruled out that AID might be active on RNA in vivo (18Honjo T. Muramatsu M. Fagarasan S. Immunity. 2004; 20: 659-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). AID simulates hallmark properties of SHM when acting alone on naked DNA in vitro (14Pham P.

An in-depth in vitro analysis geared to reveal the biochemical basis for the distributions of mutations and the favored targeting of deaminations to hot spot motifs is the focus of this paper. We have taken a two-tiered approach to evaluate the biochemical properties of AID: when acting on naked ssDNA and when acting on closed circular dsDNA undergoing transcription. Mutational spectra are obtained using wt AID and mutant forms of AID. The AID mutants were designed to have reduced interactions with DNA and allow us to determine how binding and processivity perturb mutation frequency and specificity. An analysis of mutations performed on ensembles of individual DNA clones has enabled a determination to be made of the precise location, timing, and distribution of AID-initiated mutations. Construction and Purification of AID Mutants and DNA Substrates—Mutant AID proteins (R35E, R24E, R35E/R36D, and a 10-amino acid C-terminal deletion) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the pAcG2T-AID vector (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) as the template. The following primers and their complementary strands were used: 5′-tgg gct aag ggt gag cgt gag acc tac-3′ (for R24E mutant), 5′-tac gta gtg aag gag cgt gac agt gct-3′ (for R35E mutant), 5′-ctg tgc tac gta gtg aag gag gat gac agt gct aca tcc ttt-3′ (for R35E/R36D double mutant), and 5′-ctg tat gag gtt gat gac taa cga gac gca ttt cgt act-3′ (a 10-amino acid C-terminal deletion). The entire coding region of AID in the mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Following the recommended protocol, the mutant plasmids were then cotransfected with linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) to generate recombinant baculovirus encoding for the mutant AID proteins. To express the mutant proteins, Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the corresponding viruses at an multiplicity of infection of 3 for 72 h. Wild type and mutant GST-AID proteins were purified as described previously (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar), with an additional purification step. All AID proteins were fractionated on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Fractions were stored at -80 °C. Our current level of purity for wt AID is about 85% based on analyzing integrated resolved band intensities from a Coomassie-stained denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). The deamination activity was tested for all preparations of AID and mutant AID using the primer extension assay described previously (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The deamination activities (pmol of DNA deaminated/μg of enzyme/min) of the AID preparations on the one specific DNA oligomer, 5′-aaa ggg gaa agC aaa gag gaa agg tga gga ggt-3′, were as follows: 2 pmol/μg/min (R35E), 1.4 pmol/μg/min (R35E/R36D), 1.8 pmol/μg/min (C-terminal), and 0.6 pmol/μg/min (wt AID). There was no activity for the R24E AID mutant above the background for our assay (<6 fmol/μg/min). T7 RNA polymerase was purchased from Promega and ultrapure rNTP from Amersham Biosciences. M13mp2 gapped substrate DNA was prepared as described previously (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). M13mp2T7 covalently closed circular dsDNA substrate was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of M13mp2 phage DNA, in which lacZα nucleotides 279-299 were replaced with a T7 promoter sequence 5′-CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGT-3′. Mutation Analysis of AID-targeted C Deamination in Vitro—Deamination specificities of wt and mutant AID were measured under the following reaction conditions: 30-μl volume, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 ng of gapped DNA (=100 fmol), 0.2 μg of RNase A, and 25-200 ng of wt or mutant AID (=0.5-4 pmol). After incubations for 2.5, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by a double extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Conversions of C → U on the DNA substrate were detected as white or light blue plaques indicating C → T mutations in a lacZα target gene after transfection into uracil glycosylase-deficient E. coli, as described previously (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Transcription-dependent AID deamination specificity was measured using a covalently closed circular dsDNA M13mp2T7 substrate, undergoing active transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. In a typical 30-μl reaction, RNase-activated GST-AID attached to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), 50 ng of dsDNA M13mp2T7 substrate, and 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 containing 250 μm rNTPs was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The DNA product was transfected into ung-E. coli-competent cells and plated on α-complementation host cells. Deamination was analyzed by scoring C → T and G → A mutations in the lacZα gene of light blue and white M13mp2T7 phage. C → T mutations indicate that deamination has occurred on the transcribed strand and G → A mutations on the nontranscribed strand. To verify that transcription was occurring, we labeled the RNA by including [α-32P]ATP in the transcription reaction and followed the synthesis by PAGE using a 6% denaturing gel. Transcription of the supercoiled M13mp2T7 resulted in RNA transcripts with lengths primarily in the range of 300-500 nucleotides. The specificity of AID-catalyzed deamination of C → U on ssDNA recapitulates keynote features of SHM in humans, perhaps most importantly the ability to distinguish between WRC hot spots and SYC cold spots (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To probe the biochemical basis of AID deamination specificity, we have analyzed spectra from large numbers (∼50) of individual clones generated with wt AID and AID mutants. Spectral and Clonal Analysis of Wild Type AID-catalyzed C Deamination Specificity on ssDNA—The WRC hot spot and SYC cold spot distinctions are not absolute because some WRC sites are more reactive than others, even those having identical WR bases preceding a target C residue, and non-hot spot C residues are occasionally deaminated in preference to WRC sites (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Here we generate and analyze wt mutational spectra derived from individual ssDNA phage clones to probe the mechanisms of AID deamination specificity. Human wt AID was incubated for 2.5 and 10 min in the presence of gapped closed circular M13 phage DNA containing a lacZα reporter gene within the single-strand gap (Fig. 2a). C → U deaminations on gapped ssDNA were detected as C → T mutations in M13 phage (white and light blue plaques) (Table I) after transfection into uracil glycosylase-deficient E. coli (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) (see sketch, Fig. 2). The fraction of mutated clones is small, 3.7, 5.1, and 5.2% at 2.5, 5, and 10 min, respectively (Table I), and increases approximately linearly with increased levels of AID for incubations of at least 10 min (data not shown). The average number of deaminations/clone is 13, 17, and 23 at 2.5, 5, and 10 min, respectively (Table I). Half of the mutated clones have large numbers of mutations (20-70 mutations), yet ∼95% of the clones reacted with wt AID are not mutated, even after a 10-min incubation (Table I; see also Ref 14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F.

Open table in a new tab The observation that the fraction of mutated clones saturates after 5 min whereas the average number of mutations/clone increases for at least 10 min suggests that wt AID may be acting processively; the enzyme appears to remain bound and active on one ssDNA substrate for at least 10 min (Table I). As mentioned previously (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar), our experiments using gapped M13 DNA substrate contain roughly equal numbers of unannealed 7.2-kb ssDNA and gapped circular dsDNA substrate. Therefore, it seems unlikely that AID cycles on the same gapped DNA molecule because one might expect that excess ssDNA would act to trap AID that had dissociated from the gapped substrate. Cycling between DNA substrates could, of course, be occurring on a longer time scale, where partitioning between processivity and cycling could depend on such factors as ssDNA sequence and length. Mutational spectra (Fig. 2a, bar graphs) were obtained from sequencing approximately 50 mutant clones at each incubation time. Deamination patterns for individual DNA clones depict the deamination specificity and spatial distribution of mutations at high resolution (Fig. 2a). The 10 clones shown below each spectrum portray the spatial mutational patterns for the most weakly and strongly deaminated DNA (Fig. 2a, sparse and dense clones, respectively). The colored circular symbols show the locations of WRC hot spot sites (red circles), NNC neutral sites (green circles), and SYC cold spot sites (blue circles) in the target region. The colored T symbols denote hot spot, neutral, and cold spot sites where an AID-catalyzed deamination has occurred resulting in a C → T mutation in lacZα. The spectrum for the 2.5-min incubation with wt AID shows that C → T mutations occur prominently in WRC hot spots (Fig. 2a), where 40-60% of the clones have mutations at 11 different WRC sites distributed more or less uniformly over the 365-nucleotide target sequence. Mutations at SYC cold spots occur infrequently; two SYC sites (-202, +109) are mutated in 20% of the clones and five occur in 5-10% of the clones (-204, -171, +56, +69, +98) (Fig. 2a). Neutral C sites having neither WR nor SY 5′-motifs are mutated at frequencies between those for hot and cold spots (Fig. 2a). Deaminations tend to congregate in regions in which WRC hot spots appear to act as nucleation sites for multiple deaminations at nearby intermediate and cold spot motifs (Fig. 2a, dense clones). The increased numbers of C → T mutations in the 10-min clones occur primarily in neutral and cold spots, with smaller numbers of new hot spot sites undergoing deamination at the later time point. In other words, hot spot deaminations occur first and become saturated in time so that they must decrease at longer incubation times relative to neutral and cold spot mutations, a result that is consistent with processive action of AID. Scatter diagrams show that as the number of mutations/clone increases, the mutant fraction occurring in hot spot motifs decreases, but the fractions in cold spot and neutral spot motifs increase (Fig. 2b). Therefore, AID usually deaminates hot spots first and then targets intermediate and cold spots on the same DNA strand at a later time. Clones with the fewest numbers of mutations (about 30% of the mutated clones have between 1 and 10 mutations, located primarily at WRC hot spots) provide additional evidence that AID deaminates hot spots first and only later acts at neutral and cold spots on the same DNA molecule, as opposed to acting at a hot spot on a different DNA molecule. The distribution of mutations in sparsely mutated clones suggests that AID can access distal target C residues, separated by as many as 50-100 bases while remaining bound to a single ssDNA substrate (Fig. 2a, 2.5 min, sparse clones). Clone 1, for example, is deaminated at one hot spot residue and two intermediate residues located on either side of the hot spot, 34 nucleotides to the 3′- and 113 nucleotides to the 5′-side. Clone 2 is deaminated at three widely separated hot spot residues. Mutational clusters anchored by at least one deaminated hot spot C are evident in clones containing at least five deaminated C residues and appear common in clones having at least 10 mutations (Fig. 2a, 2.5 min, dense clones 45-49). However, even in clones containing multiple mutational clusters, there are widely spaced regions, often greater than 50 nucleotides and up to as many as 150 nucleotides, with no deaminated C residues, even though these nonmutated regions contain numerous WRC hot spot motifs (Fig. 2a, 2.5 and 10 min, dense clones 44-49). Evidence that the nondeaminated hot spots are accessible to AID is that some of the clones have mutations at specific hot spots that are absent in other clones (e.g.Fig. 2a, 2.5 min, compare dense clones 48 and 49). We have observed many independent examples that substantiate this point. Mutational Distribution and Specificity of N- and C-terminal AID Mutants—AID is composed of a strong positively charged N-terminal domain (+11 net charge), rich in Lys and Arg, an active site region, and a C-terminal domain that is required for CSR but not SHM (25Ta V.-T. Nagaoka H. Catalan N. Durandy A. Fischer A. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Tashiro J. Ikegawa M. Ito S. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Nat.

Cell. 2003; 12: 501-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). We had proposed (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) that the positively charged N terminus is likely to be involved in ssDNA binding and might thereby be responsible for AID processivity. However, we had not anticipated the major change in AID deamination specificity that occurred when replacing Arg with Glu (R35E) in the N-terminal nonactive site region (Fig. 3a). The strongest hot spot, CAC, site 130, in the R35E AID deamination spectrum is mutated in ∼50% of the clones but does not have a WRC signature motif (Fig. 3b). Note that ∼40% of the clones have a proximal WRC (site 128) mutated. Four of 50 clones contained just one mutation, with three of the four mutated at CAC130 (Fig. 3a, sparse clones 1-3, 5). The remainder of the spectrum generally resembles wt AID; the mutations are clustered near WRC hot spots and are accompanied by sizable gaps between clusters within which hot spots are deaminated in some clones but not in others (Fig. 3a, dense clones). Introducing a second mutation in an adjacent amino acid to form R35E/R36D accentuates the specificity difference with wt AID (Fig. 3c). Although the C → T mutation at CAC130 is mutated in about 50% of the clones, as observed with R35E, deamination of the nearby WRC128 hot spot is attenuated 4-fold, from 40 to 10% for clones with both mutations. The attenuated hot spot makes mutations in the neutral motif CAC130 stand out even more and provides another example of altered mutational specificity (compare C sites 128 (red) and 130 (green) in Fig. 3, c and b). We suggest that the double mutant, as a consequence of its reduced N-terminal charge (+7) compared with wt AID (+11), appears to be less processive and cycles much more readily between DNA substrates. Reduced processivity is implied by a 40% reduction in the average number of deaminations/clone for R35E/R36D compared with wt AID (Table I, 2.5-min incubation). An increase in cycling for the double mutant is indicated by a significant increase in the ratio of mutated to nonmutated clones with increasing length of incubation. At 2.5 min, the fraction of mutated clones is twice as large for wt compared with R35E/R36D, 3.7% versus 1.5%, respectively (Table I). However, the opposite is true at 10 min, where the mutated clone fraction is 5.2% for wt AID compared with 19.7% for the R35E/R36D double mutant (Table I). Thus, a reduction in N-terminal positive charge has enabled the AID double mutant to access different DNA substrates, presumably by cycling from one to another substrate, with reduced processivity on each. The mutational spectrum for the C-terminal deletion mutant ΔC AID (Fig. 3d) is similar to wt AID (Fig. 2a). An examination of individual clones for wt and ΔC shows no significant differences in the spatial distribution of mutations (data not shown). The average number of deaminations/clone and the fraction of mutated clones are similar for wt and ΔC (Table I). Thus, ΔC, which is proficient in SHM but deficient in CSR (25Ta V.-T. Nagaoka H.

Transcription-dependent Deamination by AID, Spectral and Clonal Analysis—We have determined the spectrum of transcription-dependent AID-catalyzed C deamination by integrating the lacZα reporter gene along with a bacteriophage T7 promoter into a covalently closed circular M13 phage dsDNA and transcribing the gene with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of wt AID (Fig. 4). C → U deaminations were detected as C → T and G → A mutations in M13 mutant phage (white and light blue plaques) after transfection into uracil glycosylase-deficient E. coli (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 103-107Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) (see sketch, Fig. 4). The background mutant frequency of dsDNA substrate alone is 0.5 × 10-3. A slight increase in mutation frequency (∼2-fold) is observed in the presence of either T7 RNA polymerase or AID alone (Table II). When both AID and T7 RNA polymerase are present, a 4-fold increase in mutation frequencies (3.7 × 10-3) is observed as a result of transcription-dependent AID-catalyzed deamination (Table II).Table IIAID-induced mutation on actively transcribed dsDNAMutation frequency (×10−3)DNA alone0.5 ± 0.1DNA + T7 RNA polymerase0.8 ± 0.3DNA + AID1.0 ± 0.3DNA + T7 RNA polymerase + AID3.7 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab We selected 86 mutant phage clones from the transcription-dependent AID-catalyzed deamination reactions and performed a sequencing analysis.

We analyzed the structural organization of the Ufd1-Npl4 adapter complex and its interaction with p97 and compared it with another adapter, p47. We found that the binary Ufd1-Npl4 complex forms a heterodimer that cooperatively interacts with p97 via a bipartite binding mechanism. Binding site 1 (BS1) is a short hydrophobic stretch in the C-terminal domain of Ufd1. The second binding site is located at the N terminus of Npl4 and is activated upon binding of Ufd1 to Npl4. It consists of about 80 amino acids that are predicted to form a ubiquitin fold domain (UBD). Despite the lack of overall homology between Ufd1-Npl4 and p47, both adapters use identical binding mechanisms. Like the ubiquitin fold ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain in p47, the Npl4-UBD interacts with p97 via the loop between its strands 3 and 4 and a conserved arginine in strand 1. Furthermore, we identified a region in p47 homologous to Ufd1-BS1. The UBD/UBX and the BS1 of both adapters interact with p97 independently, whereas homologous binding sites in both adapters compete for binding to p97. In contrast to p47, however, Ufd1-Npl4 does not regulate the ATPase activity of p97; nor does a variant of p47 that contains both binding sites but lacks the N-terminal domains. Therefore, the binding sites alone do not regulate p97 directly but rather serve as anchor points to position adapter-specific domains at critical locations to modulate p97-mediated reactions.

The essential AAA ATPase p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vertebrates and its orthologues in yeast (Cdc48p) and other organisms are involved in a large variety of cellular processes. These include organelle membrane fusion, removal of soluble and membrane proteins, and regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis (1Woodman P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). p97 functions as a molecular chaperone that either extracts substrates from membranes and other structures or changes their conformation. It contains two AAA domains (D1 and D2) that are stacked and form a hexameric barrel. The N-domain, which interacts with cofactors and substrates, is positioned in a plane with D1 at the outside of the hexamer (2Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E.

For its various functions, p97 cooperates with different sets of mutually exclusive adapters and additional cofactors, two of which, p47 (9Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and a binary complex of Ufd1 and Npl4 (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ufd1-Npl4 and p47 form alternative complexes with the ATPase and are required for different types of reactions. The Ufd1-Npl4 adapter is needed for p97-mediated reactions during endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (11Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol.

During endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, p97 and Ufd1-Npl4 mediate the transport of endoplasmic reticulum proteins into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This mobilization process involves the recognition of a substrate in the membrane by the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, followed by its ATP hydrolysis-driven extraction and concomitant ubiquitylation (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The function of Ufd1-Npl4 depends on the N-terminal 200 amino acids in Ufd1 that adopt the same fold as the p97 N-domain (19Coles M. Diercks T. Liermann J. Groger A. Rockel B. Baumeister W.

The p97-p47 complex regulates several organelle membrane fusion steps, including cisternal regrowth from mitotic Golgi fragments (9Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This process involves ubiquitin, but (in contrast to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) is proteasome-independent. p97-p47 is recruited to a monoubiquitylated yet unidentified substrate on mitotic Golgi membranes via the UBA domain in p47 (21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). There it cooperates with another cofactor, the deubiquitinating enzyme VCIP135, to remove ubiquitin and trigger membrane fusion (25Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The exact functions of the adapters and how they modulate p97-mediated reactions are not fully understood. One aspect is that they link the ATPase to different types of ubiquitin conjugates, Ufd1-Npl4 to lysine 48 linked chains and p47 to monoubiquitylated substrates (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Another aspect is the p47-mediated regulation of the ATPase activity of p97 (27Meyer H.H. Kondo H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an effort to cast light on the role of Ufd1-Npl4 and its relationship to p97, we have analyzed its structural organization and its interaction with the ATPase. Surprisingly, we found that it is very similar to p47. DNA Constructs and Expression of Proteins—All proteins were generated in Escherichia coli. Full-length His-p97, Npl4, and Ufd1-His were generated, and complexes were assembled as described (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G.

Constructs coding for truncation mutants of Ufd1, Npl4, and p47 fused to the C terminus of GST were derived from pGEX-Ufd1, pGEX-Npl4, and pGEX-p47 (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D.

The ubiquitin fold domain of Npl4 with a C-terminal His tag was expressed using pET30 (Novagen) that contained an insert between the NdeI and XhoI sites coding for amino acids 1–96. The His-tagged p47 full-length, p47-UBX, and p47(BS1-UBX) proteins were expressed using pTrcHis-p47 (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G.

His-tagged and GST-tagged fusion proteins were purified using nickel-agarose (Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. GST-p97 and His-p47 variants were further purified using gel filtration. Peptides covering binding site 1 (BS1) of Ufd1 (GEVGFRAFSGSGNRLDGKKKG) and p47 (PKGAFKAFTGEGQKLGSTAPQ) and Ufd1-(286–306) were synthesized and biotinylated at the N terminus. Molecular Mass Determination—The Ufd1-Npl4 complex was generated from recombinant proteins as described (15Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). 70 μg of the complex was treated to 0.22-μm filtration prior to size exclusion chromatography with a Superose-6 HR (10/30) column coupled with an in-line Dawn EOS laser light scattering apparatus (Wyatt Technology Corp.), refractometer (Wyatt Technology), and UV detector (Waters Corp.). The running buffer was 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% glycerol. The data were collected and analyzed with the ASTRA software at the HHMI Biopolymer Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University). Binding Experiments—For experiments using gel filtration, the preassembled Ufd1-Npl4 complex or individual proteins were either run alone or after 30 min of binding on ice in running buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5% glycerol), followed by separation on a Superose-6 HR (10/30) column (Amersham Biosciences). Co-precipitation experiments using glutathione- or streptavidin-coated beads were performed as described (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G.

Competition experiments were carried out with a 50-fold molar excess of soluble UBD/UBX domains or BS1 peptides over immobilized binding domains. An anti-His antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect p47 variants co-isolated with GST-p97. Far Western overlay assays were carried out as described (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J.

ATPase Assay—The assays were performed using 2 μg of recombinant p97 preincubated without or with varying amounts of the p47, p47-(244–370) or Ufd1-Npl4 for 30 min on ice. Proteins were then incubated in 100 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm ATP) for 40 min at 37 °C. 40-μl samples were taken at the start and the end of the reaction. Formation of orthophosphate was measured using the malachite green color reagent according to the method by Lanzetta et al. (31Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Ufd1 and Npl4 Form a Heterodimer—In a first step toward understanding the structural organization of the Ufd1-Npl4 complex and its interaction with p97, we determined the stoichiometry of the adapter. Our previous data suggested that Ufd1 and Npl4 form a tight complex with a ratio of 1:1. The binary complex eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa from gel filtration both when isolated from cytosol as well as when reconstituted from recombinant proteins (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, since migration in size exclusion columns depends on both size and shape of the proteins, we determined the molecular weight of the reconstituted Ufd1-Npl4 complex by coupling gel filtration with in-line multiangle laser light scattering, refractive index, and UV light measurements. The Ufd1-Npl4 peak was monodisperse with an average molecular mass of 100 kDa (data not shown). This is in agreement with a heterodimer composed of one Npl4 (67-kDa) and one Ufd1 (35-kDa) peptide. We also previously showed that Ufd1 alone binds p97. However, Npl4 stimulates complex formation, although it does not bind p97 on its own in solution (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To reveal the relevance of this stimulation, we performed binding experiments with p97 to Ufd1 or Npl4 individually or Ufd1 and Npl4 together, separated the resulting protein complexes by gel filtration, and analyzed them in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1). Ufd1 bound p97, but binding was inefficient, since only a fraction of p97 was shifted to a larger molecular weight (row 2). More importantly, the p97-Ufd1 complexes were of heterogeneous size, and some eluted in the void volume, indicating that the proteins aggregated. Consistent with previous results (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), Npl4 did not bind p97 (row 3), whereas Ufd1-Npl4 bound p97 efficiently and shifted it homogeneously to an apparent molecular mass of about 700 kDa (row 5). These results show that Ufd1 requires Npl4 for correct complex formation with p97. Ufd1 Contains Two Distinct Binding Sites for Npl4 and p97—Ufd1 binds both p97 and Npl4 via its C-terminal ∼100 amino acids, previously termed the UT6 domain (15Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We decided to clarify whether p97 and Npl4 bind via the same or distinct interaction sites within this domain. Binding of the two partners to Ufd1 can be analyzed in far Western overlay assays. We generated a series of Ufd1 truncation mutants fused to GST in bacteria as depicted in Fig. 2A. Bacterial lysates were separated in SDS gels and transferred onto membranes. After partial renaturation, immobilized proteins were incubated with biotinylated p97 or Npl4, respectively. Bound probes were identified with peroxidase-coupled streptavidin and detected by chemiluminescence. The results are summarized in Fig. 2A. We found that Ufd1 contains two distinct short binding sites for p97 and Npl4, lying between residues 215 and 241 (termed BS1) and 258–275, respectively. To confirm the results from overlay assays, we purified critical truncation mutants and performed binding assays with p97 or Npl4 in solution. We also generated and tested GST-Ufd1-(281–307), which contains a sequence with homology to BS1. GST-Ufd1 mutant proteins were isolated using immobilized glutathione, and bound partners were analyzed in Coomassie-stained SDS gels (Fig. 2B). Our results show that Ufd1-(215–241) was necessary and sufficient to bind p97 but did not interact with Npl4. Conversely, Ufd1-(258–275) bound Npl4, but not p97. The internal repeat Ufd1-(281–307) did not bind either of the two partners. Sequence alignment of Ufd1-BS1 with p47 revealed a short homologous stretch in the larger linker region between the p47 SEP and UBX domains, which had previously been implicated in interaction with p97 (26Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic residues are best conserved between the two sequences (Fig. 2C). To confirm the relevance of the homology, we used chemically synthesized peptides covering the BS1 sequences of Ufd1 and p47 as shown in Fig. 2C. Peptides were biotinylated at the N terminus and immobilized on steptavidin-beads. Incubation with p97 and subsequent co-sedimentation revealed that both peptides bound p97 specifically (Fig. 2D). In summary, we found that Ufd1 has two distinct short binding sites for p97 and Npl4. The first one, BS1, covers 21 amino acids and is homologous to a newly demarcated binding site in the other adapter, p47. An independent binding site for Npl4 resides further downstream, covering 18 amino acids. Interaction with Ufd1 Activates Npl4 Binding to p97—The identification of the two distinct binding sites in Ufd1 allowed us to analyze Npl4-stimulated complex formation with p97. Again, we performed in vitro interaction studies with GST-Ufd1 truncation mutants binding to Npl4 or p97, but this time also with Npl4 and p97 together. As before, bound partners were detected in SDS gels (Fig. 3). As in the previous experiment, GST-Ufd1-(1–230) covering the N-terminal domain did not bind any of the partners (lanes 1–3), whereas GST-Ufd1-(215–307) bound both (lanes 4 and 5). Confirming our previous data, p97 recruitment to the latter was stimulated by co-incubation with Npl4 (lane 6). Ufd1-BS1-(215–241) bound p97, but not Npl4, no matter whether they were incubated individually or together (lanes 7–9). Conversely, the Ufd1-Npl4 binding peptide (residues 258–275) only bound Npl4 and not p97 (lanes 10 and 11). Despite the lack of direct binding activity to p97, however, this fragment co-sedimented p97, when Npl4 was present (lane 12). This result suggests that the binding of the Ufd1 fragment to Npl4 activated an otherwise inactive interaction domain in Npl4 for p97 and that Npl4 bridged between GST-Ufd1-(258–275) and p97 in this reaction. Npl4 Contains a Ubiquitin Fold Domain That Mediates Interaction with p97—The notion of a hidden p97 interaction domain in Npl4 is supported by the fact that p97 binds partially denatured Npl4 on filters in overlay assays (10Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We used the same technique to search for the p97-binding site in Npl4. As for Ufd1, we generated a series of Npl4 truncation mutants fused to GST as listed in Fig. 4A. We expressed the Npl4 mutants in bacteria and analyzed the lysates in far Western assays with biotinylated p97 in the overlay. As shown in Fig. 4B, we identified a fragment covering the N-terminal 89 amino acids that was sufficient and required for interaction with p97. In contrast, other mutants that either covered only residues 1–49 or were missing the N-terminal 47 amino acids were unable to interact with p97. Binding of p97 to these mutants was also tested in solution, confirming the results obtained in overlay assays (data not shown). In our hands, standard computational sequence analysis of the Npl4 N terminus did not reveal significant homologies to any known proteins (other than Npl4 orthologues) or conserved domains. A fold recognition method, however, used on the 3D-PSSM server (available on the World Wide Web at www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/) predicted a β-grasp fold that is also found in ubiquitin and related proteins. Since p47 binds p97 via its UBX domain that also assumes a ubiquitin fold (23Yuan X. Shaw A. Zhang X. Kondo H. Lally J. Freemont P.S. Matthews S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we aligned the peptide sequences of the two domains according to their predicted (Npl4) or confirmed (p47) secondary structure and relatively weak primary sequence similarities (Fig. 4C). Dreveny et al. (33Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed that the p47-UBX domain interacts with p97 by inserting the loop between its strands 3 and 4 into a cleft in the p97 N-domain. Furthermore, they identified an arginine on strand 1 to be important for binding. We tested whether the Npl4 ubiquitin fold domain (UBD) binds via the same mechanism to p97. We generated a series of variants of the Npl4-UBD fused to GST with mutations in critical residues and tested binding to p97 in co-sedimentation experiments (Fig. 4D). Mutation of the arginine residue on strand 1 that is conserved between Npl4 and p47 abolished binding of Npl4-UBD to p97 almost completely (lane 3) compared with the wild type domain (lane 2). The loops between strands 3 and 4 of Npl4-UBD and p47-UBX do not have any sequence similarities. However, mutations in the Npl4 loop (RNK to AAA, lane 5) or flanking region (INR to AAG, lane 4) again abolished binding, indicating that this region is crucial for p97 interaction with Npl4 too. In contrast, mutations in the second helix (L67A, lane 6) or S5 (L75A and F78S, lanes 7 and 8) had little or no influence on the interaction. All variants tested here were easily expressed in bacteria and soluble in large amounts, indicating correct folding. Together, Npl4 contains an interaction domain for p97 that assumes a β-grasp ubiquitin fold (UBD) but has little primary sequence homology to either ubiquitin or p47-UBX. Nevertheless, both interaction domains employ the same surfaces for binding to p97. Binding Sites in Ufd1 and Npl4 Are Functionally Related to Individual Sites in p47—We identified two different binding sites in the Ufd1-Npl4 adapter that are homologous to binding sites in p47. We therefore wanted to clarify whether the different sites can interact independently and whether the homologous sites in the two adapters bind via similar mechanisms. We incubated p97 again with GST fusions of each of the binding domains, Npl4-UBD, p47-UBX, Ufd1-BS1, or p47-BS1. We then tested the interaction in two series of competition experiments. First, we carried out the binding in the absence or presence of excess amounts of His-tagged ubiquitin fold domains, Npl4-UBD or p47-UBX (Fig. 5A). In the second series, we performed the same set of binding reactions, this time in the absence or presence of excess peptides covering the other binding site of each adapter, Ufd1-BS1 or p47-BS1 (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the amounts of p97 co-sedimented with the GST fusions under the different conditions revealed that each ubiquitin fold domain interfered with binding of both Npl4-UBD and p47-UBX (A, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 6 and 7) but not with interaction of the BS1 of either of the two adapters (A, lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 12 and 13). Conversely, the BS1 peptides of either Ufd1 or Npl4 inhibited p97 binding to the immobilized BS1 of both adapters (B, lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 12 and 13) but did not affect interaction of the UBD/UBX domains with p97 (B, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 6 and 7). Together, these data show that the two binding domains of each adapter independently interact with p97. However, homologous domains of the adapters compete for binding, suggesting that they bind via the same mechanism to p97. The Binding Domains Alone Do Not Mediate Regulation of ATPase Activity—We previously reported that p47 down-regulates the ATP hydrolysis activity of p97 (27Meyer H.H. Kondo H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since results presented here revealed that Ufd1-Npl4 uses the same mechanism of interaction with p97 as p47, we asked whether Ufd1-Npl4 regulates p97 the same way. When we measured p97-adapter complexes, however, we found that, contrary to p47, Ufd1-Npl4 did not reduce the ATPase activity of p97 (Fig. 6). This differential effect could have two causes. It could be due to small variation in the binding regions between the two adapters. Alternatively, the binding domains of p47 do not regulate p97 directly but require additional adapter-specific domains for the modulation. We therefore tested whether the p47-(244–370) fragment that contains both BS1 and the UBX domain but lacks the p47-specific domains had any regulatory activity. Despite the fact that the p47 fragment bound p97 as well as full-length p47 in co-sedimentation experiments (Fig. 6B), we did not observe a negative effect on the ATPase activity caused by the mutants at equimolar concentrations (Fig. 6A) or even at a 5-fold molar excess (not depicted). Therefore, the bipartite binding domain of the adapter does not regulate p97 activity directly but requires additional adapter-specific domains. Recent work has revealed that p97/VCP mediates different types of reactions and that it requires distinct sets of cofactors to carry out these tasks. In this report, we found that despite these functional differences and lack of overall homology, the two alternative adapters Ufd1-Npl4 and p47 interact with the ATPase in a very similar manner via a bipartite binding mechanism (Fig. 7). In the case of Ufd1-Npl4, each of the two subunits contains one binding site, and several lines of evidence show that both subunits indeed act together and bind p97 cooperatively. We have previously shown that, although Ufd1 can interact with p97 independently, the addition of Npl4 stimulates complex formation. By analyzing the various possible complexes more carefully, we now show that p97 binding to Ufd1 alone results in inefficient binding that leads to heterogeneous complex formation and aggregation. Only the preassembled Ufd1-Npl4 complex efficiently binds p97 and forms a physiological ternary complex of homogeneous size that is also found in cytosol, suggesting that all three partners act together. We also revealed how Npl4 stimulates complex formation although it is not able to bind p97 on its own in solution. Using truncation mutants, we showed that Ufd1 binding to Npl4 activates a ubiquitin fold domain (UBD) in Npl4 that then interacts with p97. The notion of an autoinhibited binding of full-length, free Npl4 is supported by the fact that the isolated UBD of Npl4 can bind p97 in solution, and so does partially denatured Npl4 on filters. Whether this activation by Ufd1 is physiologically relevant is unclear, since we have not detected Ufd1 or Npl4 individually in cell extracts. Our analysis of the reconstituted, binary Ufd1-Npl4 complex using multiangle light scattering combined with gel filtration revealed that the adapter is a heterodimer with only one molecule of each protein. It therefore has the same layout of binding sites as a single p47 molecule. The fact that Ufd1-Npl4 elutes at a larger apparent molecular weight from gel filtration columns points to an elongated shape of the complex. Based on these findings, any number of Ufd1-Npl4 between 1 and 6 could theoretically bind a single p97 hexamer, although a symmetric interaction of either 3 or 6 units per hexamer may be more likely. In the case of p47, recent findings indicate a binding ratio of 6 adapter molecules per hexamer p97 (33Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Rouiller I. Butel V.M. Latterich M. Milligan R.A. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1485-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but further structural and functional work is required to confirm these results and clarify whether this is also true for Ufd1-Npl4. The finding of a UBD in Npl4 as a binding site for p97 was unexpected to us, since primary sequence analysis did not detect any obvious homologies to ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like domains. We could, however, identify this domain using fold prediction software in Npl4 proteins as distantly related as the mammalian and the yeast form. This prediction is supported by our binding analysis using mutants of the Npl4-UBD. It revealed interaction surfaces with p97 identical to those reported for the p47-UBX domain (33Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our data, therefore, suggest that the described complex represents a general interaction mechanism of ubiquitin fold domain-containing cofactors with p97. This is not the same mechanism as was employed for the interaction of ubiquitin chains with p97, however, since cofactors and ubiquitin do not significantly compete for binding to the ATPase (33Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Hartmann-Petersen R. Wallace M. Hofmann K. Koch G. Johnsen A.H. Hendil K.B. Gordon C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 824-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our findings that Ufd1-Npl4 or p47 stimulate ubiquitin binding to p97 rather than inhibiting it (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the absence of significant sequence homology to ubiquitin makes it unlikely that the Npl4-UBD acts in a manner similar to that of the truly ubiquitin-like domains in Rad23 and related proteins that link these factors to the proteasome (36Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The sole function of Npl4-UBD may therefore be the interaction with p97. The identification of the UBD in Npl4 as the interaction interface for p97 associates the Ufd1-Npl4 complex with a growing number of cofactors that bind p97 via this fold. Besides p47, these include VCIP135 in mammals (26Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Ubx1–7p in budding yeast (37Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and Ubx2p and Ubx3p in fission yeast (35Hartmann-Petersen R. Wallace M. Hofmann K. Koch G. Johnsen A.H. Hendil K.B. Gordon C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 824-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fold does not seem to be a prerequisite for interaction, though, since we did not detect this domain in the direct binding partners such as Ufd3p or Ufd2p using fold prediction. Ufd1, on the other hand, contains a short hydrophobic binding site for p97 (BS1). We show that it is homologous and functionally related to a short stretch in p47 within the linker between the SEP and UBX domains that was previously shown to bind p97 (26Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The BS1 does not seem to be as common as the ubiquitin fold, however. We noticed a homologous region in VCIP135 (amino acids 1020–1035), and it will be interesting to find out whether it has the same function. However, none of the other known p97-binding factors have segments with obvious homology to BS1. Nevertheless, BS1 is conserved in Ufd1 proteins of different species. This is also true for Caenorhabditis elegans Ufd1, which is intriguing, since Npl4 in this species lacks the UBD. Given that the N-domain of p97 is essential for adapter binding (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), it is likely that BS1, too, directly interacts with it. Unfortunately, the structural data collected by Deverny et al. (33Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using the p47-(244–370) fragment that contains both UBX and BS1 did not reveal the exact location of its binding site in p97. The orientation of the fragment in the crystal with p97, however, suggests that BS1 binds p97 on the top of the N-domain toward the center of the p97 hexamer. Based on our finding that the two binding sites interact independently with p97, one could speculate that p47-(244–370) or Ufd1-Npl4 forms a clamp around the N-domain. It was therefore important to ask whether the connected binding domains alone account for the down-regulation of p97 ATPase activity as observed for p47, by either changing the conformation of p97 or restricting the movements of the N-domains. However, since we did not detect any effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis upon binding of either p47-(244–370) or the complete Ufd1-Npl4 complex, we conclude that bipartite adapter binding does not regulate the ATPase activity directly. Therefore, the additional adapter moieties and the way they organize the p97-adapter complexes are crucial for the differential regulation. In fact, p47 has been reported to oligomerize (24Yuan X. Simpson P. McKeown C. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Wallis R. Dreveny I. Keetch C. Zhang X. Robinson C. Freemont P. Matthews S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of p47 units within the p97-adapter complex may be another way of restricting N-domain movements and thereby influencing ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with this, there is no evidence for oligomerization of Ufd1-Npl4. These results support a model in which the binding domains of the adapters serve as anchor points for p97 rather then directly regulating it, whereas adapter-specific domains are required for differential modulation. Correct anchoring, however, may be crucial. Whereas the UBD could serve as a general recruitment domain, the BS1 may provide higher affinity and may position the adapter in the right orientation with respect to p97 and its movements. The exact role of the adapters in p97-mediated reactions is still a matter of speculation. If they are involved in transmitting mechanical force from p97 to a substrate, correct positioning is essential. However, this is also true, if they are involved in further processing of substrates and regulating recruitment of additional cofactors, a deubiquitinating enzyme in the case of p47, and possibly ubiquitin conjugation machinery in the case of Ufd1-Npl4. Future analysis of yet uncharacterized domains of the adapters will shed light on their roles in p97-mediated reactions. We thank Graham Warren, in whose laboratory this project was initiated.

In eukaryotic cells, various checkpoint control mechanisms guard the integrity of the genomic DNA. These regulatory pathways prevent mitotic entry when cells experience problems with DNA replication or suffer DNA damage (for reviews, see Refs. 1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin.

These biochemical networks contain sensor proteins that monitor the presence of specific nucleic acid structures and/or associated proteins at sites of DNA replication or DNA damage. The sensor proteins regulate effector proteins, which in turn control cell cycle progression and other processes. A third class of proteins, termed mediators or adaptors, may promote functional interactions between sensor and effector proteins. Certain checkpoint proteins may carry out more than one of these functions. The process by which cells detect incompletely replicated DNA in the genome can be studied in cell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs (4Dasso M. Newport J.W.

These replication blockages elicit activation of Xchk1, the Xenopus version of the check-point effector kinase Chk1 (6Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the activation of Chk1 requires ATR, which is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase-related family of proteins (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A.

In egg extracts, Xenopus ATR (Xatr) catalyzes the stimulatory phosphorylation of Xchk1 at multiple conserved (S/T)Q sites in its regulatory domain (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The activated form of Chk1 blocks the initiation of mitosis by preventing activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex in a wide range of organisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar and 11Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). The Xatr-catalyzed phosphorylation of Xchk1 also requires another protein named Claspin (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Jeong S.Y. Kumagai A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because Claspin associates directly with Xchk1, Claspin may promote the phosphorylation of Xchk1 by Xatr by serving as a mediator or adaptor protein. Claspin also interacts with chromatin in a highly specific manner during the course of DNA replication in egg extracts (15Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The binding of Claspin to chromatin depends upon various proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication, including the pre-replication complex, Cdc45, and Cdk2. These observations imply that Claspin also detects the presence of active DNA replication forks in the nucleus as part of its function. Functional relatives of Claspin in budding and fission yeast called Mrc1 appear to fulfill a similar role in these organisms (16Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat.

Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In addition to Claspin and Mrc1, various other proteins fall into the mediator/adaptor class. For example, in budding yeast, Rad9 is required for activation of the checkpoint effector kinase Rad53 in response to DNA damage (see Refs. 1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, a relative of Rad9 called Crb2 appears to play a similar role in the DNA damage-dependent activation of Chk1. Rad9 and Crb2 both possess conserved BRCA1 C-terminal domains, which generally dock with other proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (20Caldecott K.W. Science. 2003; 302: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, potential functional relatives of these proteins include 53BP1, TopBP1/Cut5, Mdc1, and BRCA1 itself (21Canman C.E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R488-R490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Significantly, Claspin and Mrc1 do not contain BRCA1 C-terminal motifs, suggesting that the various checkpoint mediator/adaptor proteins have distinct functional properties. The correct regulation of Chk1 also depends on a number of other proteins. For example, ATR possesses a binding partner called ATRIP that is important for the association of ATR with DNA (22Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). In addition, checkpoint clamp loader and checkpoint sliding clamp proteins participate in the detection of incompletely replicated/damaged DNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). For example, Rad17 forms a clamp loader complex with the four small subunits of replication factor C (RFC2–5). The Rad17-RFC2–5 complex enables the binding of a clamp consisting of Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 (the 9-1-1 complex) to checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. A key question is how various checkpoint regulatory proteins collaborate in the activation of downstream effector kinases such as Chk1. Although proteins like Claspin have been referred to as adaptors or mediators that facilitate the ability of upstream kinases in the ATR/ATM family to phosphorylate downstream checkpoint effector kinases, there has been no direct biochemical evidence that these proteins function in this manner. In this study, we have used a reconstituted system to directly evaluate the concept that Claspin promotes the phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. Xenopus Egg Extracts—Xenopus egg extracts as well as nuclear and chromatin fractions from these extracts were prepared as described previously (6Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Activation of Xchk1 and Xchk2 in Egg Extracts—The use of single-stranded (dA)70 and (dA)70 annealed to (dT)70 ((dA)70-(dT)70) to study checkpoint responses in Xenopus egg extracts was described previously (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide CGGAAGGGCCGAGCGCAGAAGTGGTCCTGCAACTTTATCCGCCTCCATCCAGTCTATTAATTGTTGCCGG was used as a random sequence single-stranded 70-mer. This oligonucleotide was annealed to its complementary sequence to yield a random sequence double-stranded 70-mer. The oligonucleotide CTAGTGCACGCTAGAGGCAAGTGGGTACTGGAGCTCCATA and its complementary sequence were used to form a random sequence double-stranded 40-mer. Typically, we added oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to the extracts. To observe phosphorylation of Xchk1 and Xchk2, we incubated the extracts in the presence or absence of 3 μm tautomycin, respectively, in addition to the appropriate DNA template. Cloning of cDNA Encoding Xenopus ATRIP (Xatrip)—A Xenopus expressed sequence tag (TC177046) with significant homology to human ATRIP was identified. Using primers based on this sequence, a DNA fragment was isolated by PCR from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library. This fragment was used as a probe to isolate a 2.9-kb cDNA encoding full-length Xatrip with the ClonCapture kit (Clontech). DNA sequencing of this cDNA was performed at the California Institute of Technology Sequencing Facility. Production of Recombinant Proteins—The coding sequence of Xatrip was cloned into pFastBacHTa, and a sequence encoding a FLAG epitope was engineered into the 3′-end of the coding sequence by standard procedures. The His6-Xatrip-FLAG protein, with His6 and FLAG tags at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, was produced in Sf9 insect cells and purified with nickel-agarose beads as described (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Recombinant Xchk1-GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; RPA, replication protein A; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.-His6 proteins, with GST and His6 tags at the C-terminal end, were prepared in a similar manner (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RPA was produced in Escherichia coli CodonPlus RIL cells and purified as described (23Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Production of Antibodies—Anti-Xatr antibodies were produced against a bacterially expressed His6-tagged fragment of Xatr (amino acids 403–823). Anti-Xatrip antibodies were produced against His6-tagged full-length Xatrip expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Antibodies were raised in rabbits at a commercial facility and affinity-purified with the original antigen. Immunodepletions from Egg Extracts—Xatr, Xatrip, and Claspin were immunodepleted from egg extracts with antibodies bound to protein A-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) as described (15Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two rounds of immunodepletion were performed to ensure complete removal of the protein. Binding of Purified His6-Xatrip-FLAG to Oligonucleotides—Purified His6-Xatrip-FLAG protein was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with magnetic beads coated with (dA)70, (dA)70-(dT)70, or no DNA in the absence and presence of recombinant human RPA in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After the incubation, the beads were washed four times with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel sample buffer. Isolation of Xatr Bound to Magnetic Beads Containing Oligonucleotides—Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) containing biotinylated (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 were incubated for 60 min in inter-phase egg extract. The biotin group was attached to the 5′-end of (dA)70. In the case of (dA)70-(dT)70, only (dA)70 was biotinylated. Magnetic beads were washed three times by centrifugation for 3 min at 2070 × g through 1 m sucrose dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm potassium gluconate, and 10 mm magnesium gluconate. Next, the beads were washed by collection with a magnetic rack twice with buffer A and once with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5). Assay for the Kinase Activity of Xatr-Xatrip—Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads containing biotinylated (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 (2.5 μg) were incubated in interphase egg extract (100 μl) for 60 min. For the extracts containing beads with (dA)70-(dT)70, we also added a soluble random sequence double-stranded 40-mer (2.5 μg/100 μl of extract) to increase the binding of Xatr-Xatrip to the beads. The addition of the random sequence double-stranded 40-mer to extracts containing (dA)70-coated magnetic beads had no effect on the activity of Xatr-Xatrip isolated from these extracts (data not shown). Magnetic beads containing associated Xatr-Xatrip were isolated as described above and treated with 25 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) at room temperature for 15 min in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin. Proteins that were released from the beads by nuclease treatment were collected and mixed with 50 μl of buffer A containing 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The Xatr-Xatrip complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-Xatrip antibodies (1 μg) bound to protein A beads (10 μl). The kinase activity of Xatr was assayed with PHAS-I as the substrate as described (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Kinase assays with Xchk1-GST-His6 as the substrate were performed in the presence of 1 mm nonradioactive ATP. Production of Recombinant Xchk1-GST-His6 Associated with Claspin from Egg Extracts—Interphase egg extracts (100 μl) containing either (dA)70 alone or (dA)70-(dT)70 plus 3 μm tautomycin were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After 60 min, 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.1% CHAPS, 20 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate was added to the extracts, and the mixtures were centrifuged through Sephadex G-25 spin columns equilibrated with the same buffer. Recombinant Xchk1-GST-His6 proteins (1 μg) were incubated in the excluded spin-through fractions from the columns for 1 h at 4 °C and then isolated from the incubations with glutathione-agarose beads. Xatr Is Required for the Phosphorylation of Xchk1 in Response to Model DNA Templates—Xchk1 undergoes checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation in response to incompletely replicated DNA in Xenopus egg extracts (6Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation depends upon Xatr (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For these experiments, the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin was used to induce the formation of DNA replication blocks in Xenopus sperm chromatin that had been incorporated into reconstituted nuclei (4Dasso M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Xchk1 can also be triggered by the addition of certain defined DNA templates to egg extracts. For example, annealed oligomers consisting of (dA)70 and (dT)70 are very effective for this purpose (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given their relatively simple nature in comparison with reconstituted sperm chromatin, we wanted to use such templates to investigate the biochemical properties of the checkpoint pathway containing Xatr, Claspin, and Xchk1. To pursue this line of investigation, we first characterized the features of the DNA templates that are important for inducing activation of Xchk1. As shown in Fig. 1A, (dA)70-(dT)70 induced the phosphorylation of Xchk1 very efficiently, as described previously (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We also observed that a longer template consisting of (dA)100-(dT)100 gave similar results (data not shown). Random sequence double-stranded 70-mers likewise elicited strong phosphorylation of Xchk1, although not quite as well as (dA)70-(dT)70. By comparison, annealed 40-mers of poly(dA) and poly(dT) or annealed 40-mers of random sequence oligonucleotides were typically significantly less effective at triggering the phosphorylation of Xchk1. Finally, single-stranded (dA)70 and a random sequence single-stranded 70-mer did not cause significant phosphorylation of Xchk1. In parallel, we also examined the effects of the various oligonucleotides on the phosphorylation of Xchk2 (Fig. 1A). Xchk2 became maximally phosphorylated in response to all of the double-stranded templates, regardless of length, but not in response to the single-stranded templates. In other experiments with various more complex templates containing three or four oligonucleotides that were designed explicitly to mimic features of replication forks, we could not identify any template that was markedly better than (dA)70-(dT)70 for inducing the phosphorylation of Xchk1 (data not shown). Therefore, we used this template for most of the experiments in this study. First, we asked whether the phosphorylation of Xchk1 that is induced by (dA)70-(dT)70 also depends upon Xatr. To investigate this issue, we removed Xatr from egg extracts by immunodepletion with anti-Xatr antibodies (Fig. 1B). In parallel, we used control antibodies to prepare mock-depleted extracts. We incubated the depleted extracts with (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 in the presence of an exogenously added recombinant Xchk1-GST-His6 protein. Finally, we recovered Xchk1-GST-His6 from the extracts and examined its phosphorylation state by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. In mock-depleted extracts, Xchk1 underwent strong phosphorylation in the presence of (dA)70-(dT)70, but not (dA)70, consistent with previous results (12Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). By contrast, in Xatr-depleted extracts, there was no phosphorylation of Xchk1-GST-His6 in the presence of (dA)70-(dT)70. These results indicate that (dA)70-(dT)70 induces a checkpoint response that is controlled by Xatr as the upstream regulator. Identification of Xatrip, a Xenopus Homolog of ATRIP—In all known cases, ATR and its homologs form a complex with a specific binding partner or regulatory subunit. This protein was first described in fission yeast as Rad26, which interacts with Rad3, the fission yeast equivalent of ATR (24Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Wolkow T.D. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Aspergillus nidulans, the uvsB and uvsD genes encode ATR and Rad26 homologs, respectively (26De Souza C.P. Ye X.S. Osmani S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3661-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Three groups identified a homolog of Rad26 in budding yeast named Ddc2, Lcd1, and Pie1, respectively (27Paciotti V. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2046-2059PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rouse J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Wakayama T. Kondo T. Ando S. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Ddc2/Lcd1/Pie1 interacts with Mec1, the budding yeast homolog of ATR. Most recently, this protein was identified in human cells and named ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) (30Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To study Xatr along with its presumed binding partner, we isolated a cDNA that encodes a Xenopus homolog of this ATR-binding protein from an oocyte library (Fig. 2). We named this protein Xenopus ATRIP (Xatrip) because, among known counterparts, it is most similar to human ATRIP. Overall, Xatrip is 45% identical at the amino acid level to human ATRIP, but there are two regions with higher homology (amino acids 62–277 and 566–801) that are more than 50% identical between the two species. In these regions, there are four conserved serine and threonine residues (amino acids 84, 88, 197, and 741) in (S/T)Q motifs that are potential phosphorylation sites for ATR. There is also a predicted coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal conserved region (amino acids 128–243). Xatrip has low homology to a potential functional counterpart in Drosophila called MUS304 (25% identical). However, Xatrip shows minimal primary sequence homology to fission yeast Rad26 and budding yeast Ddc2/Lcd1/Pie1. Xatr and Xatrip Form a Tight Complex That Associates with DNA—To study the properties of Xatrip, we raised antibodies against full-length recombinant His6-Xatrip that had been expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In immunoblotting experiments, the antibodies recognized a 100-kDa polypeptide in egg extracts (Fig. 3A). Using recombinant Xatrip as a standard, we estimated that the concentration of endogenous Xatrip in the egg extract was ∼40 nm. For comparison, the concentration of Xatr was ∼56 nm. The amounts of Xatrip and Xatr in egg extracts did not appear to change during the course of the cell cycle or upon checkpoint activation (data not shown). To assess whether Xatr and Xatrip form a complex in egg extracts, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. As shown in Fig. 3A, we could readily detect Xatr in anti-Xatrip immunoprecipitates. Moreover, we could use anti-Xatr antibodies to immunoprecipitate Xatrip efficiently. The interaction between Xatr and Xatrip persisted after extensive washing with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, indicating that these proteins form a stable complex. The binding of Xatr to Xatrip did not change during progression of the cell cycle (data not shown) or after the addition of either (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 to the egg extracts (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined the DNA binding properties of Xatr-Xatrip. For this purpose, we first utilized streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads that had been coated with various biotinylated oligonucleotides. Beads containing (dA)70, (dA)70-(dT)70, or no DNA were incubated in egg extracts, re-isolated from the extracts, and analyzed for the presence of Xatr and Xatrip by immunoblotting. We observed that both Xatr and Xatrip associated with (dA)70 and (dA)70-(dT)70, but binding to single-stranded (dA)70 was much greater (Fig. 3C). There was no binding of either protein to beads lacking DNA. To characterize further the binding of Xatr and Xatrip to single-stranded DNA in egg extracts, we used single-stranded poly(dA) of different lengths on magnetic beads (Fig. 3D). As expected, Xatr and Xatrip bound well to (dA)70 in egg extracts. Furthermore, both proteins associated efficiently with poly(dA) that was 40, 30, or 20 nucleotides in length. By contrast, there was no detectable binding of either Xatr or Xatrip to a 10-mer of poly(dA). These results indicate that Xatr can associate with relatively short stretches of single-stranded DNA as small as 20 nucleotides in length. However, even 70-mers of single-stranded DNA were ineffective in eliciting the phosphorylation of Xchk1 (see Fig. 1A). Therefore, the association of Xatr with single-stranded DNA is by itself not sufficient to elicit a check-point response. Since a random sequence double-stranded 40-mer oligonucleotide template triggered the activation of Xchk2 preferentially compared with that of Xchk1, we asked whether the addition of a soluble double-stranded 40-mer to egg extracts would affect the binding of Xatr and Xatrip to biotinylated (dA)70-(dT)70 on magnetic beads. Interestingly, the presence of a double-stranded 40-mer in the egg extracts resulted in increased binding of Xatr-Xatrip to beads containing (dA)70-(dT)70, but not (dA)70 (Fig. 3C). An explanation for this observation would be that the double-stranded 40-mer acts as a competitor for proteins that preferentially recognize double-stranded DNA ends. Consistent with this possibility, the addition of the double-stranded 40-mer reduced the binding of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku70, and Ku80 to (dA)70-(dT)70 on magnetic beads. 2S.-M. Kim, H. Y. Yoo, and W. G. Dunphy, unpublished data. In the experiments described below, we used this competitor DNA to increase the yield of Xatr-Xatrip that could be obtained from egg extracts through binding to magnetic beads coated with (dA)70-(dT)70. Finally, we asked whether Claspin associates with any of the oligonucleotide templates. We could not detect any binding of Claspin to (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 in either the absence or presence of the double-stranded 40-mer (Fig. 3C). Therefore, although Claspin binds quite well to stalled replication forks in chromosomal DNA (15Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we could not detect stable association of Claspin with model DNA templates that trigger the activation of Xchk1, at least under these conditions. Role of Xatrip in the Binding of Xatr to DNA—Next, we examined the functional properties of Xatrip in egg extracts. For these experiments, we attempted to remove Xatrip from the extracts by immunodepletion with anti-Xatrip antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, all of the Xatrip could be removed by this procedure. Significantly, ∼30% of the Xatr remained behind in the Xatrip-depleted extract. In parallel, we also removed Xatr from the extracts with anti-Xatr antibodies. This procedure resulted in the elimination of not only"
https://openalex.org/W2000907682,"Hsp72 protects cells against apoptosis in response to various stresses. By simultaneously measuring cytochrome c localization and nuclear morphology in mouse embryo fibroblasts, we have shown that Hsp72 blocks cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to cytotoxic stress and that permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane is the critical point in deciding the fate of the cell. Hsp72 did not inhibit apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts once cytochrome c had been released from the mitochondria. Recent reports have claimed that Hsp72 can prevent caspase activation by inhibiting the oligomerization of Apaf-1 in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP. We now show that this apparent function of recombinant Hsp72 is due to the presence of salt in the Hsp72 preparation and that the same response can be achieved by the addition of heat-denatured Hsp72 in the same high salt buffer or by the high salt buffer alone. Hsp72 expressed in a range of different cell lines had no inhibitory effect on cytochrome c-stimulated caspase activity of cytosolic extracts. We conclude that the protective effect of Hsp72 occurs upstream of the mitochondria and not through the inhibition of the apoptosome. Hsp72 protects cells against apoptosis in response to various stresses. By simultaneously measuring cytochrome c localization and nuclear morphology in mouse embryo fibroblasts, we have shown that Hsp72 blocks cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to cytotoxic stress and that permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane is the critical point in deciding the fate of the cell.

We conclude that the protective effect of Hsp72 occurs upstream of the mitochondria and not through the inhibition of the apoptosome. Hsp72 belongs to an ancient family of proteins that play a role in many different cellular processes, including the folding of newly synthesized proteins, protein trafficking across cellular membranes, and the assembly/disassembly of protein complexes (1Hartl F.U. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Less well understood is the ability of Hsp72 to protect cells from cell death. Hsp72 has been shown to protect cells from necrosis and is capable of protecting and repairing important cell metabolic processes (3Gabai V.L. Kabakov A.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Yaglom J.A. Ekhterae D.

Cell Res. 1995; 217: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis, whereby cells actively engineer their own destruction in response to extracellular signals and intracellular damage (7Samali A. Robertson J.D. Peterson E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In contrast to necrosis, which is caused by metabolic failure leading to cell swelling and the eventual rupture of the cell membrane, apoptosis requires active cell metabolism to degrade the nuclear DNA, divide the cell into smaller membrane-bound vesicles, and mark these for phagocytosis by surrounding healthy cells (12Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 13Lawen A. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Apoptosis commonly involves the activation of caspases, a family of intracellular proteases normally present as zymogens (14Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). These caspases commit a cell to apoptosis by activating proteins directly involved in the apoptotic process, or inactivating anti-apoptotic proteins and those responsible for normal homeostasis and repair. Apoptosis through extracellular signaling (the extrinsic pathway) and in response to intracellular damage (the intrinsic pathway) are both dependent on caspase activation but differ in how that activation is achieved. In the case of the extrinsic pathway, membrane-bound receptors are oligomerized in response to ligand binding and directly activate the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and -10 (15Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These initiator caspases are then responsible for activating the effector caspases 3, 6, and 7 (16Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In some cells (known as type I cells) this is sufficient to induce apoptosis. In type II cells death is dependent on the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria in response to caspase-8 activity (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). This mitochondrial pathway is the same pathway activated in the cell in response to intracellular damage. Cytochrome c is released from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria and is bound by Apaf-1 along with ATP/dATP to form a large protein complex known as the apoptosome (18Cain K. Bratton S.B.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). This complex then binds and activates caspase-9, which is responsible for activating the effector caspases in a process analogous to that achieved by caspase-8 (21Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). A number of proteins are known to inhibit apoptosis and, in particular, by preventing the activation of the caspases. The best known of these are the anti-apoptotic homologs of Bcl-2 that act by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (22Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Another family of apoptotic inhibitors is the IAPs that directly inhibit caspase activity by binding to the active site of the enzyme (23Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 24Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Hsp72 also inhibits apoptosis but the mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Two groups have proposed that Hsp72 prevents the formation of an active apoptosome by binding directly to Apaf-1 (25Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 26Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that Hsp72 functions upstream of the caspase cascade by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (27Tsuchiya D. Hong S. Matsumori Y. Shiina H. Kayama T. Swanson R.A. Dillman W.H. Liu J. Panter S.S. Weinstein P.R. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2003; 23: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This inhibition of cytochrome c release may be achieved by the ability of Hsp72 to prevent Bax translocation in response to stress (30Gotoh T. Terada K. Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Two other reports have shown that Hsp72 failed to inhibit cytochrome c release but functioned either by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 in cytosols incubated with dATP (31Li C.Y. Lee J.S. Ko Y.G. Kim J.I. Seo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25665-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) or by acting downstream of the caspase cascade and down-regulating cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity (11Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that Hsp72 might inhibit apoptosis by targeting the JNK/SAPK 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RCMLA, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; UVC, ultraviolet C; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. pathway (9Gabai V.L.

Finally, it has been shown that Hsp72 binds to apoptosis-inducing factor, another apoptogenic factor released from the mitochondria, thereby preventing the chromatin condensation and apoptosis that result from apoptosis-inducing factor release (33Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This study endeavors to rationalize some of the many and often contradictory claims of Hsp72 function. We demonstrate that Hsp72 inhibits apoptosis in MEF by preventing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and not through interactions with the apoptosome or other downstream points in the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. In addition, the inability of Hsp72 to inhibit caspase activation by the apoptosome is confirmed in a range of fibroblast, epithelial, and lymphoid cells. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from BALB/c mice were minimally transformed with E1A and Ras as described previously (34Lowe S.W. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Amato Giaccia (Stanford University). MEF, MDA-MB-231, and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. MEF constitutively expressing Hsp72 were prepared as previously described (8Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MEFs expressing Bcl-2 were generated with a retroviral supernatant kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Strasser (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia). Cells were heated by immersion in a circulating water bath calibrated to 44° ± 0.1 °C for 15-60 min. For UV treatment, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed once in PBS before irradiation with 7 J/m2 UVC in a CL-1000 UV Cross-linker (UVP). Cells were treated with lyophilized mouse TNFα (Sigma) and etoposide (ETOPOPHOS, Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology). Recombinant Hsp72 (NSP555 and SPP755) was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Canada). Where indicated, cells were treated with 25-50 μm z-VAD-fmk or z-FA-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products) dissolved in Me2SO. Cells were stained with propidium iodide, and nuclear morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (8Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At least 200 cells were counted in each experiment, and the data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Long term survival was assessed in MEFs by clonogenic assays. Briefly, dilutions containing known numbers of cells (1-10,000) were placed in Petri dishes at 37 °C for 7-10 days. Clones (>50 cells) derived from cells that survived the stress were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 50% methanol and counted. Cells (3000 per well) were plated in 96-well plates 24 h prior to treatment. Cells were supplemented with 25 μm z-VAD-fmk immediately after heating and again 24 h later to ensure the drug was not depleted with time. The cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C and harvested at the specified time points by fixing with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The wells were then stained with 0.4% sulfur rhodamine B dissolved in 1% acetic acid. After extensive washing the immobilized dye was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Hsp72 expression in cells was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for human Hsp72 (N15) or with an antibody that detects both mouse and human Hsp72 and Hsp73 (N6, both kind gifts from Dr. W. Welch, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Human Apaf-1 expression was detected using a rat monoclonal antibody (2E12, kind gift from Dr L. O'Reilly, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia). Mouse Hsp60 was detected with a rabbit antibody (kind gift from Prof. N. Hoogenrad, La Trobe University, Australia). For assay of caspase-3 activity, ∼107 MEF or 4 × 107 293 cells were harvested in PBS/0.01% EDTA, washed once in PBS and once in cytosol preparation buffer, CPB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF) and resuspended in 0.4 ml of CPB. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min then disrupted using 15 strokes (20 strokes for 293 cells) of a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove organelles, including mitochondria. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay. For blue native electrophoresis, frozen cells were lysed by resuspending in 4 volumes of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 20 min before centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Cytosols contained no detectable amounts of cytochrome c as determined by Western blotting. Caspases were activated by the addition of dATP and bovine cytochrome c (Sigma) to aliquots of cytosol and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Caspase-3 activity was measured by the rate of cleavage of DEVD-pNA colorimetric substrate (BioMol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of Hsp72 on caspase-3 activity was determined by adding a 1/10th volume of the following to the cytosol and incubating for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of cytochrome c and dATP:bovine serum albumin (BSA) or recombinant human Hsp72 (Stressgen NSP555) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4); BSA or recombinant human Hsp72 (Stressgen SPP755) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF; BSA or Hsp72 in PBS dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Hsp72 was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Final concentrations of exogenous Hsp72 were 100 ng/μl or 1.4 μm. The effect of NaCl concentration on caspase-3 activity was determined by preincubation with the specified concentration of NaCl. Caspase-3 activity was measured in MEF, L929, MDA-MB-231, Skut1B, Jurkat, and CEM cells using the same method. Blue native electrophoresis was performed using a modification of the procedure of Schagger (35Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cytosols were activated by incubating with 2 mm dATP and 20 μg/ml cytochrome c for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were resolved on a 4-13% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel and 2.5% polyacrylamide loading gel. The cathode buffer contained 15 μg/ml Coomassie G-250. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the membranes immunoblotted as described above. Mechanical Cell Disruption—Cells were prepared as described previously, except lysates were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet remaining organelles, including mitochondria. Proteins from the pellets and supernatants were resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE. Cytochrome c Detection by Immunofluorescence—Cytochrome c release was measured using a modification of the method of Waterhouse and Trapani (36Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼105 MEFs were harvested and incubated for 10 min on ice in PBS containing 100 μg/ml digitonin and 100 mm KCl before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Effective permeabilization of cells by digitonin was confirmed by trypan blue staining. The cells were incubated with an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), an Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), followed by propidium iodide. The cells were subjected to FACS analysis on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. FACS analysis was performed using WinMDI 2.8 software. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 equipped with a krypton/argon laser and attached to a Leica DMRBE microscope. The Expression of Hsp72 Inhibits Apoptosis in Response to Heat, UVC Radiation, and TNFα but Not to Etoposide—As shown earlier (8Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), Hsp72 expression protects mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from apoptosis induced by heat shock, TNFα, and UVC radiation (Fig. 1A). Hsp72 did not protect MEFs from two DNA-damaging stresses: etoposide (Fig. 1A) and ionizing radiation (8Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The level of Hsp72 expression in two MEF lines infected with Hsp72 retrovirus, MEF-H2 and MEFH3, is within the normal physiological range, because it has been shown previously that exogenous Hsp72 expression in these cells is lower than that induced during thermotolerance (8Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Hsp72 confers long term protection from heat-induced apoptosis, not just a delay in apoptosis, as shown by increased clonogenic survival (Fig. 1B). MEF-H3 was less resistant to stress than MEF-H2 consistent with the lower expression of Hsp72 compared with MEF-H2 (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis in MEFs Is Dependent on Caspase Activity—The addition of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (25 μm) immediately after heating effectively inhibited the development of apoptotic nuclear morphology in both MEF and MEF-H2 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that caspase activity is required for heat-induced apoptosis. z-FA-fmk at 50 μm failed to inhibit apoptosis under identical conditions. z-VAD-fmk was also found to inhibit apoptosis in response to UVC, etoposide, and TNF-α (data not shown). To determine if inhibition of caspase activity was sufficient to confer a long term survival advantage for MEF, a sulfur rhodamine B assay was employed to measure cell growth. As shown in Fig. 2B, MEF-H2 proliferated more rapidly than parental MEF after heat. By comparison both cell lines grew at similar rates when cultured at 37 °C. z-VAD-fmk at 25 μm did not confer any survival advantage to either cell line after heat treatment. z-VAD-fmk was administered immediately after heating and again 24 h later to ensure that the drug was not depleted over time. Neither z-VAD-fmk nor the Me2SO carrier affected the growth rate of unheated cells (data not shown). It has been shown previously that z-VAD-fmk will effectively inhibit apoptosis in response to cell stress, but that the damaged cells will continue to die by necrosis (37Volbracht C. Leist M. Kolb S.A. Nicotera P. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 36-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lemaire C. Andreau K. Souvannavong V. Adam A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, 25 μm z-VAD-fmk did confer a long term survival advantage to MEFs cultured in the presence of TNFα, which acts through the extrinsic signaling pathway (Fig. 2C). Given that Hsp72 inhibits apoptosis in response to heat, caspase activity in MEF was measured to determine if Hsp72 also functioned by inhibiting caspase-3 activity. Heat-induced caspase activity was found to be substantially less in MEF-H2 compared with parental MEFs (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that caspase activity is required for heat-induced apoptosis and that Hsp72 functions by inhibiting the ability of the cell to activate the caspase cascade. Hsp72 Does Not Inhibit Cytochrome c Activation of Caspase Activity in an in Vitro System—It has been suggested that Hsp72 interacts directly with Apaf-1, inhibiting its ability to activate caspase-9 in response to cytochrome c and dATP, either by inhibiting the formation of the apoptosome, or by preventing the binding of pro-caspase-9 to this complex (25Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 26Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Thus, one would predict that cell cytosols derived from MEF-H2 would be more resistant to caspase activation in response to cytochrome c and dATP than cytosols derived from parental MEFs. However, as shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), the addition of cytochrome c and dATP induced at least as much, if not more caspase-3 activity in MEF-H2 cytosols compared with cytosols derived from parental MEF. This was demonstrated using a range of cytochrome c and dATP concentrations that induced caspase activity proportional to the dose. A similar result was found in the Hsp72-expressing cell lines derived from L929, MDA-MB-231, Skut1B, Jurkat, and CEM cells compared with base vector-transduced cells (data not shown). In all these cell lines Hsp72 is protective against various apoptotic stresses. 2R. Steel, J. P. Doherty, K. Buzzard, N. Clemons, C. J. Hawkins, and Robin L. Anderson, unpublished data. The inability of constitutively expressed Hsp72 to inhibit caspase activation in cell cytosols in response to cytochrome c and dATP suggests that Hsp72 does not inhibit caspase activation through direct interaction with the apoptosome. The Ability of Recombinant Hsp72 to Inhibit Caspase Activation in Cell Cytosols in the Presence of Cytochrome c and dATP Is Due to the Increased Salt Concentration—The lack of inhibition of caspase-3 activity in cytosols from Hsp72-expressing cells would not be predicted from the previously published results (25Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 26Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). To investigate this anomaly, cytosols were prepared from 293 cells and incubated with cytochrome c/dATP in the presence or absence of the same recombinant human Hsp72 (Stressgen SPP755) as described in the previous publications. Recombinant Hsp72 was able to inhibit caspase activation (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). A similar result was obtained with another Hsp72 product (NSP555) from Stressgen (lane 5). Hsp72 (NSP555) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) instead of a Tris buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (SPP755). The reason for the reduced caspase activation upon addition of recombinant Hsp72 became apparent when cytosols were spiked with an equal volume of an identical buffer to that used in the Hsp72 preparation. BSA in PBS (lane 7), or PBS alone (data not shown), inhibited caspase activation to a similar extent as the recombinant Hsp72. Furthermore, Hsp72 that had been denatured by heating at 95 °C retained the ability to inhibit caspase activation (lanes 4 and 6). Similarly, recombinant Hsp72 dialyzed against 20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT showed a reduced capacity to inhibit caspase activation (lane 8). BSA in PBS also lost its inhibitory capacity after dialysis in the same buffer (lane 9). The native conformation of dialyzed Hsp72 was confirmed by its ability to bind reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLA), a known binding substrate of Hsp70 (Fig. 3E) (39Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The binding of RCMLA to Hsp72 was inhibited by 2 mm ATP confirming that both the C-terminal peptide binding domain and the N-terminal ATP binding domain were functional (39Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 40Greene L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Heat-denatured Hsp72 was not detected by native gel electrophoresis, presumably because the protein was aggregated and failed to enter the gel (data not shown). It is important to note that human 293 cells already express large quantities of the “inducible” Hsp72 in a constitutive fashion (Fig. 3F), a property that has been attributed to the presence of the E1A viral antigen in these cells (41Wu B.J. Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Nevins J.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 913-919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although 293 cells were used previously in this cytochrome c-activated caspase assay (25Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M.

Hence, the experiment was repeated with cytosols derived from MDA-MB-231, which express Hsp72 at physiological levels (Fig. 3F) and with MEF cytosols (data not shown). Again, in MDA-MB-231 cytosols, both recombinant Hsp72 in PBS (NSP555) (Fig. 3D, lane 11) and heat-denatured NSP555 (lane 12) blocked caspase-3 activity while NSP555 dialyzed against a low salt buffer lost its activity (lane 13). Finally, increasing concentrations of NaCl were added to 293 cytosols incubated with cytochrome c and dATP to quantify the influence of salt. As reported previously (43Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J.

Efficient accession of the cross-presentation pathway requires APC receptor-mediated endocytosis of the chaperone/peptide complexes. Previously, scavenger receptor class-A (SRA) was shown to play a substantial role in trafficking gp96 and calreticulin into macrophages, accounting for half of total receptor-mediated uptake. However, the scavenger receptor ligand fucoidin competed the chaperone uptake beyond that accounted for by SRA, indicating that another scavenger receptor(s) may also contribute. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that the residual calreticulin uptake into SRA-/- macrophages is competed by the scavenger receptor ligand acetylatedlow density lipoprotein (LDL). We now report that an additional scavenger receptor, SREC-I (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell-I), mediates the endocytosis of calreticulin and gp96. Ectopic expression of SREC-I in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded chaperone recognition and uptake, and these processes were competed by the inhibitory ligands fucoidin and acetylated (Ac)LDL. Although AcLDL competes for the chaperone interactions with SRA and SREC, we showed that not all of the scavenger receptors, which bind AcLDL, bind calreticulin or gp96. The overexpression of SREC-I in macrophages increased chaperone endocytosis, indicating that SREC-I functions in APCs and that the cytosolic components necessary for the endocytosis of SREC-I and its cargo are present and not limiting in APCs. These data identify a novel class of ligands for SREC-I and provide insight into the mechanisms by which APCs and potentially endothelial cells traffic chaperone/antigen complexes.

Complementary to their ability to raise peptide-specific responses, chaperones also elicit peptide-independent responses both in vitro and in vivo. They stimulate APCs including the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), induce cytokine responses, elicit peptide-independent anti-tumor responses, and can effect autoimmune disease (25Singh-Jasuja H.

Additionally, perhaps linked to its ability to inhibit tumor metastasis, calreticulin has effects on endothelial cells. CRT can inhibit endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation and is reported to be anti-angiogenic (31Pike S.E. Yao L. Setsuda J. Jones K.D. Cherney B. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Nakhasi H. Atreya C.D.

Despite the pleiotropic immunological effects of chaperones, the cellular receptors that mediate their immunogenicity are not well understood. Here we identified a cell surface receptor for calreticulin that is present both on macrophages and endothelial cells. Recent research has focused on the identification of cell surface chaperone receptors. Toll-like receptors and CD14 have been posited to transduce chaperone-mediated signaling (26Vabulas R.M.

Of particular interest has been the identification of endocytic receptors for chaperones, particularly in the context of chaperone/antigen complexes. CD91 (LDL receptor-related protein, an α2-macroglobulin receptor) was originally reported to be the unique endocytic receptor for a variety of chaperones including CRT, gp96, hsp70, and hsp90 (40Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 41Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, other endocytic chaperone receptors have subsequently been identified, including a pair of scavenger receptors. LOX-1 was identified as an endocytic receptor for hsp70 but not gp96, whereas scavenger receptor class-A (SRA) was identified as an endocytic receptor for gp96 and CRT (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S.

The studies using SRA-/- peritoneal macrophages indicate that SRA accounts for approximately half of the endocytic capability for gp96 and CRT (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C. Pizzo S.V. Post S.R. Nicchitta C.V. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6127-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Additionally intriguing, however, was the finding that a scavenger receptor ligand, fucoidin, competed >80% cellular gp96 and CRT binding and uptake more than could be accounted for by SRA (24Berwin B.

Here we identified a second scavenger receptor, SREC-I (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell-I), as an endocytic receptor for the chaperones CRT and gp96. SREC isoforms were originally cloned from endothelial cDNA libraries and subsequently identified in macrophages and phagocytic cells, including the CED-1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans (45Zhou Z.

SREC-I, probably through epidermal growth factor-like repeats in its extracellular domain, binds and internalizes modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) and has an unusually long intracellular tail for a scavenger receptor (49Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A second isoform, SREC-II, engages in heterophilic interactions with SREC-I but does not bind modified LDL well (47Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a follow up to our previous study identifying SRA as an endocytic chaperone receptor, we note that, in addition to fucoidin (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C. Pizzo S.V. Post S.R. Nicchitta C.V. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6127-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), AcLDL competes for chaperone binding to SRA and to macrophage cell surfaces. Fucoidin and AcLDL also partially compete for CRT uptake into SRA-/- cells, indicating the presence of another endocytic scavenger receptor. Screening genetic expression of scavenger receptors in CHO cells for augmented chaperone association, we have identified SREC-I as an endocytic receptor of CRT and gp96. The specificity of this binding was examined by competition with the SREC-I ligands fucoidin and AcLDL. Interestingly, the expression of other scavenger receptors, which bind modified LDL, did not confer endocytic activity for CRT, indicating a selectivity for CRT by SRA and SREC-I. Additionally, CRT and gp96 are structurally dissimilar and show no apparent similarity with AcLDL or fucoidin, potentially indicating that SREC-I binds these competing ligands on the basis of pattern recognition. Recombinant expression of SREC-I in macrophages increased the uptake of CRT, indicating that SREC-I functions as an endocytic receptor for chaperones in APCs and that receptor number is a limiting factor in chaperone uptake. These data identified CRT and gp96 as novel ligands for SREC-I and that SREC-I functions as an endocytic receptor in the trafficking of these chaperones. Antibodies and Proteins—Calreticulin was expressed and purified as described previously (50Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

AlexaFluor-succinimidyl esters, Alexa488-AcLDL, Alexa488-wheat germ agglutinin, and DiOC6 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Protein labeling with the succinimidyl ester conjugates was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Fucoidin and LPS were obtained from Sigma. Anti-SREC antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals. Cell Culture and Transfection—Peritoneal macrophages were elicited in C57BL/6 mice (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) as described previously (52Wassenberg J.J. Dezfulian C.

Macrophages were enriched by adherence selection for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum on 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) for flow cytometry experiments. RAW264.7 macrophages and CHO cells were cultured according to the published ATCC protocols. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells expressing SRA were used as described previously (24Berwin B.

In summary, C57BL/6 mouse (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) bone marrow-derived cells were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in DC culture media (RPMI 1640 medium, 5% heat-inactivated fetal/bovine serum + 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mg/ml gentamicin, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% cell culture supernatant from X63 cells expressing a full-length granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor cDNA) and plated at 1 ml/well in a 24-well tissue culture plate. On days 2 and 4, the culture medium was removed along with all of the non-adherent cells and replaced with 1 ml of fresh DC medium. On day 6, wells were vigorously washed with culture medium to collect semi-adherent cells. Cells were purified further using negative selection of granulocytes with biotin-labeled anti-GR-1 antibodies (BD Biosciences) and magnetic cell sorting streptavidin beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) to leave immature DCs. The cDNAs encoding various scavenger receptors were described previously (42Delneste Y. Magistrelli G. Gauchat J. Haeuw J. Aubry J. Nakamura K. Kawakami-Honda N. Goetsch L. Sawamura T. Bonnefoy J. Jeannin P. Immunity. 2002; 17: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected into CHO cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected with hygromycin (300 μg/ml), and individual clones were selected and expanded. Scavenger receptor expression was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates with anti protein C-tag polyclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and, in some cases, by interaction with Alexa488-labeled acetylated LDL (Molecular Probes) (42Delneste Y. Magistrelli G. Gauchat J. Haeuw J. Aubry J. Nakamura K. Kawakami-Honda N. Goetsch L. Sawamura T. Bonnefoy J. Jeannin P.

Detection of Fluorescent Ligand Association—Receptor-mediated ligand uptake studies were performed as described previously (10Berwin B. Rosser M.F. Brinker K.G. Nicchitta C.V. Traffic. 2002; 3: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 52Wassenberg J.J. Dezfulian C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Berwin B. Hart J.P. Pizzo S.V. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4282-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The uptake of protein was accomplished by placing cells in 37 °C medium containing the labeled protein, in some cases in the presence of the indicated concentration of competitive ligand. Cells then were washed with cold PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and removed from 24-well plates with a cell scraper (Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA) followed by analysis for fluorescence by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Further analysis was performed using Cell Quest (BD Biosciences). HEK-SRAtet cells were induced and incubated with fluorescent ligand as described previously (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C.

EC50 of CRT uptake by CHO-SREC cells was determined by the aforementioned uptake assay using 25 μg/ml fucoidin in parallel assays to determine nonspecific binding and uptake. For fluorescent staining and laser-scanning confocal microscopy studies, cells were plated on 8-chambered LAB-TEK slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Cells were washed with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and subsequently, ligands were incubated with cells at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. The cells were then washed in PBS and fixed for 10 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were rinsed and mounted in 10% PBS, 90% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine (mounting medium). Images were digitally captured using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). Competition of CRT Endocytosis by AcLDL and Fucoidin Indicates the Activity of an Additional Scavenger Receptor(s)— Receptor-mediated endocytosis is required for efficient trafficking of molecular chaperones into APCs and representation of their associated antigens. SRA was previously identified as an endocytic receptor for CRT and gp96, and experiments using SRA-/- macrophages indicated that SRA accounts for ∼50% cell-surface CRT binding capacity on these cells (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C. Pizzo S.V. Post S.R. Nicchitta C.V. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6127-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The interaction between SRA and CRT or gp96 was efficiently competed by the scavenger receptor ligand fucoidin (24Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C. Pizzo S.V. Post S.R. Nicchitta C.V. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6127-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 60Radsak M.P. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Braedel S. Brossart P. Rammensee H.G. Schild H.

Overexpression of wild-type p53 down-regulates the enzymatic activity of telomerase in various cancer cell lines through transcriptional repression of its catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In this study, we re-evaluated the role of p53 in telomerase regulation using isogenic cell lines expressing physiological levels of p53. We demonstrate that endogenous wild-type p53 was able to down-regulate telomerase activity, hTERT mRNA levels, and promoter activity; however, the ability to repress hTERT expression was found to be cell type-specific. The integrity of the DNA-binding core domain, the N-terminal transactivation domain, and the C-terminal oligomerization domains of p53 was essential for hTERT promoter repression, whereas the proline-rich domain and the extreme C terminus were not required. Southwestern and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated lack of p53 binding to the hTERT promoter, raising the possibility of an indirect repressive mechanism. The down-regulation of hTERT promoter activity was abolished by a dominant-negative E2F1 mutant. Mutational analysis identified a specific E2F site responsible for p53-mediated repression. Knockdown of the key p53 transcriptional target, p21, was sufficient to eliminate the p53-dependent repression of hTERT. Inactivation of the Rb family using either viral oncoproteins or RNA interference attenuated the repression. Inhibition of histone deacetylases also interfered with the repression of hTERT by p53. Therefore, our results suggest that repression of hTERT by endogenous p53 is mediated by p21 and E2F.

Telomerase, a specialized RNA-directed DNA polymerase that extends telomeres at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes, has been implicated in aging, immortalization, and transformation. The human telomerase complex is composed of a catalytic subunit (hTERT) 1The abbreviations used are: hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. with a reverse transcriptase activity (1Nakamura T.M.

Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar) and an RNA-containing subunit (human telomerase RNA) (2Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) that is used as a template for extending telomere length. Telomerase activity is repressed in most normal human somatic tissues, whereas the enzyme is active in ∼90% of human cancers (3Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism through which telomerase is reactivated in the process of carcinogenesis remains unclear. Telomerase enzymatic activity can be regulated at multiple levels, including hTERT transcription, alternative splicing, chaperone-mediated folding, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation; however, the major control mechanism of telomerase regulation seems to be at the level of hTERT transcription (for a review of telomerase regulation, see Ref. 4Kyo S. Inoue M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 688-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor that can mediate many downstream effects such as growth arrest and apoptosis through activation or repression of its target genes (5Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). p53 is the most frequently altered gene in human cancers. Mutations and deletions of p53 are found in over half of human primary tumors (6Harris C.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Absence of functional p53 allows cellular immortalization and predisposes cells to neoplastic transformation (7Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to correlate the status of p53 and telomerase activity during carcinogenesis. p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit increased (>3-fold) basal levels of telomerase activity relative to those present in matched early passage fibroblasts derived from p53 wild-type-expressing embryos (8Drissi R. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29994-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevation of p53 protein levels, which is usually associated with inactivating p53 mutations, is correlated with telomerase expression in cervical cancer (9Nair P. Jayaprakash P.G. Nair M.K. Pillai M.R. Acta Oncol. 2000; 39: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), breast cancer (10Roos G. Nilsson P. Cajander S. Nielsen N.H. Arnerlov C. Landberg G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), non-small cell lung cancer (11Kiyooka K. Maniwa Y. Okada M. Ann. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1999; 5: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar), and ovarian cancers (12Wisman G.B. Hollema H. Helder M.N. Knol A.J. Van der Meer G.T. Krans M. De Jong S. De Vries E.G. Van der Zee A.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1451-1459PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type p53 was shown to down-regulate telomerase enzymatic activity in a number of cancer cell lines independent of its effects on growth arrest and apoptosis (13Kusumoto M. Ogawa T. Mizumoto K. Ueno H. Niiyama H. Sato N. Nakamura M. Tanaka M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2140-2147PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was attributed to transcriptional repression of hTERT by wild-type p53 since it was preceded by down-regulation of hTERT mRNA (13Kusumoto M. Ogawa T. Mizumoto K. Ueno H. Niiyama H. Sato N. Nakamura M. Tanaka M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2140-2147PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion was supported by promoter activity studies demonstrating the ability of p53 to repress hTERT promoter-reporter constructs. Mapping studies showed that mutation of all five Sp1 transcription factor-binding sites within the core hTERT promoter results in strong down-regulation of the reporter activity, which cannot be further repressed by p53 (14Kanaya T. Kyo S. Hamada K. Takakura M. Kitagawa Y. Harada H. Inoue M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar). In an additional study, activation of exogenous temperature-sensitive p53 in BL41 Burkitt's lymphoma cells triggered rapid down-regulation of hTERT mRNA expression independent of the induction of the p53 target gene p21 (15Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A. Bjorkholm M. Chen Z. Zaid A. Selivanova G. Peterson C. Wiman K.G. Pisa P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mitomycin C treatment of three breast cancer cell lines results in strong down-regulation of hTERT only in MCF7 cells, which express endogenous wild-type p53, but not in T-47D cells carrying mutant p53 and in p53-null MDA-MB-157 cells. Wild-type p53 inhibits Sp1 binding to the hTERT proximal promoter in a gel shift assay with purified proteins. The ability of p53 and Sp1 to form a complex was shown by co-immunoprecipitation (15Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A. Bjorkholm M. Chen Z. Zaid A. Selivanova G. Peterson C. Wiman K.G. Pisa P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a mechanism of hTERT repression in which p53 binds to Sp1 and renders it inaccessible to hTERT promoter activation (15Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A. Bjorkholm M. Chen Z. Zaid A. Selivanova G. Peterson C. Wiman K.G. Pisa P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these findings has been questioned because most of these studies were based on non-physiological overexpression of p53 or lacked isogenic controls (16Lin S.Y. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore re-examined the role of p53 in telomerase repression using proper isogenic controls and in lines expressing physiological levels of p53. Our results demonstrate that endogenous p53 represses telomerase in a cell type-specific manner. This p53-induced repression occurs through an indirect mechanism and is mediated by the p21/E2F pathway.

The additional point mutations of the hTERT promoter were generated on the template of pGL3-core-phTERT with a QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) using the following primers (only the sense primer is shown; mutations are in lowercase; and the numbers indicate positions relative to the transcription initiation site (22Takakura M.

The M6 reporter (point mutation of the most proximal Sp1 site) was constructed by subcloning the SacII and XhoI inserts from the mt5Sp1 plasmid into wild-type pGL3-core-phTERT digested with the same enzymes. Expression plasmids for wild-type human p53 and mutants L22Q/W23S, R273H, R175H, 360del, and 342del were gifts from Dr. C. Hurris and were as described (23Zhou X. Wang X.W. Xu L. Hagiwara K. Nagashima M. Wolkowicz R. Zurer I. Rotter V. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 843-848PubMed Google Scholar). E2FdTA expression plasmid pRcCMV-E2F1-(1–363) was as described (24Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Small hairpin RNA either in the pSuper vector (for luciferase assays) or in the pSuper-Retro-Hygro vector (for stable expression), both of which were gifts from Dr. R. Agami, were prepared as described (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). The following 19-bp sequences were targeted: for p21 (p21i), GACCATGTGGACCTGTCAC; for mouse p63 (mp63i), GGCAGAGCGTGCTGGTCCC; and for the p53 control mutated sequence (p53i-mut), GACTCCCGTTGTAATCTAC. Western Blots—For Western blotting of p53 and p21 proteins, 50 μg of total cell lysate was separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% dry skimmed milk in PBS/Tween, and p53 was detected using a polyclonal antibody produced in our laboratory. For detection of p21, a polyclonal antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The protein-antibody complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Roche Applied Science) using the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading was verified in each experiment by Ponceau red staining. Production of Stable Cell Lines—MCF7, HT1080, and LNCaP cells were stably transfected or infected with an ecotropic receptor. Ecotropic Phoenix packaging cells were transfected with 10 μg of the appropriate retroviral construct by the calcium phosphate method. Culture supernatants were collected 36–48 h post-transfection and filtered. Target cells were infected with the filtered viral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 12 h, after which the medium was changed. Fresh viral suspensions were added after a 24-h interval for an additional 12 h. For production of stable RNA interference (RNAi) against p21 or mouse p63 in MCF7 cells, pSuper-Retro-Hygro was used. Following infection, cells were selected with 1 mg/ml hygromycin for 1 week. For production of HT1080 and LNCaP cells with inactivated p53, the pBabe-GSE56-puro retroviral construct was used. Following infection, cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week. Southwestern Blot Analysis—DNA samples (300 ng of each) were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and cross-linked to the membrane by UV light at 120 J. The membrane was washed twice with PBS and blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 3 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml protein in binding buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). 3.1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg/ml pGL3 plasmid DNA for blocking). The diluted nuclear extract was incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, the blots were probed with anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, washed with PBS/Tween, probed with anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (27Zalcenstein A. Stambolsky P. Weisz L. Muller M. Wallach D. Goncharov T.M. Krammer P.H. Rotter V. Oren M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5667-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primers used for the detection of hTERT promoter sequences that amplify region –217 to +119 relative to the transcription initiation site were 5′-CAGGCCGGGCTCCCAGTGGA and 3′-CAGCAGGGAGCGCACG-GCTC. The primers used for the detection of p21 promoter sequences that amplify the region near the p53-binding site were 5′-GCACTCTT-GTCCCCCAG and 3′-TCTATGCCAGAGCTCAACAT. Transfections and Reporter Assays—Cells were grown in complete medium and replated at 3 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate 16–24 h before transfection. For reporter gene assay, cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) using 300 ng of promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, the indicated amounts of expression plasmids, and 100 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector for normalization of transfection efficiency. After transfection (48 h), cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using reagents and procedures from Promega. For experiments with RNAi, 250 ng of Rb RNAi, 250 ng of p107 RNAi, and 700 ng of p130 RNAi were cotransfected with the reporter. The targeted sequences are as follows: for p130, CUCUUGGGCCUGC-CUUGTT; for Rb, CACACUCCAGUUAGGACUGTT; and for p107, CC-AAGAGUCAAGGAAGUUCTT. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Telomerase Activity Assays— Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.), and 2 μg was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers (Roche Applied Science). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for total hTERT mRNA was performed using the Assays-on Demand TaqMan kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The values for hTERT were normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping control. The primer sequences for SYBR Green real-time PCR of GAPDH were as follows: 5′-ACCCACTC-CTCCACCTTTGA and 3′-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT. For specific detection of full-length hTERT by semiquantitative PCR, the following primers were used: 5′-TGTCAAGGTGGATGTGACG and 3′-CTGGAGGTCTGTCAAGGTA. The forward primer is directed to the α-splice site so that the α-spliced form is not amplified. Similarly, the design of the reverse primer prevents amplification of the β-spliced form. PCR was performed in the presence of [33P]dCTP, and reaction products were detected by autoradiography. Telomerase enzymatic activity was measured using the real-time telomeric repeat amplification protocol essentially as described (28Wege H. Chui M.S. Le H.T. Tran J.M. Zern M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: E3-E9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 Represses Telomerase Activity and hTERT mRNA—To examine the role of endogenous wild-type p53 in telomerase regulation, we used several isogenic cell line pairs specifically differing in their p53 status. To this end, MCF7 breast cancer cells containing wild-type p53 and their derivatives stably expressing p53 RNAi were used (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, induction of the p53 protein following doxorubicin treatment was strongly suppressed in RNAi-containing cells (MCF7-p53i) compared with cells expressing the vector control (MCF7-vector). As shown in Fig. 1B, following 48 h of doxorubicin treatment, a 10-fold down-regulation of telomerase activity was observed in control cells. This inhibition was largely p53-dependent, as only a 2-fold reduction was detected in MCF7-p53i cells. Next, we examined the levels of hTERT mRNA using realtime quantitative RT-PCR. A significant p53-dependent reduction of hTERT mRNA could be detected as early as 18 h post-treatment (Fig. 1C). The long lag between mRNA down-regulation and the decrease in telomerase enzymatic activity is consistent with the reported long half-life of the latter (29Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10687-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). hTERT was shown to have a complex splicing pattern, which gives rise to at least four isoforms (full-length, α, β, and αβ), with only the full-length form catalytically active (30Ulaner G.A. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar). Since all alternatively spliced forms of hTERT were detected in our real-time RT-PCR, we tested specifically whether the full-length form that encodes enzymatically active hTERT is down-regulated following doxorubicin treatment. RT-PCR using primers specific for this form indeed showed strong down-regulation of full-length hTERT in MCF7-vector cells (Fig. 1D). To corroborate the ability of endogenous p53 to down-regulate hTERT expression in an additional isogenic system, we used LNCaP prostate cancer cells containing wild-type p53 and their derivatives in which p53 was inactivated using the dominant-negative GSE56 peptide (31Mittelman J.M. Gudkov A.V. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1999; 25: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Following doxorubicin treatment, we observed strong p53-dependent repression of hTERT mRNA (Fig. 1E). Of note, the phenomenon of p53-dependent repression of hTERT mRNA was not general to all the cell lines examined. In a number of isogenic cell lines, the reduction of hTERT mRNA following drug treatment was in-dependent of the p53 status (Table I).Table IRepression of hTERT by endogenous wild-type p53 is cell type-specificCell lineDescriptionMeans of p53 inactivationp53-dependent hTERT repressionMCF7Breast cancersiRNA for p53YesLNCaPProstate cancerGSE56YesHCT-116Colon cancerGene knockoutNoHT1080FibrosarcomaGSE56NoRKOColon cancerE6No Open table in a new tab p53 Represses the Transcriptional Activity of the hTERT Promoter—To examine whether p53-mediated down-regulation of hTERT mRNA is due to promoter repression, we performed a series of hTERT promoter-luciferase gene reporter assays (Fig. 2A). As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, wild-type p53 repressed the hTERT promoter constructs of different lengths in a dose-dependent manner when cotransfected into p53-null H1299 cells. The core promoter was sufficient to respond to the p53-mediated repression. To avoid the effects of exogenous p53 overexpression and to extend the analysis to another cell type, we assessed the effect of endogenous p53 by inactivating it using the dominant-negative peptide p53-DD (18Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The transfection process itself stabilized and activated endogenous p53 (data not shown); and thus, the reporter activity in the absence of p53-DD reflects the effect of activated p53. Inactivation of p53 by cotransfection with p53-DD strongly reduced the promoter activity of a known p53 transactivation target, p21waf1, and resulted in ∼2.5-fold up-regulation of both 5.9-kb and core hTERT promoter activities (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that p53-mediated repression maps to the core promoter. Mapping of p53 Domains Required for Telomerase Repression—To map the domains of p53 necessary for telomerase repression, H1299 cells were cotransfected with the core hTERT promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with various p53 mutants. Similar expression levels of the different p53 forms were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the most frequent naturally occurring point mutations in the DNA-binding core domain (R175H and R273H) as well as the inactivating double mutation in the transactivation domain (L22Q/W23S) eliminated p53-mediated repression. Deletion of 51 amino acids (342del), which disrupts the oligomerization domain of p53, also abolished repression. Thus, the integrity of the DNA-binding core domain, the N-terminal transactivation domain, and the C-terminal oligomerization domains is essential for repression. In contrast, deletion of 33 C-terminal amino acids (360del) or the proline-rich domain (62–91del) did not interfere with repression, meaning that these domains are dispensable for this function. The proline-rich domain is important for the recruitment of the Sin3A corepressor and histone deacetylases (32Zilfou J.T. Hoffman W.H. Sank M. George D.L. Murphy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 has been demonstrated in the case of stathmin and map4 (33Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that recruitment of the Sin3A corepressor by p53 is not involved in hTERT repression. Overall, the pattern of domains essential for hTERT repression is identical to that needed for transactivation by p53. p53 Is Not Associated with the Core hTERT Promoter in Vitro and in Vivo—Since our mapping demonstrated the importance of the intact p53 DNA-binding core domain, we hypothesized that p53 may bind to the hTERT promoter. Examination of the core hTERT promoter sequence revealed a lack of the typical p53 consensus binding sites. However, since this is generally the case for transcriptional repression by p53, we decided to test whether p53 can bind elsewhere to the hTERT promoter. First, we assessed whether p53 can bind the hTERT promoter in vitro using a Southwestern assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, only background binding of wild-type p53 to the pGL3 plasmid containing the core hTERT promoter could be detected. In contrast, strong binding to the same plasmid containing the p21 promoter (serving as a positive control) was observed. Similar results were obtained with endogenous p53 from doxorubicin-treated MCF7 cells (data not shown). To examine whether p53 binds to the hTERT promoter in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment. MCF7 cells and their counterparts expressing p53 siRNA were either treated with 0.4 μm doxorubicin for 16 h or left untreated. Following formaldehyde cross-linking and precipitation of the chromatin with anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, the precipitated DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using primers specific to the hTERT promoter or the p53 binding site in the promoter of a known p53 target gene, p21waf1. As shown in Fig. 4B, no amplification of hTERT promoter sequences could be detected, whereas the p21 promoter sequence was easily detected in the same immunoprecipitation product. The specificity of this immunoprecipitation was demonstrated by the lack of a PCR product of the p21 promoter in the no-antibody control and its lower intensity in MCF7-p53i cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that the p53 protein does not associate with the hTERT promoter. An Atypical E2F Site Is Responsible for Repression of the hTERT Promoter by p53—Since the mutational analysis demonstrated that DNA binding by p53 was required for hTERT repression (Fig. 3), but no direct p53 binding to the core hTERT promoter was apparent, we proposed that p53 must bind elsewhere in the genome to mediate hTERT promoter repression. The complete correlation of the domains necessary for repression with the structural requirements for transactivation by p53 raised the possibility that p53 activates a target gene whose product represses the hTERT promoter. The cell type variability of p53-mediated hTERT repression (Table I) is consistent with this hypothesis and can potentially be explained by the absence of the mediator(s) in some cancer cell lines. We therefore attempted to identify such putative mediator(s) by identification of the cis-regulatory element in the hTERT promoter that is responsible for p53-mediated repression. To this end, we created several deletion and point mutati"

However, the actual function of eIF5A in apoptosis is still unknown. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify eIF5A-interacting proteins to help us understand the mechanisms of eIF5A. Our results demonstrated that eIF5A and syntenin could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo and functioned collaboratively to regulate p53 activity. Our findings, for the first time, revealed a new biological activity for eIF5A as the regulator of p53. Overexpression of eIF5A or its EFP domain resulted in up-regulation of p53, and silencing eIF5A by small interfering RNA reduced the p53 protein level. Further analysis by reverse transcription PCR showed eIF5A-activated p53 transcription. The effect of eIF5A on p53 transcriptional activity was further demonstrated by the increasing expressions of p21 and Bax, well known target genes of p53. In contrast, a point mutant of eIF5A, hypusination being abolished, was revealed to be functionally defective in p53 up-regulation. Overexpression of eIF5A led to a p53-dependent apoptosis or sensitized cells to induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents. However, when eIF5A interacted with its novel partner, syntenin, the eIF5A-induced increase in p53 protein level was significantly inhibited. Therefore, eIF5A seems to be a previously unrecognized regulator of p53 that may define a new pathway for p53-dependent apoptosis, and syntenin might regulate p53 by balancing the regulation of eIF5A signaling to p53 for apoptosis.

The putative eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF5A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescence protein; RFP, red fluorescence protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; NFRET, normalized FRET.1The abbreviations used are: eIF5A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescence protein; RFP, red fluorescence protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; NFRET, normalized FRET. is an intriguing protein, because it is the only cellular protein known to contain the unique amino acid hypusine, a modification that appears to be required for cell proliferation (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. Biol.

The protein was originally described as a translation initiation factor because of its ability to stimulate the synthesis of methionyl-puromycin in vitro and to transiently attach to ribosomes in the course of initiation of eukaryotic cellular protein synthesis (4Benne R. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 475-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It could promote the formation of the first peptide bond during the initial stage of protein synthesis (6Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). However, the major evidence for the function comes from a nonphysiological in vitro reaction. Actually, depletion of this factor in yeast caused only a small reduction in the protein synthesis rate (7Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that eIF5A did not function for general protein synthesis. eIF5A was further hypothesized to be involved in the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs, for example, those involved in the cell cycle progression (G1/S transition) (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Biofactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of eIF5A has been reported to correlate with cell proliferation; an increase in G1-arrested cells was observed after depletion of this factor in yeast (7Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although eIF5A was originally designated as an “initiation factor,” the recent in vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that eIF5A is more than an initiator of protein translation. The finding that eIF5A is a cellular cofactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Rev, and HTLV-1 Rex transactivator proteins in mRNA export suggests that it can have additional activities. Moreover, the factor interacts with the general nuclear export receptor CRM1 during their transportation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (9Rosorius O. Reichart B. Kratzer F. Heger P. Dabauvalle M.C. Hauber J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eIF5A protein expression was normally very low but inducible with T lymphocyte-specific stimuli in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals, and a significant up-regulation of eIF5A mRNA was found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients (10Bevec D. Klier H. Holter W. Tschachler E. Valent P. Lottspeich F. Baumruker T. Hauber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10829-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eIF5A expression is also significantly increased during dendritic cell maturation, and hypusine formation appears to be essential for this process (11Kruse M. Rosorius O. Kratzer F. Bevec D. Kuhnt C. Steinkasserer A. Schuler G. Hauber J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Further, the protein expression is significantly induced, and the hypusine formation activity increased more than 30-fold in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (12Chen Z.P. Chen K.Y. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of post-translational modification of eIF5A is evident, because agents blocking the lysine/hypusine transformation inhibit the growth of mammalian cells, inducing reversible arrest at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) in Chinese hamster ovary cells and apoptosis in tumor cells (13Tome M.E. Fiser S.M. Payne C.M. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We recently reported that eIF5A was involved in the apoptosis of tumor cells induced by inhibition of ubiquitin proteasomes (14Jin B.F. He K. Wang H.X. Wang J. Zhou T. Lan Y. Hu M.R. Wei K.H. Yang S.C. Shen B.F. Zhang X.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4819-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data suggest that eIF5A may be involved in cell growth and apoptosis. However, the actual function of eIF5A in apoptosis is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, a new biological activity for eIF5A as the regulator of p53 and that eIF5A and syntenin could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo and function collaboratively to regulate p53 activity. Plasmids, Cell Lines, Transfection, and Antibody—eIF5A and its truncation mutants were prepared by PCR-specific primers and cloned in-frame into the pGBKT7 vector, and the human syntenin cDNA was isolated from a human mammary cDNA library and cloned into the GAL4 activation domain vector pGADT7 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Myc and HA epitope tags were introduced to the N terminus of eIF5A and syntenin by cloning into the pXJ40myc or the pXJ40HA mammalian expressing vectors, respectively. Constructs encoding GST fusion proteins were prepared by amplification of each sequence by standard PCR methods, and the fragments were cloned in-frame into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences). The eIF5AK50A with lysine 50 replacement by alanine was prepared by PCR method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. eIF5A and its domains (EFP, eif5a), eIF5AK50A, and eIF4A were cloned in-frame into the pXJ40HA mammalian expressing vector. The constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct orientation. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, the eIF5A cDNA and eIF5AK50A were amplified and ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vectors (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Syntenin cDNA was ligated into the pDsRed-N1 vectors (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). H460 (p53WT) and H1299 (p53-/-), derived from human lung cancer, MDA-MB-435 cells derived from human breast cancer, and 293T and COS-7 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transient transfections were performed by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for the plasmids above. Anti-p53 antibody and anti-p-p53 (Ser-6, -9, -15, -20, -37, -46, -392) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF5A was prepared in our laboratory against human eIF5A expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and affinity-purified by standard procedures. Other antibodies (HA, Myc, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Syntenin, Bcl-2, Bax, p21, Mdm2) were obtained from Santa Cruz. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The bait plasmid was created by inserting a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment encoding the EFP sequence (1–99) of eIF5A into pGBKT7, resulting in an in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The resultant plasmid and a mammary cDNA library were simultaneously transformed into AH109 yeast strains according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Transformants were plated on synthetic medium without tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine, followed by β-galactosidase assays. The 1.75 million clones were screened, and then we restreaked candidate clones to allow loss of some of the AD/library plasmids and reintroduced them back to the same yeast strain to confirm the specific interaction between the candidate clones and the EFP bait. The negative and positive controls were purchased from Clontech Laboratories. GST Pull-down Assay—We used the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-eIF5A and GST-syntenin fusion proteins. For GST pull-down assays, fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The expression vector for eIF5A or syntenin was in vitro translated using the TnT Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). The 35S-labeled eIF5A or syntenin was then incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor tablets from Roche Diagnostics). The binding reaction was rocked for overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were subsequently washed four times with the washing buffer (the same as the binding buffer). The beads were boiled in 10 μl of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. RNA Interference Experiments—The siRNA sequence targets human eIF5A (from mRNA sequence, GenBank accession number BC030160). Computer analysis confirmed this sequence to be a good and specific target without homology to other human genes. The sense siRNA sequence was 5′-GATCCCCAGGTCCAT CTGGTTGGTATTTCAAGAGAATACCAACCAGATGGACCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′. The anti-sense siRNA sequence was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGGTCCATCTGGTTGGTATTCTCTTGAAATACCAACCAGA TGGACCTGGG-3′. The annealed products were constructed into the pSUPER vector (Oligo-engine), and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Transient transfections were performed by LipofectAMINE for the plasmids above, and the cells were harvested at different hours after transfection. Microscopy for FRET Assays—At 48 h after transfection, images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2,100 laser scanning confocal imaging system. All images were taken with an oil immersion objective and with appropriate filter sets (EGFP, excitation 488 nm, dichroic mirror 560 DCLPXR, emission HQ 515/30; RFP, excitation 543 nm, dichroic mirror 650 DCLPXR, emission HQ590/70; FRET, excitation 488 nm, dichroic mirror 650 DCLPXR, emission HQ590/70). The three-filter method was used to analyze protein interactions (15Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). GFP, RFP, and FRET images for different groups were taken with the identical settings. GFP and FRET images were acquired simultaneously, and RFP images were acquired separately at the same plane. Cells expressing moderate levels of GFP or RFP fluorescence were chosen, and high or low expressing cells were avoided. The FRET filter image contains the FRET signal, as well as the bleed-through of GFP and RFP into the FRET channel. GFP and FRET images of cells expressing GFP only and RFP and FRET images of cells expressing RFP only were also obtained to determine bleed-through corrections and background corrections. The GFP and RFP images of the samples were then multiplied with the respective correction factor and subtracted from the FRET image, and normalized FRET (NFRET) images were calculated according to Xia and Liu (15Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). All image calculations were carried out with the LaserPix software version 4.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and whole cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min to remove cell debris. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating whole cell extracts with the indicated antibody, preincubated with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), while rocking at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer, resuspended in 40 μlof1× SDS sample buffer, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Whole lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the primary antibody after blocking. Membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells by using TRIzol Reagent (15596-026, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (M1701, Promega) for semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR following the manufacturer's instructions. We performed PCR amplifications of 20 cycles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 30 cycles for a 420-bp fragment of p53, respectively. Primer sequences were 5′-CGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTC-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CTTCTTTGGCT GGGGAGAGGAG-3′ (3′-primer) for the p53 fragment (GenBank accession number X02469). Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry, cells were harvested and followed by a washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed in cold ethanol (70%) overnight and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml RNase for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Percentages of cells in the different phases of the cycle were measured by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei using CellQuest software FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Proportions of apoptotic cells were indicated as a percentage of the sub-G1 fraction in FACS analysis. Identification of Syntenin as eIF5A-binding Protein—The eIF5A protein comprises two well defined domains, EFP (N-terminal) and eif5a (C-terminal). In the attempt to identify eIF5A-binding proteins that could clarify the role of eIF5A in the cell, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the EFP domain of eIF5A as bait to screen an oligo(dT)-primed human mammary cDNA library. Eight positive clones of 1.75 × 106 yeast transformants were found. Among them, the inserts from three positive clones were identified to be syntenin. Full-length cDNA for syntenin was then obtained from a mammary library, encoding 298 amino acid residues and containing two PDZ domains in tandem. These two PDZ domains span amino acids 113–193 (PDZ1) and 198–273 (PDZ2), respectively. With different N-terminal and C-terminal deletions of eIF5A being created (Fig. 1A), the EFP domain was further determined to be essential for the interaction of eIF5A with syntenin in yeast cotransformed with syntenin (in pGADT7) and either eIF5A or its mutants (in pGBKT7) and scored for β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1A). To further define which domain of eIF5A was required for the interactions with syntenin, a GST pull-down experiment was performed in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1B, the full-length eIF5A and EFP domain were both specifically associated with syntenin, which is consistent with the results of yeast two-hybrid screens. In contrast, no association was found between other mutations of eIF5A and syntenin or between syntenin and GST protein (Fig. 1B). We also constructed different deletions of syntenin to define the region, which determines the binding behavior of syntenin with respect to eIF5A. Fig. 1C shows that the N-terminal sequence of syntenin was necessary for its interaction with eIF5A. To further verify the interaction in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitations by transient co-transfection experiments in 293T cells. A lysate of human 293T cells expressing Myc-eIF5A and HA-syntenin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, the human eIF5A was co-precipitated in a HA-syntenin-dependent manner. In contrast, no significant binding was detected in the co-precipitates from the control cells expressing either Myc-eIF5A and HA peptide, or Myc peptide and HA-syntenin (Fig. 1D). Similarly, we demonstrated the in vivo interaction of eIF5A with syntenin by immunoprecipitation of extracts from MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells with an antibody against eIF5A (Fig. 1E). This further confirmed the specificity of the investigated interaction. Taken together, these data demonstrated that syntenin and eIF5A could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo. To observe the physical association of eIF5A with syntenin in living cells, we employed the FRET microscopy to visualize it in vivo. The method was described by Xia and Liu (15Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) to perform a direct pixel-by-pixel analysis in living cells, and it could show FRET intensities with high spatial resolution. The three-filter method was applied in all FRET experiments, and GFP, DsRed (referred to as RFP below), and FRET filter images are used to calculate a NFRET. Fusion protein GR-6, in which GFP and RFP was linked by a 6-amino acid peptide, was prepared as a positive control (Fig. 2A), and co-transfection with GFP and RFP was used as a negative control (data not shown). As a result, we found the NFRET signals in COS-7 cells co-transfected with GFP-eIF5A and RFP-syntenin, indicating the interaction of eIF5A and syntenin in living cells (Fig. 2D). The same result was also observed using GFP-eIF5AK50A to substitute for GFP-eIF5A (Fig. 2E), suggesting the binding was not affected by hypusine modification. In contrast, in the cells co-transfected with GFP and RFP-syntenin, or GFP-eIF5A and RFP, no NFRET signals were found (Fig. 2, B and C). A New Biological Activity for eIF5A as the Regulator of p53—In our efforts to identify the functional significance for the interaction of eIF5A with syntenin, we unexpectedly found that p53 protein level was obviously enhanced in response to eIF5A transfection. As shown in Fig. 3, after transient transfection in COS-7 cells, almost 4-fold of myc-tagged eIF5A relative to the level of endogenous eIF5A was observed and led to an increase in p53 protein level, which was further shown both in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, neither an unrelated eukaryotic initiated factor family member (eIF4A) nor control vector pXJ40 had a similar effect on the levels of p53 expression (Fig. 3A). To further demonstrate the implication of endogenous eIF5A in p53 regulation, RNA interference was employed to specifically knockdown the eIF5A level. After the transfection with the siRNA specific for eIF5A, eIF5A expression was markedly decreased compared with the control, and the observed eIF5A knockdown led to a significant reduction in p53 expression (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the p53 protein level was not affected in the control transfected cells. These results indicated that suppression of the endogenous eIF5A expression through eIF5A siRNA could reduce p53 protein level. p53 functions as a transcription factor to regulate target genes involved in apoptosis. To determine the transcriptional activity of the eIF5A-induced p53 protein, the expression of p21, a well known target gene of p53, was examined. As shown in Fig. 3D, the expression level of p21 was increased in eIF5A-overexpressed cells. We next investigated whether the up-regulated p53 modulated the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Mdm2. Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, expression was low in control cells but was dramatically increased after eIF5A transfection (Fig. 3D). The kinetics of Bax expressions was similar to the expression of p53 (Fig. 3A). Mdm2 expression level also increased after eIF5A transfection (Fig. 3D). In contrast, Bcl-2 expression decreased (Fig. 3D). Thus, up-regulation of p53 induced expression of Bax and Mdm2 but decreased Bcl-2 expression. To define which domain of eIF5A is required for p53 up-regulation, we constructed two plasmids containing EFP and eif5a domain of eIF5A, respectively. The truncation sites are indicated in the predicted structure for the human eIF5A (Fig. 1A). After transfection, expression of the EFP domain of the eIF5A proteins, with the expected molecular sizes, was confirmed by Western blot using anti-eIF5A and showed to be necessary to regulate p53 expression (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the eif5a domain was not able to induce p53 expression (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, because the hypusine residue (residue 50) in the EFP domain is essential for eIF5A function, we then assessed whether the modification is essential to the eIF5A-induced up-regulation of p53. As shown in Fig. 4B, the eIF5A mutant, in which lysine 50 was replaced by alanine and hypusination was abolished, was revealed to be functionally defective in up-regulation of p53, whereas the expression level of the mutant form was almost similar to that of the tagged wild type eIF5A. These results, therefore, demonstrated that p53 up-regulation by eIF5A depends on the post-translational modification of eIF5A. The protein p53 activity is commonly regulated at the transcriptional level and/or through post-translational stabilization that blocks its ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (16Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar, 17Kim S.J. Hwang S.G. Shin D.Y. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanisms leading to the increase in p53 protein level, we tested both possibilities and found that mRNA transcript levels of p53, determined by reverse transcription PCR, were significantly increased in the cells overexpressing eIF5A (Fig. 5A). No significant change in the ubiquitinated p53 level was observed with Western blot approaches by anti-p53 antibodies (data not shown), but Mdm2 expression level increased after eIF5A transfection (Fig. 3D). As the phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites commonly leads to its stabilization, further analysis was conducted to determine the phosphorylated site(s) of p53 in response to eIF5A overexpression by Western blot analysis using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Fig. 5B shows phosphorylation at serine 6 and 392 significantly increased among the phosphorylation sites tested. Taken together, p53 up-regulation by eIF5A expression was mainly associated with transcriptional activation of the p53 gene. eIF5A Regulated p53-dependent Apoptosis—In our experiments, the eIF5A expression through transfection affected p53 expression and further promoted the transcription of Bax as well as p21, the most intuitive links between p53-mediated transactivation and apoptosis. To further determine the biological role of eIF5A, we examined its effect on apoptosis in a FACS assay. A pair of human lung carcinoma cells (H1299 (p53-/-) and H460 (p53+/+)) were transfected with the pXJ40 control vector or the pXJ40 vector encoding either eIF5A or eIF4A and cultured for 24 h. Then, FACS analysis was performed, which showed that eIF5A could induce apoptosis in H460 cells expressing wild type p53 but had no significant effect on p53-null H1299 cells (Fig. 6A), indicating that the induction of apoptosis by eIF5A is dependent on p53. The effect of eIF5A on the apoptosis of H460 cells was more observable after the cells were further treated with camptothecin (1 μm) for an additional 8 h at 24 h after the transfections. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, FACS analysis indicated that the effect of eIF5A on apoptosis was significantly enhanced in H460 cells treated with camptothecin (Fig. 6, B and C) but not in camptothecin-treated p53-null H1299 cells. Similar results were also obtained in the cells treated with etoposide and cisplatin (data not shown). These data indicated that the eIF5A-induced apoptosis was p53-dependent. Effect of eIF5A on p53 Was Affected by Syntenin—To further investigate the functional significance of the interaction of eIF5A with syntenin, we assessed whether the effect of eIF5A on p53 expression was affected by syntenin in COS-7 cells co-transfected with eIF5A and syntenin together. As shown in Fig. 7A (lane 3), our results found that the eIF5A-induced increase in p53 protein level was inhibited to almost 50% by syntenin co-transfected expression (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the eIF5A-led increase in p53 expression level was not affected by the co-transfection of either the pXJ40 control vector or the pXJ40-eIF4A expression vector (Fig. 7A, lanes 2 and 5). The effect of syntenin on p53 became more observable with the increasing doses of the pXJ40-eIF5A expression vector (Fig. 7B). To further investigate whether the antagonizing effect was via a direct physical association, we constructed a syntenin mutant (SYNmut) (Fig. 1C, PDZ1 + 2), in which the N-terminal domain (Δ1–101) was deleted, and the interaction with eIF5A was abolished (Fig. 1C). After co-transfection of the syntenin mutant and eIF5A together, our results indicated that the syntenin mutant no longer inhibited the eIF5A-led increase in p53 protein level (Fig. 7A, lane 7). Thus, these data showed that when eIF5A interacted with syntenin, the eIF5A-induced increase in the p53 protein level was significantly inhibited. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that eIF5A and syntenin could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo, and functioned collaboratively to regulate p53 activity. The eIF5A signaling to p53 required both the EFP domain of eIF5A and hypusine formation through modifications but was interfered with by its negative regulator syntenin. To date, although a large number of cellular genes transcriptionally regulated by p53 have been described, limited genes are known to regulate p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis (17Kim S.J. Hwang S.G. Shin D.Y. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the interaction of eIF5A with syntenin will generate new insights into the mechanisms by which p53 activity is tightly regulated in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings revealed a new biological activity for eIF5A as the regulator of p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis. Recently, higher eIF5A protein expression was found in tumors with p53 accumulation and poor differentiation (18Chen G. Gharib T.G. Thomas D.G. Huang C.C. Misek D.E. Kuick R.D. Giordano T.J. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S.M. Beer D.G. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the correlation between them is unclear. In the present study, both eIF5A expression through transfection and eIF5A silencing through RNA interference significantly altered the p53 protein level, suggesting that the regulation of eIF5A activity is an upstream event to p53 activation. The eIF5A protein was also reported to have significantly increased in the v-HA-Ras oncogene-transformed mouse NIH3T3 cells, implying that the regulation of eIF5A activity is a downstream event controlled by the Ras-mitogen-activated protein signal transduction pathway (12Chen Z.P. Chen K.Y. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, the eIF5A protein expression was markedly elevated in lung adenocarcinomas containing K-Ras mutation, compared with wild type K-Ras tumors (18Chen G. Gharib T.G. Thomas D.G. Huang C.C. Misek D.E. Kuick R.D. Giordano T.J. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S.M. Beer D.G. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that eIF5A mediates the effect of Ras mutation on p53 activation. Further investigations are being done to confirm the eIF5A involvement in the p53 pathway. Syntenin contains two closely located PDZ domains that share some (ephrinB1, EphA7) interacting proteins with PICK1 and GRIP. The PDZ domains of syntenin can recognize type I (neurofascin, ProTGFα), type II (syndecans, ephrin-B2, and EphA7), and nonconserved PDZ binding motifs (Schwannomin-FEEL) (19Hirbec H. Perestenko O.

For the majority of the known partners of syntenin, PDZ domains are usually the sites for their interaction. However, some soluble partners, for example sox4 transcriptional factor, bind directly to the NH2 termini of syntenin, not to PDZ domains (24Geijsen N. Uings I.J. Pals C. Armstrong J. McKinnon M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1136-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which is similar to our results (Fig. 2B). The interaction of eIF5A with syntenin was mapped to the EFP domain of eIF5A. Although hypusine formation in the EFP domain is essential for eIF5A function in p53 regulation, our data showed it was not essential for the interaction of eIF5A with syntenin. The regulation of p53 function is complicated. The known mechanisms for regulation include an increased rate of transcription and translation and a post-translational stabilization of the protein (17Kim S.J. Hwang S.G. Shin D.Y. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in p53 protein level could also possibly occur through stabilization and accumulation of p53 via down-regulation of Mdm2 expression (25Wang X. Michael D. de Murcia G. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15697-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, p53 activation by eIF5A in our results was accompanied with the increase in Mdm2 expression (Fig. 3D). This was possibly because of the negative-feedback loop in which p53 activation induced Mdm2 expression (26Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 27Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar, 28Lev Bar-OrR.

A. 2000; 97: 11250-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), but phosphorylation of p53 at various sites could prevent p53 to interact with the up-regulated Mdm2 (Fig. 5B) (29Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E152-E153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar). The Mdm2 up-regulation in p53 activation was also found in Ras signaling, inducing Mdm2 in a p53-dependent manner, thereby blunting p53 activation in response to different stress (31Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 32Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). One perplexing aspect of eIF5A protein is that it can promote both cell survival and cell death. In yeast expression, eIF5A has been reported to correlate with cell proliferation (7Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, eIF5A expression was induced in activated human T lymphocytes (10Bevec D. Klier H. Holter W. Tschachler E. Valent P. Lottspeich F. Baumruker T. Hauber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10829-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This paradox could be reconciled by viewing the mechanisms of eIF5A not as isolated circuits, but as part of a coordinated process, which targets key nodes of cell signal networks for cell growth or apoptosis. Moreover, the seemingly contradictory biological outcomes can also be found in Ras (a regulator of eIF5A activity), mediating both life and death decisions by distinct effector pathways (33Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). As the downstream target of eIF5A, p53 is also implicated in diversified functions, such as cell growth, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or cellular senescence, in addition to apoptosis (31Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). For example, higher eIF5A protein expression was present in tumors with p53 accumulation but showing poor differentiation (18Chen G. Gharib T.G. Thomas D.G. Huang C.C. Misek D.E. Kuick R.D. Giordano T.J. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S.M. Beer D.G. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Certain levels of p53 expression in human mammary epithelial cells may resist cells to extracellular matrix-induced apoptosis (34Seewaldt V.L. Mrozek K. Sigle R. Dietze E.C. Heine K. Hockenbery D.M. Hobbs K.B. Caldwell L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 protein in human mammary epithelial cells is detected frequently in women at high risk for the development of breast cancer (35Rohan T.E. Hartwick W. Miller A.B. Kandel R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). How this seemingly discordant choice of cell death versus survival for eIF5A protein is achieved is not known. However, clarifying these complexities represents a challenge and offers hope for a more selective intervention of the p53 apoptotic program. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated a new biological activity for eIF5A as the regulator of p53 and that eIF5A and syntenin could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that eIF5A functioned collaboratively to regulate p53 activity. These findings generated new insights into the mechanisms by which p53 is tightly regulated in apoptosis and generated a better understanding for the new function of eIF5A. The interaction of eIF5A with syntenin could possibly unravel novel pathways for p53 control and permit the p53 network to be manipulated in a more selective and sensitive manner. Moreover, the ability of eIF5A to sensitize cells to agents of chemotherapy can also be exploited for therapeutic purposes or may be suggested for rational strategies to improve therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1995583091,"Female multiple mating and alternative mating systems can decrease the opportunity for sexual selection1,2,3. Sperm competition is often the outcome of females mating with multiple males and has been observed in many animals1,4,5,6,7, and alternative reproductive systems are widespread among species with external fertilization and parental care3,8,9,10. Multiple paternity without associated complex behaviour related to mating or parental care is also seen in simultaneously spawning amphibians11,12,13,14,15 and fishes16 that release gametes into water. Here we report ‘clutch piracy’ in a montane population of the common frog Rana temporaria, a reproductive behaviour previously unknown in vertebrates with external fertilization. Males of this species clasp the females and the pair deposits one spherical clutch of eggs. No parental care is provided. ‘Pirate’ males search for freshly laid clutches, clasp them as they would do a female and fertilize the eggs that were left unfertilized by the ‘parental’ male. This behaviour does not seem to be size-dependent, and some males mate with a female and perform clutch piracy in the same season. Piracy affected 84% of the clutches and in some cases increased the proportion of eggs fertilized, providing direct fitness benefits both for the pirate males and the females17. Sexual selection—probably caused by a strong male-biased sex ratio—occurs in this population, as indicated by size-assortative mating; however, clutch piracy may reduce its impact. This provides a good model to explore how alternative mating strategies can affect the intensity of sexual selection."

Host defense often culminates in a form of host programmed cell death termed the hypersensitive response, which may delay or restrict the spread of the pathogen beyond the initial point of infection (6Greenberg J.T. Yao N. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Although many R genes and their corresponding avirulence genes have been cloned and characterized, less is known about the signal transduction components that link the perception of a pathogen with downstream responses. In some cases, the signaling proteins are pathway specific, functioning in concert with particular R proteins, whereas others appear to be shared by many R gene pathways. Among the defense-related signaling pathways that appear to be conserved are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. All eukaryotes utilize MAPK cascades, which are composed of three sequentially acting protein kinases: a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPK to transduce intracellular signals (7Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). In the Arabidopsis thaliana genome there are predicted to be 20 genes for MAPKs, 10 MAPKKs, and more than 60 MAPKKKs (8Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). To date, functional data are available for relatively few of the corresponding proteins, and their participation in different pathways remains largely unknown. Perhaps the most extensively characterized plant MAPKs are the tobacco proteins SIPK and WIPK. SIPK, initially identified as a salicylic acid-induced protein kinase, is activated rapidly in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses including osmotic and salt stress, wounding, and treatment with non-race-specific elicitors from fungi and bacteria (9Hoyos M.E. Zhang S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Mikolajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszynska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7225-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Klessig D.F. Nurnberger T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). SIPK has also been shown to be activated downstream of gene for gene interactions between resistant tobacco plants (NN) challenged with Tobacco mosaic virus and upon Avr9 treatment of Cf9 transgenic tobacco (14Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of SIPK activation in response to abiotic stresses is transient, whereas biotic elicitors that induce cell death result in prolonged activation (11Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7225-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Zhang S. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional gain-of-function studies have shown that SIPK overexpression is sufficient to induce both defense gene expression and cell death (17Liu Y. Jin J. Yang K.-Y. Kim C.Y. Baker B. Zhang S. Plant J. 2003; 34: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that SIPK may be a convergence point for many different stimuli and that the duration of its activation may play a role in the types of downstream processes it mediates. SIPK activation is often accompanied by the activation of WIPK, which was originally identified as a wound-induced protein kinase (18Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition to its association with wounding, WIPK appears to also play a role in defense signaling. Although many of the same stimuli activate SIPK and WIPK, they differ in several regards. WIPK activation is typically slower than SIPK activation (17Liu Y. Jin J. Yang K.-Y. Kim C.Y. Baker B. Zhang S. Plant J. 2003; 34: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This may be due, in part, to the fact that WIPK is regulated at the transcription level; WIPK mRNA levels accumulate in response to various stresses, most notably wounding (18Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Also, unlike SIPK, WIPK overexpression is not sufficient to elicit cell death, which likely indicates that although these two MAPKs are typically active at the same time, they influence different downstream processes (19Zhang S. Liu Y. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1877-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The dual activation of SIPK and WIPK by the same stimuli is not surprising in light of the discovery that they are both activated by the same upstream MAPKK, NtMEK2 (20Yang K.Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active form of NtMEK2 induces cell death, which is preceded by the activation of SIPK and WIPK and the induction of genes associated with defense responses (20Yang K.Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). More recently, NtMEK2 has been shown to activate Ntf4, a MAPK that is closely related to SIPK (21Voronin V. Aionesei T. Limmongkon A. Barinova I. Touraev A. Lauriere C. Coronado M.J. Testillano P.S. Risueno M.C. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, expression of constitutively active forms of two putative orthologs of NtMEK2, AtMKK4 and AtMKK5, induces cell death (22Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 559-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). AtMKK4 and AtMKK5 have also been shown to activate the Arabidopsis SIPK and WIPK orthologs AtMPK6 and AtMPK3, respectively (22Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 559-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Based on phylogenetic analysis, genes encoding putative orthologs of SIPK, Ntf4, and WIPK have been cloned recently from tomato (23Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The tomato proteins LeMPK1 and LeMPK2 are highly similar to SIPK and Ntf4, respectively, and LeMPK3 is highly similar to WIPK. At the amino acid level, LeMPK1 and LeMPK2 are share 95% identity with most of the differences occurring at the N terminus outside of their identical conserved kinase domains. Using specific antibodies raised against peptides representing their divergent N termini, Holley et al. (23Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) showed that both LeMPK1 and LeMPK2 are activated in Lycopersicon peruvianum suspension cells treated with systemin, oligosaccharide elicitors, and ultraviolet-B radiation. These observations suggest that LeMPK1 and LeMPK2 may be redundant or have overlapping functions. In tobacco, separate functions for SIPK and Ntf4 can be inferred from the temporal and tissue-specific expression of Ntf4 (24Voronin V. Touraev A. Kieft H. van Lammeren A.A. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). LeMPK3 was also shown to be activated by ultraviolet-B radiation and has been shown to be regulated at the transcript level similar to WIPK (25Mayrose M. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14819-14827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a model system to investigate active defense responses in plants, we study the interaction between tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) (26Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As part of the infection process, the bacterium translocates effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell via a type III secretion system. In resistant plants, two of these effectors, AvrPto and AvrPtoB, are detected by a Ser/Thr protein kinase encoded by the R gene Pto (27Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 28Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1996; 274: 2063-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 29Kim Y.J. Lin N.C. Martin G.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This recognition event activates a variety of defense responses including the hypersensitive response. The Pto-mediated defense response requires another protein, Prf, that contains a nucleotide-binding site and a region of leucine-rich repeats (30Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E. Rommens C.M. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Prf likely functions with Pto during the recognition event, but its role is unknown. Several substrates of Pto have been identified including a Ser/Thr protein kinase, Pti1 (31Zhou J.-M. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and an ERF-like transcription factor, Pti4 (32Gu Y.-Q. Yang C. Thara V.K. Zhou J. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recently, in a study using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), an additional nine genes that contribute to Pto-mediated resistance were identified. Among these, two encode MAPKKs (putative orthologs of NtMEK1 and NtMEK2) and two encode MAPKs (putative orthologs of SIPK and WIPK) (33Ekengren S.K. Liu Y. Schiff M. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Martin G.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In a separate VIGS screen, we recently identified a MAPKKK, LeMAPKKKα, that plays a dual role as a regulator of cell death in both Pto-related plant immunity and disease (34del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Overexpression of LeMAPKKKα induces cell death and thus enabled us to delineate two downstream MAPK cascades using a combination of overexpression analysis and VIGS (34del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Based on these experiments the putative tomato orthologs of NtMEK2 and SIPK were found to constitute a MAPK cascade acting directly downstream of LeMAPKKKα. Together, these gain- and loss-of-function studies established that MAPKs play a role downstream of Pto in the defense response (33Ekengren S.K. Liu Y. Schiff M. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Martin G.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 34del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of MAPKs in Pto-mediated resistance, we now provide biochemical evidence that LeMPK2 and LeMPK3 are activated in vivo in response to AvrPto and AvrPtoB and in tomato leaves overexpressing LeMAPKKKα. We identify two phylogenetically unrelated MAPKKs, LeMKK2 and LeMKK4 that when overexpressed elicit cell death and activate LeMPK2 and LeMPK3. Additionally, using LeMPK1, LeMPK2, and LeMPK3 as substrates for phosphorylation assays, we demonstrate that LeMKK2 and LeMKK4 have overlapping substrate specificity. Cloning of MAPKs and MAPKKs—Two expressed sequence tag clones, cLEF46J19 and cTOB17A11, were sequenced and found to contain complete open reading frames of LeMPK2 and LeMPK3, respectively. LeMPK1 was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers designed from the published sequence (23Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The tomato MAPKK genes (LeMKK1, LeMKK2, LeMKK3, and LeMKK4) were obtained as expressed sequence tag clones (cLEX6B23, cLER2B17, cTOE9P24, and cTOF13F16, respectively) that contained complete open reading frames. Kinase inactive mutants (LeMPK1K92R, LeMPK2K90R, LeMPK3K70R, LeMKK1K99R, LeMKK2K99R, LeMKK3K98R, and LeMKK4K95R) that contain an Arg in place of the catalytic Lys were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The tomato MAPKK genes and their inactive derivatives were cloned into pER8 (35Zuo J. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was modified to produce proteins containing an N-terminal double hemagglutinin(HA) epitope. To generate maltose binding protein (MBP)-LeMPK fusion proteins, BamHI and XhoI sites were added to LeMPK1K92R, LeMPK2K90R, and LeMPK3K70R via PCR to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, for cloning into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Protein expression and purification with amylose resin were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Transient Gene Expression in Tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana— Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV2260 strains carrying the vector pER8 (35Zuo J. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the gene of interest were grown and prepared for infiltration (A600 = 0.03) following a similar procedure as described in He et al. (36He X. Anderson J.C. Pozo Od O. Gu Y.Q. Tang X. Martin G.B. Plant J. 2004; 38: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For whole-leaf assays, leaves were sprayed with 5 μm estradiol-17β 48 h post inoculation. For kinase assays and protein expression, 1-cm leaf disks were removed from infiltrated leaves, floated on 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 2 h, and treated with estradiol (final concentration = 5 μm). At designated time points, leaf disks were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein Extraction, In-gel Kinase Assay, and Immnoblot Analysis— Proteins were extracted by grinding leaf tissue in extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na3VO4,10mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% plant protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with a micropestle. The mixture was then spun for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was removed and stored at -80 °C. The concentration of protein extracts was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. In-gel kinase assay and immunoblot were performed as previously described (34del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—The immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described previously (23Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, extracts containing 0.2 mg of total protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-LeMPK1, -2, or -3 antisera (1:100 dilution) on a rocking platform shaker in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% plant protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Approximately 20 μl of packed volume of recombinant protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 1.5 h at 4 °C. The complexes were precipitated by a brief centrifugation and washed two times with immunoprecipitation buffer, one time with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and three times with kinase reaction buffer (without myelin basic protein and ATP). Kinase reactions were performed for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg ml-1 myelin basic protein, and 25 μm ATP) containing 0.1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis on a 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, gels were washed three times for 0.5 h in 20% (w/v) isopropanol and dried. The radiolabled myelin basic protein substrate was visualized by a phosphoimaging system or were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro phosphorylation experiments were performed using HA-epitope tagged LeMKKs and kinase-inactive MBP-LeMPK fusion proteins as substrates. For purification of LeMKKs, 0.1 mg of total protein extracted from N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing the four LeMKKs were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation buffer with 100 μl of packed volume anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) on a rocking platform shaker. The beads were collected by a brief centrifugation and were washed one time with immunoprecipitation buffer, one time with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and two times with kinase reaction buffer (without myelin basic protein and ATP). The purified LeMKKs were divided equally into four aliquots and combined with ∼25 μl of amylose resin, saturated with the substrate MBP-LeMPK recombinant proteins. Kinase reactions were performed for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 1.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, gels were dried, and radiolabled MBP-LeMPK fusion proteins were visualized by exposure to Kodak Biomax MR film. Phylogenetic Analysis—The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was created by the ClustalW method (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar) (MegaAlign program, DNAStar, Madison, WI). The human MAPKK protein HsMEK1 (Q02750) was used as an out group to root the tree. Previous VIGS experiments indicated that MAPKs play an important role in the Pto-mediated defense response against avirulent Pst strains. Therefore we investigated whether MAPKs are activated specifically in response to bacterial effector proteins AvrPto and AvrPtoB in Pto-expressing tomato leaves (Rio Grande-PtoR, hereafter RG-PtoR). To synchronize expression of the effector genes in tomato leaves and to study early changes in MAPK activation following detection of these proteins, we used an estradiol-inducible expression system developed for use in plant cells (35Zuo J. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leaves that were transiently transformed with Agrobacterium containing either AvrPto or AvrPtoB under the control of the inducible promoter were treated with estradiol and monitored for cell death. Only areas that had been transformed with AvrPto or AvrPtoB resulted in cell death following the application of estradiol (Fig. 1A). Expression of AvrPto and AvrPtoB appeared to be tightly regulated because no cell death was detected in transformed tissue that was not treated with estradiol (data not shown). To investigate whether expression of AvrPto or AvrPtoB induced kinase activity in Pto-expressing tomato leaf cells, we used an in-gel kinase assay with myelin basic protein serving as an artificial substrate to detect MAPK activity. To avoid problems associated with wounding that could potentially result from excision of the tissue after treatment with estradiol, 1-cm leaf disks from portions of the leaf that had been transformed with Agrobacterium were removed and floated on buffer for 2 h prior to treatment with estradiol. A time-course analysis demonstrated that expression of either AvrPto or AvrPtoB resulted in an increase of MAPK activity within 1 h after treatment of the leaf disks with estradiol (Fig. 1B). This activity returned to levels comparable with the control tissue by 3 h after induction. To determine whether the MAPK activity detected could be attributed to Pto- or Prf-mediated host defenses activated in response to AvrPto and AvrPtoB we used two additional tomato lines, RG-prf3 and RG-PtoS. The former is isogenic to RG-PtoR and contains a 1-kb deletion in the Prf gene rendering it non-functional (30Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E. Rommens C.M. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas the latter is nearly isogenic to RG-PtoR and carries the Pto haplotype from Lycopersicon esculentum that lacks Pto but contains several closely related genes of the Pto family (26Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). No increase in MAPK activity could be detected in RG-prf3 tissue in response to expression of AvrPto or AvrPtoB (Fig. 2). In RG-PtoS tissue, a slight increase in MAPK activity was detected in response to AvrPto. This may be attributable to the reported weak recognition of AvrPto by one of the other Pto family members that produces a weak hypersensitive response following infiltration with Agrobacterium expressing AvrPto (38Chang J.H. Rathjen J.P. Bernal A.J. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There was no increase in MAPK activity in RG-PtoS plants following the expression of AvrPtoB. Thus, the MAPK activity we detected is dependent on Pto and Prf and correlates with the phenotypes observed when plants are treated with avirulent Pst. As discussed in the introduction, Holley et al. (23Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) developed antibodies for the specific detection of LeMPK1 (similar to Ntf4), LeMPK2 (similar to SIPK), and LeMPK3 (similar to WIPK). We obtained antisera for LeMPK2 and LeMPK3 and used them in a series of immunocomplex kinase assays to determine whether either of these MAPKs are activated in RG-PtoR tissue expressing either AvrPto or AvrPtoB. Both LeMPK2 and LeMPK3 were activated in response to AvrPto and AvrPtoB, whereas a much lower background activity was detected in the empty vector control (Fig. 3). To identify MAPKKs that might act upstream of LeMPK2 and LeMPK3 in the Pto-mediated defense response, we searched the TIGR tomato gene index using the NtMEK2 amino acid sequence and found expressed sequence tags encoding four distinct MAPKKs. An expressed sequence tag encoding a full-length version of each MAPKK was identified and used for further analysis. We used the DNASTAR analysis software to cluster the tomato MAPKKs with related kinases from tobacco, Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and alfalfa (Fig. 4A). The tomato MAPKKs clustered into four of the five known MAPKK groups defined by Ichimura et al. (8Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). cLER2B17, which encodes a MAPKK we refer to as LeMKK2, belongs to group C. This group contains tobacco NtMEK2, which has been demonstrated to activate both SIPK and WIPK (20Yang K.Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis AtMKK4 and AtMKK5, which act upstream of both AtMPK6 and AtMPK3 (Fig. 4A, Ichimura et al. (8Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar)). Expression of constitutive-active forms of NtMEK2, AtMKK4, or AtMKK5 in leaves causes hypersensitive response-like cell death and activates their downstream MAPKs indicating a role in defense (20Yang K.Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 22Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol.

Synapse-associated kinases are uniquely positioned to promote enduring consolidation of structural and functional modifications at the synapse, provided that kinase mRNA is available on site for local input-specific translation. We now report that the mRNA encoding PKMζ is rapidly transported and specifically localized to synaptodendritic neuronal domains. Transport of PKMζ mRNA is specified by two cis-acting dendritic targeting elements (Mζ DTEs). Mζ DTE1, located at the interface of the 5′-untranslated region and the open reading frame, directs somato-dendritic export of the mRNA. Mζ DTE2, in contrast, is located in the 3′-untranslated region and is required for delivery of the mRNA to distal dendritic segments. Colocalization with translational repressor BC1 RNA in hippocampal dendrites suggests that PKMζ mRNA may be subject to translational control in local domains. Dendritic localization of PKMζ mRNA provides a molecular basis for the functional integration of synaptic signal transduction and translational control pathways.

Synapses, the local sites of communication between neurons, are elemental modules of information processing in the nervous system. Subject to activity- and experience-dependent modification, synaptic connections are also sites of plastic modulation of interneuronal communication. It is thought that various forms of such modulation, collectively called synaptic plasticity, are determinants of information storage at the synapse that underlie neural development and higher brain functions, including learning and memory. Numerous mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to serve as molecular substrata of plastic events at the synapse, prominent among them phosphorylation signaling pathways and protein synthetic pathways.De novo synthesis of proteins is required for the long term modulation of synaptic strength. Characterized by highly mosaic and dynamic protein repertoires, synaptodendritic microdomains have in recent years been recognized to generate and maintain at least part of such dynamic diversity by local synthesis on site (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kindler S.

Prerequisite for such a mechanism is the targeted transport of relevant mRNAs to subsynaptic sites of translational competence.Long lasting synaptic plasticity is thus likely to require dendritic RNA transport, localization, and translation. In contrast, post-translational modification of existing synaptic proteins is presumably responsible for initial changes in synaptic strength. Diverse phosphorylation signaling pathways have been suggested to contribute functionally to the plastic modification of synaptic connections. Specifically, various types of protein kinases have been implicated in long term potentiation (LTP), 1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; PKM, protein kinase M; PKC, protein kinase C; DTE, dendritic targeting element; UTR, untranslated region; CaMK, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase; MAP, microtubule-associate protein; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; PKM, protein kinase M; PKC, protein kinase C; DTE, dendritic targeting element; UTR, untranslated region; CaMK, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase; MAP, microtubule-associate protein; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide(s). an experimental model of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Such kinases include members of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) family, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase family, the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, and the protein kinase C (PKC) family (reviewed in Ref. 7Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar).Recently, the autonomously active isoform of atypical protein kinase Cζ, called protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), has been reported to be required for the maintenance of LTP (8Ling D.S. Benardo L.S. Serrano P.A. Blace N. Kelly M.T. Crary J.F. Sacktor T.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It was further shown that induction of a mouse PKMζ transgene in Drosophila enhanced memory in olfactory learning paradigms (9Drier E.A. Tello M.K. Cowan M. Wu P. Blace N. Sacktor T.C. Yin J.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role for PKMζ-mediated signal transduction in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and behavioral memory (10Paulsen O. Morris R.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PKMζ is autonomously active because it is the independent catalytic domain of PKCζ and is not autoinhibited by the pseudosubstrate of the regulatory domain of PKCζ. However, PKMζ is not a proteolytic fragment of PKCζ, as we originally hypothesized (11Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), but is instead synthesized directly from a brain-specific PKMζ mRNA (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M.

Formation of PKMζ during LTP maintenance has been shown to require increased de novo protein synthesis (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M. Libien J.M. Weinstein G.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combined observations therefore prompt a scenario in which PKMζ mRNA is locally available at synapses for site-specific translation. However, such local availability and its fundamental prerequisite, the targeted delivery of PKMζ mRNA to synaptodendritic sites, has hitherto not been documented.Here we present a functional dissection of the dendritic targeting competence of PKMζ mRNA. We report that PKMζ mRNA is specifically delivered to distal dendritic domains. We demonstrate that such transport is specified by two dendritic targeting elements that are contained within the RNA. In hippocampal dendrites, PKMζ mRNA was found colocalized with the translational modulator BC1 RNA. We propose that dendritic delivery of PKMζ mRNA to translationally competent synaptic sites enables the phosphorylation signaling pathway and the local protein synthetic pathway to synergize in the implementation of long term synaptic plasticity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared as described by Goslin et al. (14Goslin K. Banker G. Asmussen H. Banker K. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). The cells were dissociated from embryonic day 18 rat hippocampi and were plated onto polylysine-treated glass coverslips. Primary cultures of sympathetic neurons were generated as described (15Higgins D. Lein P.J. Osterhout D.J. Johnson M.I. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 177-205Google Scholar, 16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superior cervical ganglia from embryonic day 20–21 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were dissociated, and the cells were plated on polylysine-treated glass coverslips. Basement membrane extract (Matrigel; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was used at 100 μg/ml to induce dendritic growth. The neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (made from paraformaldehyde) and 4% sucrose in 140 mm NaCl, 15 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature for 20 min. The coverslips with fixed cells were stored in 70% ethanol at -20 °C until further processing (17Muslimov I.A. Banker G. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).RNA Preparation—The following transcripts were generated for microinjection experiments: (1) PKMζ mRNA Segment 1 (1935 nt) from plasmid pPKMζ-(48–1982) (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M. Libien J.M. Weinstein G. Tcherapanov A. Sacktor T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40305-40316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), representing PKMζ mRNA nt 48–1982, inserted between HindIII and XbaI in pBlueScript SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), linearized with XbaI; (2) PKMζ mRNA Segment 2 (1851 nt) from plasmid pPKMζ-(48–1982), linearized with NsiI; (3) PKMζ mRNA Segment 3 (859 nt) from plasmid pPKMζ-(48–1982), linearized with SacI; and (4Richter D. Cell Polarity and Subcellular RNA Localization. Springer, Berlin2001Google Scholar) PKMζ mRNA Segment 4 (300 nt) from plasmid pPKMζ-(48–1982), linearized with PstI. Analogously, PKMζ mRNA Segment 5 (1635 nt) represents PKMζ mRNA nt 348–1982, and PKMζ mRNA Segment 6 (1136 nt) represents PKMζ mRNA nt 847–1982. Segments 5 and 6 were transcribed from pPKMζΔ1–347 and pPKMζΔ1–846, respectively. These plasmids, derived from pPKMζ-(48–1982), were linearized with XbaI. Finally, pPKMζΔ1905–1946 (linearized with XbaI) was used to generate PKMζΔ1905–1946 mRNA (1893 nt), containing a 42-nt deletion mutation. This mRNA is in the following referred to as PKMζ mRNA Segment Δ.Other RNAs, injected for reference, included full-length BC1 RNA (used as a reference RNA that is transported along the entire dendritic length). They further included 3′ BC1 RNA, U4 RNA, and irrelevant polylinker-derived RNAs, all of which were used as reference RNAs that remain restricted to the soma. Intracellular localization of these reference RNAs, and the respective transcription vectors to generate them, have been described by Muslimov et al. (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All RNAs were prepared from linearized plasmids, using SP6, T3, or T7 RNA polymerase, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega, Madison, WI). Following transcription in the presence of 35S-UTP, excess unlabeled UTP was added to the reaction mixture to ensure that labeled transcripts were full-length. The integrity of all transcripts was monitored as described (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).For in situ hybridization, probes were prepared as follows. A probe specific for PKMζ mRNA was generated from plasmid pPKM180, corresponding to 180 nt of the 5′-most region of PKMζ mRNA (18Powell C.M. Johnston D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27958-27963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cloned into pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene). This probe does not recognize PKCζ mRNA or other atypical PKC/M mRNAs (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M. Libien J.M. Weinstein G. Tcherapanov A. Sacktor T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40305-40316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, the plasmid was linearized with ApaI for “antisense” and with SacI for “sense” strand probe transcription. BC1 RNA probes were generated from plasmid pMK1 (19Tiedge H. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Weinstock P.H. Arancio O. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) mRNA probes were generated from plasmid pNSEISH. A full-length NSE cDNA clone, obtained from Dr. Forss-Petter (20Forss-Petter S. Danielson P. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1986; 16: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was digested with the BglII to generate a 1.2-kb fragment containing most of the ORF. This fragment was blunt ended and ligated into pBluescript KSII(+) to yield pNSEISH. The plasmid was linearized with XhoI for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase to generate sense strand probes and with SmaI for in vitro transcription with T3 RNA polymerase to generate antisense strand probes.In Situ Hybridization—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) were used. The animals were perfusion-fixed with 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde) in phosphate-buffered saline, the brains were sectioned at 10 μm, and the specimens were post-fixed by UV illumination (21Tiedge H. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Prehybridization, hybridization, and subsequent processing steps were performed with brain sections and cultured neurons as described previously (17Muslimov I.A. Banker G. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Tiedge H. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Weinstock P.H. Arancio O. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

High stringency washes were performed at 50 °C (hybridization to BC1 RNA) or 45 °C (hybridization to PKMζ and NSE mRNAs).RNA Microinjection—RNA microinjection was performed as described in Muslimov et al. (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fine tipped microinjection needles were used to pressure inject neurons with RNA. Injected RNAs were 35Sradiolabeled at 3 × 106 cpm/μl. RNA was microinjected at volumes of several femtoliters/pulse. Lucifer yellow (0.4%) was coinjected for calibration purposes. The neurons were incubated for 4 h at 35 °C (unless stated otherwise) prior to fixation and emulsion autoradiography. For PKMζ mRNA, the number of dendrites analyzed was as follows: Segment 1, 18 dendrites; Segment 2, 12 dendrites; Segment 3, 24 dendrites; Segment 4, 15 dendrites; Segment 5, 15 dendrites; Segment 6, 16 dendrites; and Segment Δ, 15 dendrites.Data Evaluation—Emulsion autoradiography was performed as described (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tiedge H. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The specimens were analyzed and photographed on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope using dark field and phase contrast optics. Digital images were acquired using a Sony 3CCD DKC-5000 camera or a Photometrics CoolSnapHQ camera.Dendritic distribution profiles were established by measuring silver grain densities along dendrites. A dendritic labeling signal was considered significant if it exceeded background levels by a factor of at least three (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Background was determined in areas of equal size in “sense” strand controls. Dendrites were identified by morphology as described (22Tiedge H. Brosius J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7171-7181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze transport competence of microinjected RNAs, silver grain densities were established along dendritic extents of sympathetic neurons in 40-μm intervals. MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA) and KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) were used for quantitative analysis. NIH BLAST software was used for sequence comparisons (23Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Lash A.E. Leipe D.D. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Rapp B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and Mfold software was used for RNA secondary structure predictions (24Zuker M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).RESULTSPKMζ mRNA Is Localized to Somatodendritic Domains in Cultured Neurons—PKMζ is translated in brain from a unique mRNA that encodes the catalytic but not the regulatory domain of PKCζ (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M. Libien J.M. Weinstein G. Tcherapanov A. Sacktor T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40305-40316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This PKMζ-encoding mRNA is transcribed from an alternative internal promoter within a single PKCζ gene (12Hernandez A.I. Blace N. Crary J.F. Serrano P.A. Leitges M. Libien J.M. Weinstein G.

DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To establish whether PKMζ mRNA is localized to dendrites, we first performed in situ hybridization with hippocampal neurons in primary culture, using a PKMζ-specific probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 shows that substantial signal intensities, indicating the presence of PKMζ mRNA, were observed in both somata and dendrites of hippocampal neurons. No significant signal was detectable along axonal processes. In dendrites, the signal was typically of heterogeneous and clustered appearance, the latter often evidenced at branch points or at points of intersection with other processes. Such localization may be interpreted to indicate that PKMζ mRNA is enriched at synaptic sites.Analogous results were obtained with sympathetic neurons in culture (Fig. 2). Again, the labeling signal for PKMζ mRNA was discontinuously distributed along dendritic arborizations. Similar to hippocampal neurons in culture, PKMζ mRNA signal in dendrites was observed along the full dendritic length, including the distal-most dendritic segments. Axonal processes were devoid of specific labeling. On average, signal intensities for PKMζ mRNA were about 10 times lower in sympathetic neurons in culture than in hippocampal neurons in culture (a fact that was compensated for in Fig. 2 by correspondingly longer autoradiographic exposure times). In summary, the results show 1) that PKMζ mRNA is present in significant amounts in somatodendritic domains in neurons, 2) that it is localized in clustered fashion throughout proximal and distal segments of dendritic arborizations, and 3) that somatodendritic expression levels are cell type-dependent.Fig. 2Dendritic localization of PKMζ mRNA in sympathetic neurons in primary culture. Labeling signal is evident throughout the dendritic extent. Overall signal levels are about 10 times lower than in hippocampal neurons, partially compensated for by longer exposure times. The signal is robust and clustered in dendrites but is absent from axonal processes. C is a sense strand control. A–C, dark field photomicrographs. D–F, corresponding phase contrast photomicrographs.

PKMζ mRNA was found heterogeneously distributed in adult rat brain (Fig. 3). Neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamic nuclei were among the brain areas that displayed the most robust PKMζ mRNA expression levels. To establish degrees of dendritic localization, we compared the expression pattern of PKMζ mRNA in hippocampus with that of BC1 RNA, a nontranslatable bona fide dendritic RNA (19Tiedge H.

In addition, NSE mRNA was chosen as a representative of somatically restricted neuronal RNAs (28Landry C.F. Watson J.B. Kashima T. Campagnoni A.T. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Expression of PKMζ mRNA, BC1 RNA, and NSE mRNA in forebrain. PKMζ mRNA (A) and BC1 RNA (B), but not NSE mRNA (C), extend into dendritic layers of CA3-CA1. Note that PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA, but not NSE mRNA, are low or absent in dentate gyrus granule cells. Conversely, PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA, but not NSE mRNA, are detectable at substantial levels in the hilus. Coexpression of PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA was also observed in several other brain areas but not universally in all (a notable exception being the cerebellum). A slight but consistent lateral hemispherical asymmetry is apparent with PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA, but to a much lower degree, if at all, with NSE mRNA (for discussion of left-right asymmetry in brain, see Refs. 50Hobert O.

Scale bars, 1.2 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA were identified at substantial levels not only in stratum pyramidale but also in stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare of Ammon's horn, layers that contain medial and distal apical dendritic arborizations, respectively, of hippocampal pyramidal cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of both RNAs took the characteristic form of a gradient with intensity levels diminishing in the CA3 to CA1 direction. Furthermore, although both PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA were strongly expressed in the hilar region, only relatively low amounts of either RNA were detected in somatic or dendritic layers of the dentate gyrus. These results indicate coexpression as well as codistribution of PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA in the hippocampal formation.Do PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA also colocalize along dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells? To address this question, we analyzed expression levels of PKMζ mRNA in the CA3 field in comparison with BC1 RNA, NSE mRNA, and the mRNA encoding microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (29Garner C.C. Tucker R.P. Matus A. Nature. 1988; 336: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 30Bruckenstein D.A. Lein P.J. Higgins D. Fremeau Jr., R.T.

Although PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA were strongly expressed in medial and distal dendritic layers, lower levels of both RNAs were detected in the stratum lucidum, the layer through which the proximal segments of pyramidal apical dendrites traverse. This evaluation was confirmed by quantitative analysis along the pyramidale to lacunosum moleculare extent (Fig. 4E). Of note, proximal segments of CA3 apical pyramidal cell dendrites, innervated by mossy fibers in stratum lucidum, have been shown to display both a lower density of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity and less regulation of AMPA receptors during LTP than distal segments of these dendrites (32Monaghan D.T.

PKMζ mRNA (A), BC1 RNA (B), and MAP2 mRNA (C), but not NSE mRNA (D) are expressed at substantial levels in dendritic layers. PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA are expressed at equally high levels in stratum radiatum and in stratum lacunosum moleculare but at lower relative levels in stratum lucidum. In contrast, relative MAP2 mRNA expression levels are highest in stratum radiatum but lower in stratum lacunosum moleculare. The results with all four RNAs were imaged and quantified (E). For each RNA analyzed, relative signal intensities in stratum pyramidale were set at 100%.

Scale bar, 250 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The dendritic expression profile of PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA in CA3 is distinctive as it is distinguished from patterns of other dendritic RNAs. For example, we detected MAP2 mRNA at approximately equal levels in both stratum pyramidale and stratum lucidum (Fig. 4, C and E). At the same time, the highest relative levels of MAP2 mRNA were seen in dendritic stratum radiatum but not extending into stratum lacunosum moleculare, the distal-most dendritic layer (Fig. 4, C and E; see also Refs. 29Garner C.C.

The PKMζ/BC1 profile is also not shared with dendritic CaMKIIα mRNA because the latter is expressed at highest relative levels in stratum pyramidale and at uniform but overall lower relative levels in strata lucidum, radiatum, and lacunosum moleculare (35Burgin K.E.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).Taken together, the results show that PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA are targeted to colocalize in a characteristic pattern along CA3 pyramidal cell apical dendrites. Such colocalization is indicative of functional interactions between PKMζ mRNA and BC1 RNA, a translational modulator, in the regulation of PKMζ synthesis in pyramidal cell dendrites. This hypothesis remains open to future investigation.Dendritic Transport of PKMζ mRNA Is Specified by Two Cis-acting Targeting Elements—The above data show that PKMζ mRNA is localized to dendritic domains of neurons both in culture and in vivo. Is the RNA actively transported to dendrites, and if so, what is/are the code(s) that specify such transport? To address these questions, we used a microinjection paradigm with in vitro synthesized RNAs (16Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Shan J. Munro T.P. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. Smith R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8859-8866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNAs, including PKMζ mRNA segments of desired lengths and sequence contents, were introduced into cultured sympathetic neurons by somatic microinjection. After appropriate post-injection time intervals to allow for transport, the cells were fixed, and dendritic delivery was ascertained by emulsion autoradiography.Cis-acting DTEs, inasmuch as they have been identified in localized neuronal mRNAs, often reside in 3′-UTRs. We therefore decided to examine dendritic targeting competence by working initially in the 3′ to 5′ direction. A series of PKMζ mRNA segments was generated by successive trimming in this direction to pinpoint presumed DTEs within the PKMζ mRNA sequence (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 6, a segment spanning nucleotides 48–1982 (Segment 1) was transported along dendrites to localize in a fashion in"
https://openalex.org/W2089410077,"Ure2p is the precursor protein of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion [URE3]. Ure2p shows homology to glutathione transferases but lacks typical glutathione transferase activity. A recent study found that deletion of the Ure2 gene causes increased sensitivity to heavy metal ions and oxidants, whereas prion strains show normal sensitivity. To demonstrate that protection against oxidant toxicity is an inherent property of native and prion Ure2p requires biochemical characterization of the purified protein. Here we use steady-state kinetic methods to characterize the multisubstrate peroxidase activity of Ure2p using GSH with cumene hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, or tert-butyl hydroperoxide as substrates. Glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity was proportional to the Ure2p concentration and showed optima at pH 8 and 40 °C. Michaelis-Menten behavior with convergent straight lines in double reciprocal plots was observed. This excludes a ping-pong mechanism and implies either a rapid-equilibrium random or a steady-state ordered sequential mechanism for Ure2p, consistent with its classification as a glutathione transferase. The mutant 90Ure2, which lacks the unstructured N-terminal prion domain, showed kinetic parameters identical to wild type. Fibrillar aggregates showed the same level of activity as native protein. Demonstration of peroxidase activity for Ure2 represents important progress in elucidation of its role in vivo. Further, establishment of an in vitro activity assay provides a valuable tool for the study of structure-function relationships of the Ure2 protein as both a prion and an enzyme.

GSTs have the general function of conjugating GSH to electrophilic substances to reduce their toxicity. As a consequence, GSTs are involved in development of resistance toward drugs, insecticides, and herbicides and have a protective role against a range of diseases including cancer. GSTs are dimeric proteins with a relatively conserved N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and a more variable C-domain. GST activity is typically tested using the “universal” GST substrate, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). However, a number of GSTs identified by structural criteria have failed to show activity toward CDNB (5Vuilleumier S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some GSTs have been shown to have overlapping functions with other glutathione-binding enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and glutaredoxins (1Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A.

These enzyme families share the GSH-binding thioredoxin domain but are otherwise structurally and mechanistically dissimilar (7Saito Y. Hayashi T. Tanaka A. Watanabe Y. Suzuki M. Saito E.

Characterization of the GSTs, glutaredoxins, and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals some redundancy of function between the different classes of enzyme (11Choi J.H.

The versatility of the glutathione-binding enzymes and their tendency to show overlapping functions may contribute significantly to the ability of the host organism to adapt to change. Ure2p is the protein determinant of the S. cerevisiae prion [URE3] (14Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Analogous to the mammalian prion (15Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar), the heritable [URE3] prion phenotype is conveyed by a structural change in Ure2 to an aggregated form (16Masison D.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1995; 270: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that drugs isolated using a yeast prion cell-screening assay are also active against mammalian prions, suggesting that there may be features of the cellular mechanism of prion formation and/or maintenance that are common to yeast and mammalian prions despite the diversity of the proteins involved (17Bach S.

Conversion of Ure2 to the prion form depends on the N-terminal ∼90 amino acids (18Masison D.C. Maddelein M.L. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This N-terminal prion domain also directs the formation of amyloid-like fibrils in vitro (19Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W.

This function is carried out by the C-terminal region of the protein and is lost on conversion to the prion form (16Masison D.C. Wickner R.B.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13564-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) forms, confirming the classification of Ure2 as a glutathione transferase (6Rossjohn J. Board P.G. Parker M.W.

However, attempts to demonstrate typical GST activity for Ure2, such as using CDNB, have so far proved unsuccessful (11Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

A Ure2 homologue in Aspergillus nidulans was found to lack the nitrogen metabolite repression activity of Ure2 but contributed to heavy metal and xenobiotic resistance, including resistance to oxidative stress (28Fraser J.A. Davis M.A. Hynes M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2802-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Further, it was recently found that the deletion of the S. cerevisiae Ure2 gene increases the sensitivity of the cell to metals and cellular oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (27Rai R. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12826-12833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Basu U. Southron J.L. Stephens J.L. Taylor G.J. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2004; 271: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Ure2 possesses GPx activity. This has implications for the role of Ure2 in vivo. In addition, it implies the potential to establish an in vitro activity assay for Ure2, which would serve as an invaluable tool in structure-function analysis. In this study, we tested the activity of Ure2 toward a number of oxidant substrates in vitro to establish whether the peroxidase activity related to the Ure2 gene is an inherent property of the Ure2 protein. Having detected GPx activity for Ure2, we employed steady-state kinetic techniques to characterize the kinetic parameters for the substrates cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH), and H2O2 and to investigate the reaction mechanism. Further, we compared the activity of wild type Ure2 with that of a Ure2 deletion mutant, 90Ure2, which lacks the prion domain. Finally, we compared the activity of the native dimeric protein with that of fibrillar aggregates. Materials—GSH, β-NADPH, CHP, t-BH, and glutathione reductase were from Sigma. Ure2 and 90Ure2 were produced in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal His6 tag and purified by nickel affinity chromatography or produced without a tag and purified by a series of ionic exchange and gel filtration chromatographic steps, as described previously (21Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at –80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl and defrosted in a 25 °C water bath immediately prior to use. The protein concentration in terms of monomers was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 40,700 m–1 cm–1 (21Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. Enzyme Assays and Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—The GPx activity of Ure2 was determined using GSH with one of the hydroperoxides, CHP, H2O2, or t-BH, as substrates using a coupled spectrophotometric assay as described previously (30Flohe L. Gunzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 115-121Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Unless otherwise indicated, the assay was carried out at 25 °C in a 1-ml reaction volume containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 4 mm sodium azide, 0.5–5.0 mm GSH, 0.15 mm β-NADPH, 0.24 units of glutathione reductase, and 0.3–3.0 μm Ure2. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 25 °C for 6 min, after which the reaction was started by the addition of the hydroperoxide substrate to a final concentration of 0.5–5.0 mm to both cuvettes. The progress of reactions was monitored continuously by following the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm on a Shimadzu UV2501PC14 spectrophotometer. Initial rates were determined from the linear slope of progress curves obtained with an extinction coefficient for NADPH of 6220 m–1 cm–1 after subtracting the non-enzymatic velocities due to the auto-oxidation of GSH by the hydroperoxide determined from the corresponding blank. When bovine serum albumin was used in place of Ure2, no increase over the base-line rate was observed. The presence or absence of 4 mm sodium azide had no affect on the Ure2 activity. When GSH was omitted from the reaction mixture, no Ure2 activity was observed. Steady-state kinetic analysis was carried out by obtaining sets of initial velocities over a wide range of concentrations of one substrate while the concentration of the other substrate was kept constant (31Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1998Google Scholar, 32Laidler K.J. Bunting P.S. The Chemical Kinetics of Enzyme Action. Oxford University Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation or the Lineweaver-Burk equation. The values obtained from these plots, and Eadie-Hofstee plots were the same within error. Single or global fitting was carried out using the regression wizard of SigmaPlot. The errors shown are the S.E. of the fit, or the mean ± S.E. obtained from independent measurements, as appropriate. Determination of true kinetic parameters and investigation of the reaction mechanism were performed by obtaining Michaelis-Menten curves at a series of concentrations of the second substrate and then fitting the data globally to the Michaelis-Menten model describing two-substrate sequential binding (32Laidler K.J. Bunting P.S. The Chemical Kinetics of Enzyme Action. Oxford University Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar, 33Seubert P.A. Renosto F. Knudson P. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem.

The values obtained by linear extrapolation using secondary plots or by global fitting were the same within error. Assay of Ure2 GPx Activity during the Time Course of Amyloid-like Fibril Formation—The initial sample was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any preexisting aggregates, and 300 μl of the supernatant was transferred into each of a series of tubes, one for each time point. The reaction mixture contained 30 μm full-length Ure2 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The samples were incubated in parallel at a constant temperature of 37 °C with shaking as described previously (35Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the increase in fluorescence due to ThT binding correlates directly with the appearance of fibrillar aggregates of Ure2 (36Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At each time point, one of the samples was placed on ice. A 50-μl aliquot of the complete reaction mixture was removed and assayed for GPx activity using 1 mm GSH and 1.2 mm CHP as substrates, as described above. A further 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed to assay for ThT binding, as described previously (35Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of the remaining 240 μl of sample, a 50-μl aliquot of the resulting supernatant was assayed for GPx activity. A further 10-μl aliquot of supernatant was used for protein concentration determination using the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The precipitate was resuspended in 240 μl of the same buffer, and then a 50-μl aliquot of the resuspended mixture was assayed for GPx activity. Thus, the final protein concentration in the GPx assays was 1.5 μm for the total reaction mixture and a maximum of 1.5 μm in either the supernatant or the pellet fraction, depending on the relative distribution of protein between the fractions during the course of fibril formation. The pattern of change observed was highly reproducible in independent experiments. Ure2 Shows Glutathione Peroxidase Activity—The ability of Ure2 to reduce hydroperoxides was tested in vitro using purified Ure2 with the oxidant substrate CHP and the reducing agent GSH. Reactions were followed by the oxidation of NADPH, which is coupled to the reduction of GSSG to GSH by glutathione reductase. The rate of non-enzymatic oxidation of NADPH in the absence of Ure2 was subtracted in each case. When Ure2 was added in the presence of all of the other components of the assay, a significant increase in the oxidation rate of NADPH was observed (Fig. 1, inset) and the initial velocity of the Ure2-catalyzed reaction was found to be proportional to the Ure2 concentration (Fig. 1, main panel). As is characteristic of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (32Laidler K.J. Bunting P.S. The Chemical Kinetics of Enzyme Action. Oxford University Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity of Ure2 toward CHP showed pH and temperature optima, in this case at around pH 8.0 and 40 °C (Fig. 2). In contrast, the uncatalyzed rate was observed to increase steeply above pH 8 or above 30 °C (data not shown). Therefore, we adopted pH 7.5 and 25 °C as the standard conditions for the Ure2 GPx activity assay. A control using bovine serum albumin in place of Ure2 over the same protein concentration range showed no detectable GPx activity (data not shown). The presence or absence of 4 mm sodium azide had no effect on the Ure2 GPx activity, ruling out the possibility that the observed activity is due to contamination with a heme-containing peroxidase such as catalase or myeloperoxidase. Ure2 showed no peroxidase activity in the absence of GSH. This then demonstrates that Ure2 has GSH-dependent peroxidase activity.Fig. 2Optima of Ure2 catalyzed glutathione peroxidase activity toward CHP.A, pH dependence of activity measured at 25 °C. B, temperature dependence of activity measured at pH 7.5. The Ure2 concentration was 1.2 μm. Other details are as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of Different Hydroperoxide Substrates—To further characterize the GPx activity of Ure2, we employed steady-state methods to obtain the apparent kinetic parameters for the enzymatic reaction. The results of steady-state kinetic analysis of Ure2 GPx activity toward the substrates CHP, hydrogen peroxide, and t-BH are shown in Fig. 3 and Table I. When the concentration of one substrate was fixed and the concentration of the other substrate was varied, the GPx activity was hyperbolic with respect to substrate concentration (Fig. 3) and double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots were linear (Fig. 4), as is typical of adherence to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (31Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1998Google Scholar). Ure2 showed activity toward all three substrates with an apparent preference in the order H2O2 ≥ CHP > t-BH. This indicates that Ure2 has GPx activity toward hydrogen peroxide as well as typical organic hydroperoxide substrates.Table IApparent steady-state kinetic constants for Ure2 activity toward different hydroperoxide substratesSubstrateFixed [hydroperoxide substrate]aFixed [CHP] or [H2O2] at 1.2 mm; fixed [t-BH] at 5 mm.Fixed [GSH] at 1 mmKm(GSH)(app)Vmax(app)/[E]0Km(app)Vmax(app)/[E]0mms-1mms-1CHP2.6 ± 0.10.12 ± 0.027.8 ± 0.20.37 ± 0.02H2O22.1 ± 0.40.36 ± 0.054.3 ± 0.90.36 ± 0.06t-BH5.5 ± 1.00.16 ± 0.047.9 ± 2.90.07 ± 0.02a Fixed [CHP] or [H2O2] at 1.2 mm; fixed [t-BH] at 5 mm.

The concentration of Ure2p in the reactions was 0.6 μm. The observed pattern of intersecting straight lines excludes a ping-pong reaction mechanism and is consistent with either a steady-state ordered sequential mechanism or a rapid-equilibrium random sequential mechanism. The parameters obtained by global fitting of the data to Equation 1 are shown in Table III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Prion Domain Does Not Contribute to Peroxidase Activity—The apparent kinetic parameters obtained for wild type Ure2 (with and without a His6 tag) and for the prion domain deletion mutant 90Ure2 are shown in Table II. The results show that not only does the presence of a His6 tag have no effect on the enzymatic activity of Ure2 but also that the detected activity cannot be attributed to contamination with a similar enzyme, given the radically different purification methods for tagged and non-tagged protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The parameters obtained for 90Ure2 are the same within error as those obtained for wild type Ure2, indicating that the prion domain does not contribute to the GPx activity. This result is consistent with the finding that the Ure2 prion domain is essentially unstructured in the native dimer (21Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

The exact steady-state solutions of the mechanisms for two-substrate reactions are extremely complicated. However, in practice, only a limited number of mechanisms are observed and, under certain conditions, the rate equations can be reduced to simple forms (31Fersht A.R.

Fig. 4 shows double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus one substrate concentration, obtained for a range of concentrations of the second substrate. The slope of the lines was observed to decrease with increasing concentration of the second substrate, and the lines intersected at a common point. This rules out a ping-pong mechanism (which is characterized by parallel double-reciprocal plots). The pattern observed is consistent with a sequential mechanism, and the data can be fitted to Equation 1 (32Laidler K.J. Bunting P.S. The Chemical Kinetics of Enzyme Action.

Because of the equivalent form of the rate equations, it cannot be distinguished from the current data whether binding is random or ordered. However, if binding is ordered, given that GSH binds to Ure2 in the absence of a second substrate (26Bousset L. Berlhali H. Melki R. Morera S.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles prepared from rat gastrocnemius muscle were incubated with purified HSP70 at both 37 and 41 °C for either 30, 60, or 120 min. Maximal SERCA1a activity (μmol/g protein/min) in the absence of HSP70 was reduced progressively with time, with greater reductions occurring at 41 °C compared with 37 °C. HSP70 protected against thermal inactivation of SERCA1a activity at 37 °C but not at 41 °C and only at 30 and 60 min but not at 120 min. HSP70 also protected against reductions in binding capacity for fluorescein isothiocyanate, a fluorescent probe that binds to Lys515 in the nucleotide binding domain of SERCA, at 30 and 60 min but not at 120 min, an effect that was independent of temperature. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding rabbit SERCA1a and human HSP-EYFP and subjected to 40 °C for 1 h. Immunohistochemistry revealed nearly complete co-localization of SERCA1a with HSP70 under these conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation showed physical interaction between HSP70 and SERCA1a under all thermal conditions both in vitro and in HEK-293 cells. Modeling showed that the fluorescein isothiocyanate-binding site of intact SERCA1a in the E2 form lies in its close proximity to a potential interaction site between SERCA1a and HSP70.

Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; HSP, heat shock protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SH, sulfhydryl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; CTL, control; DTT, dithiothreitol; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescein protein. are 110-kDa integral membrane proteins that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) (1MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Two SERCA isoforms predominate in adult striated muscle, namely SERCA1a and SERCA2a. SERCA1a accounts for more than 99% of the SERCA isoforms expressed in adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle, whereas SERCA2a is the major isoform expressed in heart and slow-twitch skeletal muscle (2Wu K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In muscle, SERCAs perform at least two crucial functions obligatory for precise control of intracellular Ca2+. In conjunction with plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases, SERCAs are responsible for setting resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations, and during repetitive muscle contractions, they induce muscle relaxation through the rapid sequestration of large Ca2+ loads from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the SR, thereby determining the size of the SR Ca2+ store. Loss of Ca2+ regulation and Ca2+ overload have been implicated as major factors associated with oxidative damage and cellular dysfunction in striated muscle that occurs with ischemia-reperfusion (3Rubin B.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), loss of SERCA function likely contributes to Ca2+ overload that occurs with oxidative stress. Specifically, SERCA1a, the SERCA isoform expressed in adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle, contains 24 cysteine residues (20Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to represent a principal target that is preferentially damaged by ROS (15Senisterra G.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) is rapidly induced under conditions of oxidative stress which provides cytoprotection to cells, making them resistant to otherwise lethal levels of stress (21Kampinga H.H.

For example, overexpression of HSP70 in striated muscle cells, either in transgenic mice or physiologically, by exposure of cells to a mild heat shock, is associated with protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury (23Marber M.S.

(Lond.). 2003; 548: 837-846Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the cytoprotective effects of HSP70 remains to be established but presumably is related to the ability of HSP70 to prevent protein aggregation and assist with refolding of denatured or partially folded proteins (22Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 29Knowlton A. Knowlton A. Heat Shock Proteins and the Cardiovascular System. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1997: 1-24Google Scholar). It has been shown that the bacterial heat shock protein (HSP) GroEL can prevent thermal inactivation of SERCA1a in vitro by blocking the aggregation of SERCA1a at 25 °C (30Javed M.U.H. Michelangeli F. Lund P.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 631-638PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether HSP70 can interact physically with SERCAs and prevent inactivation of SERCA activity that normally occurs with oxidative stress. To explore this possibility, we prepared SR membrane fractions from rat fast-twitch skeletal muscle and mixed them with a purified recombinant HSP70 just prior to prolonged incubation at temperatures known to cause sulfhydryl (SH) oxidation and thermal instability of SERCA1a in vitro (13Schertzer J.D. Green H.J. Tupling A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E722-E728Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that HSP70 binds to SERCA1a, prevents inactivation of maximal SERCA1a activity, and preserves FITC binding capacity of SERCA1a during heat stress in vitro. Experiments using HEK-293 cells that co-expressed SERCA1a and HSP70 also confirmed that the two proteins can interact physically in intact mammalian cells. However, functional protection of SERCA1a and, to a lesser extent, preservation of FITC binding capacity by HSP70 were lost with progressively greater severity of heat stress. We propose that HSP70 can bind to SERCA1a and, depending on the severity of heat stress, protect SERCA1a function by stabilizing the nucleotide binding (N) domain.

Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection with three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, and samples were suspended in 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunofluorescence in HEK-293 Cells—For immunofluorescence experiments, HEK-293 cells were grown on 18 × 18-mm glass coverslips and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using Ca2+ phosphate. In co-localization experiments, SERCA1a plasmid DNA was co-transfected in a 1:1 (w/w) ratio with HSP70-EYFP plasmids. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and washed in PBS. Samples were then permeabilized by using antibody buffer (0.5% Triton-X and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C and were blocked for 30 min at 4 °C using antibody buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with either the A52 antibody (final concentration of 2 μg/ml) alone, and in some experiments together with a polyclonal antibody against HSP70 (Stressgen Bioreagents) (1:500 dilution, ∼2 μg/ml), overnight at 4 °C. After thorough washing in antibody buffer, appropriate anti-rabbit FITC- and anti-mouse Cy5 (cyanine 5.29)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch; West Grove, PA) were applied to the samples for 1 h at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed three times for 15 min with PBS, mounted on glass slides using glycerol/PBS solution, and sealed using nail polish. Images with each excitation wavelength (488 and 633 nm) were collected separately (FITC and EYFP fluorescence, ∼495–550 nm; Cy5, ∼645–720 nm), using a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP laser scanning confocal system (Leica Microsystems Canada; Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada). Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). To quantify immunofluorescence results, a minimum of 200 cells in five random fields of view from at least three experiments was counted under the ×40 microscope. Preparation of Isolated SR Membrane Fractions—SR membrane fractions were isolated from white portions of gastrocnemius muscles from 3- to 4-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 238 ± 3.5 g (mean ± S.E.), suspended in a solution containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2% NaN3, and 0.2 mm PMSF, and frozen at -80 °C, as described earlier (36Tupling R. Green H. Senisterra G. Lepock J. McKee N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R1681-R1688PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schertzer J.D. Green H.J. Duhamel T.A. Tupling A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E597-E610Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry, as modified by Schacterle and Pollock (38Schacterle G.R. Pollock R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 51: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Waterloo. SERCA Activity Measurements—To determine whether HSP70 could protect against thermal inactivation of SERCA1a activity, SR samples (5 μg of total protein) were diluted in 1 ml of the assay buffer used for measurement of SERCA activity (described below) and incubated at both 37 and 41 °C either with or without 1 μg of total purified rat HSP70 protein. At 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation, measurements of SERCA activity were made at 37 °C by using a spectrophotometric assay as described previously (39Tupling R. Green H. Senisterra G. Lepock J. McKee N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E224-E232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay buffer contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm P-endolpyruvate, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0. Immediately before the reaction was started by the addition of CaCl2, 5 mm ATP, 18 units/ml of both lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, 0.3 mm NADH, and 1 μm Ca2+ ionophore A-23187 (Sigma, C-7522) were added to the diluted sample. Basal activity was measured in the absence of Ca2+ and recorded prior to the addition of CaCl2. Experiments were also performed at 37 °C with or without HSP70 in a subset of samples that were incubated for either 30, 60, or 120 min in SERCA activity assay buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2. The 1 mm Ca/EGTA buffer would have a free Ca2+ concentration of about 10 μm. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression with computer software (Graph Pad Software), and the KCa and Hill coefficient (nH) values were calculated by using an equation for a general cooperative model for substrate activation. The values for maximal SERCA1a activity that occurred at pCa 5.6 to 5.2 were taken directly from the experimental data and normalized for total protein concentration. Maximal SERCA1a activity values are reported as percentages of control (CTL) values, which were measured in SR samples that were kept on ice and set to 100%. Samples from all conditions were analyzed during the course of a single day. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—To determine whether HSP70 could bind to SERCA1a in vitro, co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA1a and HSP70 was carried out following the method described in the Seize-X primary immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). SR samples were diluted in SERCA activity assay buffer (no ATP) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in a total of 85 μl, mixed with purified HSP70 (3 μg), and incubated for 30, 60, and 120 min at either 37 or 41 °C. The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm PMSF, 1% Tween 20, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged in a Beckman GS-15R centrifuge for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were mixed with an agarose gel/anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody affinity support complex and rotated overnight at 4 °C. After washing the affinity support complex with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, the samples were eluted with a glycine elution buffer (pH 2.8) supplied with the kit. The samples were loaded on 7% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were separated using standard SDS-PAGE protocols (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with a skim milk suspension, the membranes were treated with anti-SERCA1a monoclonal antibody A25, washed in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween), and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, and the signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) using a bio-imaging system and the GeneSnap software (Syngene) obtained from Fisher. Immunoprecipitations of proteins from microsomal fractions that were isolated from HEK-293 cells were performed as described previously (41Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 42Asahi M. Sugita Y. Kurzydlowski K. de Leon S. Tada M. Toyoshima C. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Western blot analysis was also used to determine whether proteolysis of SERCA1a occurred under the heat stress conditions that were employed in this study. FITC Binding Capacity—FITC binding capacity of SERCA1a was measured to assess the structural integrity of the N domain under conditions of heat stress. SR samples (5 μg of total protein) were diluted in SERCA activity assay buffer at 250 μg/ml and incubated under all temperature conditions both with and without the addition of 1 μg of purified HSP70. Immediately following the timed temperature incubations, all samples (including CTL) were incubated in 250 μl of FITC labeling buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm FITC and a protease inhibitor mixture at 25 °C for 60 min in the dark. FITC-labeled samples were dissolved in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol, 5% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, to stop the reaction, applied to the same 7% gel, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained for FITC-labeled SERCA1a using the anti-fluorescein/Oregon Green monoclonal antibody 4-4-20. Densitometric analysis was performed using the GeneSnap software (Syngene) to determine relative FITC binding levels expressed as a percentage of control. Modeling—Structural models were developed from a computational prediction of interaction between the substrate binding domain of HSP70 cognate and SERCA1a. Protein Data Base code 1IWO was used for the SERCA1a model and Protein Data Base code 7HSC was used for the HSP70 model. Three residues from the C terminus of 7HSC, a self-pseudo-substrate for the binding site on the substrate binding domain of HSC, were deleted from Protein Data Base data. The global scan calculations of protein to protein docking were performed on a grid spacing of 0.7 Å by using FTDoc suite and mutidoc software (43Jackson R.M. Gabb H.A. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 265-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) on a titanium2-based Linux computer. Data Analysis—To determine the effects of temperature (37 versus 41 °C) and the time of incubation (30, 60, and 120 min) and treatment (CTL, HSP70, without HSP70), a repeated measures three-way analysis of variance was employed. Where significant differences were found, Duncan's post hoc tests were used to compare specific means. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Ca2+-dependent SERCA1a Activity—To determine the effects of HSP70 on SERCA1a function in response to heat stress, we mixed isolated SR membrane fractions prepared from rat fast-twitch skeletal muscle with recombinant rat HSP70 protein, and we determined Ca2+ dependence of SERCA1a activity immediately following 30-, 60-, and 120-min incubations (in 1 mm EGTA, see “Experimental Procedures”) at both 37 and 41 °C. At saturating Ca2+ levels (pCa 5.6 to 5.2) the time-dependent inactivation of maximal SERCA1a activity was greater (p < 0.05) at 41 °C compared with 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Relative to CTL, in the absence of HSP70, following 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation, maximal SERCA1a activity was reduced at 41 °C (p < 0.05) by 30, 38, and 57% compared with reductions at 37 °C (p < 0.05) of 11, 19, and 31%, respectively. When SR membrane fractions were premixed with purified HSP70, maximal SERCA1a activity was protected at 37 °C following both 30- and 60-min incubations and, perhaps, even activated at 30 min. For all other incubation conditions, the percent inactivation of maximal SERCA1a activity was not different (p > 0.05) between samples that were exposed to elevated temperature in the presence or absence of purified HSP70. In order to determine whether HSP70 function itself was impaired during prolonged periods at elevated temperatures thereby explaining the lack of protection of maximal SERCA1a activity at 120 min at 37 °C or >30 min at 41 °C, we performed experiments where purified HSP70 was incubated for 120 min at 41 °C, then mixed with SR membranes that were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 1 mm EGTA, with maximal SERCA1a activity being determined between pCa 5.6 and 5.2 (Fig. 1B). SR samples that were mixed with HSP70 that had been preincubated for 120 min at 41 °C were fully protected against thermal inactivation of maximal SERCA1a activity compared with samples that were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the absence of HSP70, where maximal SERCA1a activity was reduced by 19% compared with CTL. These results indicate that direct thermal effects on HSP70 function cannot explain the lack of protection of SERCA1a function by HSP70 that was observed under some conditions of elevated temperature used in this study. Because the Ca2+-bound state of SERCA is more stable than the Ca2+-free state (11Lepock J.R. Rodahl A.M. Zhang C. Heynen M.L. Waters B. Cheng K.-H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 44McIntosh D.B. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to assess thermal inactivation of SERCA1a in the presence of Ca2+, both with and without HSP70. Maximal SERCA1a activity was partially stabilized at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+/EGTA, which was added prior to the start of incubation. Compared with CTL, in the absence of HSP70, maximal SERCA1a activity was unaltered (p < 0.05) at 30 min but was reduced (p < 0.05) by 16 and 20% at 60 and 120 min, respectively. Similar to our findings with 1 mm EGTA, HSP70 prevented inactivation of maximal SERCA1a activity at 60 but not at 120 min of incubation (data not shown). The effects of HSP70 on the SERCA1a enzyme kinetic properties in response to heat stress are illustrated in Table I. A main effect (p < 0.05) of time of incubation was found for both the KCa (the negative logarithm of the Ca2+ concentration that gives half-maximal SERCA enzyme activity expressed in pCa units) (120 = 60 < 30 min = CTL) and the Hill coefficient (nH) (120 < 60 = 30 min = CTL) (Fig. 2). These effects were not specific to temperature level and were independent of HSP70 treatment. Compared with CTL and 30 min, KCa was shifted from ∼6.35 to ∼6.23 following incubations of both 60 and 120 min. The Hill coefficient was 1.83 ± 0.10 in CTL and was reduced following incubations of 120 min to 1.47 ± 0.09.Table IEffects of HSP70 on SERCA1a enzyme kinetic properties in response to heat stress SR membrane fractions that were prepared from rat fast-twitch muscle were incubated for 30, 60, or 120 min at either 37 or 41 °C, both with and without purified HSP70.

Phylogenetic studies show that these efflux systems are associated with five superfamilies of transporters (4Chung Y.J. Saier Jr., M.H. Curr. Opin. Drug. Discovery Devel. 2001; 4: 237-245PubMed Google Scholar). One of these includes a family of small multidrug resistance (SMR) conferring proteins. The SMR family consists of small hydrophobic proteins of ∼100 amino acid residues with four transmembrane α-helical spanners (5Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Turner R.J. Weiner J.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized SMR protein is EmrE, from Escherichia coli. The protein has been characterized, purified, and reconstituted in a functional form (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). High-affinity substrate binding has been established as a reliable and sensitive assay for activity of the detergent-solubilized transporter (11Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Glu-14, the only membrane-embedded charged residue, is highly conserved in the SMR family (8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This residue has an unusually high pK and is an essential part of the binding domain shared by substrates and protons (11Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The occupancy of the binding domain is mutually exclusive, and as such this provides the molecular basis for coupling of substrate and proton fluxes. Direct measurements of substrate-induced release of protons in a detergent-solubilized EmrE shows the stoichiometry of the release is almost 1 proton per monomer. The findings demonstrate that the only residue involved in proton release is Glu-14 and that all the Glu-14 residues in the EmrE functional oligomer participate in proton release (14Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MDTs transport substrates with apparently little common structural features. At times these substrates are neutral, negatively, or positively charged (15Bibi E. Adler J. Lewinson O. Edgar R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 163-170PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nishino K. Yamaguchi A. J.

This poses intriguing mechanistic challenges such as binding of substrates with different charges to a common binding domain. Some clues for the molecular basis of multidrug recognition are emerging from the structural studies of transcription factors that regulate expression of MDTs (19Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Only limited information is available as to how the MDTs deal with transport of substrates with different charges. The gradient that ion-coupled transporters can generate depends on the number of ion molecules transported per substrate molecule (stoichiometry) and on the charge of the substrate. In the case of MdfA, an E. coli multidrug transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, it was shown that it exchanges neutral compounds as chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol and monovalent cationic substrates with the same stoichiometry, and as a result the driving forces for both types of substrates are different (20Lewinson O.

In this study, we compare transport of monovalent and divalent substrates by EmrE in intact cells and in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified protein. In intact cells, under conditions where the only driving force is the electrical potential, EmrE confers resistance to monovalent substrates but not to divalent ones. In the presence of a proton gradient, resistance to both types of substrates is detected. In proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified EmrE only proton gradients were able to drive transport of both divalent and monovalent substrates, whereas the electrical potential drove transport of monovalent substrates. The results demonstrated that whereas the transport only of monovalent substrates involves charge movement (i.e. electrogenic), the transport of divalent substrate does not (i.e. electroneutral). Together with previous results, these findings suggest that an EmrE dimer exchanges two protons per substrate molecule during each transport cycle. The findings that under some conditions EmrE is ineffective in removing certain types of drugs imply that an in-depth study of mechanisms of action of MDTs may help devising strategies for coping with the problem of multidrug resistance.

Growth was at 37 °C in a 1.2-ml-square storage plate (96 wells, Abgene, Surrey, UK). LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 mm Bis-Tris propane was titrated to the indicated pH with HCl. Bis-Tris propane was added to maintain a constant pH during growth as described previously (24Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression, Purification, and Reconstitution of EmrE-His— Overexpression and purification of EmrE was performed essentially as described previously (14Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For reconstitution, purified EmrE-His was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagene GmbH, Hilden, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (sodium buffer) with 0.08% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Glycon Biochemicals, Luckenwalde, Germany), 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3× in sodium buffer containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Glycon Biochemicals, Luckenwalde, Germany). EmrE-His was eluted from the beads with sodium buffer containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 200 mm imidazole. The supernatant was mixed with a solution containing 25 mg/ml E. coli phospholipids (Avanti, Inc., Alabaster, AL), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The amount of protein mixed with the phospholipids is indicated in the specific experiments. To generate ΔpH, after sonication the mixture was diluted 27-fold into NH4 buffer containing 190 mm NH4-Cl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and then centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 90 min. Proteoliposomes were resuspended in NH4 buffer, frozen in liquid air, and kept at –70 °C. To generate Δψ, the proteoliposomes were formed by dilution into 70 mm sodium thiocyanate, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Tricine buffer, pH 7.5 and 1 mm dithiothreitol (thiocyanate buffer). They were then centrifuged, resuspended and frozen as above. Before the assay, the proteoliposomes suspension was thawed and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for a few seconds until clear. ΔpH-driven Methyl Viologen Uptake Assay—Uptake of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed essentially as described in Yerushalmi et al. (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). 3 μl of the NH4 containing proteoliposomes were diluted into 200 μl of an ammonium-free solution. The latter contained 20 μm [14C]methyl viologen (32 nCi/assay), 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tricine, 10 mm Tris, and 5 mm MgCl2 (final pH 8.5) (KCl buffer). At given times the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution. The samples were filtered through Millipore filters (0.22 μm) and washed with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation. In each experiment the values obtained in a control reaction with 15 μm nigericin were subtracted from all experimental points. This background was no more than 10% of most experimental values. The reaction was measured in duplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. ΔpH-driven Tetraphenylphoshonium (TPP+) Uptake Assay—3 μl of NH4 containing proteoliposomes were diluted into 200 μl of KCl buffer that contained 10 nm [3H]TPP+ (60 nCi/assay). Because of the relatively high nonspecific binding of [3H]TPP+ to the filters, the reaction was slightly modified so that it was stopped by centrifugation (452 × g, 1 min) through columns (2-ml disposable syringes) containing Sephadex G-50 fine, preswollen in KCl buffer and packed by centrifugation (113 × g, 1 min). The radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. In each experiment, a control reaction was carried out where no gradient was generated (dilution into ammonium buffer). The values obtained in such a reaction were subtracted from all experimental points. The reactions were carried out in duplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. For examining the effect of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) on [3H]TPP+ uptake, proteoliposomes were incubated with 0.3 mm DCCD for 30 min before the uptake assay. Drug gradients were calculated using intraliposomal volumes determined in a separate experiment as follows: proteoliposomes were sonicated in the presence of 2 mm [14C]methyl viologen (32.3 mCi/mmol). A sample (3 μl) was diluted with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution used in the transport experiments, filtered through Millipore filters (0.22 μm), and washed with an additional 2 ml of solution. From the radioactivity associated with the proteoliposomes an internal volume of 0.2 μl per sample was calculated. To prevent significant leakage this manipulation was performed with proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmrE E14C, an inactive mutant (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). TPP+Binding Assay—NH4 containing proteoliposomes were diluted into 200 μl of a buffer containing 10 nm [3H]TPP+ (60 nCi/assay), 190 mm NH4Cl, and 43 mm Tris-Cl (final pH 8.5). The reactions (200 μl) were stopped by centrifugation (452 × g, 1 min.) through columns containing Sephadex G-50 fine, preswollen in the same buffer, and packed by centrifugation (113 × g, 1 min.). The radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Δψ-Driven Uptake Assays—Δψ driven uptake assays of MV2+ and TPP+ were performed as the ΔpH-driven uptake assays except that the inner and outer solutions differed in composition; 3 μl of proteoliposomes formed in thiocyanate buffer were diluted into 200 μl of a solution containing 10 nm [3H]TPP+ or 41 μm [14C]MV2+, 190 mm KCl, and 20 mm Tris-Tricine buffer, pH 7.5. As a control the proteoliposomes were diluted into a buffer of composition identical to the one in their interior. Results were essentially identical when the membrane potential was generated by a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential in a medium with no chloride as described in Ref. 20Lewinson O. Adler J.

The Resistance That EmrE Confers against Monovalent and Divalent Substrates Is Affected Differently by Changes in the External pH—E. coli cells that overexpress EmrE display resistance to a wide variety of toxic lipophilic cations, monovalents such as ethidium and acriflavine, and divalents such as MV2+ (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The growth of E. coli cells carrying plasmids with or without the emrE gene in LB medium containing monovalent or divalent lipophilic cations was compared under various pH conditions (Fig. 1). In the absence of drugs, cells harboring either plasmid grew equally well in the pH range of 7.0–8.4 (data not shown). As expected when the monovalent substrates 125 μm ethidium or 62 μm acriflavine were added to the medium, only cells expressing EmrE were able to grow. At these drug concentrations growth was practically identical in the pH range tested. In contrast, the resistance that EmrE confers against 62 μm of the divalent substrate MV2+ is drastically reduced as the pH increases, and it is abolished above pH 7.6. To further explore the nature of this different sensitivity to pH, a more detailed study was carried out and the IC50 values of the three compounds were determined at the various pH values. The findings are illustrated for two pHs in each case (Fig. 2, A–C) and summarized in Fig. 2, right panels. Ethidium and acriflavine markedly inhibited growth at pH 7.0 and pH 8.4 with a slightly higher potency (about 5-fold) at the more alkaline pH (Fig. 2, A and B, gray lines). At the two pH values, EmrE significantly protected against the toxic effects of both compounds (black lines). In the case of MV2+, the difference between the two pH values is more striking. MV2+ was 15 times more potent at pH 8.4 than at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C, gray lines). The protection conferred by EmrE at pH 8.4 was only slightly evident at the low concentration (black lines). Moreover, at this pH, EmrE induces a reproducible and significant sensitization at the higher concentrations. In Fig. 2, right panels, we can see the systematic decrease of IC50 values for all of the substrates tested at the high pH values. However, whereas the drop in IC50 for ethidium and acriflavine in the presence of EmrE was about 8- and 4-fold, respectively, in its absence there was also an increased toxicity of the compounds, and therefore the protection was still highly significant even at the high pH. On the other hand, for MV2+ IC50 in the presence of EmrE decreased 114-fold in the range between 7.0 and 8.4. In addition, the degree of protection was practically undetectable at the high pH values. Increased sensitivity at higher pHs could be caused by several factors, including higher sensitivity of target and increased uptake and decreased extrusion by EmrE. The latter could be caused by changes in the driving forces for extrusion or in its components. The internal pH of E. coli cells is kept in the range 7.6–7.9 (25Zilberstein D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As a result, as external pH is raised, ΔpH (inside alkaline) drops and even becomes inverted (inside acid) above this pH, whereas Δψ (inside negative) increases (25Zilberstein D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This raises the hypothesis that EmrE can only utilize ΔpH to extrude MV2+ from the cells, suggesting the possibility that transport is electroneutral. Above pH 7.8–8.0, only compounds that are electrogenically transported out of the cell can be removed. In contrast, at high pH, without a significant driving force EmrE may facilitate the entry of compounds that are transported electroneutrally. This can explain the higher sensitivity to MV2+of cells that express EmrE at high pH (Fig. 2C). Therefore, a detailed study of the effect of the components of the proton electrochemical gradient on transport of monovalent and divalent substrates was carried out. EmrE Catalyzes Uptake of TPP+into Proteoliposomes— EmrE catalyzes ΔpH-driven uptake of MV2+ and ethidium into proteoliposomes (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Transport of MV2+ can be measured rapidly and quantitatively using radiolabeled substrate (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Transport of ethidium is followed using an assay based on changes of fluorescence of ethidium upon uptake to proteoliposomes loaded with nucleic acids. This is a convenient assay but only qualitative. Therefore it was necessary to introduce a new assay and we chose to study transport of TPP+, a compound that binds to detergent-solubilized EmrE with nanomolar affinity (11Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We chose TPP+ because of its high affinity and because of the knowledge we have accumulated on its interaction with EmrE (6Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, the driving force was a pH gradient generated by the ammonium diffusion gradient obtained upon dilution of the proteoliposomes prepared in NH4Cl medium into media in which the ammonium was replaced by KCl (10Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A time-dependent accumulation of [3H]TPP+ was observed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmrE (Fig. 3A, black squares). When the pH gradient was abolished by dilution into a medium identical in composition to that inside the proteoliposome, a small rapid association of TPP+ to the proteoliposomes was observed (Fig. 3A, white squares). As shown in Fig. 3B, other substrates of EmrE, like MV2+, ethidium, and acriflavine inhibit the [3H]TPP+ uptake in a concentration range expected from their kinetic properties. In addition DCCD, a carbodiimide that is known to react with carboxyls and inhibits MV2+ uptake and TPP+ binding by EmrE (26Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), also inhibits transport of TPP+ (Fig. 3A, inset). The protein concentrations used in these experiments are at least four times lower than those used to measure MV2+ uptake. When higher concentrations are used, the fraction of TPP+ associated with the proteoliposomes in the absence of a pH gradient increases with the increase in amount of protein (Fig. 4). The gradients of TPP+ generated in the presence of(Δμ˜H+)are practically identical at all protein concentrations, but they become more difficult to detect. At the highest protein concentration used (750 ng) all the TPP+ is bound to EmrE, and therefore no transport can be detected. We conclude that the TPP+ associated with the proteoliposomes in the absence of a pH gradient is bound to EmrE because the binding is inhibited by other substrates (Fig. 4, inset) or by pretreatment of the protein with DCCD (Fig. 3A, inset) (26Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, although not shown, binding is not observed in liposomes with no protein or proteoliposomes prepared with E14C-EmrE, an inactive mutant (11Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A more detailed study comparing the binding properties of TPP+ to the membrane associated and the detergent solubilized protein is now being carried on. Based on the results that demonstrated the ability of EmrE to catalyze uptake of [3H]TPP+ and [14C]MV2+ into proteoliposomes, we can compare the energetics of the uptake of monovalent and divalent substrates.Fig. 4Reconstituted EmrE binds TPP+. Proteoliposomes were reconstituted with the indicated amount of purified EmrE and loaded with ammonium. They were then diluted (3 μl) into an ammonium-free medium (black squares) or ammonium medium (white squares) containing [3H]TPP+. After 2 min, proteoliposomes were filtered on Sephadex G50 columns, and radioactivity incorporated was measured. Inset, [3H]TPP+ binding to ammonium-loaded EmrE proteoliposomes (3 μl) was measured in the presence of substrates of EmrE as specified in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Δψ Drives EmrE-mediated Uptake of TPP+but Not of MV2+—Depending on the proton/substrate stoichiometry of the reaction and the charge on the substrate, exchange of protons with a substrate by antiporters may result in a net movement of electric charges (electrogenic transport) or no net movement of charges (electroneutral transport). Electrogenic transport will be driven by both components (Δψ and ΔpH) of the proton electrochemical gradient ((Δμ˜H+)), but when transport is electroneutral, ΔpH is the primary driving force (27Rudnick G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To determine whether EmrE can utilize Δψ as the driving force for uptake of substrates, we used proteoliposomes where Δψ (positive inside) was generated by imposing a gradient of SCN–, a permeant anion (SCN–in> SCN–out). The results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate EmrE-catalyzed uptake of the monovalent cation TPP+ into proteoliposomes when Δψ (positive inside) is generated (filled squares). TPP+ uptake was abolished with DCCD, a carbodiimide that inhibits TPP+ binding to the protein (data not shown). The TPP+ concentration gradient generated by EmrE about 60-fold is almost identical to the predicted accumulation expected from the SCN– gradient generated by dilution (66-fold) if one charge is moving per transport cycle. TPP+ has been shown to equilibrate across membranes in an unmediated mode in response to electrical potentials and has been used to estimate their magnitudes (29Schuldiner S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5451-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, TPP+ accumulates despite the fact that the potential is positive inside, suggesting that under these conditions the EmrE mediated flux is much faster than the unmediated one. The above findings suggest that, by definition, TPP+ transport is electrogenic, and the stoichiometry of the exchange reaction H+/TPP+ is therefore higher than 1. On"

Because R. rubrum is known to possess volutin granules that accumulate PPi under illumination (18Salih G.F. Nyrén P. Curr. Res.

The number of acidocalcisomes as well as the amount of PPi and polyP significantly increase when the bacteria are grown in light. We also demonstrate that the H+-PPase is predominantly located in the acidocalcisomes of R. rubrum.

Protein determination was carried out by using the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels and then blotted onto nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. Subsequent processing steps were performed in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk, washed three times, and then incubated with polyclonal antibody 326 against Arabidopsis H+-PPase (20Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000), washed three times, and processed for chemiluminiscence detection as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weights were calculated using prestained molecular weight markers. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For subcellular localization of H+-PPase, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed in 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and 50 min at 4 °C, attached to poly l-lysine treated glass slides, and permeabilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 10 min. The samples were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% cold fish gelatin, and 50 mm NH4Cl and were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the polyclonal antibody against the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase (20Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibody against T. cruzi H+-PPase (21Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), diluted 1: 50 (polyclonal) or 1:100 (monoclonal) in 1% cold fish gelatin. Bacteria were subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS plus 1% cold fish gelatin. Coverslips were mounted in glass slides with Vectashield® media and sealed. The images were collected with an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope or an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. For polyP localization, bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in the same buffer and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde. 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg/ml DAPI. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed using the fluorescence microscope (9Seufferheld M. Viera M.C.F. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29971-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For localization of LysoSensor blue DND-167, bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in prewarmed (30 °C) Sistrom medium containing 1 μm LysoSensor. Bacteria were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh prewarmed Sistrom medium. Bacteria were mounted on a slide and observed with the fluorescence microscope using UV excitation. For cycloprodigiosin detection, bacteria were centrifuged, resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS containing 100 nm cycloprodigiosin, and incubated for 30 min. Bacteria were mounted on a slide and observed with the fluorescence microscope using a red emission filter. Bacteria resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS or Sistrom medium, but without cycloprodigiosin or LysoSensor, respectively, were used as controls. For co-localization studies of chromatophore proteins and H+-PPase, polyclonal antibodies against crude membranes of phototropic R. rubrum cells were adsorbed with R. rubrum grown aerobically in the dark, to remove nonspecific antibodies (22Crook S.M. Treml S.B. Collins M.L.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown aerobically were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 1 h followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were then incubated with the antibodies against crude membranes for 45 min at 37 °C and centrifuged, and the antibody that was not adsorbed was collected from the supernatant. For co-localization studies, the cells were incubated 1 h with antibodies diluted 1:20 and with a mouse monoclonal antibody against T. cruzi H+-PPase, diluted 1:50. The cells were subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with rabbit fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:100 and with mouse rodamine-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS plus 1% cold fish gelatin. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum or without the primary antibody. Three-dimensional Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy Reconstruction Analysis of H+-PPase Staining in R. rubrum—Volumetric renderings through a representative bacterial cell were compiled using the average projection ray tracing algorithm (26Drebin, R.

Further image processing was conducted using the ImageJ software tools and Application Programming Interface originally developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institutes of Health (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The voxel signal intensities were normalized (28Russ J.C. The Image Processing Handbook. 2nd Ed. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 151-210Google Scholar) to enable easier discrimination of relative pixel intensities, and a median filter (28Russ J.C. The Image Processing Handbook. 2nd Ed.

Average projections through the xyz plane and the zyx plane were selected to depict the relative signal intensities through the volumetric dataset. Size bars and arrows were applied as overlays to the xyz and zyx images using tools in Adobe Photoshop. Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis—For routine electron microscopy, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed for 1 h with 2.5% grade II glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 0.03% CaCl2, and 0.03% picric acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Bacteria were post-fixed with OsO4 for 45 min and then for 15 min with potassium ferricyanide, washed, and treated with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated by successive incubations of 6 min with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) at room temperature. Epoxy embedding was carried out by resuspending the sample once in 1:1 ethanol/acetonitrile, twice in 100% acetonitrile, then 30 min in 1:1 Epoxy/acetonitrile, 1.5 h in 3:1 Epoxy/acetonitrile, and 4 h in 100% Epoxy. The embedded samples were polymerized for 20 h at 85 °C. Epoxy blocks were ultrathin-sectioned, the sections were deposited on 300-mesh copper grids, and the grids were stained with uranyl acetate for 30 min and triple lead stain (lead citrate, lead nitrate, and lead acetate) for 1 min. For immunocytochemistry, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in a solution containing 0.5% grade I glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 1% picric acid, in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Fixed bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and dehydrated by successive incubations of 6 min each with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 25, 50, 75, 95, 100, and 100%) at -20 °C. The samples were embedded in Unicryl at 4 °C by incubation with 1:1 ethanol/Unicryl for 1 h and 100% Unicryl for 1, 16, and 8 h. The embedded samples were polymerized under UV irradiation at -20 °C for 48 h. Thin sections were collected on 300-mesh nickel grids and blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.5% cold fish gelatin (PBS-TW-FG). The grids were incubated for 3 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody against T. cruzi H+-PPase (21Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) diluted 1:10 in PBS-TW-FG. After washing in PBS-TW-FG, the grids were incubated for 1 h with a 5-nm gold conjugate goat anti-mouse antibody. Subsequently, the grids were washed with PBS and then in distilled water, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Routine and immunocytochemistry samples were observed with a Hitachi H 600 electron microscope. For imaging whole bacteria, the preparations were washed in 0.25 m sucrose, and a 5-μl sample was placed on a Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grid, allowed to adhere for 10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly with a Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV (9Seufferheld M. Viera M.C.F. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29971-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis was done at the Electron Microscopy Center of Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL). The spectra shown are the ones that yielded the most counts in 100 s (of 10 spectra obtained from granules of different bacteria in each preparation), but all other spectra taken from acidocalcisomes of the same preparation were qualitatively similar. Specimen grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Fine probe sizes were adjusted to cover the electron-dense vacuoles (or a similar area of the background), and x-rays were collected for 100 s by utilizing a thin window (Norvar) detector. Analysis was performed by using a Noran Voyager III analyzer with a standardless analysis identification program. Perchloric Acid Extracts—For NMR, bacteria were washed twice with buffer A (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4,50mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and then extracted with ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4 (2 ml/g wet weight cells). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 M KHCO3 (32Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Bailey B.N. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28356-28362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min., the supernatant was separated, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 100 μm prior to adjusting to pH 8. All of the extracts contained 10% D2O (v/v) to provide a field frequency lock. NMR Spectroscopy—Phosphorus NMR spectra were acquired at 303.6 MHz using a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer equipped with a 17.6 Tesla Oxford Instruments magnet. For perchloric acid extracts, 16,384 transients were collected at room temperature using 25-μs (90°) pulse excitation, 20-kHz spectral width, 32,768 data points, and a 5-s recycle time. Inverse-gated proton decoupling was used to remove nuclear Overhauser effect and J-coupling effects. The chemical shifts of all 31P spectra were referenced to 0 ppm using an 85% phosphoric acid external reference (33Van Wazer J.R. Ditchfield R. Burt C.T. Phosphorus NMR in Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 1-23Google Scholar). The specific assignments of individual resonances were initially based on published chemical shifts and 31P-31P scalar couplings (33Van Wazer J.R. Ditchfield R. Burt C.T. Phosphorus NMR in Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 1-23Google Scholar). NMR spectra were processed using the VNMR 6.1B software package (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) running on a Sun Ultra5 (Sun Microsystems, Santa Clara, CA) work station, and included base-line correction, zero filling, and a 3-Hz exponential line broadening prior to Fourier transformation. Acidocalcisomes are recognizable by their strong electron density when observed by electron microscopy in unfixed and unstained whole cell mounts (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using this technique, R. rubrum grown in the dark showed both large and small granules, in different locations of the cells (Fig. 1A, arrows). The large granules have a diameter of ∼205 ± 24 nm. X-ray microanalyses were performed on these granules, and a representative spectrum (Fig. 1B) shows that the counts for phosphorus were ∼3-fold greater than the counts for magnesium, which were approximately the same as the counts for potassium. The counts for oxygen and phosphorus were approximately the same. The medium used to grow R. rubrum in the previous experiments was calcium-deficient, which might explain the lack of detectable levels of calcium in the x-ray microanalyses of the acidocalcisomes (Fig. 1B). To test this idea, we therefore next cultivated bacteria in the presence of 100 mm CaCl2 for4h before preparing them for x-ray microanalysis. Fig. 1C shows that there is a dramatic increase in the counts for calcium as well as a decrease in the counts for magnesium and potassium in the acidocalcisomes of these cells. The presence of these elements was not detected in spectra taken from the background (Fig. 1D) and demonstrates the ability of acidocalcisomes to accumulate calcium. Peaks for copper and in part for carbon arise from the grid. Examination of cells in thin sections showed round vacuoles of ∼200 nm in cells grown both in the light (Fig. 2A, arrowhead) and in the dark (Fig. 2B, arrowhead), clearly different from the chromatophore membranes detected in cells grown in the light (Fig. 2A). As is characteristic of the morphology of acidocalcisomes (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), an electron-dense ring was observed surrounding the apparently empty vacuoles (Fig. 2A, arrowhead). Each intracellular vacuole appeared to be surrounded by a membrane (Fig. 2B, arrowhead). R. rubrum acidocalcisomes (Fig. 2C) showed a sponge-like appearance that is also typical of acidocalcisomes in different organisms (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2141501589,"A possible function of eukaryotic heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) as endogenous danger signal has been controversially discussed in the past. Hsp60 was shown to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in professional antigen-presenting cells and to enhance the activation of T cells in primary stimulation. However, in vitro activation of macrophages by Hsp60 was attributed to contaminating endotoxin in the recombinant Hsp60 protein preparations. Here, we employ low endotoxin recombinant human Hsp60 and murine Hsp60 expressed by eukaryotic cell lines to dissect the Hsp60 protein-mediated effects from biologic effects that are mediated by prokaryotic contaminants in the Hsp60 protein preparation. The induction of tumor necrosis factor-α secretion in mouse macrophages is lost after endotoxin removal and is not mediated by Hsp60 expressed in eukaryotic systems. In contrast, the Hsp60-mediated enhancement of antigen-specific T cell activation does not correlate with endotoxin contamination. Moreover, Hsp60 that is expressed on the surface of different eukaryotic cell lines increases the activation of T cells in primary stimulation. Taken together, we provide evidence that endogenous Hsp60, which is thought to be released from dying infected cells in vivo, has a biological function that is not due to contaminating pathogen-associated molecules.

Pattern recognition receptors represent an ancient family of receptors on professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), 1The abbreviations used are: APC, antigen-presenting cells; HSP, heat shock protein; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PEC, peritoneal exudate cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; OVA, ovalbumin; LAL, Limulus amoebocyte lysate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; EU, endotoxic units. sensing pathogenic infection by the presence of conserved prokaryotic molecules, the so-called pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6190) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the immune system also detects the destruction of tissue that is associated with infection, leading to the expression and release of endogenous danger signals (2Matzinger P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 961: 341-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), e.g. molecules or super-molecular structures that are usually hidden within healthy cells (3Gallucci S. Matzinger P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, ureic acid that is released from injured cells has been identified recently as such an endogenous signal, inducing APC activation and displaying adjuvant activity in vivo (4Shi Y. Evans J.E. Rock K.L. Nature. 2003; 425: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Several members of the conserved heat shock protein (HSP) family have long been suspected to act as danger signals since they are up-regulated and released in response to cellular stress and stimulate immune responses in vivo and in vitro (5Srivastava P.

Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, Hsp60 is located within the mitochondria, where it plays an essential role in folding of imported proteins (10Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 11Heyrovska N. Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been shown, however, that extracellular eukaryotic Hsp60 also induces the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on murine and human APC and the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α (12Chen W.

Since the recombinant Hsp60 protein employed was expressed in Escherichia coli, it may be contaminated with LPS and other prokaryotic molecules. Therefore, it has been crucial to rule out that the biologic activity of these commercially available Hsp60 preparations was due to prokaryotic contaminants. In the past, this question was addressed with several controls, including heat sensitivity and polymyxin B insensitivity of Hsp60 versus LPS (6Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Recent studies have cast doubt on the validity of these controls (22Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S. Haeuw J.F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur.

It was demonstrated that LPS in threshold concentrations does induce TNF-α in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and is sensitive to heat denaturation. Moreover, Hsp60 and Hsp70 protein preparations obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada), once they had been purified from LPS by immobilized polymyxin B, did not induce TNF-α while being fully active as ATPase or chaperones, respectively. This finding led us to reconsider our previous work with recombinant Hsp60. We have shown that the addition of Hsp60 to cultures containing peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEC) and ex vivo purified T cells expressing transgenic MHC class I (25More S.H. Breloer M. von Bonin A. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or MHC class II (26Breloer M. Dorner B. More S.H. Roderian T. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2051-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) restricted TCRs specifically enhanced and accelerated the release of antigen-specific IFN-γ. Here, we employ LPS-depleted recombinant human Hsp60 to differentiate between Hsp60- and LPS-mediated stimulation. Moreover, murine Hsp60 expressed on the surface of different eukaryotic cell lines allows us to investigate the biological activity of Hsp60 independent of not only LPS but of any other prokaryotic molecule. We reproduce the published correlation of LPS contamination in the Hsp60 protein preparations and TNF-α induction in RAW 264.7 cells (23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol.

However, we also demonstrate that Hsp60 still leads to an enhancement of antigen-specific T cell activation in the absence of LPS or any other PAMP. Cell Culture—8–10-week-old female DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice specific for OVA323–339/H-2-Ad (27Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) and BALB/c mice were obtained from the Bundesamt fuer Risikobewertung, Berlin, Germany. RAW 264.7 cells and COS cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and l-glutamine. To induce PEC, BALB/c mice were injected with 500 μl of pristane (Sigma) intraperitoneally and sacrificed 5 days later. PEC were harvested by peritoneal lavage. T cells from DO11.10 transgenic mice (termed DO11.10 T cells hereafter) were purified from spleens via depletion of MHC-II-positive cells by magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hsp60, LPS, and LPS Quantification—E. coli-derived LPS was obtained from Sigma (strain 055:B5, order number L4005). Recombinant murine Hsp60 was obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies, either of unpurified quality (order number SPP 741, lot number 104424) or of “low endotoxin” quality (order number ESP 741, lot number 105402). Recombinant human Hsp60 was obtained from Loke Diagnostics Aps (Risskov, Denmark) (lot number 2003 N7) and termed high endotoxin Hsp60 hereafter. High endotoxin human Hsp60 protein preparations were further purified by EndoTrap endotoxin removal columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (profos, Regensburg, Germany) to generate low endotoxin human Hsp60. Quantification of endotoxin in protein and LPS preparations was performed with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate kit (QCL-1000, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Quantification of protein was performed by Bradford assay and verified by SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain and western blot with specific anti-Hsp60 monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies order number SPA-810). Vector Construction—The Hsp60 cDNA encoding for the mature protein missing the mitochondrial leader sequence was amplified from EL-4 cDNA using the 5′-CGGGCCTATGGCCAAAGATGT-3′ sense and 5′-TGGACAATGACAGCAGTAAACCA-3′ antisense primer and subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The Hsp60 cDNA was then amplified from this vector using the 5′-GCAGATCTGCCAAAGATGTAAAATTTGGTGCG-3′ BglII-sense and 5′-AGGTCGACATAGAACATGCCGCCTCCCAT-3′ SalI-antisense primer that introduce a 5′-BglII and 3′-SalI restriction site and eliminate the internal ATG start and TAA stop codon. The BglII- and SalI-digested PCR product was cloned into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) that fuses the Igκ leader sequence and a hemagglutinin epitope to the N terminus and a myc epitope and the transmembrane region derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor to the C terminus of the encoded protein. To be able to express the protein under the control of different promoters, the cDNA was again amplified from the pDisplay-Hsp60 vector using the 5′-CTAATCTAGAGAACCCACTGCTTACTG-3′ XbaI sense or 5′-ACCCAAGCTTACTGGCTTATCGAAATTAATAC-3′ HindIII sense, respectively, and the 5′-CTGGCATCTAGAAGGCACAGTC-3′ XbaI antisense primer and cloned into the pEF-BOS vector (EF1α promoter) (28Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) and the pFM92 vector (β-actin promoter) (29Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Transfection of Eukaryotic Cell Lines—Transient transfection of COS cells was performed using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 5 μg of DNA and 6 μl of FuGENE reagent were incubated in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI medium at room temperature for 45 min. COS cells were seeded the day before into 6-well culture dishes. The culture medium was exchanged against 2 ml of fresh RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the transfection mix was added for 24 h. The cells were then analyzed by FACS staining using myc epitope or Hsp60-specific antibodies and western blots of cell lysates. Stable transfection of X63 cells was performed by electroporation at 250 mV and 960 microfarad (Bio-Rad) using 1 × 107 cells and 10 μg of ScaI-linearized pFM92 or pFM92-mHsp60 vector DNA. The cells were washed twice in serum-free RPMI medium and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 350 μl of serum-free RPMI medium in the presence of vector DNA before electroporation. After transfection, 450 μl of culture medium (RPMI 10% fetal calf serum) was added for 10 min. The cells were then seeded into four 24-well plates. Stably transfected cells were selected by adding G418 to the culture medium (1.2 μg/ml) the following day. Murine Hsp60-expressing cell clones were detected in a Hsp60-specific FACS staining. FACS Staining—1–2 × 106 cells were stained with specific antibodies against the myc epitope of the recombinant protein (clone 9E10, Upstate Biotechnology, Milton Keynes, UK) or against Hsp60 (SPA806, StressGen Biotechnologies). Fc receptors of cells were blocked with 30 μl of Cohn II fraction (10 mg/ml, Sigma), and 1 μg of specific antibody was added. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were washed, and a phycoerythrin-labeled murine IgG-specific antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was added. Cellular Assays and Cytokine Quantification—All assays were performed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, HEPES, and l-glutamine. For APC activation, RAW 264.7 cells or pristane-induced BALB/c-derived PEC (1 × 105/well) were incubated with the indicated amount of Hsp60 or LPS for 24 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, the indicated amounts of COS cells or X63 cells either transfected with Hsp60 or mock-transfected with the corresponding empty vector were added to the APC culture. TNF-α in the supernatant was detected by standard sandwich ELISA. 96-well Maxisorb plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 8 μg/ml anti-TNF-α (clone MP6XT-22) in 10 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, at 4 °C for 24 h. Plates were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Culture supernatants and a standard of recombinant TNF-α were added to the coated plates and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. After six washes, 1 μg/ml biotinylated anti-TNF-α clone MP6-XT3 was added as detection antibody and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following six washes, a 1:10,000 dilution of streptavidin/peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added for 30 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed six times and developed with 300 μg/ml tetramethylbenzidin, diluted in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, pH 5.5, containing 0.003% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and OD at 450 nm was measured immediately. All antibodies and recombinant TNF-α were obtained from Pharmingen. MHC-II-depleted spleen cells from DO11.10 mice (5 × 104/well) were incubated with syngenic pristane-induced PEC (1 × 105/well) in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml ovalbumin peptide 323–339 to activate T cells. Either the indicated Hsp60 species or LPS or Hsp60- or mock-transfected cell lines were added to this culture. Supernatants from the cultures were collected after 24 h and analyzed for IFN-γ content by ELISA employing IFN-γ DuoSet ELISA development system according to the manufacturer's recommendation (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). No Induction of TNF-α Release from Murine Macrophages by Low Endotoxin Hsp60 —The human recombinant Hsp60 protein used in the experiments contained an endotoxic activity of 22 EU/mg, as determined by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. This high endotoxin preparation was further purified by EndoTrap endotoxin removal columns, thus generating low endotoxin Hsp60 containing 1.6 EU/mg of protein (Fig. 1A). Incubation with LPS or with 10 μg/ml high endotoxin Hsp60 induced TNF-α release in the murine macrophage line RAW 264.7, whereas the same amount of low endotoxin Hsp60 did not induce elevated TNF-α levels (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the comparison of the commercially available recombinant murine Hsp60 from StressGen Biotechnologies revealed that only the endotoxin-contaminated (48 EU/mg) Hsp60 preparation induced TNF-α release in RAW 264.7 cells, whereas the low endotoxin (<3 EU/mg) preparation was biologically inactive (Fig. 1C). The E. coli-derived LPS that we employed (E. coli strain 055:B5) induced TNF-α secretion in RAW 264.7 cells at threshold concentrations between 100 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1C). Since the endotoxic activity of this LPS preparation was determined to be 1 EU/1 ng of LPS (data not shown), the activation threshold for TNF-α induction in RAW 264.7 cells by LPS, being 0.1–1 ng/ml, was equivalent to 0.1 and 1 EU/ml, respectively. Consequently, the TNF-α response to 10 μg/ml high endotoxin human Hsp60, still containing 0.22 EU/ml, can be explained as a response to the contaminating endotoxin. In contrast to cell lines, freshly prepared PEC responded to LPS in concentrations between 10 and 100 ng/ml and were not activated by either high or low endotoxin Hsp60 in concentrations up to 30 μg/ml (data not shown). These results in accordance with previous studies (23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the LPS that is present in the recombinant human and murine Hsp60 preparations induces the observed TNF-α secretion in RAW 264.7 cells. Hsp60 Increases Antigen-specific T Cell Activation Irrespective of the Endotoxin Contamination—We have previously shown that eukaryotic Hsp60 induces the acceleration and enhancement of antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion in naive CD8-positive (25More S.H. Breloer M. von Bonin A. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or CD4-positive (26Breloer M. Dorner B. More S.H. Roderian T. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2051-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) TCR transgenic T cells. To compare the different Hsp60 preparations in this system, we incubated BALB/c-derived PEC together with T cells that had been purified from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice (DO11.10 T cells) in the presence of the chicken ovalbumin (OVA)-derived peptide OVA323–339. As shown in Fig. 2, interaction of the DO11.10 TCR and OVA323–339/MHC-II complexes on the surface of PEC induced IFN-γ secretion in T cells. Since ex vivo-prepared DO11.10 T cells displayed a naive phenotype (26Breloer M. Dorner B. More S.H. Roderian T. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2051-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and encountered the first stimulation, the IFN-γ response in the absence of co-stimulating agents was low (Fig. 2A, medium). The addition of both recombinant human high endotoxin Hsp60 and low endotoxin Hsp60 increased the antigen-specific IFN-γ release 2-fold (Fig. 2A). This Hsp60-mediated increase of IFN-γ secretion did not correlate with the endotoxin contamination of the Hsp60 protein preparation or with the potency of the Hsp60 preparations to induce TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1B). The addition of 100 ng/ml (i.e. 100 EU/ml) of E. coli-derived LPS induced the same increase in IFN-γ secretion by DO11.10 T cells as the addition of Hsp60. In contrast, LPS amounts containing approximately the same endotoxic activity as 10 μg/ml high and low endotoxin Hsp60 preparations (i.e. 0.22 and 0.016/EU ml, respectively) did not induce a significant increase in IFN-γ secretion (1.3-fold and no increase, respectively). Moreover, Fig. 2B shows that in an independent experiment, a comparable increase in IFN-γ secretion of T cells was induced by either the commercially available low endotoxin preparation of recombinant murine Hsp60 (StressGen Biotechnologies, 3.7-fold increase) or the low endotoxin human Hsp60 (Loke Diagnostics, 3.8-fold increase), whereas in the same experiment, 100 pg/ml LPS only led to a 1.5-fold increase of the IFN-γ response. These results suggest that the Hsp60-mediated increase in IFN-γ secretion of naive T cells is not due to contaminating LPS alone and does not correlate with TNF-α induction. However, it is still possible that other PAMPs, which escape recognition in the LAL assay and do not induce TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells, are responsible for the T cell stimulation. To rule out any contribution of prokaryotic contaminants in the Hsp60-mediated T cell activation, we expressed Hsp60 on the surface of eukaryotic cell lines. Transient Expression of Eukaryotic Hsp60 on the Surface of COS Cells—Murine Hsp60 cDNA was cloned as a fusion protein flanked with two model epitopes and containing the transmembrane domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. COS cells were transiently transfected with two different constructs, driven by different promoters (Fig. 3A). Surface expression of Hsp60 was determined by extracellular FACS analysis, detecting both Hsp60 and the inserted model epitope myc (Fig. 3B). Fig. 4 shows that neither Hsp60-positive nor control COS cells induced TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 4A) or in PEC (data not shown). The addition of Hsp60-expressing COS cells to DO11.10 T cells in the presence of OVA-pulsed PEC led to an increase in antigen-specific IFN-γ (Fig. 4B). The COS cells themselves, employed as carriers for Hsp60, stimulated the cultures to some extent since the addition of 1 × 104 mock-transfected COS induced an increase in IFN-γ when compared with cultures with no COS cells added. Nevertheless, the titration of Hsp60-positive COS cells, generated with two different expression constructs (Fig. 3), clearly revealed that both Hsp60-expressing COS cell lines mediate a dose-dependent increase in IFN-γ production when compared with similar numbers of the control COS cells (Fig. 4B). This result demonstrates that murine Hsp60 on the surface of eukaryotic cells mediates an increase in the IFN-γ secretion of T cells.Fig. 4Murine Hsp60 expressed on the surface of COS cells increases the IFN-γ production of DO11.10 T cells.A, LPS (100 ng/ml) or COS cells transiently transfected with the indicated vectors (1 × 104) were cultured with RAW 264.7 (1 × 105) cells for 24 h. TNF-α in the supernatant was determined by ELISA, and error bars show S.D. of triplicates. The result is representative for two independent experiments. B, 5 × 104 DO11.10 T cells were cultured with 1 × 105 BALB/c-derived PEC in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml OVA323–339 peptide. Titrated numbers (as indicated on the x axis) of COS cells transiently transfected either with the empty pFM92 vector (open bars) or with pFM92-mHsp60 (gray bars) or pEF-BOS-mHsp60 (black bars) were added to the culture. Supernatant was harvested 24 h later and analyzed for IFN-γ content by ELISA. Results are shown as means of triplicates, and error bars indicate S.D. Asterisks indicate statistically significant increase of IFN-γ secretion when compared with mock-transfected COS cells employing Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005). The experiment shown is representative for five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stable Expression of Eukaryotic Hsp60 on the Surface of X63 Cells—Because the addition of COS cells into the T cell stimulation assay did induce some increase in cytokine secretion, we employed another eukaryotic cell line as an “Hsp60 carrier.” We expressed murine Hsp60 on the surface of the murine pre-B cell line X63 employing the pFM92-mHsp60 construct described above. Fig. 5A shows the surface expression of Hsp60 on a stably transfected X63 clone (mHsp60#12) by FACS. The addition of these Hsp60-positive X63 cells in the T cell stimulation culture led to an increase in IFN-γ release, whereas the mock-transfected X63 cells displayed no significant stimulatory effect (Fig. 5C). Again, neither Hsp60-positive nor control X63 cells induced TNF-α release in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 5B) or in PEC (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that murine Hsp60 can increase murine T cell activation in the absence of any prokaryotic structure belonging to the group of proinflammatory PAMPs. The question of whether eukaryotic heat shock proteins themselves function as stimulators of the innate immune system or whether contaminating endotoxin is responsible for the immune stimulatory effects has been discussed controversially in the past (6Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study suggest (i) that the TNF-α secretion in macrophages, often employed as readout for Hsp60 stimulation, is due to endotoxin contamination, as suggested by Gao and Tsan (23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and (ii) that the Hsp60-mediated increase in antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion by naive T cells is not due to LPS or other PAMPs. We draw this conclusion from the following evidence. We reproduced previous findings (23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that recombinant Hsp60 failed to stimulate murine macrophages to secrete TNF-α once the contaminating LPS has been depleted below 10 EU/mg of protein. In contrast, human and murine Hsp60 preparations that contained less then 10 EU LPS/mg of protein and did not induce TNF-α release in RAW 264.7 cells or in PEC still increased the IFN-γ secretion in DO11.10 T cells undergoing primary stimulation. An endotoxin contamination below 10 EU/mg of protein will lead to a final amount of 0.1 EU/ml cell culture if the protein is used at 10 μg/ml as done in this study. Although an endotoxin contamination of 0.1 EU/ml has been described as biologically inert to RAW 264.7 cells or dendritic cells by others (22Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S. Haeuw J.F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 317: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out an effect on T cell activation. We addressed this problem by demonstrating that the same amount of LPS that was present in the different Hsp60 preparations failed to show a biologic effect on T cells. However, the endotoxic activity of E. coli-derived LPS may vary with the E. coli strain and with the purity of the LPS preparation employed. The E. coli strain B055:B5-derived LPS employed in this study displays an endotoxic activity of 1 EU/ng of LPS, whereas Gao and Tsan (23Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) describe a highly purified protein-free LPS derived from JM83 E. coli K12, displaying a 3-fold higher endotoxic activity. Thus, the comparison of contaminating LPS in protein preparations with the same amount of purified LPS bears considerable risk of over- or underestimating the LPS amount containing the biologically relevant endotoxic activity corresponding to the protein preparation. Besides LPS, there are other PAMPs to consider that may activate APC through the TLR/IL-1R signaling, such as lipoproteins (21Lee H.K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or CpG-rich DNA (31Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5380) Google Scholar), which are not recognized in the LAL assay. Therefore, it is still possible that these “non-LPS”-PAMPs and not the Hsp60 protein itself mediate T cell activation. To obtain a Hsp60 protein source that is completely free of prokaryotic molecules, we expressed Hsp60 on the surface of eukaryotic cell lines. We did not attempt to purify the protein out of an eukaryotic expression system since that again may lead to contamination with endotoxin or other prokaryotic contaminants. Instead, we chose to employ the eukaryotic cell lines COS and X63 as mostly inert carriers for our target protein. In accordance with the results presented earlier, murine Hsp60 expressed on the surface of both cell lines induced an increase in the antigen-specific IFN-γ response of DO11.10 T cells but did not induce the release of TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells. We recognize that, within our experimental system, one still cannot distinguish whether the Hsp60 protein itself is the stimulating agent or whether it functions as a chaperone for other intracellular molecules that mediate the final increase in antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion of T cells. If Hsp60 chaperones other agents for activation, the expression of Hsp60 in a eukaryotic system proves that these molecules must be of eukaryotic origin, and thus, stimulate T cell responses in the absence of PAMPs. Regarding the mechanism of this Hsp60-mediated T cell activation, our results suggest that Hsp60 enhances T cell activation independently of TNF-α induction in APC, at least above the threshold of a standard ELISA. Moreover, a recent study employing gene expression array analysis of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with recombinant low endotoxin Hsp60 and Hsp70 did not induce the up-regulation of 96 common cytokine genes (30Gao B. Tsan M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This does not exclude a role for these cytokines in the Hsp60-mediated T cell activation since we use freshly prepared peritoneal macrophages as APC in this system. The macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, although responding to much lower doses of LPS and LPS-contaminated Hsp60 preparations with TNF-α release, did not induce the Hsp60-mediated T cell activation (data not shown). Employing the LPS-free murine Hsp60, we will now reevaluate the role of cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and receptors involved in the Hsp60-mediated T cell activation. Endotoxin as a possible source of biologic activity, falsely attributed to HSP, has moved into the focus of the scientific community lately. Regarding other HSP families, it has been demonstrated that Gp96 displays immune stimulatory capacity in the absence of PAMPs since transgenic mice expressing Gp96 on the cell surface develop spontaneous autoimmune diseases (32Liu B. Dai J. Zheng H. Stoilova D. Sun S. Li Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15824-15829Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A murine tumor cell line that was secreting autologous Hsp70 due to forced overexpression proved to be more immunogenic in vivo than the parental cell line (33Wang M.H. Grossmann M.E. Young C.Y. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that murine Hsp60 expressed as a transmembrane protein on the surface of two different eukaryotic cell lines increases the T cell activation in the absence of LPS or PAMPs in vitro. In accordance with our data, it has been shown that skin allografts derived from mice transgenic for autologous Hsp60 displayed accelerated rejection when compared with skin grafts expressing the usual level of endogenous Hsp60 (34Birk O.S. Gur S.L. Elias D. Margalit R. Mor F. Carmi P. Bockova J. Altmann D.M. Cohen I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5159-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is again possible to speculate that Hsp60, among other HSPs, is released from dying cells in vivo and may function as an activator of the innate immune system."

Here, we present evidence that p21 expression increases through PGA2-triggered stabilization of the p21 mRNA and further show that these events require the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Binding experiments using either endogenous p21 mRNA or in vitro-labeled p21 transcripts revealed a specific PGA2-dependent association of the p21 mRNA with the RNA-binding protein HuR. Interestingly, although inhibition of the ERK pathway did not prevent the PGA2-triggered increase in cytoplasmic HuR, it did impair the formation of endogenous and in vitro [HuR-p21 mRNA] complexes and further prevented the PGA2-mediated stabilization of the p21 mRNA, suggesting that ERK-mediated events were required for binding HuR to the p21 mRNA and preventing its decay. RNA interference-based knockdown of HuR abundance further served to demonstrate the contribution of HuR-mediated p21 mRNA stabilization toward enhancing p21 expression after PGA2 treatment. Collectively, our results indicate that PGA2 stabilizes the p21 mRNA through an ERK-independent increase in cytoplasmic HuR levels and an ERK-dependent association of HuR with the p21 mRNA.

Stressful and proliferative stimuli activate complex signaling networks in mammalian cells. Among the ensuing gene regulatory processes, events influencing mRNA stability can effectively alter the profiles of expressed gene products (1Gorospe M. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Wells J. Hunter A.

Best characterized among such RNA sequences are U-rich and AU-rich elements, usually found in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester; CR, coding region; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IP, immunoprecipitation; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; PG, prostaglandin; PPAR, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA. of short-lived mRNAs (5Chen C.Y.

For example, many proto-oncogenes (c-fos, c-myc), cytokines (interferons, interleukins), cell cycle regulatory proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc25, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21), apoptosis-related proteins (bcl-2, cyclooxygenase-2), and growth factors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, vascular endothelial growth factor) are all encoded by mRNAs whose half-lives are regulated under various stressful situations (5Chen C.Y.

Similarly, many RNA-binding proteins have been described that selectively recognize and bind to AU-rich elements of labile mRNAs and regulate their post-transcriptional fate, including tristetraprolin, AUF1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D), KSRP, BRF1, and the Hu/elav (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) proteins (12Brennan C.M.

A number of studies have documented the involvement of the Hu/elav protein HuR in regulating mRNA turnover and translation under situations of stress (12Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

HuR binds with great affinity and specificity to AU-rich elements in a variety of mRNAs, such as those mentioned above (12Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol.

The precise mechanisms regulating HuR function remain to be fully elucidated, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that the subcellular localization of HuR is intimately linked to its function. HuR is predominantly (>90%) localized in the nucleus of unstimulated cells but can be exported to the cytoplasm through the action of CRM1 (and possibly additional factors) and is imported to the nucleus via transportins 1 and 2 (28Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 895-901Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 29Güttinger S. Mühlhäusser P. Koller-Eichhorn R. Brennecke J. Kutay U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several stress-activated signaling pathways have been reported to modulate the cytoplasmic abundance of HuR or its binding ability. Activation of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2, a downstream target of phosphorylation by MAP kinase p38, was found to enhance the cytoplasmic presence of HuR and increase the ability of HuR to bind to and stabilize target mRNAs encoding the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor (31Tran H. Maurer F. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7177-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Heat stress was shown to specifically enhance HuR-mediated export of hsp70 mRNA to the cytoplasm, purportedly through the association of HuR with the protein ligands pp32 and APRIL (32Gallouzi I.-E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Gallouzi I.-E. Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Elevated activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase, an enzyme that participates in the cellular response to metabolic stresses, was found to reduce the cytoplasmic abundance of HuR. Conversely, reductions in AMP-activated protein kinase activity triggered by agents such as irradiation with short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC), increased the cytoplasmic abundance of HuR (34Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Additional stress agents causing an elevation in cytoplasmic HuR levels include the alkylating agent methyl-methane sulfonate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium arsenite and the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Treatment with the stress model agent PGA2 causes growth inhibition associated with the apoptotic death of cultured cells and exhibits anti-tumor activity in vivo (2Fan J. Yang X. Wang W. Wood W.H.

Several microarray-based studies have led to the identification of mRNAs whose transcription and/or steady-state levels are regulated by PGA2 and other cyclopentenone PGs (2Fan J. Yang X. Wang W.

We and others have previously reported several gene expression changes occurring during the PGA2-triggered stress response, including the inhibition of cyclin D1 levels and the potent up-regulation of p21 expression (36Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 45Amici C. Palamara A.T. Santoro M.G. Exp.

Yang X. Brewer G. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the PGA2-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression revealed that PGA2 decreased the stability of the cyclin D1 mRNA, identified a specific 390-base 3′-UTR segment involved in cyclin D1 mRNA decay, and suggested a role for AUF1 in these destabilization events (49Lin S. Wang W. Wilson G.M. Yang X. Brewer G. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we expand on our earlier findings that PGA2 treatment increased cytoplasmic HuR levels and heightened the association of HuR to the p21 3′-UTR (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Using the human non-small cell lung cancer line H1299, we provide a formal demonstration that p21 mRNA is stabilized upon treatment with PGA2. A variety of in vitro and in vivo binding assays provide further evidence that PGA2 increases the association of p21 mRNA-HuR complexes, whereas interventions to reduce HuR indicate that the PGA2-stimulated p21 mRNA stabilization and increased p21 levels require HuR. Finally, our data show that the PGA2-triggered increase in the abundance of these complexes, the heightened stability of the p21 mRNA, and the elevated p21 production are all dependent on the activity of the MAP kinase ERK. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Preparation of Cell Fractions—The human line H1299 (non-small cell lung carcinoma) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cell counts were carried out using a hemacytometer. All experiments were performed using exponentially growing cells. Actinomycin D, staurosporine, and PGA2 were from Sigma. Suramin, AG1478, herbimycin A, genistein, BAPTA-AM, PD98059, and SB202190 were from Calbiochem. U0126 was from Promega, and SP600125 was from Biomol Research Labs, Inc. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For the p21 promoter-reporter assays, transfections were carried out using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid pWWT-luc, a kind gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein (50El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). The transfection of siRNAs (either control or targeting HuR) at a final concentration of 20 nm was carried out using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions; cells were collected for Western blotting or used for mRNA half-life determinations 48 h after transfection. Nuclear Run-on—Assays were performed as described (51Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 μg of PCR-amplified, gel-purified DNA corresponding to each indicated gene was denatured and blotted onto nylon membranes. Nuclei from 2 × 107 H1299 cells were isolated from each treatment group using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and nascent RNAs were labeled by in vitro transcription using reaction buffer (100 mm KCl, 2.5 m MgCl2, 2.5 mm rATP, 2.5 mm rCTP, 2.5 mm rGTP, and 500 μCi [α-32P]UTP) for 30 min at 30 °C; radiolabeled RNA was then isolated using the STAT-60 reagent. Membranes were blocked in 2 ml of hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4× SSC, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 2× Denhardt's Solution, 40% formamide, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 20 μg/ml poly(A), and 2 μg/ml human Cot-1 DNA) containing 100 μg tRNA for 4 h, whereupon radiolabeled RNA (∼2 × 106 cpm per hybridization bottle) was added and hybridized for 72 h at 55 °C. Membranes were then washed extensively at 55 °C with wash buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 15 min). Signals were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Northern blot analysis was carried out using standard methodologies (36Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the detection of the p21 mRNA, cyclin D1 mRNA, and 18 S rRNA oligomers 5′-CTGGGCCGAAGAGGCGGCGGCAGGCCTTGCTGCCGCATGGGTTCTG-3′, 5′-GAGGTTGGCATCGGGGTACGCGCGGCGGATGGTTTCCACTTCGCAGCACAGGAGCTGGTG-3′, and 5′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′, respectively, were end-labeled using [α-32P]dATP and terminal transferase. For the detection of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and gadd153, the corresponding PCR products were labeled using random primers. Northern blotting signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. For mRNA half-life assessments, 3–4 independent experiments were performed. Actinomycin D (2 μg/ml) was added, and total RNA was prepared at the times indicated (Figs. 2, 5, and 9). p21 mRNA half-lives were calculated after measuring p21 mRNA signals on Northern blots, normalizing them to 18 S rRNA signals, plotting the values as logarithmic scales, and calculating the time period required for the p21 mRNA to undergo a reduction to one-half of its initial abundance (before adding actinomycin D).Fig. 5Influence of MAP kinases on the PGA2-mediated induction of p21 mRNA. A, Northern blot analysis of p21 mRNA expression in H1299 cells treated with 45 μm PGA2 for the times shown without any pre-treatment (c) or after pre-treatment for 1 h in the presence of either the ERK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) (U), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) (SP), or the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (20 μm) (SB). 18 S signals served to verify equal loading and transfer of samples. Northern blot analysis of p21 mRNA levels in control incubations with the MAP kinase inhibitors alone (c). p21 mRNA data were obtained from two experiments, normalized to 18 S rRNA signals, and plotted as relative p21 mRNA expression levels (fold difference) compared with untreated cells. B, nuclear run-on assays were performed as explained in the legend of Fig. 2A, and triplicate measurements of the signals (normalized to β-actin signals) were represented as the means ± S.E.

C, forty-eight hours after the indicated siRNA transfections, cells were treated with PGA2 for 12 h or were left untreated, whereupon p21 mRNA half-life was assessed as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2C. In panels B and C, data represent the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For Western blotting, whole-cell (15 μg), cytoplasmic (20 μg), or nuclear (5 μg) lysates, prepared as described (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. HuR was detected with a monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz, p21 with a monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, β-actin with a monoclonal antibody from Abcam, phosphorylated ERK (ERK1, ERK2) with a polyclonal antibody from Cell Signaling, and β-tubulin, histone deacetylase 2, and total ERK (ERK1, ERK2) with polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz. Following secondary antibody incubations, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Synthesis of Labeled Transcripts—Complementary DNA, prepared from total RNA extracted from H1299 cells, was used as the template for PCR amplification of different mRNA regions of p21. All 5′-oligonucleotides contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence 5′-CCAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′ (T7) and, therefore, the resulting PCR fragments served as templates for the synthesis of corresponding RNAs. Transcription reactions were carried out in the presence of either [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) or biotinylated CTP (Sigma). Radiolabeled transcripts were used at a specific activity of 100,000 cpm/μl (2–10 fmol/μl) for RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA) analysis, whereas biotinylated transcripts were used for pull-down assays, as described (10Wang W. Lin S. Caldwell C.M. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). REMSA, REMSA Supershift, UV Cross-linking, and Biotin Pulldown Binding Assays—For analysis of the binding of endogenous proteins to radiolabeled transcripts, REMSA assays were carried out as described previously (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For REMSA supershift analysis, 4 μg of antibody was incubated with lysates for 1 h on ice before the addition of radiolabeled RNA; all subsequent steps were as described for REMSA analysis. The IgG1 antibody used in the supershift assays was from BD Pharmingen. For cross-linking experiments, RNase T1-treated RNA-protein mixtures were exposed to UV light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and then electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were subsequently dried, and radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager. For biotin pull-down assays, 6 μg of biotinylated transcripts was incubated with 120 μg of cytoplasmic lysate for 30 min at 25 °C. Complexes were isolated with paramagnetic streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway), and pull-down material was analyzed by Western blotting. Ca2+Measurement—H1299 cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4/AM (20 μm for 30 min at room temperature; Molecular Probes) and incubated with PGA2 (0–60 μm) diluted in Hepes-buffered solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 15 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Confocal images were obtained every 2 min using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) in the frame scan (xy) mode. Data are reported as F/F0, where F0 refers to basal fluorescence intensity prior to PGA2 treatment. Image processing and presentation were performed using IDL 5.5 software (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, CO). All measurements were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C). Immunoprecipitation (IP) Followed by Reverse Transcription (RT) and Real Time PCR—For IP of endogenous RNA-protein complexes, whole-cell (1 mg) lysates were incubated (2 h, 4 °C) with a 50% (v/v) suspension of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) that had been pre-coated with 30 μg of either IgG1 (BD Pharmingen) or anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were washed using NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), incubated with 100 μl of NT2 buffer containing 20 units of RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 30 °C, washed with NT2 buffer, and further incubated in 100 μl of NT2 buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (15 min at 55 °C). RNA was extracted and precipitated in the presence of GlycoBlue (Ambion). The presence of p21 and GAPDH mRNAs in the IP materials was assessed by using the sequence-specific primer pairs 5′-GGGGAAGGGACACACAAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-AATGAACTGGGGAGGGATGG-3′ for the p21 PCR product and 5′-CAGGTGGTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACA-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTCTCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCT-3′ for the GAPDH PCR product. Increased Expression of p21 in Response to PGA2 Treatment Occurs through Enhanced mRNA Stability—In keeping with earlier reports (49Lin S. Wang W. Wilson G.M. Yang X. Brewer G. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), treatment of H1299 cells with PGA2 caused a rapid and potent cessation of growth (Fig. 1A) associated with changes in the expression of cell cycle-associated genes. Expression of cyclins A, B1, and D1 was reduced following PGA2 treatment, whereas expression of the growth suppressors p21 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and gadd153 (a growth- and DNA damage-inducible gene) was elevated, as detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). A direct assessment of transcription rates by a nuclear run-on assay revealed that the changes in steady-state levels of the mRNAs encoding p21 or cyclins A, B1, and D1 were unlikely to arise from altered gene transcription, because transcription rates were unaffected by PGA2 treatment, as reported previously for cyclin D1 (49Lin S. Wang W. Wilson G.M. Yang X. Brewer G. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); the transcriptional up-regulation of gadd153 served as positive control (Fig. 2A). The regulation of p21 expression was examined in greater detail. The transcriptional activity of the p21 promoter in H1299 cells, assessed using a luciferase-based reporter assay, did not change significantly following PGA2 treatment (Fig. 2B). Instead, assays were carried out to measure the half-life of the p21 mRNA by monitoring the rate of p21 mRNA clearance in H1299 cells where transcription was halted by actinomycin D treatment. These experiments revealed that PGA2 treatment markedly increased the stability of the p21 mRNA from an apparent half-life of 4.2 h in untreated populations to one of 8 h in PGA2-treated cells (Fig. 2C). These observations are consistent with the notion that PGA2 treatmen"
https://openalex.org/W2031312781,"We previously reported on a new boiling stable protein isolated from aspen plants (Populus tremula), which we named SP1. SP1 is a stress-related protein with no significant sequence homology to other stress-related proteins. It is a 108-amino-acid hydrophilic polypeptide with a molecular mass of 12.4 kDa (Wang, W. X., Pelah, D., Alergand, T., Shoseyov, O., and Altman, A. (2002) Plant Physiol.130, 865-875) and is found in an oligomeric form. Preliminary electron microscopy studies and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry experiments showed that SP1 is a dodecamer composed of two stacking hexamers. We performed a SDS-PAGE analysis, a differential scanning calorimetric study, and crystal structure determination to further characterize SP1. SDS-PAGE indicated a spontaneous assembly of SP1 to one stable oligomeric form, a dodecamer. Differential scanning calorimetric showed that SP1 has high thermostability i.e. Tm of 107 °C (at pH 7.8). The crystal structure of SP1 was initially determined to 2.4 Å resolution by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method from a crystal belonging to the space group I422. The phases were extended to 1.8 Å resolution using data from a different crystal form (P21). The final refined molecule includes 106 of the 108 residues and 132 water molecules (on average for each chain). The R-free is 20.1%. The crystal structure indicated that the SP1 molecule has a ferredoxin-like fold. Strong interactions between each two molecules create a stable dimer. Six dimers associate to form a ring-like-shaped dodecamer strongly resembling the particle visualized in the electron microscopy studies. No structural similarity was found between the crystal structure of SP1 and the crystal structure of other stress-related proteins such as small heat shock proteins, whose structure has been already determined. This structural study further supports our previous report that SP1 may represent a new family of stress-related proteins with high thermostability and oligomerization.

Stable protein 1 (SP1), 1The abbreviations used are: SP1, stable protein 1; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; EM, electron microscopy; sHsp, small Hsp. which we previously isolated from aspen plants (Populus tremula) (2Pelah D.

Physiologia Plantarum. 1997; 99: 153-159Crossref Google Scholar), is a boiling stable, stress-responsive protein with no significant sequence homology to other stress-related proteins (5Dure L.

SP1 cDNA encodes a 12.4-kDa hydrophilic polypeptide having no cysteine or potential glycosylation sites (1Wang W.X. Pelah D. Alergand T. Shoseyov O. Altman A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis and the N-terminal sequence of SP1 revealed that SP1 is a homooligomeric protein composed of 12 subunits that are tightly bound to each other even under extreme conditions. Similar to native SP1, recombinant SP1 produced in both Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris assembles spontaneously to a multimeric stable complex (8Wang W. Vinocur B. Shoseyov O. Altman A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). Environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, or heat, induce specific genes in higher plants. Plants inherently possess various molecular-biochemical mechanisms by which they can cope with such stresses (6Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 9Hoekstra F.A. Golovina E.A. Buitink J.

One of the mechanisms that may confer such tolerance is the activation of a large set of genes that leads to the accumulation of specific proteins in the cells. Several families of proteins have been identified as stress-induced proteins (8Wang W. Vinocur B. Shoseyov O. Altman A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). The small heat shock protein (Hsps) family is the major type of stress-induced proteins and is believed to exert cellular protection during stress (5Dure L. II I Plant J. 1993; 3: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 11Wang W. Vinocur B. Altman A. Planta. 2003; 218: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). Hsps are molecular chaperones that are characterized by their ability to selectively recognize and bind to misfolded proteins. They possess high thermostability and create oligomers spontaneously. Attempts to identify the factors responsible for the high thermostability of proteins have included sequence and structural comparisons of homologous proteins from mesophile, thermophile, and hyperthermophile organisms (12Wintrode P.L. Arnold F.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 55: 161-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem.

These comparisons have shown that proteins isolated from thermophile organisms have a better internal packing of non-polar groups, more hydrogen bonds, and more ion pairs than homologous proteins isolated from mesophiles Here we performed a thermostability study of SP1 using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method, and we also determined the crystal structure of SP1 at 1.8 Å resolution. The DSC study showed a Tm of 107 °C for SP1, which supports our previous finding that the SP1 is a boiling stable protein. The crystal structure of SP1 was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.4%. The SP1 monomer has a ferredoxin-like fold or an α/β structure of four β-strands and three α-helices. Monomers of SP1 assemble into a dimer via their hydrophobic interface. The hydrophobic inner core and dimer interface probably contribute to the enhanced thermostability of SP1 as well as its oligomerization. Sequence and structural comparisons between SP1 and other stress-related proteins, such as small Hsp (sHsp), suggest that SP1 represents a new class of stress-related proteins. SP1 samples (wild type and recombinant) were purified as reported earlier (1Wang W.X. Pelah D. Alergand T. Shoseyov O. Altman A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Wild-type SP1 samples (10 mg/ml) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using sample buffer (SB, containing 2% SDS) with or without boiling treatment (10 min). The low molecular weight band (which corresponds to the monomeric form of SP1) was electro-eluted from the SDS-PAGE and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 0.025% SDS. This low molecular band protein sample was subjected again to SDS-PAGE using SB with or without boiling treatment. Solutions of recombinant SP1 (24 μmol in a sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) were scanned with a Microcal VP-DSC-ER calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 60 degree/h-1. The data was analyzed using the 5.0 software supplied by the DSC manufacturer. The data was analyzed using Origin 5.0 software (MicroCal). Crystallization experiments were carried out at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method with VDX-24 tissue culture plates (Hampton HB3-140). Droplets of the protein solution containing 7 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2 were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution of 20% polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl. Crystals appeared within a few days and were grown to their maximal size in 2 weeks. These crystals belong to the space group I422 with unit cell a = b = 90.50 Å, c = 186.30 Å (17Wang W. Dgany O. Dym O. Altman A. Shoseyov O. Almog O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). New crystals with different morphology appeared within the same droplet after 3 weeks. These new crystals belong to the P21 space group with unit cell of a = 97.03 Å, b = 94.75 Å, c = 168.03 Å, β = 90.11°. Selenium-methionine crystals were also crystallized in the I422 space group with unit cell a = b = 90.75 Å, c = 186.41 Å. All the data used for solving and refining the structure were collected on the SSRL wiggler beamline 9-2, using a 2 × 2 area detector systems corporation charge-coupled device detector. Both the native and selenium-methionine crystals were transferred from the mother liquor to the cryoprotectant (13% glycerol and 87% mother liquor). After a few seconds, the crystals were scooped up in a cryoloop and exposed to a cold nitrogen stream (Oxford Instruments), where they were rapidly frozen to ∼100 K. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected on selenium-methionine crystals belonging to the space group I422. The data were collected at three wavelengths around the selenium absorption edge (see Table I). Native data was collected from the tetragonal and monoclinic crystals.Table IData processing and merging statistics Open table in a new tab All the data (three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and two native data sets) were integrated with the MOSFLM program package (18Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 27-38Google Scholar). The data were scaled and merged using SCALA (19Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar, 20Evans P.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1771-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structure factor amplitudes were calculated using the TRUNCATE program (19Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar, 21French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-524Crossref Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Data statistics derived from data processing are shown in Table I. Tetragonal Structure—The phases for the selenium-methionine data were calculated with SOLVE-RESOLVE. Six selenium sites were located for three selenium-methionine found in SP1 sequence. Because the Mathews coefficient (22Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) was very high for two copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit, it was assumed that there were three molecules and that the N-terminal methionine was disordered. A trimer in the asymmetric unit resulted in a Mathews coefficient of 2.8 for a solvent content of 56% of the unit cell volume. The mean experimental figure of merit was 0.34-2.4 Å. The non-proper non-crystallographic symmetry operations relating the monomers could be estimated from the selenium sites. The CCP4 program DM (23Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) was used for refining the non-crystallographic symmetry operations and averaging and extending the phases to the native data set resolution. The model was built into the map calculated with these modified phases. Monoclinic Structure—The structure in the space group P21 was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the I422 crystal form. Attempts to solve the structure using one to three copies of the molecule refined in the I422 space group as a search model failed. Previous EM studies showed that SP1 has a ring-like shape with a central cavity. EM studies also revealed oligomers possessing significant homogeneity in shape and size, which clearly demonstrated a 6-fold symmetry of the SP1 particle along the axis of the ring. 2O. Dgany, A. Gonzalez, O. Sofer, W. Wang, G. Zolotnitsky, A. Wolf, Y. Shoham, A. Altman, S. G. Wolf, O. Shoseyov, and O. Almog, unpublished data. It was then noticed that the dodecamer formed by the three molecules in the I422 asymmetric unit and nine additional molecules related to the first three by the I422 symmetry operations -x, 1 - y, z; y - 0.5, x + 0.5,- z + 0.5; and -y + 0.5, -x + 0.5, -z + 0.5 had a pseudo 6-fold axis and a shape and size resembling the particles in the EM studies. Using this dodecamer as a search model yielded a clear solution for the P21 structure using the program MOLREP (19Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar, 24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). Two dodecamers were found in the P21 asymmetric unit (Matthews coefficient 2.7). Model Refinement—Both the tetragonal and monoclinic models were refined with the program REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) using a maximum likelihood target (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). The geometry was restrained to the standard Engh and Huber values (34), using the maximum likelihood target. The non-crystallographic symmetry and, in the case of the I422 structure, the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction experimental phases, were also used as additional restraints. Restrained refinement was preceded by translation, liberation, and screw rotation parameters refinement (25Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were generated before refinement in their riding positions and used for geometry and structure factor calculations. Automatic water molecule searching was carried out using automated refinement of protein crystallography (26Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). After refinement, the fit of the model to the electron density was inspected using difference Fourier density maps 2mFo - DFc and mFo - DFc, where Fo and Fc are the scaled observed and calculated structure factors, m is the figure of merit, and D is an estimate of the error in the partial structure from coordinate errors (27Luzzati P.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1953; 6: 142-152Crossref Google Scholar). These coefficients were calculated by REFMAC. The results of the refinement and the stereochemical analysis of the model, carried out with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), are summarized in Table II. The final refined models have been deposited in the PDB with the code 1SI9 for the I422 crystal form and the code 1TR0 for the P21 crystal form.Table IISummary of the refinement for the P21 and I422 modelsI422 modelRefined residues106Solvent atoms441Glycerol1Ramachandran most favored region94-91Ramachandran allowed region5-2Ramachandran generously allowed region0Ramachandran disallowed region0R-factor (all reflections, work + free set0.209R-factor (highest resolution bin)0.320Reflections in free set910R-factor (free set)0.258R-factor (free set in highest resolution bin)0.341Correlation coefficient (all reflections)0.949Correlation coefficient (free set)0.931Overall coordinate e.s.u.aBased on maximum likelihood target R=Σ(|Fo|−|Fc|)/Σ|Fo|. e.s.u., estimated standard uncertanties.0.232Overall B e.s.u.aBased on maximum likelihood target R=Σ(|Fo|−|Fc|)/Σ|Fo|. e.s.u., estimated standard uncertanties.10.259P21 modelRefined residues106Solvent atoms3179Glycerol1Ramachandran most favored region91-94Ramachandran allowed region2-5Ramachandran generously allowed region0Ramachandran disallowed region0R-factor (all reflections, work + free set)0.164R-factor (highest resolution bin)0.231Reflections in free set13491R-factor (free set)0.202R-factor (free set in highest resolution bin)0.250Correlation coefficient (all reflections)0.963Correlation coefficient (free set)0.940Overall coordinate e.s.u.aBased on maximum likelihood target R=Σ(|Fo|−|Fc|)/Σ|Fo|. e.s.u., estimated standard uncertanties.0.079Overall B e.s.u.aBased on maximum likelihood target R=Σ(|Fo|−|Fc|)/Σ|Fo|. e.s.u., estimated standard uncertanties.2.623a Based on maximum likelihood target R=Σ(|Fo|−|Fc|)/Σ|Fo|. e.s.u., estimated standard uncertanties. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the results of a SDS-PAGE analysis of wild-type SP1 isolated from aspen plants. Fig. 1, lane 1 shows wild-type SP1 without boiling treatment as one high molecular band, which may correspond to the SP1 dodecamer. After boiling for 10 min the SP1 dodecamer dissociates to a lower molecular weight band which may correspond to the monomeric form of SP1 (Fig. 1, lane 2). This monomeric form of SP1 was electro-eluted and subjected again to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1, lane 3 shows that the electro-eluted SP1 spontaneously reassembled to the same high oligomeric form, and upon boiling it dissociated to its low oligomeric form. The SP1 dodecamer dissociated only upon boiling in the presence of 2% SDS; however it reassembled spontaneously to a dodecamer. Fig. 2 shows a DSC study of SP1 resulting in a Tm of 107 °C for SP1. These results further support our previous findings that SP1 is a boiling stable protein and that the high oligomeric form dissociate only upon boiling treatment in the presence of 2% SDS.Fig. 2DSC scan of SP1 indicating Tm for SP1 of 107 °C, which further supports evidence that SP1 is a boiling stable protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Monomer—The maximum average root mean square displacement between the monomers in the asymmetric unit is less than 0.20 Å (0.43 Å for the tetragonal model), which indicates an overall high similarity between all the SP1 molecules, although some side chains in surface loops could be modeled in different conformations in different molecules. The protein chain has an α and β folding with three α-helices, H1 (residues 23-39), H2a (residues 74-81), and H2b (residues 84-93), and a β-sheet formed by four antiparallel β-strands, B3 (residues 9-17), B1 (residues 45-50), B2 (residues 65-71), and B4 (residues 97-108). Secondary structure characterizations were carried out using the PROCHECK software package (28Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The N-terminal segment points toward the solvent and is mobile as evidenced by the lack of interpretable electron density for the first two residues and the large temperature factors for Thr-3 and Lys-4. The long loop formed by residues 51-64 is largely unstructured. This loop projects away from the molecule and is involved in dimer contacts. Helices H1 and H2 define an external convex surface with numerous hydrophilic and acidic side chains facing toward the solvent. The inner side of this surface and the opposing β-sheet enclose a hydrophobic central cavity rich in aromatic and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 4). Most of the phenylalanines in the SP1 molecule occupy this cavity (Phe-17, -46, -67, -71, -89, and -93). Trp-48 and Tyr-33, Tyr-63 and Tyr-80, together with the two histidines (His-11 and His-65), and Arg-100 block access of the solvent to the cavity. There are three waters buried in the central core of the monomer that also play a role in molecule stability. Wat125 forms three hydrogen bonds, one with Tyr-33 OH of helix H1 and the other two hydrogen bonds with Phe-67 O and Ser-69 O-γ of strand B2. Wat561 and Wat921 form an additional bridge between Tyr-33 O and Ser-69 O-γ. However, such non-hydrophobic interactions are rare in this hydrophobic pocket. The Dimer—The dimer appears to be the smallest stable SP1 unit. The two molecules in the dimer are related by a 2-fold axis parallel to helix H1 and β-strands B3 and B4 (Fig. 5). The outer surface of the β-sheets of the two molecules forms a β barrel-like structure, defining a central pore. At one end of the pore, the loop comprising the residues 51-64 bridges the gap between the two B4 strands in the dimer. The center of the pore is closed to the solvent by a barrier of hydrophobic side chains in B3 and B4 (Leu-14, Leu-101, Ile-103, and Tyr-105) and Tyr-63. The side chains of residues Asn-47, Ser-45, Thr-70, Leu-8, and Leu-107 occupy the surface at the end of the pore closer to the N termini. Glu-68 is an important residue in creating stable dimers of SP1. Glu-68 side chain carboxylate forming hydrogen bonds to Lys-10 NZ and to the Tyr-105 side chain OH group of the opposite molecule (see Fig. 6). This residue is conserved in other proteins with the same fold as SP1. Water 5 mediates a dimeric contact bonding Phe-106 N and Thr-50 N in neighboring monomers.

These contacts take place mainly along the B1, H1, and the N-terminal tails. The complete list of direct interdimeric contacts is given in Table IV. As a result of the interdimeric interactions six dimers create a ring-like structure around a pseudo 6-fold axis. The ring-like structure of the dodecamers has an outer radius of ∼50 Å and an inner radius of ∼15 Å (Fig. 7). The loop including residues 18-22 in each dimer protrudes toward the solvent, whereas the arms of the N-terminal are extending toward the inner part of the ring-like structure (Fig. 7). The 6-fold symmetry is broken, because the contacts between equivalent molecules in neighboring dimers are not identical.Table IVContacts between a dimer (molecules A and B) and its two new neighboring dimers (molecules C and D to its right and molecule K and L to its left)Neighboring dimer contactDistance (Å)Molecule AThr-5 NLys-44 O (mol.

K)2.9 Open table in a new tab In Fig. 8 the EM density map is superimposed on top of the crystal structure of a dodecamer. The high density regions of the EM map correspond to regions that are mainly α-helixes and are related to each other by the same pseudo 6-fold axis. The similarity of the dodecamer to the particles seen in EM studies (Fig. 8) and the fact that this arrangement is observed in different crystal space groups with no intrinsic 6-fold symmetry suggest strongly that the dodecamer is the biological unit active form of SP1. The Interdodecamer Contacts—In the P21 space group the dodecamers are stacked in perpendicular interleaving layers (see Fig. 9, a and b). The interdodecamer interactions take place between dodecamers in perpendicular planes. There are water molecules that mediated hydrogen bonds between solvent-facing side chains in loop 16-22 of one dodecamer and the external surface of the dimer defined by a β-barrel in a neighboring dodecamer. There are also hydrophobic interactions that involve aliphatic side chains in the external loops. These contacts involve different residues for each SP1 molecule in the dodecamer, which explains the breakdown of the 6-fold symmetry in the crystal forms. The crystal structure of SP1 indicated strong hydrophobic interactions between two monomers that created a very stable dimer. With the exception of the N-terminal residues, the main chain of the protein was well defined into the electron density map, and no substantial differences, other than a better accuracy of the P21 model arising from the higher resolution of the diffraction and higher non-crystallographic symmetry, could be found between the molecules in the two different space groups. Our results showed that SP1 belongs to the α+β protein class with ferredoxin-like fold composed of an α+β-sandwich with an antiparallel β-sheet. Two molecules of SP1 form a dimer. This dimer belongs to the superfamily of dimeric α+β-barrels in which the two β-sheets form a β-barrel. SP1 like other proteins in this family may assemble into higher order oligomers. Proteins with the above mentioned dimeric α+β-barrel folding include monooxygenase isolated from Streptomyces coelicolor (PDB entry 1LQ9) (ActVA-Orf6 (29Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)), TT1380 isolated from Thermus thermophilus (PDB entry 1IUJ), and Arabidopsis thaliana stress-related protein (PDB entry 1Q4R). In all of these cases, the B4 strand in one molecule creates hydrophobic interactions with the β-2 strand of the neighbor monomer, which results in a stable dimer. It is reasonable to assume that strong dimer interactions contribute to protein stability under extreme conditions. However, monooxygenase isolated from S. coelicolor was not reported to have high thermostability and was found to be active in its dimeric form. The structural similarity of SP1 to TT1380 from T. thermophilus together with the apparent high Tm of SP1 (107 °C) implies that these proteins may use a ferredoxin-like fold as a scaffold for hyperthermostability and that they are evolutionally related. In addition to the thermostability of SP1 gained by creating dimers, it is possible that the assembly of dimers to dodecamers may also contribute to the high thermostability of SP1. Although the relationship between the degree of oligomerization and Tm is not yet clear (30Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), it is still possible that oligomerization contributes to the stability of SP1. Thermostable dodecamers as found for SP1 are rather rare for proteins with a ferredoxin-like fold. Most thermostable oligomers of this family of proteins are found in the range of monomers to tetramers (30Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 31Clantin B. Tricot C. Lonhienne T. Stalon V. Villeret V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of SP1 (Fig. 10) with proteins of ferredoxin-like fold such as A. thaliana At3g17210 stress-related protein and ActVA-Orf6 monooxygenase indicated a conserved region between SP1 and At3g17210 at residues 62-74 (GYTHXFESTFESK). This region corresponds to the region of the β-2 strand, which borders the helices 2 and 3 deep cavity, and it may have an important role in the function of these two proteins by serving as the active site in a way similar to that found for ActVA-Orf6 monooxygenase (17Wang W. Dgany O. Dym O. Altman A. Shoseyov O. Almog O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the sequence similarity in this region found between monooxygenase and the above mentioned proteins is low. However this loop is the interdimer contact region as found for SP1, and it may also play a role in preserving the stability of SP1 (see Glu-68 role in dimer contacts). Because SP1 may have some functional similarity to the small heat shock proteins family (sHsp) (i.e. it is stress-related and has high thermostability), we compared its structure to the only two sHsp crystal structures analyzed thus far, sHsp16.9 isolated from wheat (32van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and sHsp16.5 isolated from Methanococcus jannaschii (33Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). These two sHsps have high amino acids sequence similarity between them and belong to the α-crystallin family. High structural similarity was found between the monomers of these two sHsps, and both monomers have a similar β-sandwich fold. In addition, both sHsps assemble to an oligomeric form. Hsp16.9 was found in an oligomeric form of a dodecamer composed of two stacking hexamers in which each hexamer is composed of three dimers, and the Hsp16.5 oligomer was found to be a hollow spherical complex composed of 24 units. Nevertheless no amino acid sequence similarity exists between SP1 and these two sHsps. Radical differences also were found in the crystal structure of the SP1 and the two sHsps, indicating that SP1 does not belong to the conserved sHsps family. This may suggest that SP1 may be representing a different family of proteins with unique thermostability and a different function in stress protection. Based on the present structural study of SP1 we can conclude that SP1 thermostability is a result of several factors. 1) SP1 has a ferredoxin-like fold, which was found in other studies to be a fold of several other thermostable proteins; 2) monomers of SP1 assemble into a stable dimer via a double hydrogen bond of residue Glu-68; 3) hydrophobic residues create interactions found in each inner core of the monomers and at the dimer interface; and 4) dimers form high oligomeric forms of SP1, such as a dodecamer, via additional interactions between the dimers."

Structure-function studies indicate that the replication initiator comprises four domains. Based on the structural similarity of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA to other AAA+ proteins that are oligomeric, it was proposed that Domain III functions in oligomerization at oriC (Erzberger, J. P., Pirruccello, M. M., and Berger, J. M. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 4763–4773). Because the Box VII motif within Domain III is conserved among DnaA homologues and may function in oligomerization, we substituted conserved Box VII amino acids of E. coli DnaA with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of this motif. All mutant proteins are inactive in initiation from oriC in vivo and in vitro, but they support RK2 plasmid DNA replication in vivo. Thus, RK2 requires only a subset of DnaA functions for plasmid DNA replication. Biochemical studies on a mutant DnaA carrying an alanine substitution at arginine 281 (R281A) in Box VII show that it is inactive in in vitro replication of an oriC plasmid, but this defect is not from the failure to bind to ATP, DnaB in the DnaB-DnaC complex, or oriC. Because the mutant DnaA is also active in the strand opening of oriC, whereas DnaB fails to bind to this unwound region, the open structure is insufficient by itself to load DnaB helicase. Our results show that the mutant fails to form a stable oligomeric DnaA-oriC complex, which is required for the loading of DnaB.

Our results show that the mutant fails to form a stable oligomeric DnaA-oriC complex, which is required for the loading of DnaB. Chromosomal DNA replication is initiated by DNA-binding proteins, which first recognize replication origins and then assemble the enzymatic machinery that functions at each replication fork (reviewed in Refs. 1Messer W.

Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, DnaA mediates replication fork assembly for bidirectional fork movement by first binding to each of the five DnaA boxes of oriC (4Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A.

Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for unwinding because DnaA bound to the nonhydrolyzable analogue ATPγS 1The abbreviation used is: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). is also active. DnaA next recruits two DnaB-DnaC complexes (one for each replication fork) to the unwound region of oriC to form an intermediate named the prepriming complex (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After the release of DnaC from the complex, the helicase activity of DnaB enlarges the unwound region of oriC to position the helicase at the apex of each replication fork (10LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6877-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the movement of DnaB in this initial phase and subsequently, primase interacts transiently with the helicase to synthesize primers at multiple sites on the parental DNA (12Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme at the fork extends these primers to synthesize the leading and lagging strands concurrently in duplication of the bacterial chromosome (13Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Remarkably, DnaA is structurally comparable with archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that the initiation of DNA replication in all organisms is mechanistically similar. As added support of the similarity, the origin recognition complex and Cdc6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are functionally equivalent to E. coli DnaA, respectively recognizing yeast replication origins and recruiting the minichromosome maintenance complex, the putative replicative helicase, to form the pre-initiation complex (reviewed in Ref. 15Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because DnaA protein regulates chromosomal DNA replication at the initiation stage, its role in initiation has been the subject of numerous studies (reviewed in Refs. 1Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kaguni J.M. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 145-157PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). On the basis of the comparison of the primary sequence of 67 eubacterial DnaAs, the replication initiator comprises four domains (see Fig. 1; reviewed in Ref. 14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Domain I, proximal to the N terminus, is moderately conserved, and distinct subdomains function in oligomerization and in the recruitment of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex to oriC (see Fig. 1) (16Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Domains I and III are separated by Domain II of the nonconserved sequence. Domain III is highly conserved and contains the Walker A and B box motifs, which function in ATP binding, and also contains Sensor I, Sensor II (Box VIII), and Box VII motifs shared by the AAA+ family of ATPases (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Within Box VII, a conserved arginine at position 281 of E. coli DnaA may enable the protein to sense whether ATP or ADP, formed by nucleotide hydrolysis, remains bound to coordinate ATP hydrolysis to a conformational change. In comparison, many oligomeric AAA+ proteins, such as HsIU and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, bind ATP within a bipartite binding site formed between adjacent protomers (reviewed in Ref. 19Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, DnaA may bind ATP via a similar structure. Domain IV near the C terminus functions in binding to the DnaA box sequence (20Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Blaesing F. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A homology model of E. coli DnaA has been derived from the crystal structure of Domains III and IV of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Domain IV carries a winged helix DNA binding motif in which amino acids in a loop preceding an α-helix make specific contacts with nucleotides in the DnaA box sequence (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Nureki O. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Katayama T. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As described above, a model was proposed whereby arginine 281 within the Box VII motif sensed the state of the bound adenine nucleotide via its interaction with the γ-PO4 of ATP (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This model leads to two predictions. First, mutant proteins of the Box VII motif should retain the ability to bind ATP and thus be able to unwind oriC. Second, because the unwound region of oriC is speculated to be sufficient for the binding of two hexamers of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex (24Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), mutant proteins should be active in DNA replication. To test these predictions, we substituted each of the strictly conserved amino acids in Box VII with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). We show that the arginine 281 substitution (R281A) retains wild-type activity in ATP binding and in unwinding oriC, confirming the first prediction. In contrast, R281A and other mutant Box VII proteins are inactive in initiation at oriC in vivo and in vitro, refuting the second expectation and demonstrating that Box VII residues are essential for initiation. Further biochemical characterization of R281A revealed that its inactivity in initiation is not a result of defects in binding to DnaA box sequences in oriC or oriV of the plasmid RK2 or to DnaB in the DnaB-DnaC complex. Instead, we found that its failure to form a stable DnaA-oriC complex causes its inactivity in initiation at oriC. We conclude that strand opening of oriC is insufficient to provide a structure with which the DnaB-DnaC complex can stably interact. The results additionally suggest that the Box VII motif functions in DnaA oligomerization. DnaA protein also functions in plasmid DNA replication. In E. coli, the broad host range plasmid, RK2, appears to require the cooperative binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA boxes within the RK2 replication origin (oriV) (25Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We show that the Box VII function is apparently unnecessary for initiation at the replication origin of RK2, supporting the notion that a subset of DnaA functions is needed at this plasmid origin. Replication Proteins—Monomeric DnaAΔ220–294, an in-frame deletion of amino acids 220–294 (Fig. 1), was purified as described (26Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from E. coli HMS174 (DE3) recA hsdR (rK12- mK12+) Rifr (F-) (Novagen) carrying pKCdnaAΔ220–294 (27Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23017-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and grown in LB medium at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotics to maintain the dnaA plasmid. Wild-type DnaA protein that was fused at its N terminus to a His tag (Novagen) used in this study was isolated from E. coli BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) ompT hsdS (rB-mB-) (Novagen) carrying pKC597, which was constructed by inserting a 1.7-kb NdeI-BamHI fragment encoding the wild-type dnaA gene and 289 base pairs of the downstream dnaN gene into the multiple cloning site of pET16b (Novagen) by its cleavage with NdeI and BamHI endonucleases. In the construction, the dnaA GTG initiator codon was substituted by an ATG codon, and dnaA was placed under inducible control of the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter of the vector. His-tagged DnaA was purified after induced expression as described (26Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but heparin agarose chromatography was substituted by metal chelation chromatography. Monomeric His-tagged DnaA is essentially identical to wild-type DnaA in oriC plasmid replication in either a reconstituted or crude enzyme system; they are also essentially identical in oriC binding, ATP binding, and unwinding of oriC. Missense mutations in the Box VII motif were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) with pairs of oligonucleotide primers carrying the desired mutation into both pKC597 and pRB100 as the DNA templates. In pRB100, the respective dnaA mutations were expressed from the natural dnaA promoters. DNA sequence analysis was then performed to confirm the presence of the mutation and the absence of spontaneous mutations elsewhere in the dnaA gene and its promoter region. The mutant DnaA carrying the R281A substitution and an N-terminal His tag was purified for this study following the method used for purification of His-tagged DnaA protein. Other replication proteins, including a crude enzyme fraction that is deficient in DnaA protein, have been described (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

To test these predictions, we purified a mutant DnaA carrying an alanine substitution at arginine 281 (R281A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). 2For this study, protein purification of both mutant and wild-type DnaA was facilitated by an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence and metal chelation chromatography. The presence of the N-terminal polyhistidine sequence does not affect the activity of wild type DnaA in DNA replication (see “Experimental Procedures”) (35Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For simplicity, the His tag modification has been omitted from the protein nomenclature. ATP binding assays were performed, which measured the amount of radioactive ATP complexed to DnaA by nitrocellulose filter retention. The assays revealed that R281A was comparable with DnaA+ in both affinity (KD) for ATP and the ratio of ATP bound per DnaA monomer (Fig. 2A), substantiating our expectation. DnaA is a weak ATPase, which is stimulated by DNA (34Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We measured the ATPase activity of R281A and found that the rate of appearance of R281A-ADP was comparable with DnaA+ complexed to ADP (Fig. 2B). We also observed a greater time-dependent reduction in the amount of ATP that remained bound to R281A compared with DnaA+. Other experiments showed that this difference arose from a slightly elevated rate of dissociation of ATP from R281A rather than from the hydrolysis of ATP (data not shown). These results indicate that the R281A substitution does not substantially affect the ATPase activity of DnaA, but it may slightly reduce the stability of ATP bound to the mutant protein. Arginine 281 Is Not Required for Binding to the DnaA Boxes of oriC—In gel mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled DNA fragment carrying oriC, DnaA forms six discrete complexes, which reflect the ordered binding of DnaA to the DnaA boxes in oriC (35Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the R281A substitution is outside the DNA binding domain of DnaA (20Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23017-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we expect the mutant DnaA to be comparable with wild-type DnaA in this assay of DNA binding (Fig. 3). R281A is similar to DnaA+ in this assay, indicating that substitution of this Box VII residue does not affect sequence-specific DNA binding. Arginine 281 within the Box VII Motif Is Not Required to Unwind oriC—During the initiation process, DnaA complexed to ATP and bound to oriC in a supercoiled plasmid unwinds a region of duplex DNA within oriC (6Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The open structure is sensitive to P1 nuclease, which cleaves within the unwound region to linearize the plasmid. The amount of linear DNA, separated from the supercoiled DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis, can be quantified by its fluorescence after ethidium bromide staining. In this assay, we found that the mutant protein was comparable with DnaA+ protein at 3–50 ng in unwinding of oriC (Fig. 4). Consequently, the substitution did not impair this activity. However, R281A was less inhibitory than DnaA+ at levels above 50 ng. Box VII Mutants Are Inactive in Initiation from oriC—Despite showing that R281A is active in unwinding oriC and in binding to ATP and the DnaA boxes of oriC, we found that the mutant protein was inert in DNA replication of an oriC-containing plasmid in vitro (Fig. 5A). To ascertain whether other conserved Box VII residues are also essential for function, we substituted these residues (Fig. 1) with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the mutant DnaAs as well as R281A and wild-type DnaA in an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system (RTS 100, Roche Applied Science). These proteins, and also R281A, were essentially inactive in oriC plasmid replication, whereas DnaA+ protein expressed in vitro was similar in activity to purified DnaA+ protein assayed in parallel as a control (Fig. 5B). Correspondingly, an in vivo assay showed that the respective dnaA alleles, including pBR322 as a negative control, were inactive in initiation (Table I). The control with the dnaA+ gene showed that it was active. The genetic assay relied on a host strain lacking a functional chromosomal dnaA locus (dnaA850::Tn10). In this strain, we established plasmids encoding the respective dnaA alleles and then introduced an oriC plasmid (pCM959-CmR). Hence, dnaA function is plasmid-encoded. These results indicate that the Box VII motif is functionally important for initiation from oriC.Table IBox VII mutations are inactive in initiation from E. coli oriC but support initiation from plasmid RK2 oriV E. coli MS3898 (genotype: asnB32 relA1 spoT1 thi-1 ilv-192 zia::pKN500 (pKN500 = mini-R1) ΔdnaA mad-2 (F-) recA1 (λimm434) (50Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M.

With MS3898 harboring the dnaA+ plasmid, pRB100, it was transformed by pCM959-CmR DNA at a frequency of 8 × 105/μg of plasmid DNA, but transformants were not obtained when this strain harbored plasmids encoding the respective dnaA mutations or pBR322. The frequencies of transformation obtained when MS3898 harboring pBR322 or the respective dnaA plasmids was transformed by pCM959-CmR have been normalized relative to those values when the strain was transformed by pACYC184, with the value obtained with the dnaA+ plasmid pRB100 set at 1. In contrast, pFF1 containing RK2 oriV transformed MS3898 carrying all plasmids encoding wild type or mutant dnaA alleles but not when the strain carried pBR322. The frequency of transformation by pFF1 is expressed as a ratio relative to the frequency of transformation by pACYC184 and normalized relative to the ratio obtained with the strain carrying pRB100 set at 1.Resident plasmidAlleleTransformation by pCM959 (oriC)Transformation by pFFI (RK2oriV)pBR322<6 × 10-4<7 × 10-4pRB100dnaA+11pRBR281AR281A<2 × 10-40.84pRBL282AL282A<6 × 10-50.76pRBS284AS284A<2 × 10-40.52pRBR285AR285A<2 × 10-40.82 Open table in a new tab Arginine 281 Functions in DnaA Oligomerization at oriC, Which Is Required to Assemble the Prepriming Complex—After the unwinding of oriC, DnaA recruits the DnaB-DnaC complex via a direct interaction with DnaB to assemble the prepriming complex (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaC releases it from the DnaB-DnaC complex to unmask the helicase activity of DnaB (24Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Without concomitant DNA replication, DnaB can further unwind the parental duplex DNA (39Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The positive superhelicity that accumulates from DNA unwinding can be removed by DNA gyrase to produce a highly negative supercoiled DNA, Form 1*, which can be separated from the naturally supercoiled oriC plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified. Because R281A is active in unwinding oriC (Fig. 4), its inactivity in initiation may be at a following step. R281A was inert when it was examined, whereas DnaA+ protein was active in Form 1* formation (Fig. 6), suggesting that R281A is defective in the assembly of the prepriming complex. Because DnaA interacts with DnaB to load the helicase at oriC, we considered the possibility that Box VII residues function in DnaB recruitment. As DNA replication of a single-stranded DNA carrying a DnaA box in a hairpin structure requires an interaction between DnaA and DnaB (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39815-39822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), R281A may be inactive in this system. However, we found that R281A was comparable in replication activity to DnaA+ (Fig. 7). We conclude that Box VII is not required for DnaA to interact with DnaB and that R281A fails to assemble the prepriming complex for another reason. Several studies indicate that a specific nucleoprotein complex forms at oriC during initiation. In one study, we determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis that 10 DnaA monomers and two DnaB hexamers are bound to oriC in the isolated prepriming complex (9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DnaC was not quantified because the reaction conditions should have permitted DnaC-dependent hydrolysis of ATP to release it from the DnaB-DnaC complex (24Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

In a second study, we showed that an N-terminal domain of DnaA must physically interact with another DnaA monomer bound to oriC to form a DnaA-oriC complex that is functionally active (16Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A third study involving molecular modeling of Domains III and IV of a DnaA homologue led to the suggestion that Domain III of one DnaA monomer interacts with an adjacent monomer in a proposed DnaA hexamer (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If Box VII residues within Domain III participate in DnaA oligomer formation to assemble a specific DnaA-oriC complex, which is then recognized by the DnaB-DnaC complex to assemble the prepriming complex, we expect a decreased stoichiometry of the mutant protein because of its failure to assemble properly at oriC, and background levels of DnaB and DnaC as a consequence. To test this model, we incubated R281A, DnaB, and DnaC with an oriC plasmid under conditions optimal to form the prepriming complex and then separated the plasmid DNA and proteins bound to it from unbound proteins by gel filtration chromatography. Quantitative immunoblot analysis of the proteins associated with the oriC plasmid revealed that the mutant DnaA was present at near background levels (Table II). DnaB representing the DnaB-DnaC complex was also barely detectable. As a control, the prepriming complex assembled with wild-type DnaA contained 14 DnaB monomers, consistent with recent results showing that two DnaB hexamers are bound per oriC plasmid (8Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ratio of about seven DnaA monomers per oriC is lower than the expected ratio of 10 monomers per oriC in the prepriming complex but is generally consistent with previous studies (9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the stoichiometry of DnaA+ bound to the oriC plasmid in the absence of the DnaB-DnaC complex was determined, the ratio of five DnaA monomers agrees with previous observations that one DnaA monomer is at each of the five DnaA boxes of oriC (9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In summary, these results indicate that the mutant DnaA is impaired in DNA replication from its inability to form a stable DnaA-oriC complex. We suggest that the specific defect of R281A is in self-oligomerization.Table IIStoichiometry of DnaA and DnaB at oriC Prepriming complexes were assembled on an oriC plasmid (M13oriC2LB5) and isolated by gel filtration chromatography (Sepharose 4B, Amersham Biosciences) as described (9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to the void volume were analyzed for the amount of DNA in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and for DnaA and DnaB protein by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Known amounts of DNA or protein were used to prepare standard curves from which the amounts of DnaA and DnaB retained on the oriC plasmid were determined. The results from identical sets of experiments were averaged to calculate the standard deviation for the stoichiometry of DnaA and DnaB protein. The range in the ratios of DnaA and DnaB per oriC plasmid is also indicated. In one set of experiments under conditions optimal to form the prepriming complex (9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the amounts of DnaA+ or R281A and DnaB were determined. DnaC was not quantified because the experimental conditions include ATP, which, when hydrolyzed by DnaC, permits the release of DnaC from the prepriming complex. In the second set of experiments, the amount of wild-type or mutant DnaA bound to the oriC plasmid in the absence of DnaB and DnaC was determined.ComplexProteinDnaADnaBNo. of experimentsMonomer/oriCRangeNo. of experimentsMonomer/oriCRangePreprimingDnaA+36.6 ± 0.46.2-6.7214.1 ± 0.813.5-14.7R281A51.2 ± 0.40.7-1.732.5 ± 0.62.1-3.1DnaA-oriCDnaA+44.9 ± 1.34.2-6.3R281A20.550.5-0.6 Open table in a new tab Cooperative Binding of DnaA to RK2 oriV—Doran et al. (25Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) proposed that DnaA binds cooperatively to the DnaA boxes in the replication origin of RK2 plasmid. By gel mobility shift analysis, they showed that DnaA forms four discrete complexes on binding to a DNA fragment carrying oriV (Fig. 8A), suggesting that a DnaA monomer binds to each of the four DnaA boxes within oriV. At low DnaA levels, Complex I, which had the greatest electrophoretic mobility, was never seen in the absence of the next retarded complex, Complex II, suggesting that Complex II was formed through a cooperative interaction between DnaA molecules bound to respective DnaA boxes. In support of this interpretation this binding mode was not observed when the rightmost DnaA box in oriV was inverted (25Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Instead, DnaA binding appeared to be sequential. We compared R281A with wild-type DnaA and observed similar binding to RK2 oriV by gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 8B). At lower protein levels in this and other experiments, Complex I was not seen in the absence of Complex II, in agreement with the observations of Doran et al. (25Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, we observed three instead of four complexes and do not know the reason for this difference. Hence, the inability of R281A to form a stable complex at oriC is not apparently from a defect in cooperative binding, suggesting that the functions of self-oligomerization and cooperative binding are distinct. In contrast to DnaA protein, an in-frame deletion lacking amino acids 220–294 (DnaAΔ220–294) did not appear to bind cooperatively to oriV because the appearance of Complexes I and II was sequential (Fig. 8C). Of the AAA+ motifs of DnaA, the Walker B box, Sensor I, and Box VII motifs are absent in DnaAΔ220–294 (Fig. 1) (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because R281A appears to bind normally to the oriV-containing fragment, other AAA+ motifs of Domain III may be responsible for cooperative DNA binding. We also measured the activity of R281A and other Box VII mutants in RK2 DNA replication in vivo (Table I). In contrast to their inactivity at oriC in vivo, the Box VII mutants maintained the RK2 plasmid about as effectively as wild-type DnaA protein. These results suggest that a subset of DnaA functions is needed at the RK2 plasmid origin and that, if arginine 281 functions to sense the hydrolysis of ATP, it is unnecessary for RK2 DNA replication. The Box VII Motif—This study investigates the function of the Box VII motif, testing the idea that Box VII mutants should remain active in ATP binding and thus be able to unwind oriC. Because the unwound region of oriC appears to be where DnaB initially binds before moving as a DNA helicase (8Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), mutants of this motif should be active in initiation if the unwound region of oriC is sufficient for the binding of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex. Our results show that the mutant DnaA bearing an R281A substitution is active in ATP binding and in unwinding of oriC. However, R281A is inactive in initiation from the failure to form a stable complex at oriC. The inactivity of other Box VII mutants in DNA replication suggests that they share similar defects. Thus, the open region within oriC is insufficient to load DnaB. The single-stranded DNA binding activity of DnaC, thought to enable DnaC to bind to the unwound region of oriC to load the helicase (24Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), does not suffice either. These and previous results (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the loading of DnaB requires direct interaction with DnaA assembled at oriC as an oligomer. Oligomerization of DnaA at oriC—Recent studies show that DnaA self-oligomerizes on binding to the DnaA boxes of oriC and that this activity is required for initiation. Specific N-terminal residues (leucine 5, tryptophan 6, glutamine 8, and cysteine 9 in a predicted α-helix), which function in oligomerization (17Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), reside within a region of DnaA that can replace the dimerization domain of a bacteriophage λ CI repressor (41Weigel C. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Tungler D. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because this N-terminal domain is separate from the Box VII motif relative to the primary structure of DnaA, two regions of DnaA appear to be involved. As additional support for oligomerization, the spatial arrangement of the individual DnaA boxes of oriC must be preserved to maintain oriC function. Insertion of four or eight base pairs between DnaA boxes R3 and R4 near the right oriC border disrupts oriC function but not when the insertion is 10 base pairs, which is one helical turn (42Woelker B. Messer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5025-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apparently, DnaA bound at these sites must interact on one side of the DNA helix in forming an oligomeric complex to load DnaB. Finally, the unstable binding of R281A to oriC supports the proposal based on modeling studies that Domain III functions in DnaA oligomerization (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The quantitative immunoblot experiments (Table II) revealed that R281A fails to bind stoichiometrically to oriC, in contrast to gel mobility shift assays in which the mutant DnaA was comparable with wild-type DnaA in binding to the DnaA boxes of oriC (Fig. 3). Furthermore, a previous study concluded that Domain IV is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (20Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which is ostensibly at odds with the observation that the R281A substitution causes an unstable DnaA-oriC complex. Because of the rapid off-rate of DnaA when its binding to the DnaA box sequence was measured by surface plasmon resonance (22Blaesing F. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or by competitive DNA binding assays (43Margulies, C. A. (1997) in The Influence of IHF and FIS on the Ordered Binding of DnaA Protein to oriC, the E. coli Chromosomal Origin. Ph.D. thesis, Michigan State University, East LansingGoogle Scholar), we suggest that R281A dissociates from the oriC plasmid as it is being isolated by gel filtration chromatography because of its failure to oligomerize. In contrast, it is well documented that nucleoprotein complexes, which are labile in solution, are stabilized by the caging effect of the polyacrylamide gel in the gel mobility shift method (44Vossen K.M. Fried M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Fried M.G. Liu G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5054-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which provides an explanation for the comparable binding of R281A and DnaA+ to oriC in this assay. DnaA as an AAA+ATPase—DnaA is a member of the AAA+ family of ATPases (19Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with other AAA+ ATPases, arginine 281 is proposed to function as the arginine finger (14Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) to sense whether ATP has been hydrolyzed in coordinating ATP hydrolysis to a conformational change. In other AAA+ proteins, the change in conformation modulates enzyme function (reviewed in Ref. 19Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the role of arginine 281 is to function as the arginine finger, the results suggest that the ability to discriminate ATP from ADP is essential for the formation of an active DnaA-oriC complex and the recruitment of DnaB helicase.

Hep I does not activate ERK or PI 3-kinase in FAK knockout fibroblasts, suggesting activation occurs downstream of FAK. TSP1/hep I stimulates RhoA inactivation with kinetics corresponding to focal adhesion disassembly in a FAK, ERK, and PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, hep I does not stimulate focal adhesion disassembly in cells expressing constitutively active RhoA, suggesting that RhoA inactivation is required for this response. This is the first work to illustrate a connection between FAK phosphorylation in response to a soluble factor and RhoA inactivation, as well as the first report of PI 3-kinase and ERK in FAK regulation of RhoA activity. Integrin-mediated interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix regulate numerous aspects of cell physiology, including anchorage-dependent growth and survival as well as mechanical coupling of the contractile elements of the cell to the extracellular environment. In addition, these sites are critical for the integration of matrix- and growth factor-derived signal transduction pathways (1Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Integrins cluster following initial ligation, both increasing the strength of the cell-matrix interaction and activating a variety of integrin-derived signaling pathways. The small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 drive formation of early peripheral integrin clusters, generally referred to as focal complexes (2Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Activation of RhoA increases cellular contractility, particularly through the RhoA effector ROCK, which inactivates myosin phosphatase (4Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). This stimulates increased actin bundling, fusion of peripheral focal complexes, and elongation of the adhesions in the direction of contractility (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 6Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr.

These elongated, highly organized complexes are generally referred to as focal adhesion plaques. Compared with focal complexes, focal adhesions are less dynamic and as such have been shown to hinder cell migration by preventing release of the cell during translocation (8Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B.

Several growth factors, including epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, and the matricellular family of extracellular matrix proteins, including thrombospondin (TSP1), 1The abbreviations used are: TSP1, thrombospondin 1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PTX, pertussis toxin; CRT, calreticulin; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; GAP, GTPase activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; BAE cells, bovine aortic endothelial cells; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum.1The abbreviations used are: TSP1, thrombospondin 1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PTX, pertussis toxin; CRT, calreticulin; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; GAP, GTPase activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; BAE cells, bovine aortic endothelial cells; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum. tenascin-C, and SPARC, stimulate focal adhesion disassembly characterized by the loss of highly bundled actin stress fibers and the selective depletion of vinculin and α-actinin from the focal adhesion plaque (11Greenwood J.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, cells remain spread and integrins remain clustered and linked to talin and paxillin, indicating an incomplete loss of adhesion. Our laboratory has characterized this spread cell devoid of focal adhesions and stress fibers as being in an intermediate adhesive state between that of strongly adherent, focal adhesion-containing cells and weakly adherent, rounded cells. These de-adhesive proteins are mainly expressed during dynamic tissue conditions, such as development, inflammation, and wound healing, where the cell must quickly alter function with changing environmental conditions. Thus, the intermediate state of adhesion has been postulated to serve as an adaptive state for enhanced local responsiveness, potentially affecting cell survival, migration, and gene expression. Through a better understanding of the transition to and function of the intermediate adhesive state, we hope to provide new insights into the mechanisms of both physiological and pathophysiological remodeling responses. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was first described in 1992 by Shaller et al. (13Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) as a focal adhesion-associated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylated by v-Src. FAK has since been shown to transduce many of the matrix-dependent effects on cell proliferation, migration, and survival (14Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 15Orr A.W. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1254-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). FAK interacts with paxillin through the focal adhesion targeting domain in the C terminus of FAK and becomes autophosphorylated on Tyr397, recruiting c-Src, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, and Shc (16Hildebrand J.D.

Src phosphorylates other critical residues within FAK, such as Tyr576 and Tyr577 in the kinase domain resulting in full activation of the kinase activity of FAK (21Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAK is activated by most integrins, indicating a central role for FAK in adhesive signaling. In addition to integrin-mediated adhesion, growth factors and mechanical stress can also induce FAK phosphorylation (22Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Li S. Butler P. Wang Y. Han D.C. Usami S. Guan J.L. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Activated insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor stimulate direct FAK phosphorylation, whereas other growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, bombesin, endothelin, and lysophosphatic acid stimulate FAK phosphorylation indirectly through either Src- or RhoA-dependent pathways (24Zachary I.

Y.). 2001; 3: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FAK signaling is not required for focal adhesion formation and in contrast appears to destabilize focal adhesion plaques. FAK knockout fibroblasts and fibroblasts transfected with a truncated form of FAK, termed FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK), demonstrate an increase in the number and size of focal adhesions, and a subsequent decrease in cell migration (31Ilic D.

Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms employed by FAK to induce focal adhesion disassembly remain largely unknown. FAK proteolysis is associated with focal adhesion turnover in transformed and apoptotic cells through the actions of calpains and caspases, respectively (33Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, focal adhesion turnover under these conditions is extensive, resulting in complete loss of cell adhesion. FAK signaling is proposed to inactivate RhoA, because RhoA activity is elevated in FAK knockout fibroblasts and FAK associates with several RhoGAPs (8Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A.

Furthermore, RhoA inactivation and inhibition of the RhoA effector ROCK are both sufficient to induce focal adhesion disassembly (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 6Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr.

TSP1 is a homotrimeric, multidomain member of the matricellular family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins (37Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). TSP1 stimulates focal adhesion disassembly through a 19-amino acid sequence, termed hep I, in the N-terminal heparin-binding domain, which binds a receptor co-complex of cell surface calreticulin (CRT) and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (38Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

The hep I sequence of TSP binds to a defined site in calreticulin (aa 19–36) and calreticulin lacking this sequence fails to mediate TSP binding or signaling (44Goicoechea S. Pallero M.A. Eggleton P. Michalak M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37219-37228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interaction between TSP1 and the CRT/LRP complex activates pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein (Gαi) signals resulting in increased activation of PI 3-kinase and ERK, both of which are required for TSP1/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (41Greenwood J.A.

Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were isolated and cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% FBS as described previously (38Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (K41 (wild-type), K42 (CRT-knockout), and K42-CRT (CRT-rescued)) were a gift of Dr. Marek Michalak (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) (45Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). FAK knockout MEFs were grown in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1 × 10–6 β-mercaptoethanol (46Ilic D. Furuta Y. Suda T. Atsumi T. Fujimoto J. Ikawa Y. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tet-inducible FAK knockout fibroblast clone 46 was a generous gift of Dr. Stephen Hanks (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Tet-FAK knockout fibroblasts were grown in media used for BAE cells supplemented with 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (47Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FAK was induced upon tetracycline withdrawal for various time points. Transfection—Transient transfection of BAE cells was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser. Cells were trypsinized, and 3–4 × 106 cells per condition were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The construct for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged constitutively active RhoA (V14) (gift of Dr. Martin Schwartz, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and the FAK construct HA-tagged FRNK, HA-FRNK F1034S, which is defective in focal adhesion targeting, and myc-FAK Y397F, which localizes to focal adhesions but cannot become activated (gifts of Dr. Candece Gladson, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) were added to the cells at 10 μg/ml, incubated for 10 min on ice, and pulsed at 170 V and 960 microfarads. Cells were replated, grown for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and prepared for focal adhesion assay as described. Percent of cells transfected was determined by immunofluorescent staining for the hemagglutinin and Myc tags. Focal Adhesion Assay—Focal adhesion assays were performed as previously described (43Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAE and MEF cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips in DMEM with 10% FBS. After overnight incubation, cells were near confluent. Cells were then washed once with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 30 min. Cells were treated with various agents, fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde, and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 10 equipped for interference reflection microscopy. Cells were scored as either positive or negative for the presence of focal adhesions, with cells containing at least 5 focal adhesions considered positive. At least 300 cells were evaluated for each condition. Cell Lysate Preparation—To prepare whole cell lysates from BAE and MEF cells grown in 6-well plates, media were removed from cells, and 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue) was added to each well. Following lysis with SDS sample buffer, lysates were harvested, sonicated, boiled, centrifuged, and frozen at –20 °C until gel electrophoresis was performed. Immunoprecipitation and PI 3-Kinase Assay—BAECs and MEFs were grown to near confluence in 100-mm2 plates, medium was removed, and 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) was added. Cells were scraped, collected in Eppendorf tubes, and pre-cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with either PY20 (10 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-FAK (4 μg/ml) antibodies for 2 h on ice for PY20 or overnight for rabbit anti-FAK. Protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and prepared for either Western blot or PI 3-kinase activity assay. For Western blots, SDS sample buffer was added, and the tubes were boiled and frozen until gel electrophoresis. For PI 3-kinase assays, the beads were washed twice in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.8 mm Na3VO4, and 30 mm NaCl). Lipids were prepared by adding 400 μl of kinase buffer with 3.5 mm dithiothreitol to a predried equal mixture of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 and phosphatidylserine, to achieve a final concentration of 1.5 μm of each lipid. Kinase buffer was removed from immunoprecipitates, and 20 μl of lipids was added to each tube and incubated for exactly 10 min at 37 °C. Next, 20 μl of reaction buffer (kinase buffer containing 17.5 μm ATP, 25 μCi of [32P]ATP/sample, and 17.5 mm MgCl2) was added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 160 μl of a 1:1 methanol/chloroform solution. Lipids were extracted by adding 80 μl of HCl to each tube and centrifuging to separate the phases. The lower phase was removed, and lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates precoated with 1% potassium oxalate. The plates were developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7), exposed for autoradiography, and quantified using Scanalytic's One-Dscan version 1.31. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis using either 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat milk or 1% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-ERK (1:1000), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (1:1000), rabbit anti-RhoA (1:1000), rabbit anti-FAK (1:1000), rabbit antibodies specific for individual FAK phosphotyrosines (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861, and Tyr925) (1:1000) overnight, or RC20 (1:2500) antibodies for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG were used at either a 1:5,000 or 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h. Bands were visualized by incubating antibody-labeled membranes with PerkinElmer Life Sciences Chemiluminescence Reagent and exposing x-ray film to treated membranes. Bands were quantified using Scanalytic's One-Dscan version 1.31. RhoA Activation Assay—BAE cells and MEFs were grown to near confluence in 100-mm2 plates, medium was changed to 3% FBS for 30 min, and cells were treated with DMEM, hep I (0.5 μm), or modified hep I (0.5 μm). Levels of active RhoA were measured using the Rho Activity Assay purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgC12, 0.5 m NaC1, 1% Triton X-100) and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Lysates were normalized for total protein level and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 65 μl of GST-Rhotekin beads (Cytoskeleton kit), which utilizes the affinity of active RhoA for its effector rhotekin to precipitate only active RhoA from the cells (48Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beads were then washed once each with lysis and washing (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm MgC12, 0.5 m NaC1, 150 mm EDTA) buffers, resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v), and boiled for 5 min. Western blots were then performed for RhoA to quantify RhoA precipitation for each condition. Immunofluorescence Staining—Following treatment, coverslips were fixed for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde, and permeabilized for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then washed and blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. Cells were stained for 1 h with mouse anti-vinculin (1:200), mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (1:100), or mouse anti-myc (1:100) in blocking buffer, washed, and then stained with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml). Some cells were counterstained with Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin (1:200 in blocking buffer) for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted using Fluoroblok mounting media, and images were taken using a Nikon DiaPhot Microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolSnap video camera using the Inovision ISEE software program. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test, and p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 (indicated) was considered significant. FAK Is Required for TSP1/Hep I-induced Focal Adhesion Disassembly—TSP1 stimulates a transition to the intermediate adhesion state characterized by loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions in adherent cells (12Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 43Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because FAK signaling stimulates focal adhesion disassembly under a variety of conditions, the role of FAK in TSP1-mediated focal adhesion disassembly was assessed (49Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts derived from FAK knockout mouse embryos were utilized for initial studies (46Ilic D. Furuta Y. Suda T. Atsumi T. Fujimoto J. Ikawa Y. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and FAK knockout fibroblasts were treated with TSP1 (78 nm), hep I (100 nm), or a modified hep I peptide (100 nm), containing alanine residues in place of two essential lysines, and the presence of focal adhesions was assessed by interference reflection microscopy. Whereas wild-type fibroblasts lose focal adhesions in response to TSP1 and hep I, the FAK knockout MEFs are unresponsive to TSP1/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly, suggesting that FAK is required for this process (Fig. 1A). Modified hep I did not affect focal adhesions in either cell line. FAK knockout cells that re-express FAK upon tetracycline withdrawal were also employed to address the role of FAK in this process (47Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whereas hep I did not stimulate focal adhesion disassembly in non-induced FAK knockout fibroblasts or fibroblasts induced for 12 h, induction of FAK expression for 24 and 48 h rescued the ability of these cells to respond to hep I treatment (Fig. 1B). The unresponsiveness at 12 h induction is likely because of an unattained signaling threshold because of low levels of FAK expression. Although all current data indicate that TSP1/hep I signals focal adhesion disassembly identically in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, we also investigated the role of FAK in TSP1/h"
https://openalex.org/W2023356119,"The migration of endothelial cells in response to various stimulating factors plays an essential role in angiogenesis. The p38 MAPK pathway has been implicated to play an important role in endothelial cell migration because inhibiting p38 MAPK activity down-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated migration. Currently, the signaling components in the p38 MAPK activation pathway and especially the mechanisms responsible for p38 MAPK-regulated endothelial cell migration are not well understood. In the present study, we found that p38 MAPK activity is required for endothelial cell migration stimulated by both VEGF and nongrowth factor stimulants, sphingosine 1-phosphate and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule. By using dominant negative forms of signaling components in the p38 MAPK pathway, we identified that a regulatory pathway consisting of MKK3-p38α/γ-MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 participated in VEGF-stimulated migration. In further studies, we showed that a minimum of a 10-h treatment with SB203580 (specific p38 MAPK inhibitor) was needed to block VEGF-stimulated migration, suggesting an indirect role of p38 MAPK in this cellular event. Most interestingly, the occurrence of SB203580-induced migratory inhibition coincided with a reduction of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression. Furthermore, agents disrupting uPA and uPA receptor interaction abrogated VEGF-stimulated cell migration. These results suggest a possible association between cell migration and uPA expression. Indeed, VEGF-stimulated migration was not compromised by SB203580 in endothelial cells expressing the uPA transgene; however, VEGF-stimulated migration was inhibited by agents disrupting uPA-uPA receptor interaction. These results thus suggest that the p38 MAPK pathway participates in endothelial cell migration by regulating uPA expression."

There is evidence that MutH binds to the N-terminal domain of MutL in an ATP-dependent manner; however, the interaction sites and the molecular mechanism of MutH activation have not yet been determined. We used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and site-specific cross-linking to identify protein interaction sites between the proteins MutH and MutL. Unique cysteine residues were introduced in cysteine-free variants of MutH and MutL. The introduced cysteines were modified with the cross-linking reagent 4-maleimidobenzophenone. Photoactivation resulted in cross-links verified by mass spectrometry of some of the single cysteine variants to their respective Cys-free partner proteins. Moreover, we mapped the site of interaction by cross-linking different combinations of single cysteine MutH and MutL variants with thiol-specific homobifunctional cross-linkers of varying length. These results were used to model the MutH·MutL complex and to explain the ATP dependence of this interaction.

Nature. 2003; 421: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). One of these systems, DNA mismatch repair, is present in most organisms and enhances the fidelity of DNA replication by a factor of up to 1000 by correcting replication errors (2Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 3Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). mismatch repair is a complex process that requires the coordination of a number of specialized enzymatic activities involving many different proteins. The paradigm of such a process is the MutHLS system from Escherichia coli (7Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Because mismatch repair proteins MutS and MutL are evolutionarily conserved among the three kingdoms of life, it is believed that the basic mechanisms of mismatch repair are similar. In the presence of ATP and a mismatch, MutS recruits MutL and together they activate MutH, which in turn cleaves the newly replicated daughter strand at a transiently unmethylated d(GATC) site. The nick marks the erroneous strand for excision, which is started by the action of DNA helicase II, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and one of several exonucleases (8Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and DNA ligase carry out repair synthesis. One of the interesting questions in DNA mismatch repair is how the different Mut proteins interact in time and space. In the E. coli system, the assembly of the active MutS·MutL complex will activate the strand discrimination endonuclease MutH. Both MutS and MutL are ATPases, and the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis are just emerging (9Martik D. Baitinger C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28402-28410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol.

The mismatch activated form of this complex will stimulate the latent endonuclease activity of MutH to cleave the transiently unmethylated error-containing daughter strand, thereby marking this strand for removal. We have previously shown that the proper discrimination of the unmethylated strand from the methylated strand can be mapped to a single amino acid residue in MutH, i.e. Tyr212. Biochemical analyses indicated that only MutL, not MutS, interacts directly with MutH (11Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9861-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and that communication between MutS and MutH was mediated by MutL in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. In previous studies, we used interference analysis and photochemical cross-linking experiments with single cysteine variants of MutH that had been covalently labeled with either the probes of different sizes or a photochemical cross-linker to identify specific interactions of MutH with MutL (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results revealed topographical details of the MutL binding site of MutH located in a region around α-helix E of MutH. In this work, we focused on the MutH binding site of MutL. To determine which face of MutL is interacting with MutH, we designed a series of MutL variants containing a single cysteine in topographically distinct regions of the protein. These regions were limited to the N-terminal domain (NTD) 1The abbreviations used are: NTD, N-terminal domain; ADPNP, adenosine 5′-(β-γ-imido)triphosphate; bBBr, dibromobimane; BMOE, bismaleimidoethane; DTT, dithiothreitol; BM[PEO]4, 1,11-bismaleimidotetraethyleneglycol; BP-L, MutL protein with 4-maleimidobenzophenone covalently linked to a single cysteine; MBP, 4-maleimidobenzophenone; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization.1The abbreviations used are: NTD, N-terminal domain; ADPNP, adenosine 5′-(β-γ-imido)triphosphate; bBBr, dibromobimane; BMOE, bismaleimidoethane; DTT, dithiothreitol; BM[PEO]4, 1,11-bismaleimidotetraethyleneglycol; BP-L, MutL protein with 4-maleimidobenzophenone covalently linked to a single cysteine; MBP, 4-maleimidobenzophenone; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. of MutL, sufficient for MutH activation in vitro (15Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Residue selection was guided by a phylogenetic sequence analysis that allowed us to choose positions that are not conserved, thereby maximizing the likelihood of obtaining active single cysteine protein variants suitable for subsequent biochemical studies. We constructed 13 single cysteine full-length E. coli MutL mutants containing an N-terminal histidine tag for the purpose of attaching photoactivatable or various bifunctional thiol-specific cross-linkers. Photocross-linking experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue ADPNP with the homodimeric MutL variants and the binary MutL·MutH complex or the ternary MutL·MutH· DNA complex. Our results yielded a detailed map of the MutH binding site of MutL and, together with published results, allowed us to construct a MutL·MutH complex model with implications for the activation of the MutH endonuclease by MutL. Strains, Plasmids, Enzymes, and Reagents—E. coli K12 strains CC106 ((P90C [araΔ[lac-pro)XIII (F′laciZ proB+])) (16Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), TX2652 (CC106 mutL::Ω4 (BsaAI; Kanr)), and TX2928 (CC106 mutH471::tn5; Kanr) (17Feng G. Winkler M.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar) and the pET-15b (Novagen) derived plasmids pTX412 and pTX418 containing the mutS and mutL genes, respectively, under control of the T7 promotor were kindly provided by Dr. M. Winkler (17Feng G. Winkler M.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMQ402 (His6-MutH), a pBAD18 derivative, was a kind gift from Dr. M. Marinus (18Loh T. Murphy K.C. Marinus M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12113-12119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the protein expression of MutS and MutL, the E. coli strain HMS174(λDE3) (Novagen) was used. For MutH, the E. coli strain XL1-blue (Stratagene) was used. Pfu DNA polymerase was expressed and purified as described previously (19Evans S.J. Fogg M.J. Mamone A. Davis M. Pearl L.H. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA Substrates—Linear heteroduplex substrates were generated by annealing two 484-bp PCR products amplified by Taq-DNA polymerase with a single GATC site at position 210 and a G/C or a A/T base pair at position 385 using plasmids and primers as described previously (20Thomas E. Pingoud A. Friedhoff P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This procedure results in a mixture of 50% homoduplex substrates (G/C and A/T) and 50% heteroduplex substrates (G/T and A/C). In general, 40–60% of this DNA was cleavable by MutH in a mismatch and MutS-dependent manner. Site-directed Mutagenesis—pTX418/Cys-free containing the gene for a cysteine-free MutL variant (termed LCys-free) was generated by replacing all seven codons for the native cysteine residues from the pTX418 template using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) essentially as described previously (21Friedhoff P. Thomas E. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The substitutions C61S, C216L, C256F, C276F, C446S, C480S, and C588S are numbered with respect to the E. coli MutL sequence. E. coli XL1-blue MRF′ was transformed with the full-length PCR product. Marker positive clones were inoculated and grown overnight in LB medium-containing ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep (Qiagen), and the entire mutL gene was sequenced. Plasmids coding for single cysteine MutL variants were generated from pTX418/Cys-free using the same method described above. Protein variants are labeled as LQ4C, LK52C, and so forth where the superscript indicates the position of the cysteine residues in the MutL protein, i.e. LQ4C, represents the cysteine-free MutL variant with a glutamine to cysteine change at position 4. The gene coding for the NTD of MutL comprising amino acids 1–331 (MutL1–331) was generated using plasmid pTX418 as a template for an inverse PCR with primers 5′-AAA AAT GCA TTT TGT AGC CAC GCT CAG CAC GC-3′ and 5′-AAA AAT GCA TGA GGA TCC GGC TGC TAA CAA AG-3′ followed by cutting with NsiI and ligation. Complementation Mutator Assay—Cells lacking a functional chromosomal mutL gene show a mutator phenotype, which can be analyzed by the frequency of occurrence of Rifampicin (Rif)-resistant clones (18Loh T. Murphy K.C. Marinus M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12113-12119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Single colonies of mutL-deficient TX2652 cells transformed with pET-15b vector alone or with pET-15b containing the wild type or mutant MutL gene were grown overnight at 37 °C in 3 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml Amp. Aliquots of 50 μl from the undiluted culture were plated on LB-agar containing 25 μg/ml Amp and 100 μg/ml Rif. Colonies were counted following overnight incubation at 37 °C. Protein Purification—Recombinant His6-tagged MutH, MutL, and MutS proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography essentially as described previously (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Feng G. Winkler M.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, proteins were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). MutH proteins were stored at -20 °C in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol, pH 7.9. MutL and MutS proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. Protein concentrations were determined using theoretical extinction coefficients (22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). MutH Endonuclease Assay—MutH endonuclease was assayed on heteroduplex DNA substrate (484 bp) containing a G/T or A/C mismatch at position 385 and a single unmethylated d(GATC) site at position 210. 25 nm heteroduplex DNA was incubated at 37 °C with 500 nm MutH, 2 μm MutL, 1 μm MutS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 125 mm KCl. At suitable time points, 10-μl aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 250 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) sucrose, 1.2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 8.0, to 10-μl aliquots. Substrate and product were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Initial rates were determined from the linear portion of a plot of the time course. Site-specific Photocross-linking—Proteins at 20 μm were incubated with 4-maleimidobenzophenone (MBP, Sigma) in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 6.5, 200 mm KCl for 30 min at room temperature with a 2–100-fold molar excess of the thiol-specific reagent. Reactions were stopped by adding a 5-fold molar excess of DTT over the thiol-specific reagent. Excess reagent was removed using protein-desalting spin columns (Pierce). For photocross-linking, 5 μm single cysteine protein (MutH or MutL) modified with MBP was mixed with an equimolar concentration of the respective interaction partner (wild type or cysteine-free) in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm ADPNP and kept on ice in the dark or irradiated for 10–30 min at 354 nm with a handheld UV lamp at a distance of 5 cm. After the addition of 5 μl of 160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) followed by Coomassie Blue staining (PageBlue, Fermentas). Tryptic Digests and Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised and treated essentially as described previously (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). After washing, reduction, acetamidation, and dehydration, gel slices were rehydrated in 25 μl of 100 ng/μl trypsin (Promega sequencing grade), 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and incubated for 45 min on ice. The supernatant was removed, and 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, was added. Digestion was performed for 10 h at 37 °C. The supernatant containing the tryptic peptides was evaporated to dryness and stored at -20 °C until further use. For mass spectrometry, peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 40% ethanol and 1 μl of the mixture was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml 2.5-dihydroxy benzoic acid in 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Mass spectra were recorded with the Advanced Laser Desorption Ionization Mass analyzer (ALADIM II) in the reflector mode. After the assignment of monoisotopic peaks, the data were analyzed with ASAP (24Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and PAWS (ProteoMetrics). Thiol-Thiol Cross-linking—The homobifunctional cross-linkers of varying length, 1,8-bismaleimidotetraethyleneglycol (BM[PEO]4) and bismaleimidoethane (BMOE), were obtained from Pierce, and dibromobimane (bBBr) was from Calbiochem (Fig. 1). Stock solutions at 10 mm were made in water, Me2SO, or acetonitrile. The single cysteine MutL and MutH variants were preincubated on ice at 5 μm each for 10 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm ADPNP. Samples then were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g in a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and incubated at room temperature (25 °C) with a 100-fold molar excess of cross-linker over thiol groups. The reaction was quenched after 30 s with a 5-fold molar excess of DTT over the cross-linker, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. In the case of bBBr cross-linking, the gels were analyzed under UV light for dibromobimane fluorescence prior to Coomassie Blue staining. All of the gels were analyzed with a video documentation system (Bio-Rad). The intensity of the stained protein bands was quantified using TINA, version 2.07d, software. Protein-Protein Docking—All of the models were generated using the algorithms implemented in Chemera 2.0 (www.cqfb.fct.unl.pt/bioin/chemera/) (25Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). BiGGER was run with two docking partners selecting the MutL dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1b63) as the target and the MutH protein (2azo chain B) as the probe, and the parameters were as follows: resolution 1.0; added radius of 1.0; and angular steps of 15 with a minimal overlap of 100. Ten thousand solutions were obtained by this procedure. After the docking run, models were filtered using a 4-Å cutoff to give 2517 unique clusters. We ranked the models by their agreement with the 4 cross-link-derived distance constraints. The docking models were scored similarly as described previously (24Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, binding but not hydrolysis of ATP by MutL is required for the activation of MutH (11Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9861-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Upon ATP binding, the N-terminal ATPase domain of MutL dimerizes (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which is a common theme in all of the members of the GHKL family, e.g. gyrase B and Hsp90 (28Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). MutL1–331 (also named LN40) exists as a monomer in solution in its nucleotide-free or ADP-bound form but dimerizes upon the binding of ATP or ADPNP (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP binding and dimerization of the NTD are sufficient for activation of the MutH endonuclease in vitro. Chemical cross-linking with the homobifunctional cross-linker bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate revealed that MutH can interact with the dimeric form of the MutL NTD (29Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, the site of interaction has not yet been determined. We have previously identified a region in MutH around helix E that binds to MutL (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The single cysteine variant of MutH (HR172C) labeled with MBP could be photocross-linked to MutL. Consequently, we asked whether the photocross-linking of MutL to MutH is dependent on the dimerization of the MutL NTD. We conducted photocross-linking experiments with MutL and MutH labeled with MBP in the presence or absence of ATP or ADPNP. In addition, we tested the N-terminal fragment of MutL (MutL1–331) for cross-linking to MutH. Only in the presence of ADPNP was photocross-linking with labeled MutH (BP-HR172C) to both MutL and MutL1–331 observed (Fig. 2). This finding indicates that only dimeric MutL can form a complex with MutH and that the MutL NTD is sufficient for the interaction with MutH, in agreement with previous results using a chemical cross-linker (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We also examined the dependence of the formation of photocross-links at higher ionic strength (125 mm KCl) and in the presence of DNA (data not shown). Cross-links were observed under both conditions, implying that physical interaction is possible under conditions optimal for DNA mismatch repair (13Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Single Cysteine Variants of MutL—Our next goal was to determine the MutH interaction site of MutL. Methods for mapping protein interaction sites include cross-linking, protection, interference, and “footprinting” (30Creighton T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993: 333-334Google Scholar). We chose a strategy that in principle allowed us to perform any of these approaches in a site-directed manner using the specific chemistry of cysteine residues. Here, we report our results for the cross-linking method. To perform site-specific labeling of MutL, we needed MutL variants that contained only a single cysteine at selected positions. To this end, we first generated a cysteine-free variant of MutL by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of all seven endogenous cysteine residues by alternate amino acid residues was guided by a phylogenetic sequence analysis of the MutL proteins. The cysteine-free variant of MutL (LCys-free) (see “Experimental Procedures”) was tested for function in vivo and in vitro and displayed activity comparable with wild type (Table I and Table II).Table IIn vivo analysis to determine the ability of MutL variants to complement a mutL-deficient E. coli strainPlasmidaE. coli TX2652 (mutL-) was transformed with the plasmid pET-15b containing no mutL gene (vector control) or wild type or variants of the mutL gene with the indicated amino acid exchange(s).

Since it had been shown before that the MutL1–331 is sufficient to activate MutH in vitro (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and that it could be photocross-linked to MBP-modified MutH (BP-HR172C) (see above), we focused on this domain to introduce cysteine residues at thirteen key sites (Fig. 3). Most of these residues with the exception of Lys52 and Gln314 have <60% similarity to MutL proteins from β/γ proteobacteria, and together they cover a large surface of the MutL NTD. A prerequisite for successful mapping protein interactions via cross-linking is that the mutations do not affect the function of the protein. In some cases, a mutation directly identifies the protein-protein interface. Such “hot spots” are generally important for complex formation (31DeLano W.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 32Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed the MutL variants for their in vivo function in mismatch repair. MutL variants were tested for their ability to complement a mutator phenotype in the mutL-deficient E. coli strain TX2652 (17Feng G. Winkler M.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar). All of the variants with the exception of LK52C and the MutL1–331 were able to complement a mutL-mutator phenotype at least 10-fold better than the vector control (Table I). This indicates that none of the residues tested with the exception of Lys52 are hot spots for function in mismatch repair and thus for the interaction with MutL. The MutL variants were purified and assayed for their ability to activate MutH in a mismatch-dependent manner by MutS (Table II). All of the variants with the exception of the MutL1–331 retained the ability to mediate communication between MutS and MutH, in good agreement with our in vivo complementation data. The two variants having the slightly conserved residues LK52C and LQ314C exchanged showed reduced activity in vitro. Moreover, we found only a weak correlation between the degree of conservation and the in vitro activity of MutL in the MutH endonuclease activation assay (data not shown). Photocross-linking of Single Cysteine MutL Variants to MutH—To gain insight into which residues of MutL are in proximity to MutH, photocross-linking experiments were carried out with MBP coupled to cysteine residues in MutL (Fig. 4). MutL variants BP-LN169C and BP-LA251C in the presence of ADPNP and MutH produced a band with low mobility (apparent molecular mass of ∼120–150 kDa) in PAGE analysis. This band was only observed in the presence of MutH and ADPNP and contained both MutL and MutH as verified by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry (see below). In the case of BP-LA251C, BP-LH297C, and BP-LQ314C, a high molecular weight complex was observed, even in the absence of MutH. We attributed this to a MutL·MutL photocross-link. This result was expected for BP-LH297C and BP-LQ314C, because the cysteine residues in these variants were within 12 Å to the other subunit. The results for BP-LA251C were unexpected but may be explained by a more compact structure of MutL in solution compared with the crystal, as observed for yeast topoisomerase IIA (33Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We performed tryptic digests and mass spectrometry analysis of the photocross-link products to confirm the presence of MutH and MutL. We tried to identify any cross-linked peptide that could allow us to determine the position of the photocross-link. For BP-HR172C photocross-linked to MutL, we were able to identify tryptic peptides of both MutH and MutL in the photocross-link product. Unfortunately, no cross-linked peptide or missing peptide could be identified since the sequence coverage for MutL peptides was too low (data not shown). In contrast, an analysis of the tryptic digest of BP-LN169C photocross-linked to MutH allowed us to identify two peptides of MutH that were present in the unmodified form of MutH but were missing in the photocross-linked product (Fig. 5), indicating that these peptides may have been cross-linked to MutL. These peptides, comprising amino acids 153–172 and 156–172, were part of the region in MutH that we had previously identified by interference analysis to be the MutL interaction site (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thiol-Thiol Cross-linking of Single Cysteine MutL and MutH Variants—To obtain a more detailed picture of the MutL·MutH complex, we determined the distance between cysteine residues using various length cross-linkers. Different combinations of single cysteine MutH and MutL variants in complex were subjected to thiol-thiol cross-linking using the homobifunctional cysteine-specific cross-linkers BM[PEO]4, BMOE, and bBBr (Fig. 1). Because the structure of the dimeric MutL1–331 is known, distances between the Cα atoms of cysteine residues for the MutL variants could be measured and compared with experimental results of cross-linking with reagents of different length. As the NTD was shown to dimerize only in the presence of ATP or ADPNP (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we tested for similar nucleotide dependence in the thiol-thiol cross-linking experiments. To minimize the formation of nonspecific cross-links, we used an excess of cross-linker over thiol groups and quenched the reaction by the addition of excess DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). The specificity of the cross-links was assessed by performing experiments with the MutL variants LN131C and LK135C, which have distances between Cα atoms of 26.7 and 48.7 Å, respectively, in the dimeric form of MutL1–331 (Fig. 3). Incubation of MutL variant LN131C, but not LK135C, with the long range cross-linker BM[PEO]4 in the presence of ADPNP resulted in a species with a lower mobility attributed to an L–L dimer (Fig. 6). No cross-links were observed using the shorter cross-linker BMOE or in the absence of ADPNP. Although the 26.7-Å Cα–Cα distance between positions 131 in the MutL1–331 was slightly larger than the 22–23-Å maximum span for Cα–Cα of the cross-linker BM[PEO]4 (using a 2.8-Å Cα–Sγ distance for each cysteine and the reported S–S maximum span of 17.8 Å) our cross-linking data are in agreement with the structure of the dimeric MutL1–331. Single cysteine MutH variants incubated with BM[PEO]4 or BMOE did not result in the formation of significant amounts of cross-links (data not shown). These data indicate that, under our assay conditions, the selected cross-linkers can be used to measure the distance of cysteine residues. We tested a total of 65 combinations of MutL and MutH variants for thiol-thiol cross-linking with BMOE (Fig. 7). Only four combinations resulted in cross-link formation with a yield of >25%, which is significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the average cross-linking yield of <5%. From this analysis, we conclude that the cysteine residues in the complex formed by HS104C/LL327C, HE156C/LQ314C, HR172C/LN169C, and HR172C/LA251C must be at a distance not larger than the range of the BMOE cross-linker. Neither the MutH variants HS85C and HH115C nor any other MutL variant resulted in a significant formation of thiol-thiol cross-links with any of the MutL variants tested, suggesting that these residues are unlikely to be a part of the MutH·MutL interface. These data are in agreement with our previous finding that the modification of the cysteine residues in MutH variants HS104C,HE156C,HV166C,HL167C, and HR172C with bulky reagents (i.e. mPEG 5000) resulted in reduced activation of MutH endonuclease activity by MutL, whereas this was not observed with HS85C and HH115C (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To narrow down the distances between different positions in MutH and MutL, we employed the homobifunctional bBBr with an S–S range of only 3.17–6.61 Å. From the combinations that yielded a significant formation of cross-links using BMOE, only HR172C/LA251C and, to a much lesser extent, HR172C/LN169C were able to form a cross-link using bBBr, implying that these residues are in close proximity within the complex (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Length dependence of thiolthiol cross-linking of single cysteine MutL and MutH variants. Combinations of MutH and MutL variants that gave a significant MutH·MutL complex (L-H) cross-linked with BMOE (Fig. 7) were tested further with bBBr, which spans a smaller range. Only the combination LA251C/HR172C gave a cross-link with this shorter cross-linker. The position of the cysteine residues are indicated in the structure of MutL (top) and MutH (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Model of the MutL·MutH Complex—The program Chemera/BiGGER was used to dock the MutH and MutL proteins and generate a model of the complex (25Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The initial 10,000 docking models were then scored with the results from our thiol-thiol cross-linking experiments using BMOE and/or bBBr. The average score of all of the docking models was 23 ± 12 Å. In contrast, the best ten models had an average score of only 2.2 ± 0.4 Å. In these models (Fig. 9), MutH was located between the two subunits of the dimeric MutL, in good agreement with our previous interference analysis (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, the models suggested an explanation for the dependence of ATP binding and thus dimerization of MutL for interaction and activation of MutH. The binding site was formed by both subunits of the MutL NTD. Previous mutational analyses implicated that the DNA binding site of MutL was located in a deep saddle-shaped groove formed between the two protein subunits, mainly between the transducer domains involving residues Lys159, Arg177, and Arg266 as observed in gyrase B (27Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 34Junop M.S. Yang W. Funchain P. Clendenin W. Miller J.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The DNA binding site of MutH has been determined experimentally using a combination of mutational analyses and structure comparisons (14Toedt G. Krishnan R. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Loh T. Murphy K.C.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In several of our top scoring models, the orientation of the two DNA binding sites suggested that both proteins could, in principle, bind to the same DNA molecule in a side by side manner (Fig. 9). Such an interaction with DNA may be important for the activation of the MutH endonuclease by MutL. Several studies have shown that MutL can interact both with MutH and MutS in the absence of DNA and that MutL can mediate binding of MutH to MutS, explaining the formation of a ternary complex (11Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9861-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the activation mechanism of MutH mediated by MutL is unknown, it has been suggested that a long-lived MutS·MutL·MutH endonuclease-competent intermediate exists (13Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized the physical interactions between MutL and MutH by cross-linking and have demonstrated that (i) ATP-dependent dimerization of the MutL NTD is required for complex formation between MutL and MutH in the presence and absence of DNA, (ii) the MutL NTD is sufficient for physical interaction with MutH, (iii) the interaction site can be mapped to a region comprising residue positions 169, 251, 314, and 327 of MutL and positions 104, 156, and 172 of MutH, and (iv) a low resolution molecular model of the MutL·MutH complex suggests that both proteins can bind to the same DNA molecule."

Although based on its biochemical properties it is unlikely that Rep40 plays a central role as a replicative helicase the involvement of this motor protein in DNA packaging has recently been demonstrated. Here we focused our attention on residues that fall within and adjacent to the B′ motif of SF3 helicases that directly interact with single-stranded DNA during translocation of the motor protein. In vitro, alanine substitution at positions Lys-404 or Lys-406 abrogated the ability of the protein to interact with single-stranded DNA as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and fluorescence anisotropy, and accordingly these mutants could not unwind a partially duplex DNA substrate. Despite this loss of helicase activity, basal ATPase activity in these mutants remained intact. However, unlike the wild-type protein, K404A and K406A ATPase activity was not stimulated by DNA. As predicted, disruption of motor activity through interference with DNA binding resulted in an inability of Rep40 to package adeno-associated virus DNA in a tissue culture-based assay. Taken together, we characterized, for the first time in an SF3 helicase family member, residues that are directly involved in single-stranded DNA binding and that are critical for the Rep motor activity.

However, this categorization has been abandoned since it has become clear that the AAV lifecycle instead reflects a highly regulated system, consisting of both a productive replicative phase and latent infection (for a review, see Ref. 1Berns K.I. Linden R.M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Productive replication occurs in the presence of helper virus functions, which can be provided by either adeno- (2Atchison R.W. Casto B.C. Hammon W.M.

Virol. 1981; 40: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weindler F.W. Heilbronn R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2476-2483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of helper virus coinfection, i.e. in healthy cells, AAV establishes a persistent infection. AAV accomplishes this by site-specifically integrating its genome into a defined locus on chromosome 19 (6Kotin R.M. Siniscalco M. Samulski R.J. Zhu X.D. Hunter L. Laughlin C.A. McLaughlin S. Muzyczka N. Rocchi M. Berns K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The ability of AAV to mediate site-specific integration is a feature that is unique among eukaryotic nuclear viruses and is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the viral life style. The AAV genome is a linear DNA molecule of ∼4.7 kb and is flanked on either side by structural elements known as the inverted terminal repeats (7Srivastava A. Lusby E.W. Berns K.I. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 555-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bohenzky R.A. LeFebvre R.B. Berns K.I. Virology. 1988; 166: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The inverted terminal repeats contain motifs that serve as the viral origin of replication, namely the Rep binding site and terminal resolution site (9Ward P. Berns K.I. Virology. 1995; 209: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The right half of the genome encodes the cap open reading frame, generating the three viral capsid proteins (Vp1, -2, and -3). The left open reading frame, rep, encodes the four nonstructural proteins, Rep78, -68, -52, and -40, each designated according to their apparent molecular weight on high percent SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7Srivastava A. Lusby E.W. Berns K.I. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 555-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mendelson E. Trempe J.P. Carter B.J. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inverted terminal repeats, together with the virally encoded Rep proteins, play an essential role in virtually every aspect of the viral lifecycle. The AAV Rep proteins possess biochemical activities consistent with their role in origin-dependent viral DNA replication, site-specific integration, transcriptional regulation, and virion assembly. These activities are separated into three domains, all of which are present in the largest of the Rep proteins, Rep78. The Rep amino terminus possesses specific DNA binding and endonuclease activity (11Cathomen T. Collete D. Weitzman M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2372-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Davis M.D. Wu J. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), while the central motor domain bears motifs necessary for ATPase and helicase activity as well as the nuclear localization sequence (14Yang Q. Kadam A. Trempe J.P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6058-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain has been implicated in interaction with several cellular factors, although the biological significance of most of these interactions is not yet understood. The remaining Rep isoforms, Rep68, -52, and -40, are a combination of these functional domains arising from alternative splicing schemes and differential promoter usage within the rep open reading frame. Notably all four isoforms possess the motor domain at minimum represented by Rep40. This region is the most highly conserved among the parvoviral nonstructural proteins. Most mutational studies have focused on the conserved helicase domain and have shown that disruptions in ATPase and/or helicase function disrupt several Rep activities whose active sites have been mapped to other domains. These activities include origin-specific DNA binding, endonuclease activity, and the ability to transactivate viral promoters (17McCarty D.M. Ni T.H. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Walker S.L. Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6996-7004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high level of interdependence between biochemical activities, and therefore biophysical domains, together with the redundancy of domain usage between the four Rep isoforms complicates the interpretation of these studies and the development of a consistent molecular model for the role of Rep in the AAV lifecycle. In efforts to address this difficulty, several laboratories have focused their attention on the study of the biophysical characterization of the AAV Rep proteins. These efforts have resulted in the crystal structure for the AAV5-derived Rep endonuclease domain (19Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Perez Z.N. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Mol.

Linden R.M. Aggarwal A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The AAV2 Rep40 helicase is a member of the SF3 helicase family, which includes helicases encoded by small DNA and RNA viruses for which SV40 large T antigen (TAg) serves as the archetype (15Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). SF3 helicases are characterized by four highly conserved regions within a short stretch of ∼100 amino acids: motifs A, B (also known as Walker motifs A and B), and C essentially make up the core of the helicase active site consisting of an NTP binding site, divalent metal cation coordination site, and sensor-1 site, respectively (21Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Although the conservation of the fourth motif, B′, among SF3 helicases has been recognized the role of these residues in DNA unwinding and ATP hydrolysis has not yet been defined on the molecular level (22Kooning E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We have proposed previously that the fourth motif, B′, is involved in single-stranded DNA binding necessary for helicase activity. Significantly Rep40 is structurally related to the AAA+ family of motor proteins (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) (16James J.A. Escalante C.R. Yoon-Robarts M. Edwards T.A.

Characteristic of the AAA+ architecture as well as that of other oligomeric NTPases is the presence of an “arginine finger” that translates ATP hydrolysis into intermolecular conformational changes in the context of a functional oligomeric complex (21Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 23Niedenzu T. Roleke D. Bains G. Scherzinger E. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved arginine finger in Rep abrogates helicase and ATPase function, consistent with a hexameric model for Rep40 (see Fig. 1 in this article, Ref. 16James J.A. Escalante C.R. Yoon-Robarts M. Edwards T.A. Linden R.M. Aggarwal A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, and data not shown). This model is based on superimposition of AAV Rep40 with the recently published SV40 TAg hexamer structure (Fig. 1) (24Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on the structural information provided by our crystallographic studies, we have continued to build on our understanding of AAV Rep motor domain function through the characterization of mutants predicted to play a critical role in Rep helicase activity. In particular, we focused our study on two potential residues, lysines 404 and 406, that fall within and adjacent to the conserved B′ motif, which we had hypothesized to play a role in single-stranded DNA interactions. In further support of the hypothesis that Rep40 motor activity plays a role in viral DNA packaging (25King J.A. Dubielzig R. Grimm D. Kleinschmidt J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Dubielzig R. King J.A. Weger S. Kern A. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8989-8998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that these Rep40 mutants were deficient in the ability to efficiently package AAV DNA into preformed virions. The position of Lys-404 and Lys-406 and their potential for single-stranded binding is illustrated by the models for both the Rep40 monomer and the putative hexamer that are shown in Fig. 1. In the latter model these residues are predicted to line the pore of the hexamer. However, the potential function of these residues is also consistent with a dimeric form of Rep40. Both Rep40K404A and Rep40K406A mutations led to a loss of single-stranded binding activity, helicase activity, and DNA-stimulatable ATPase activity as well as DNA packaging activity. Based on our findings we propose motif B′ as the signature motif of SF3 helicases that is responsible for the complex interactions required for the coupling of DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Cloning of Mutant Rep Expression Constructs—All mutant Rep proteins were generated using pHisRep40/15b, which contains the AAV2 Rep40 gene in a pET15b vector (Novagen). Rep40 variants pHisRep40K340H and pHisRep40R444A were generated by subcloning the region bearing the indicated mutation from already existing plasmids into pHisRep40/15b. Mutants pHisRep40K404A and pHisRep40K406A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For transfection experiments, Rep40 and its variants were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in which the neomycin resistance gene was removed. In all cases, regions generated by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of 293T Cells and Preparation of Viral Supernatants— Transfections were carried out in 10-cm plates (1.5 × 106 cells) using a total of 12 μg of DNA/plate by calcium phosphate precipitation. 16 h post-transfection, the cells were infected by adenovirus type 5 at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and further incubated for 48 h. Cells were then harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thawing (-80 °C and 37 °C). Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation, and the virus-containing supernatants were reserved for further analyses. Determination of Infectious Viral Titer—Infectious titers were determined by replication center assay as described previously (25King J.A. Dubielzig R. Grimm D. Kleinschmidt J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses—Rep and Vp expression was confirmed using monoclonal antibodies 303.9 and B1 specific for the Rep and Vp proteins, respectively, as described previously (28Wistuba A. Weger S. Kern A. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5311-5319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Capsids and Viral DNA for Quantification—Viral supernatants were processed as described in Ref. 25King J.A. Dubielzig R. Grimm D. Kleinschmidt J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar. Total capsid quantification was determined by A20 capsid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (29Grimm D. Kern A. Pawlita M. Ferrari F. Samulski R. Kleinschmidt J. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Encapsidated DNA was quantified by dot blot analysis as described previously (25King J.A. Dubielzig R. Grimm D. Kleinschmidt J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitations—Rep40-capsid complex formation was examined by coimmunoprecipitation as described previously (25King J.A. Dubielzig R. Grimm D. Kleinschmidt J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Dubielzig R. King J.A. Weger S. Kern A. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8989-8998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 293T cells cultured in 10-cm plates were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation using 8 μg of Rep40-expressing plasmid (or pBlueScript as a control) and 4 μg of pCMV-VP (encodes the AAV Vp proteins under the control of the CMV promoter). The cells were harvested 3 days post-transfection, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was reserved for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed in 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (swelled in 10% NET-N buffer) incubated with an anti-Rep polyclonal rabbit antiserum (αRep90). After washing with 100% NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), 100–200 μl of cell lysate was incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to gel electrophoresis prior to Western blot analysis with a monoclonal Vp antibody (B1). Control lysates to verify Rep and Vp detection were prepared from lysates derived from HeLaRC cells (Rep/Cap stable cell line) that were superinfected by adenovirus. Recombinant Protein Isolation—Protein isolation was performed on an AKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences). All recombinant proteins were initially isolated via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography from 1-liter cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells prepared and induced according to the manufacturer's instructions (pET vectors, Novagen). Proteins were eluted in 300 mm imidazole and digested with thrombin to remove the His6 tag at 4 °C overnight while dialyzing against 1× thrombin buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Thrombin cleavage was stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following thrombin cleavage, the protein was dialyzed into MonoS buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl), applied to a 5-ml S/P Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted via continuous gradient formed by Buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 1 m NaCl). His6 tag fragments were removed by reapplying the sample to a HiTrap column after which residual nickel was chelated by the addition of 1 mm EDTA. The protein was then applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP. Prior to storage at -80 °C, the protein was dialyzed into a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using wild-type Rep40, quantified by Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent, as a reference standard. In general, 1-liter bacterial cultures yielded between 2 and 10 mg of recombinant protein. Purity of isolated proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE and determined to be ≥98% for all proteins used in these studies. Proteins used in equilibrium binding experiments were further purified by passage through a Superdex 200 10/30GL column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, 0.2% CHAPS, and 5% glycerol. Following this, the proteins were concentrated using centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an absorbance coefficients of 56,240 and 104,831 m-1 cm-1 for Rep40 and Rep68 proteins, respectively, which were calculated based on amino acid composition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The ability to bind nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA was assayed by gel shift using a single-stranded oligonucleotide substrate (5′-CACTCGGGTCCCTGTCAGCTTTCACTCTAATTCTTGT-3) containing a 5′ biotin label (GeneLink). Assays were performed as follows. In a total reaction volume of 15μl, the indicated amount of protein was incubated with 20 fmol of biotin-labeled DNA in a buffer consisting of: 0.5× TBE, pH 8.3, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 3 μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue in 0.5× TBE). Reactions were incubated for 45 min at room temperature, loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE, and run at 18 V/cm. The DNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane (MagnaGraph, Osmonics Inc.) and UV cross-linked. Visualization of protein-DNA complexes was performed using the LightShift chemiluminescence EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The same single-stranded oligonucleotide substrate, 5′-CACTCGGGTCCCTGTCAGCTTTCACTCTAATTCTTGT-3), was kinase-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a MEGALABEL kit (Takara Bio Inc.) and then isolated on an 8% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE gel. Following gel isolation, overnight elution into Tris-EDTA, and ethanol precipitation, the oligo concentration was determined from cpm measured by liquid scintillation. The radiolabeled EMSAs were performed at 4 °C as follows. In a total reaction volume of 15μl, the indicated amount of protein was incubated with 50 fmol of radiolabeled DNA in a buffer consisting of 0.5× TBE, pH 8.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose in 0.5× TBE). Reactions were incubated for 45 min at room temperature, loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE, and run at 18 V/cm. Standard DNA Helicase Assay—The ability of Rep40 to unwind DNA was assessed using an M13-based partially duplex substrate as described previously (16James J.A. Escalante C.R. Yoon-Robarts M. Edwards T.A. Linden R.M. Aggarwal A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Except where indicated, helicase reactions contained 14 pmol of Rep40, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5fmol of M13 DNA substrate in a total reaction volume of 15 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Colorimetric ATPase Assay—ATP hydrolysis was measured as a function of the liberation of inorganic phosphate. Assays were performed in 96-well plates using 0.5 μg of Rep and, where indicated, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene). Color detection to measure the amount of inorganic phosphate released was performed as described previously (30Huber M.D. Lee D.C. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3954-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar, 32Smith R.H. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4874-4881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following initial incubation at 37 °C for 45 min under helicase assay buffer conditions (15 μl), 200 μl of color reagent (0.034% malachite green, 1.05% ammonium molybdate, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 n HCl) was added to the reaction. After a 2-min incubation, 25 μl of 34% citric acid was added to quench the reaction, and color development was allowed to proceed for 25 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 660 nm was measured, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was quantified by comparison to a standard KH2PO4 curve (phosphate standard solution, Sigma). Error bars were calculated based on three independent assays. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed on a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (Panvera). The DNA substrate used was a single-stranded oligo(dT)38 modified by a 5′ 6-carboxyfluorescein molecule (integrated DNA technologies). In a reaction volume of 100 μl containing final concentrations of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, protein and substrate (final concentration, 5 nm) were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min prior to measurement. The fraction of DNA bound (B) was calculated using Equation 1,B=([A]x−[A]DNA)/([A]FINAL−[A]DNA)(Eq.1) Where [A]X equals the anisotropy measured at protein concentration X, [A]DNA is the anisotropy measured in absence of protein, and [A]FINAL is the anisotropy value at saturation. Each sample emission was corrected by subtraction of the buffer emission background. Each data point was calculated from the average of five anisotropy measurements. Initial fitting was done using the program Origin™ (OriginLab), and subsequently the data were fitted using DynaFit (33Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Identification of Potential ssDNA Binding Mutants within the Motor Domain of AAV2 Rep40 —Fig. 1A highlights the positions of Lys-404 and Lys-406 within the monomer structure of Rep40 that we have determined recently. In addition, based on superposition onto the hexamer structure of SV40 T-antigen solved by Li et al. (24Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) we generated a hexameric model for Rep40 shown in Fig. 1B. An ∼18-Å pore through which single-stranded DNA can pass during the process of DNA unwinding is formed in this model (16James J.A. Escalante C.R. Yoon-Robarts M. Edwards T.A. Linden R.M. Aggarwal A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protruding into the central pore are a series of loops, analogous to those found in other hexameric helicases, that we hypothesized to play a role in single-stranded DNA interactions (23Niedenzu T. Roleke D. Bains G. Scherzinger E. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In Rep40, the loop is part of a β-hairpin that projects from the core of the protein and is located between motifs B and C. Residues that reside in the first half of this hairpin (strand βa) form part of the B′ motif. Residues 404 and 406 (designated according to their position within the Rep68 sequence), which fall within and just outside the B′ motif, respectively, are located at the tip of the β-hairpin and may be involved in DNA interactions. Rep40 Residues Lys-404 and Lys-406 Are Required for Single-stranded DNA Interactions—To assess the potential role of Lys-404 and Lys-406 in single-stranded DNA interactions in the context of Rep40 motor activity, alanine mutants were generated and isolated as recombinant proteins in bacterial cultures. The Rep40 variants were then tested for their ability to interact with ssDNA as measured by EMSA. The ability of both Rep40K404A and Rep40K406A to bind to the single-stranded DNA probe was severely diminished compared with the wild-type counterpart (Fig. 2A). While the ability for DNA binding by K404A was lost (Fig. 2A, top panel), K406A retained weak ssDNA binding activity although only at the highest concentrations tested (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). To exclude the possibility of a Rep interaction with biotin, we performed EMSAs using a radiolabeled substrate. The results of these assays were in agreement with those shown in Fig. 2A (data not shown). To further examine the influence of these residues on ssDNA interaction, we carried out equilibrium binding assays using fluorescence anisotropy. The resulting binding isotherms are shown in Fig. 2B. The dissociation constant (KD) determined for Rep40 is 2.7 μm. In the case of mutants Rep40K404A and Rep40K406A, the isotherms showed a drastic reduction in their ability to bind DNA with an estimated KD of >100 μm. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain saturation due to the tendency of these mutants to precipitate at high concentration. Overall these results are consistent with the hypothesis that these residues play a central role in ssDNA binding. Interestingly, under the reaction conditions used, DNA binding did not require the presence of an NTP or analog as has been demonstrated for other hexameric helicases (for a review, see Ref. 36Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Biochemical Characterization of Wild-type AAV2 Rep40 Helicase Activity—To assess the motor activity of the K404A and K406A variants, standard assays were developed using the wild-type Rep40 protein. Helicase assays were performed using an M13mp18-based substrate to which a short oligo (20-mer) was annealed. As shown in Fig. 3A (left panel), wild-type Rep40 isolated from bacterial cell cultures was active in ou"

Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian and insect IAPs have been found to modulate apoptosis activated by a large number of pathways. IAPs inhibit apoptosis, at least in part, by binding to caspases and inhibiting their function (3Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Two zinc-binding domains define the IAPs: baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains and a ring domain. The BIR domains and nearby sequences are required to inhibit caspase function (5Chai J. Yan N.

The IAP ring domain E3 ubiquitin ligase function has been implicated both in autoregulation of DIAP1 stability and in turnover of other proteins. Depending on the target, this E3 ubiquitin ligase function can either inhibit or promote apoptosis. For example, mutations in the ring domain have been shown to stabilize DIAP1 (7Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Increased DIAP1 is expected to promote survival, as the probability that cells will undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli is extremely sensitive to the levels of IAP (27Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar, 29Goyal L. McCall K.

DIAP1 is rapidly degraded in response to Hid or Rpr expression, and this loss is proposed to require E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J.

Nambu J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the ring domain of DIAP1 enhance rather than suppress killing by some apoptosis inducers in vivo (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that a simple model in which IBM protein binding stimulates DIAP1 degradation cannot explain the function of DIAP1 in vivo. In addition, DIAP1 is cleaved in apoptotic cells in response to Rpr expression (35Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The relationship between DIAP1 cleavage, DIAP1 degradation, and inhibition of apoptosis is unclear. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the DIAP1 ring domain has also been implicated in the degradation of the pro-apoptotic Rpr, Hid, and Grim proteins and in the degradation of caspases (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 36MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B.

A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). These functions would be expected to inhibit apoptosis. Thus, the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the ring domain may be both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic. When all of these findings are taken together, IAPs seem to be able to perform a number of different functions in apoptosis that would have different outcomes in the cell. A variety of assay systems have been used to assess the relative importance of these diverse functions. However, it is clear that the role in vivo, as assessed by genetics, does not always match the findings in more biochemically tractable systems. For example, mutant forms of DIAP1 that show significant specificity for inhibiting Rpr- or Hid-induced death in vivo are relatively nonspecific on overexpression (28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar). To address this issue, we developed a novel technique to replace wild-type DIAP1 in S2 cells with DIAP1 carrying mutations in different functional domains. This strategy has allowed us to dissect the role of these domains both in living cells and in Rpr- and Hid-induced apoptosis. We have found that this system accurately recapitulates much of the specificity seen with DIAP1 mutants in vivo. In addition, this system allowed us to examine the fate of DIAP1 at very early times after Rpr and Hid expression. This is important, as Rpr and Hid induce apoptosis within 2–4 h in vivo. Most assays examine the fate of DIAP1 12 or more hours after Rpr or Hid expression. Caspase-mediated cleavage of DIAP1 was found to be an early step in DIAP1 degradation in Rpr- and Hid-induced cell death (this work and Ref. 35Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Inhibition of caspase activity resulted in the maintenance of high DIAP1 levels. Caspase activation in response to Rpr or Hid binding thus acts upstream of DIAP1 degradation. In this work, we show that, even in the absence of DIAP1 cleavage, Rpr and Hid still induce apoptosis. This supports the idea that the binding of IBM proteins to DIAP1 displaces caspases, independently of DIAP1 degradation (5Chai J. Yan N. Huh J.R. Wu J.W. Li W. Hay B.A. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Yan N. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These caspases then act to promote DIAP1 degradation, providing a feed-forward mechanism to amplify the pro-apoptotic signal. In the mutant replacement system, as in previous assays, the DIAP1 ring domain was found to play an important role in DIAP1 turnover in living cells (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A.

Nambu J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, in dying cells, loss of ring domain function had little effect on Rpr-induced apoptosis. Hid-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by mutations in the ring domain, corresponding to what is seen in vivo (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we found that mutations in the ring domain result in the persistence of the cleaved form of DIAP1, and this inhibits Hid-induced apoptosis. The strength of this replacement assay system is best illustrated by the considerable correlation between the effects of DIAP1 mutations as assayed in this system and in vivo. Our data provide a more consistent picture of what happens to DIAP1 in dying cells. Taken together, our results allow us to understand what happens in cells as they begin to die and suggest that the primary event in DIAP1 inactivation is displacement of the caspase and that degradation of DIAP1 is a secondary event that is not required for apoptosis initiation. Finally, these data allow us to propose a model that explains how particular mutations in DIAP1 are able to specifically inhibit Rpr- or Hid-induced apoptosis. Expression Vectors—To express Rpr or Hid, the coding sequences were inserted into the pRmHa-3 vector, yielding pMT-Rpr or pMT-Hid, respectively (50Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding DIAP16B and DIAP1th7 were obtained by PCR as described previously (28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into pBluescript (Stratagene). Mutants DIAP1D20A and DIAP1N21G were generated using site-directed mutagenesis with the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). To express various form of DIAP1, the DIAP1 coding sequence with an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag was inserted into the pAc5.1 vector (Invitrogen), yielding pAc-DIAP1. S2 Cell Culture and Endogenous DIAP1 Levels—SL2 cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cells (5 × 106) were seeded into 12.5-cm2 flasks in 3 ml of medium 1 h before transfection. For Rpr or Hid expression 3 μg of pMT-Rpr or 3.75 μg of pMT-Hid were used. Cells were transfected using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), resulting in transfection efficiencies of 50–70%. Forty hours after transfection, cells were split in four and treated with induction medium (Schneider's Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 700 μm CuSO4 with or without 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAL-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) (Calbiochem) and/or 5 μm MG132 (Calbiochem)). After 3 h of induction, cells were harvested in 150 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Replacement Experiment—SL2 cells were seeded as described above. Cells were transfected with 0.9 μg of pAc-DIAP1 with or without 3 μg of pMT-Rpr or 3.75 μg of pMT-Hid and/or 0.5 μg of pIE-GFP. 2P. Bangs, unpublished data. At 40 h post-transfection, cells were split in four and seeded in a 24-well plate. Cells were treated with RNA interference (RNAi) medium (Schneider's Drosophila medium containing 16 μg/ml DIAP1 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or green fluorescent protein dsRNA) for 30 min, and then an equal volume of Schneider's Drosophila medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. Cells were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. In the presence of exogenous wild-type DIAP1, all of the remaining cells expressed green fluorescent protein after RNAi treatment. To induce apoptosis, an equal volume of Schneider's Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.1 mm CuSO4 was added. After 90, 180, or 270 min of induction, cells were harvested in 150 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Western Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described by Wing et al. (34Wing J.P. Schreader B.A. Yokokura T. Wang Y. Andrews P.S. Huseinovic N. Dong C.K. Ogdahl J.L. Schwartz L.M. White K. Nambu J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), except that anti-DIAP1 antibody was used at 1:7500 dilution. Protein concentration was measured in lysates diluted 1:10 using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of each sample were mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer (200 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) and 100 mm dithiothreitol, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 10% Ready-Gel polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Assay for Caspase Activity—The assay was performed essentially as described by Zimmerman et al. (51Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, total cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were incubated with 20 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Calbiochem) in 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After a 1-h incubation, the fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was determined in a spectrophotometer set to an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and a detection wavelength of 460 nm. Caspase activity was normalized to the control condition and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three readings. Elevated caspase activity corresponds to early stages of apoptosis as detected by morphological changes. Student's t tests were used in statistical analysis. Immunostaining of S2 Cells—SL2 cells were seeded as described above. Cells were transfected with 0.9 μg of pAc-DIAP1 or pAc-GFP. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were transferred to a chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) and cultured for 4 h. Cells were treated with RNAi medium as described above. After a 24-h incubation, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, stained with affinity-purified anti-DIAP1 antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody(1:200 dilution; ICN/Cappel), and visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. In Drosophila, the initiation of apoptosis by Rpr or Hid is extremely rapid. Expression of Rpr or Hid in the Drosophila embryo induces significant apoptosis within 1–2 h (39Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Agapite J. White K. Steller H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 40White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To understand how apoptosis is initiated by these proteins, we characterized the events at very early times after the induction of Rpr or Hid expression using an inducible expression system in S2 cells. Effects of Rpr and Hid on Endogenous DIAP1—To determine whether a reduction in DIAP1 levels correlates with the initiation of death, we examined the fate of endogenous DIAP1 at short times after the induction of Rpr or Hid expression. We found that endogenous DIAP1 was very rapidly degraded in dying S2 cells (Fig. 1). Within 3 h of Rpr expression, all of the full-length DIAP1 was gone. Hid induced DIAP1 loss at a somewhat slower rate, although by 3 h, almost all of the full-length DIAP1 was lost. Caspase activation was dramatically elevated at this time (Fig. 1B). We conclude that loss of full-length DIAP1 is temporally correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Previous work has demonstrated that DIAP1 is cleaved by caspases upon induction of apoptosis by Rpr, cycloheximide, and UV light (35Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We detected a single cleavage fragment of DIAP1 after apoptosis induction by Rpr or Hid. The appearance of this band was blocked by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or expression of the baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 (Fig. 1) (data not shown), indicating that the appearance of the band depends on the activity of caspases. In addition, mutation of a caspase cleavage site at Asp20 blocked the appearance of this band (see below), indicating that the smaller band corresponds to DIAP121–438 (DIAP1Δ20), reported by Ditzel et al. (35Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that caspase activity was required for the loss of DIAP1 early in apoptosis. Addition of Z-VAD-fmk to the cultures blocked DIAP1 loss at 3 h after apoptosis initiation by Rpr or Hid. This indicates that, early in the induction of apoptosis, caspase activity is required for DIAP1 degradation. These data suggest that cleavage of DIAP1 at Asp20 activates DIAP1 degradation. Evidence from numerous laboratories demonstrates that DIAP1 turnover is mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation (26Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H.

Nambu J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the role of proteasome activity in the degradation of DIAP1 in response to Rpr or Hid expression, we added the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In living cells, we saw a significant increase in DIAP1 levels in the presence of MG132. This confirms that proteasome-mediated degradation plays a major role in DIAP1 turnover in living cells. However, in dying cells, proteasome inhibitors only slightly increased the level of full-length DIAP1, and caspase activation was not inhibited. A much more dramatic increase was seen in the level of cleaved DIAP1. We conclude that the cleaved form of DIAP1 is degraded by the proteasome. In addition, these data indicate that inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein degradation is unable to block caspase activation in dying cells. This suggests that the previously reported apoptosis inhibitory effects of mutations in the proteasome pathway might be due to increased DIAP1 in cells prior to the induction of apoptosis (31Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Ryoo H.D. Bergmann A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Steller H. Nat.

Dissection of Functional Domains Using a Mutant Replacement System—Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in DIAP1 have been isolated as modifiers of Rpr- and Hid-induced apoptosis in the Drosophila eye (27Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 28Lisi S. Mazzon I. White K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar, 29Goyal L. McCall K. Agapite J. Hartwieg E. Steller H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Many of these mutations affect domains of DIAP1 predicted to play a role in ubiquitin ligase function or in binding to caspases or IBM proteins. We wanted to assay the effect of these mutations on DIAP1 degradation and on Rpr- and Hid-induced apoptosis. As demonstrated above, the S2 cell system is particularly useful to follow the fate of DIAP1 at early times after cell death induction. Although mutant forms of DIAP1 can easily be expressed in these cells, we found that overexpression resulted in a number of artifacts. For example, overexpression of wild-type DIAP1 blocked or significantly delayed apoptosis induced by Rpr or Hid (data not shown). In addition, expression of some mutant forms of DIAP1 inhibited the normal apoptosis-associated loss of both the transfected and endogenous proteins (data not shown). To avoid these problems, we generated S2 cells that expressed only the transfected form of DIAP1. Endogenous DIAP1 was eliminated by RNAi, whereas relatively low levels of exogenous wild-type or mutant DIAP1 were expressed from a constitut"

We found that polyarginine inhibited significantly human immunodeficiency virus-1 replication at concentrations that were benign to cell cultures ex vivo and mice in vivo. Using a fluorogenic assay, we demonstrated that polyarginine potently inhibited substrate-specific proteolytic cleavage by furin. Moreover, we verified that authentic processing of human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp160 synthesized in human cells from an infectious human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) molecular clone was effectively blocked by polyarginine.

Over 40 million individuals globally are infected with HIV. In 2002 alone, more than 3 million people died from AIDS. Arguably, the “best” current treatment regimen is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which uses combinations of inhibitors targeting HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase. Although HAART has achieved widespread acceptance, its efficacy is limited by severe drug side effects, poor patient compliance, and the emergence of drug-resistant virus. New chemotherapeutics aimed at additional HIV-1 targets may ameliorate some of the problems associated with HAART. Such new approaches need to be urgently considered. The envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1 is essential for receptor binding and membrane fusion during infection. Env is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (gp160) that oligomerizes to form a trimer (1Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 2Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is transported through the trans-Golgi network. In the trans-Golgi network, Env is cleaved by the cellular protease furin into surface (gp120) and transmembrane (gp41) subunits. Cleavage of gp160 occurs at a conserved Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg sequence (3Kowalski M. Potz J. Basiripour L. Dorfman T. Goh W.C. Terwilliger E. Dayton A. Rosen C. Haseltine W. Sodroski J.

Mutagenesis of the Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg sequence produces noninfectious HIV-1 particles containing unprocessed gp160 (4McCune J.M. Rabin L.B. Feinberg M.B. Lieberman M. Kosek J.C. Reyes G.R. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1988; 53: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This finding establishes the importance of furin-mediated processing for virus infectivity. Accordingly, there is emerging interest in identifying and developing anti-HIV-1 compounds that inhibit gp160 processing (5Bahbouhi B. Chazal N. Seidah N.G. Chiva C. Kogan M. Albericio F. Giralt E.

Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Furin is a member of the mammalian subtilisin-related proprotein convertases (PCs). This family of proteases is involved in cellular metabolism and in the processing of bacterial toxins as well as viral coat proteins. Two previously reported furin inhibitors are the family of chloromethylketone- and decanolyderivatized proteins (6Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 7Stieneke-Grober A. Vey M. Angliker H. Shaw E. Thomas G. Roberts C. Klenk H.D. Garten W.

Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors can block gp160 processing. However, complications with toxicity of chloromethylketones have been reported (9Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Moulard M. Decroly E. Biochim. Biophys.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and derivatized proteins can be complex to synthesize and difficult to produce in large quantities. Additionally, α1-PDX has limited effectiveness in inhibiting PC7, the other major proprotein convertase expressed in lymphocytes (12Decroly E. Benjannet S. Savaria D. Seidah N.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Hallenberger S. Moulard M. Sordel M. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is unable to durably inhibit HIV replication (14Bahbouhi B. Seidah N.G. Bahraoui E. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides those inhibitors, peptides that mimic the Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg sequence have been reported to block furin activity in vitro and in vivo (8Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol.

Specifically, poly-l-arginine (polyR) has been published as a furin inhibitor (9Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Based on the requirement for furin cleavage of gp160 in HIV infectivity, we reasoned that polyR might be a useful anti-HIV-1 compound. Here, we report that productive HIV-1 replication in T-cell lines (MT4 and Jurkat), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and macrophages is abrogated effectively by polyR treatment. We show that the mechanism of polyR inhibition is through its blocking of gp160 cleavage by furin. Further, concentrations of polyR effective against HIV-1 replication are non-toxic to cultured cells ex vivo or to mice in vivo, suggesting the utility of this compound as a novel candidate therapeutic for AIDS. Reagents—polyR (molecular weight 8,500–13,000) and poly-l-lysine (polyK; molecular weight 4,000–15,000) were purchased from Sigma. Azidothymidine (AZT) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Plasmids—HIV-1 molecular clones pNL4-3 (17Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pAD8 (18Theodore T.S. Englund G. Buckler-White A. Buckler C.E. Martin M.A. Peden K.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were used. The furin expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health) and expresses furin from the CMV immediate-early promoter. Porcine TGF-β expression vector, pTGFb, was from Dr. Seong-jin Kim (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Cell Culture and Infection—MT-4, Jurkat, and human PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). 5 × 105/ml MT-4 cells in a 5-ml volume of complete medium were preincubated for 15 min with polyR and AZT at the indicated concentrations and were infected with 102 or 103 RT counts/ml HIV-1 NL4-3 virus. Jurkat cells were infected using 1 × 106 RT counts/ml virus. 40% of the cell suspension was removed every 2–3 days and replaced with an equivalent volume of complete medium containing the same amount of polyR as at the start. Supernatants were stored at–20 °C until tested for RT activity. PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (2 μg/ml) and interleukin-2 (20 units/ml) in RPMI 1640 for 2 days and then maintained with interleukin-2 only. PBMCs (1 × 106 cells) were preincubated with polyR for 15 min and then infected with 1 × 105 RT counts/ml HIV-1 NL4-3. Samples were collected every 2 or 3 days for subsequent RT assays, and wells were replenished with an equivalent volume of complete medium with or without polyR and AZT. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (1 mg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). MDM (differentiated for 10 days in medium containing 1000 units/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor) were infected with 2 × 104 RT counts/ml HIV-1 AD8 and incubated with or without polyR. Half of the medium was replenished every 3 days with complete medium with or without polyR. Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Internally Quenched Fluorogenic Substrate—Purified human furin was purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). PC7 cDNA was cloned into pET30c vector. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purification of His-tagged PC7 protein from Escherichia coli were performed using nickel beads according to standard protocols. Fluorometric assays were performed in 2 ml of assay buffer, containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 μm internally quenched fluorescent substrate Avz-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-Gly-Leu-Ala-Tyr(NO2)-Asp-OH (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) at room temperature. Furin (0.25 μm) was added (final enzyme concentration 0.5 nm) to the reaction, and the fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was measured with a fluorospectrometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrence, NJ) (320-nm excitation, 425-nm emission). Following furin addition, inhibitors were added at the indicated intervals. Relative inhibition was based on the change in the slope of fluorescence generated by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate by furin. Purified PC7 was added to a 200-μl volume containing protease assay buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and 50 μm Boc-RVRR-AMC (Bachem). Inhibition of proteolysis was measured by adding different concentrations of polyR. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 10 mm. Liberated AMC was detected with Wallac 1420 Victor multilabel plate reader (380-excitation/460-emission) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blotting—Proteins (20 μg/lane) were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry procedure (19Kibler K.V. Shors T. Perkins K.B. Zeman C.C. Banaszak M.P. Biesterfeldt J. Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1992-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Signals were detected using x-ray film and analyzed using the NIH Image 1.62 program. The antibodies used were as follows. Human HIV immunoglobulin (HIV-Ig™) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, rabbit anti-gp160 (R160) was kindly provided by R. L. Willey (20Willey R.L. Smith D.H. Lasky L.A. Theodore T.S. Earl P.L. Moss B. Capon D.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 139-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken anti-TGF-β was from R&D Systems. Toxicity Assays—5 × 105/ml MT-4 cells were incubated with and without polyR at concentrations of 0.5 or 1.0 μm or AZT at a concentration of 1.0 μm. 40% of the cell suspension medium was removed every 2 or 3 days and replaced with an equivalent volume of complete medium with the same amount of polyR or AZT as at the start. On each harvest, 100 μl of each cell suspension was measured for viability using the Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Gaithersburg, MD) according to manufacturer's instructions as described previously (21Kasai T. Iwanaga Y. Iha H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5187-5193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek). The percentage of viability of cells incubated with compounds was determined by the formula (OD of treated cells)/(OD of untreated cells) × 100. MDMs were incubated with or without polyR, and cell viability was assayed 2 weeks later. For in vivo assays, 8–10-week-old BALB/c mice (Taconic; Germantown, NY) were divided into seven groups, and each group was administered intraperitoneally 10 μl/g of body weight of either polyR or polyK at concentrations of 35, 350, or 700 μm (to achieve final tissue concentrations of 0.5, 5, or 10 μm respectively) or normal saline. Mice were injected once/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks and sacrificed for necropsy. Fluorescent Labeling and Cellular Uptake—Rhodamine labeling of polyR and bovine serum albumin was performed by FluoReporter tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide protein labeling kit (Geneprobe) as described previously (22Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 1 μm rhodamine-labeled polyR, 1 μm rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin, or 1 μm rhodamine alone. To verify that the uptake of polyR is saturable, non-labeled 1 μm polyR was added to the medium followed by the addition of the fluorescent-labeled polyR (1 μm). The intracellular distribution of rhodamine label was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Micro System). Env Protein and in Vitro Enzymatic Digestion—Purified gp160 LAV (T-tropic) envelope protein was purchased from Protein Sciences Corp. (Meriden, CT). For furin digestions, 0.2 μg (∼12 pmol) of gp160 was incubated at 30 °C for 16 h in assay buffer with 2 units of furin in the presence or absence of inhibitors at a final volume of 50 μl. The digests were then analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry measurements were performed using Image Gauge V.3.45 (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Gp160 cleavage efficiency was calculated by the formula (density of gp120 band)/(combined gp120 + gp160 bands) after background density was subtracted. Expression of gp160 in transfected cells was performed using pCMVEnv + pCMVRev. Both are CMV immediate-early promoter driven plasmids containing the HIV-1 Env or Rev open reading frames, respectively. polyR Inhibits Productive HIV-1 Infection of T-cells and Macrophages—Based on the report that Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg (9Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) is a potent inhibitor of furin, we investigated whether polyR would inhibit HIV-1 replication. We treated the T-cell line, MT-4, with or without polyR for 15 min and then infected the cells with 103 or 102 RT counts/ml HIV-1 NL4-3, a T-cell tropic CXCR4-co-receptor utilizing virus (17Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture supernatants were collected every 2 days, and RT activities were measured (20Willey R.L. Smith D.H. Lasky L.A. Theodore T.S. Earl P.L. Moss B. Capon D.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 139-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). polyR, at 0.5 μm, completely inhibited HIV-1 replication in MT-4 cells (Fig. 1A, left, and right, lanes 1–4), and this inhibitory profile was comparable with that achieved by AZT at 1.0 μm (Fig. 1A, left, and right, lanes 9–10). Next, we repeated the assay using Jurkat cells infected with 1 × 106 RT counts/ml HIV-1 NL4-3. Here, polyR (1.0 μm) also abrogated productive HIV-1 infection (Fig. 1B). Additionally, we asked whether polyR would be effective in primary T-cells. Thus, we treated human PBMCs with 1.0 μm polyR and then infected cells with 1 × 105 RT counts/ml HIV-1 NL4-3. When compared with mock-treated PBMCs, which replicated virus robustly, little to no HIV-1 production was seen in polyR-treated PBMCs (Fig. 1C). These results support a general property of polyR to inhibit HIV-1 replication in various T-cells. We wondered next whether polyR would also inhibit HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 uses the CCR5 co-receptor and is the predominant viral phenotype found in newly infected individuals (23Rich E.A. Orenstein J.M. Jeang K.T. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24van't Wout A.B. Kootstra N.A. Mulder-Kampinga G.A. Albrecht-van Lent N. Scherpbier H.J. Veenstra J. Boer K. Coutinho R.A. Miedema F. Schuitemaker H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2060-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 25Zhu T. Mo H. Wang N. Nam D.S. Cao Y. Koup R.A. Ho D.D. Science. 1993; 261: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). To query for effectiveness, we tested polyR against HIV-1 AD8 (a CCR5-using virus)-infected macrophages (MDMs). When compared with mock-treated macrophages, HIV-1 replication in polyR-treated macrophages was also significantly suppressed (Fig. 1D). Lack of polyR Toxicity in Cell Culture and in Mice—The virus-inhibitory effects of polyR are meaningful only if they are not trivial manifestations of cytotoxicity. To address this issue, we employed a colorimetric assay (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8)) to monitor the cellular viability of polyR-treated cells. We incubated MT-4 cells with polyR at either 0.5 or 1.0 μm or with 1.0 μm AZT (Fig. 2A) as control. When compared with AZT-treated cells, 0.5 or 1.0 μm polyR-treated cells were comparable in viability over the 12-day assay period. We also checked for toxicity in macrophages. At a polyR concentration of 2.0 μm, which effectively suppressed HIV-1 replication, no toxicity was observed in macrophages over a 2-week incubation period (Fig. 2B). We next asked whether polyR has in vivo toxicity in mice. We injected mice (in groups of five) intraperitoneally with daily drug boluses calculated to achieve final body polyR (or polyK) distributions of 0.5, 5, and 10 μm. The injected animals were monitored for 5 weeks. polyR-dosed mice were compared with counterparts administered with either normal saline or polyK. As shown in Fig. 3, groups of mice injected with the highest concentrations of polyR or polyK such as to achieve final body distributions of 10 μm succumbed quickly. Necropsies of these mice, however, provided no evidence for systemic organ or tissue toxicity (data not shown). Interestingly, these mice did reveal localized chemical peritonitis, suggesting that deaths occurred not from generalized toxicity but from local tissue shock induced by bolus administration of highly concentrated poly-basic solutions (i.e. polyR or polyK). On the other hand, virtually all mice injected with a lower concentration of polyR or polyK (i.e. calculated to achieve final body distributions <5.0 μm) thrived. At the conclusion of 5 weeks (or at the time of unexpected death), all mice were sacrificed, and blood and major organ systems were examined. No abnormalities were found in any of the blood cell counts, liver, and renal functions or in the histological examinations of tissue sections from all major organs (data not shown). Thus, excluding localized chemical peritonitis induced by highly concentrated bolus injections, polyR and polyK administered daily over 5 weeks are not significantly toxic in mice. polyR Inhibits Furin Activity—Having documented above that polyR inhibited HIV-1 replication in various cells, we next sought to understand its mechanism of action. Based on findings in the literature, one reasonable hypothesis is that polyR interferes with the furin-mediated processing of HIV-1 gp160. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether polyR can directly inhibit furin activity in vitro. Abz-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-Gly-Leu-Ala-Tyr(NO2)-Asp-OH is a substrate that is efficiently cleaved by furin with a Kcat/Km value more than 2000-fold higher than that of the commonly used Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (10Moulard M. Decroly E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We examined whether polyR could inhibit furin cleavage of fluorogenic Abz-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-Gly-Leu-Ala-Tyr(NO2)-Asp-OH. When commercially purified furin (final enzyme concentration 0.25 μm) was added to reaction buffer containing fluorogenic substrate, an increase in fluorescence, proportional to the amount of substrate cleavage by enzyme, was observed (Fig. 4A). We also compared the control addition of buffer vehicle (Fig. 4B) or the addition of polyR into the reaction to final concentrations of 0.01 or 0.05 μm (Fig. 4, C and D). In the latter instances, polyR caused a dose-dependent halt in fluorescence, consistent with inhibition of furin-mediated cleavage of substrate. polyR Is Taken up Efficiently into Cells—HIV-1 gp160 is synthesized and cleaved intracellularly (3Kowalski M. Potz J. Basiripour L. Dorfman T. Goh W.C. Terwilliger E. Dayton A. Rosen C. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. Science. 1987; 237: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 4McCune J.M. Rabin L.B. Feinberg M.B. Lieberman M. Kosek J.C. Reyes G.R. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1988; 53: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To check that the observed polyR-effect on HIV-1 might be manifested through suppression of gp160 processing by furin, we wished to verify that polyR is efficiently taken up by cells. From as early as 1965, cationic macromolecules have been reported to enter cells (22Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 26Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Park J. Ryu J. Kim K.A. Lee H.J. Bahn J.H. Han K. Choi E.Y. Lee K.S. Kwon H.Y. Choi S.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Ryser H.J. Hancock R. Science. 1965; 150: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of uptake has not been conclusively defined, recent reports suggest that internalization of domains containing a high content of arginine or lysine is accomplished through endocytosis and subsequent vesicular egress (30Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 31Fuchs S.M. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We anticipated that polyR might behave similarly. To verify this, we conjugated polyR with tetramethylrhodamine creating a fluorescent moiety (rhodamine-polyR). Using fluorescent microscopy, we then monitored the uptake over time of rhodamine-polyR into live HeLa cells. Indeed, fluorescent polyR was efficiently internalized into cells within 3 h (Fig. 5C). By comparison, rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin or rhodamine dye alone failed to enter cells (Fig. 5, A and B). When we competed rhodamine-labeled polyR (1 μm) with unlabeled-polyR (1 μm), intracellular fluorescence was markedly diminished (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the cellular uptake of polyR was saturable. polyR Inhibits HIV-1 gp160 Processing by Furin—Above, we showed that polyR suppressed HIV-1 replication in T-cells and macrophages (Fig. 1) and that polyR inhibited furin cleavage of a fluorescent peptide substrate (Fig. 4). The two observations suggest, but do not prove, that suppression of HIV-1 replication by polyR may be mediated through its interference of gp160 processing by furin. To link more directly the two findings, we wished to determine whether polyR directly interferes with gp160 processing. We therefore asked whether polyR can inhibit in vitro cleavage of purified gp160 by furin. When we incubated gp160 with furin at 30 °C for 16 h, ∼40% of the starting material was cleaved to gp120 and gp41 (Fig. 6, lane 2). When the same furin-assay was repeated but with the addition of 0.5 μm polyR to the reaction (lane 3), we observed that all input gp160 remained uncleaved. As a control for specificity, the addition of 1 μm AZT to a furin reaction did not impair gp160 cleavage (Fig. 6, lane 4). The inhibition of gp160 cleavage by furin in vitro prompted us to investigate next whether polyR suppresses intracellular gp160 processing. We transfected HeLa cells with the HIV-1 molecular clone, pNL4-3, and analyzed gp160 processing in the presence or absence of polyR treatment (Fig. 7). In pNL4-3-transfected cells, gp160 monitored over 48 (lane 1) and 72 h (lane 4) was processed into gp120 and gp41. By contrast, gp160 processing was distinctly reduced in cells treated with either 0.5 (lanes 2 and 5) or 1 (lanes 3 and 6) μm polyR. By 72 h after transfection, the total gp160/gp120/gp41 protein had a slight diminution in the presence of inhibitor when compared with untreated cells, whereas p55 Gag levels remained stable.

We wondered whether our polyR conditions used for furin would also be effective against PC7. Since purified PC7 is not commercially available, we expressed the cDNA for this convertase in E. coli and purified overexpressed protein to homogeneity as assessed by Coomassie-blue staining (Fig. 8A, lane 3). When we used purified PC7 in an in vitro assay, cleavage of fluorogenic substrate was indeed potently inhibited by polyR (Fig. 8B).

Although known to introduce proteolytic susceptibility, the detailed structural consequences of cysteine substitutions in cbEGF domains are unknown. Here, we studied pathogenic mutations C1977Y and C1977R, which affect cbEGF30 of human fibrillin-1, in a recombinant three cbEGF domain fragment (cbEGF29-31). Limited proteolysis, 1H NMR, and calcium chelation studies have been used to probe the effect of each substitution on cbEGF30 and its flanking domains. Analysis of the wild-type fragment identified two high affinity and one low affinity calcium-binding sites. Each substitution caused the loss of high affinity calcium binding to cbEGF30, consistent with intradomain misfolding, but the calcium binding properties of cbEGF29 and cbEGF31 were surprisingly unaffected. Further analysis of mutant fragments showed that domain packing of cbEGF29-30, but not cbEGF30-31, was disrupted. These data demonstrate that C1977Y and C1977R have localized structural effects, confined to the N-terminal end of the mutant domain, which disrupt domain packing. Cysteine substitutions affecting other cbEGF disulfide bonds are likely to have different effects. This proposed structural heterogeneity may underlie the observed differences in stability and cellular trafficking of proteins containing such changes."

We have previously reported that the expression of nuclear localization signal-tagged cyclin D1 (D1NLS) and its partner cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) induces proliferation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here we show that the D1NLS/CDK4 cells, after their entry into the cell cycle, accumulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 in the nuclei and decreased the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity, leading to early cell cycle arrest. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that Skp2-dependent p27 ubiquitylation was remarkably suppressed in cardiomyocytes, whereas Skp2, a component of Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein ubiquitin ligase, was more actively ubiquitylated compared with proliferating rat fibroblasts. Specific degradation of p27 by co-expressing Skp2 or p27 small interfering RNA caused an increase of CDK2 activity and overrode the limited cell cycle. These data altogether indicate that the impaired Skp2-dependent p27 degradation is causally related to the loss of proliferation in cardiomyocytes. This provides a novel insight in understanding the molecular mechanism by which mammalian cardiomyocytes cease to proliferate during terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2119712943,"The periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) is wide-spread in proteobacteria. NapA, the nitrate reductase catalytic subunit, contains a Mo-bisMGD cofactor and one [4Fe-4S] cluster. The nap gene clusters in many bacteria, including Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM158, contain an napF gene, disruption of which drastically decreases both in vitro and in vivo nitrate reductase activities. In spite its importance in the Nap system, NapF has never been characterized biochemically, and its role remains unknown. The NapF protein has four polycysteine clusters that suggest that it is an iron-sulfur-containing protein. In the present study, a His6-tagged NapF protein was overproduced in Escherichiacoli and purified anaerobically. The purified NapF protein was used to obtain polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit, and cellular fractionation of R. sphaeroides followed by immunoprobing with anti-NapF antibodies revealed that the native NapF protein is located in the cytoplasm. This contrasts with the periplasmic location of the mature NapA. However, NapA could not be detected in an isogenic napF– strain of R. sphaeroides. The His6-tagged NapF protein displayed spectral properties indicative of Fe-S clusters, but these features were rapidly lost, suggesting cluster lability. However, reconstitution of the Fe-S centers into the apo-NapF protein was achieved in the presence of Azotobacter vinelandii cysteine desulfurase (NifS), and this allowed the recovery of nitrate reductase activity in NapA protein that had previously been treated with 2,2′-dipyridyl to remove the [4Fe-4S] cluster. This activity was not recovered in the absence of NapF. Taking into account the cytoplasmic localization of NapF, the presence of labile Fe-S clusters in the protein, the napF– strain phenotype, and the NapF-dependent reactivation of the 2,2′-dipyridyl-treated NapA, we propose a role for NapF in assembling the [4Fe-4S] center of the catalytic subunit NapA.

The function of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM158 Nap system, which is encoded by the napKEFDABC transcription unit (6Reyes F. Roldán M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is to regulate the cellular redox state by dissipating excess of reductant in cells growing under phototrophic conditions or with highly reduced carbon sources, such as butyrate or caproate (4Gavira M.

Microbiol. 1994; 29: 241-245Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Nap enzyme is a heterodimer composed of NapA, the Mo-bisMGD-containing catalytic subunit that also presents an N-terminal [4Fe-4S] center, and NapB, a diheme cytochrome c. NapC is a membrane-anchored cytochrome c that mediates the physiological electron transfer from the membrane quinol pool to the NapAB periplasmic heterodimer. The Nap system of R. sphaeroides also includes two putative small transmembrane proteins of unknown function (NapK and NapE), a soluble protein (NapD), which could be required for the maturation of the enzyme, and NapF, a putative 16-kDa cysteine-rich protein that has been suggested to bind four [4Fe-4S] centers (6Reyes F. Roldán M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The R. sphaeroides wild-type strain lacks nitrite reductase, thus nitrite production can be used as an indicative of nitrate reductase activity in vivo. The mutational analysis on the R. sphaeroides nap genes reveals that the napABC genes are essential for periplasmic nitrate reduction, because mutants defective in these genes are unable to produce nitrite in vivo. Although the function of the NapF protein in the R. sphaeroides Nap system remains unknown, a mutation of the napF gene indicates that this protein is also required for in vivo nitrate reduction (7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of NapF results in a considerable decrease of the Nap activity assayed with methyl viologen (MV) as artificial electron donor (7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As reduced viologens seem to transfer electrons directly to the active site of the enzyme (9Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Buc J. Santini C.L. Blasco F. Giordani R. Cárdenas M.L. Chippaux M. Cornish-Bowden A. Giordano G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that NapF participates in electron transfer to the periplasmic NapAB complex, even more if NapF is a cytoplasmic protein. Accordingly to this, the R. sphaeroides napC– strain is unable to produce nitrite in vivo but shows the same MV-dependent nitrate reductase activity as the wild-type strain (6Reyes F. Roldán M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular localization of NapF is controversial due to the presence of a conserved twin arginine motif, which could be involved in the periplasmic targeting of the protein, although this motif is not followed by a hydrophobic region (7Reyes F. Gavira M. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli Nap system includes two iron-sulfur proteins, NapG and NapH, in addition to NapF (11Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffihs L. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although napFGH genes are not essential for periplasmic nitrate reduction in E. coli (12Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the loss of NapF results in a severe growth defect in a NapG+H+ strain, but not in an napGH deletion mutant (13Brondijk T.C.H. Fiegen D. Richardson D.J. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that electrons can flow from menaquinol to the NapC subunit in E. coli. A membrane-anchored NapGH complex could act as a proton translocating dehydrogenase transferring electrons from ubiquinol and catalyzing an effective electron transfer to the periplasmic NapAB complex. Nevertheless, no function has been assessed to NapF in the Nap system of E. coli (11Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffihs L. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brondijk T.C.H. Fiegen D.

Fe-S clusters act as cofactors in many different proteins such as electron carriers, environmental sensors, substrate transporters, or regulatory proteins participating in control of gene expression (14Yuvaniyama P.

Microbiol. 1999; 53: 495-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Spontaneous in vitro Fe-S cluster assembly can occur, but in vivo Fe-S assembly requires accessory proteins (16Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Studies of Fe-S cluster assembly in the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase revealed the requirement of two proteins, NifS and NifU (14Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Homologues of these two proteins are found in almost all organisms, from bacteria to humans. NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine. NifU is the Fe-S cluster scaffold upon which the nascent cluster is constructed to be transfer to an apo-protein (14Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the isc and suf operons are required for Fe-S biogenesis of different iron-sulfur proteins (17Zheng L. Cash V.L.

The Isc system is the housekeeping Fe-S cluster assembly, whereas the Suf system is important for Fe-S biogenesis under stressful conditions. In this system, SufA plays a role as scaffold protein for assembly of iron-sulfur clusters and delivery to target proteins, SufS is a cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes the sulfur atom from cysteine and provides it to the cluster, and SufE binds to SufS and is responsible for a 50-fold stimulation of the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS (19Loiseau L.

In this study we report the heterologous expression in E. coli of the R. sphaeroides NapF protein fused to an N-terminal His6 motif. NapF purification allowed the study of its spectroscopic properties and the isolation of anti-NapF antibodies raised in rabbit to assess the subcellular localization of the native protein in R. sphaeroides. Demonstration of the implication of the R. sphaeroides NapF protein in the assembly of the iron-sulfur center of the catalytic subunit (NapA) is also presented.

Malate dehydrogenase activity was measured in subcellular fractions of R. sphaeroides by following NADH oxidation in a spectrophotometer at 340 nm (27Smith A.F. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Gral M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Verlagchemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 166-171Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase was assayed in subcellular fractions of R. sphaeroides by the phenazine methosulfate-dependent reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol (28Carithers R.P. Yoch D.C. Arnon D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7461-7467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labile sulfur determination was performed by a reaction with N-N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and FeCl3 following described methods (29Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal. Chem. 1949; 21: 732-734Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 30Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and using a calibration curve with Na2S·9H2O in NaOH (under nitrogen atmosphere) as standard. Labile iron was assayed in samples heated at 80 °C for 10 min, by reaction with sodium methasulfite and bathophenanthroline, as previously described (31Nilsson U.A. Bassen M. Sävman K. Kjellmer I. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and using a calibration curve with FeSO4·7H2Oas standard. To determine iron and sulfur labile in the apo-NapF reconstitution assay, low molecular mass iron and sulfide compounds, not bond by the protein, were removed by gel filtration. Protein concentration was estimated by the Lowry procedure using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidized and reduced UV-visible spectra of NapF were obtained by oxidizing the protein with potassium ferricyanide or using dithionite as reductant, respectively. The spectra were recorded in a DU7500 (Beckman) spectrophotometer. The form B molybdopterin derivative was extracted from the native NapA protein and the dipyridyl-treated NapA samples by a modification of the procedure of Johnson and Rajagopalan (33Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 20 min and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 10 min. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the supernatants were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5 luminescence spectrometer. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was used to determine, through time of flight, the His6-tagged NapF molecular mass by using an immobilized metal affinity capture surface. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionations of E. coli and R. sphaeroides were carried out as previously described (34McEwan A.G. Jackson J.B. Ferguson S.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 344-349Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 100 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). A cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of sucrose buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 20 mm EDTA; 100 mm NaCl; 0.5 m sucrose) and 100 μgml–1 lysozyme and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 19,000 × g, the supernatant (periplasmic fraction) was separated from the pellet (spheroplasts), which was resuspended in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer. The spheroplasts were then broken by cavitation (3 pulses of 5 s at 90 watts), and the cell extract was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min. Then, the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was separated from the pellet (membrane fraction). Several enzymatic activities were measured as markers of purity of each subcellular fraction of R. sphaeroides. Thus, periplasmic nitrate reductase (25Moreno-Vivián C. Cárdenas J. Castillo F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1986; 34: 105-109Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was found in the periplasmic fraction, malate dehydrogenase activity (27Smith A.F. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Gral M.

Arnon D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7461-7467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was found in the membrane fraction. Western Blots and Heme or Protein Staining—For electrophoretic separation, samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, with 14% (w/v) resolving gels and 5% stacking gels. These gels were used in Western blots, heme analysis, or protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver. Immunoprobing analyses to detect the His6-tagged NapF protein in E. coli were performed by using monoclonal antipolyhistidine clone his-1 from mouse ascites fluid as primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate from goat as second antibody. Immunoprobing analyses to detect the native NapF protein in R. sphaeroides were carried out with polyclonal anti-NapF antibodies raised in rabbit and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate from goat. Immunoprobing analyses to detect the NapA protein in R. sphaeroides were carried out with polyclonal anti-NapA antibodies and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate from goat. Heme staining gels were carried out with dimetoxybenzidine dihydrochloride (35Francis R.T. Becker R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The reaction was developed with 0.5 m sodium citrate (pH 4.4) and 300 μl of 30% H2O2. Silver staining gels were performed in the presence of sodium acetate, sodium thiosulfate, 25% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% silver nitrate, and 37% formaldehyde (36Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulations—DNA manipulations were performed by using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A fusion between the 5′-end of the napF gene and the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA) from the plasmid pKPD60 (24Stoll R. Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has been performed. For this purpose, the 2.17-kb PstI/BamHI fragment that contains the R. sphaeroides napKEFD genes and the 5′-end of napA was ligated into the vector pALTER to generate pALTER-PB. To create in the 26th triplet of the napF gene a recognition site for the restriction enzyme XhoI, an amplification by PCR with the primers 5′-TGTCGGCCTCGAGCGTCCAGGGC-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and 5′-CCACGCACTTTGCCTCGAGATC-3′ was performed. The restriction enzyme XhoI was used to digest the isolated PCR product, generating a 1.2-kb fragment that contains the napKE genes and the 5′-end of the napF gene. This fragment was then ligated into the pKPD60 vector previously digested with XhoI and SalI to generate the pKPD60X construct. In the alkaline phosphatase measurements, the pKPD60 vector was used as a positive control, because this plasmid contains the signal peptide of the periplasmic cytochrome c550 of Paracoccus denitrificans fused to the phoA gene. A negative control was performed by digestion of the pKPD60 vector with XhoI and SalI and further re-ligation to generate the pKPD60ΔX plasmid, thus removing a 0.5-kb fragment, which contains the cytochrome c550 signal peptide. A napA-phoA gene fusion was also constructed by inserting the 2.17-kb PstI/BamHI fragment, which contains the napKEFD genes and the 5′-end region of the napA gene, into the pSVB25 vector to generate pSVB25X60. This construct was digested with BamHI, and the linear fragment was partially filled-in with the Klenow polymerase in the presence of dGTP and dATP. Thus, compatible ends were generated to be cloned into the vector pKPD60, previously digested with XhoI and partially filled-in with the Klenow polymerase in the presence of dCTP and dTTP, to produce the last construct pKPD60B*X* with the desired in-frame napA-phoA gene fusion. The plasmids pKPD60, pKPD60X, pKPD60ΔX, and pKPD60B*X* were sequenced to check that all the constructions were made in the correct reading frame, and were introduced into E. coli strains DH5α and XL1-blue. To generate the His6-tagged NapF recombinant protein, the PCR mutagenesis technique was performed by using as template the plasmid pFR24 carrying the napKEFD genes and the 5′-end of the napA gene, which presents a BamHI restriction site, and the primers: 5′-CTGACAGCCGTGGATCCTATCCCGC-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and cloned into pQE32, to generate pQE32/napF. This plasmid was sequenced to confirm that the His6 tag was correctly fused to NapF. The napF gene sequence has been deposited in the EMBL, GenBank™, and DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Databases under the accession number Z46806. Overproduction and Purification of NapF—The E. coli JM109 strain harboring the pQE32/napF plasmid was cultured anaerobically at 37 °C. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by filling completely 500-ml screw-capped bottles with LB culture medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml–1). When the cultures reached an A600 of 0.4, a heat-shock of 10 min at 42 °C was carried out and 50 μm of IPTG were added, keeping the cultures at 25 °C overnight for the NapF induction. The cytoplasmic fraction of E. coli containing the heterologous NapF protein was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column, and an imidazole gradient was performed (up to 250 mm imidazole) to elute the recombinant His6-tagged NapF protein. Isolation and Purification of the Anti-NapF Polyclonal Antibodies— Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified NapF were obtained by following the method previously described by Diez and López-Ruiz (37Diez J. López-Ruiz A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A volume of 250 μl containing 135 μg of purified NapF in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was diluted up to 2 ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (135 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0), mixed with 2 ml of adjuvant complete Freund (Difco Laboratories), and homogenized to obtain an uniform sample. The immunization process was carried out during 59 days. Rabbit-blood samples were collected in the presence of heparin, centrifuged at 4 °C and 19,000 × g for 15 min, and after incubation at 56 °C for 15 min, were frozen at –80 °C until use. Immunoglobulins were partially purified by a 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was washed with 1.75 m ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 17.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Lipoproteins were eliminated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto an ionic exchange DEAE-Sephacel column with the phosphate buffer described above. The fractions that contributed at the first peak at 280 nm were collected, representing the IgG fraction. The anti-NapF antibodies were stored at 4 °C until use. In Vitro Reconstitution of the Iron-Sulfur Centers of NapF—The assembly of the iron-sulfur clusters to the apo-NapF protein was performed under anaerobic conditions (nitrogen atmosphere) in a total volume of 1 ml, by adding: 12.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4; 50 mm KCl; 5 nmol of NapF; 1 mm l-cysteine; 2.5 mm DTT; 0.3 nmol of cysteine desulfurase (NifS) from A. vinelandii; and 2 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate, as previously described (38Khoroshilova N. Beinert H Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The reconstitution was monitored in a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer by recording scans between 350 and 700"

The mammalian natriuretic peptide family consists of three members: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), 1The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; NPR, natriuretic peptide receptor; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AM, acetoxylmethyl ester; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; NPR, natriuretic peptide receptor; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AM, acetoxylmethyl ester; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (1Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). ANP and BNP are produced in atrial and ventricular myocytes, respectively. ANP reduces blood pressure by stimulating sodium and water excretion, by stimulating vasorelaxation, and by inhibiting renin and aldosterone secretion. CNP is most highly expressed in the brain (2Sudoh T. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Waldman S.A. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 123-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol.

They consist of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region and intracellular kinase homology, dimerization, and carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase domains. ANP and BNP activate NPR-A, whereas CNP activates NPR-B. Binding of these receptors by their respective ligands stimulates the synthesis of the intracellular second messenger, cGMP.The mechanisms regulating NPR-A and NPR-B activity are incompletely understood. It is known, however, that receptor phosphorylation is required for natriuretic peptide activation and that prolonged exposure to natriuretic peptides or acute exposure to activators of protein kinase C causes receptor dephosphorylation and desensitization (12Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31099-31106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). NPR-A and NPR-B also are inhibited by hormones (arginine, vasopressin, angiotensin II, and lysophosphatidic acid) or growth factors (platelet-derived and fibroblast growth factors) that antagonize the actions of natriuretic peptides (14Nambi P.

Protein kinase C was initially implicated in this so-called heterologous desensitization, but recent studies indicate that it is dispensable for this response (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol.

We suggest that this is a universal mechanism by which environmental conditions and antagonistic hormones inhibit natriuretic peptide signaling. This mechanism may underlie the desensitization of NPR-A and NPR-B that accompanies pathological conditions such as diabetes and congestive heart failure (19Sechi L.A. Valentin J.P. Griffin C.A.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Fluo-4-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The NIH3T3 cells (CRL-1658) and the A10 rat aortic smooth muscle cells (CRL-1476) were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).Cell Culture and Preparation of Crude Membranes—NIH3T3 fibroblast (18Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and A10 aortic smooth muscle cells (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Crude membranes were prepared as reported previously (18Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Confocal Calcium Imaging and Transfections—NIH3T3 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA). For the GFP transfections, cells were grown to 50% confluence and transfected with 1 μg of a plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For calcium imaging experiments, untransfected NIH3T3 cells at ∼90% confluence were first washed with modified HEPES buffer, pH 7.3 (109.5 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 11.6 mm HEPES, 11.5 mm glucose) and then incubated with HEPES buffer supplemented with 2 μm fluo-4-AM, a high affinity cell-permeable calcium indicator, at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were bathed in modified HEPES buffer containing no dye for 30 min to allow dye de-esterification. The untransfected and GFP-transfected cells were superfused at ∼3 ml/min at room temperature with modified HEPES buffer supplemented with varying concentrations of NaCl. Video-rate calcium imaging was performed using a self-constructed confocal microscope built around an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. Fluorophores (fluo-4-AM and GFP) were excited using a 488-nm argon laser, and changes in fluorescence emission were monitored with a 530 ± 15-nm band pass filter. Images were recorded every 33 ms, and the resulting image stacks were analyzed by the Metamorph software package (Universal Imaging).Whole Cell Cyclic GMP Stimulations and Guanylyl Cyclase Assays— NIH3T3 cells plated in 12-well dishes were grown to 90% confluence and incubated for at least 4 h in serum-free medium. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and various concentrations of NaCl. After a 30-min incubation, the medium was replaced with the same medium containing CNP. Cells were stimulated for 3 min and stopped by aspirating the medium and adding 1 ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol. All incubations were at 37 °C. Cyclic GMP concentrations in the ethanol extract were estimated as reported (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Guanylyl cyclase assays were performed for 3 min as described previously (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitations—Serum-starved cells from 10-cm plates were exposed to various treatments and solubilized in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 μm microcystin, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Diagnostics, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). After rotation for 15 min with 30 μl of a 50% protein A slurry at 4 °C the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 2 °C. 0.8 ml of the cleared extract from each treatment was incubated with 3 μl of polyclonal antiserum from rabbit 6328 for 1 h at 4 °C. Rabbit 6328 was immunized with the synthetic peptide CGERKGPPGLL that corresponds to the last 10 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of NPR-B. Thirty μl of a 50% protein A slurry were added to the extract and incubated for an additional hour. The protein A immunocomplex was pelleted by low speed centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. NPR-B was released from the immunocomplex by boiling for 3 min in the presence of 30 μl of 2× reducing SDS sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient resolving gel.Gel Staining—Polyacrylamide gels were immersed in a fixing solution containing 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then incubated overnight at room temperature with rocking. The gel was then rinsed twice for 10 min in 100 ml of water. Staining was performed in the dark by adding 20 ml of a phosphoprotein-specific dye to the gel (Pro-Q diamond phosphoprotein gel stain, Molecular Probes) for 2 h with gentle agitation. The gel was destained by incubation with 100 ml of a solution of 20% acetonitrile and 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) for 3 h in the dark. The destaining solution was changed twice within the 3-h incubation period. The stained phosphoproteins were visualized at 532 nm using a Fluoroimage analyzer (FLA-5000, Fujifilm). To detect proteins, the same gel was washed three times with distilled water for 10 min and incubated overnight with 20 ml of SYPRO ruby protein gel stain (Molecular Probes). The next day the gel was rinsed twice with a solution of 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid for 30 min each. The stained proteins were detected at 473 nm as described above. Phosphoprotein staining was quantitated after correction of protein amounts using the Fuji Image Gauge software.RESULTSHyperosmolarity Acutely Inhibits NPR-B in NIH3T3 Cells—To examine the effect of hyperosmolarity on the activity of NPR-B, we incubated NIH3T3 cells with medium alone or medium containing 10 or 100 mm final concentrations of Tris-HCl or HEPES buffers to increase the extracellular osmotic pressure. After 30 min, we prepared crude membranes from these cells and assayed them for CNP-dependent and Triton X-100-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities. The former treatment measures the physiologic activation of NPR-B, whereas the latter artificial conditions indicate the total amount of guanylyl cyclase present in any given membrane preparation. CNP-dependent but not Triton X-100-dependent cyclase activity was markedly reduced in membranes from cells exposed to 100 mm concentrations of either buffer, whereas activities measured in membranes from cells exposed to 10 mm concentrations were only slightly decreased (Fig. 1A).To determine whether other general osmolytes inhibit NPR-B, we incubated serum-starved cells with 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm sorbitol, or 200 mm urea so that 200 meq of each osmolyte were added per treatment. As shown in Fig. 1B, membranes prepared from cells exposed to either NaCl or sorbitol had similarly reduced CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities. In contrast, no significant reductions were observed in membranes prepared from cells incubated with the same number of milliosmoles of urea. The lack of effect of urea is because of its high cell membrane permeability (22Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Hence, its osmotic gradient is short lived. In further support of a general osmotic inhibitory mechanism, we found that the effects of submaximal concentrations of NaCl (50 mm) and sorbitol (100 mm) were additive, whereas incubations with 50 mm NaCl and 100 mm urea resulted in an inhibitory response that was about half that observed with 100 mm NaCl alone.To further examine the sensitivity of the NPR-B receptor to hyperosmolarity, we conducted guanylyl cyclase assays on membranes derived from NIH3T3 cells that were incubated for 30 min with 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mm NaCl in addition to the normal 110 mm NaCl contained in the medium. We found that the additional NaCl inhibited CNP-dependent activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Slight reductions were observed with NaCl incubations of 25 mm, and marked desensitization was detectable after exposure of cells to 50 mm or higher additional NaCl concentrations. The maximum concentration tested, 150 mm, reduced hormone-dependent but not detergent-dependent activity to about half of the amount detected in untreated cells.To characterize the time course of the inhibition, cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 min with 100 mm additional NaCl. Membranes were prepared from these cells and assayed for hormone-dependent or detergent-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities (Fig. 1D). The effect of NaCl on hormone-dependent activity was rapid, having a t½ of ∼15 min. Again, the hyperosmotic conditions had no effect on cyclase activity measured in the presence of detergent.Chronic Hyperosmolarity Does Not Increase NPR-B Activity—Because previous studies have shown that the ANP-dependent activity of NPR-A is enhanced after long term exposure to hyperosmotic medium (23Katafuchi T. Mizuno T. Hagiwara H. Itakura M. Ito T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of a long term (days) NaCl incubation on NPR-B activity in the NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In these experiments, cells were exposed to 25 mm, 50 mm, or 75 mm additional NaCl for 2 days. However, neither CNP-dependent nor detergent-dependent NPR-B guanylyl cyclase activities were affected by these treatments (data not shown), suggesting that different mechanisms underlie the regulation of NPR-A and NPR-B in response to chronic hyperosmotic stress.Acute Hyperosmolarity Inhibits NPR-B in A10 Cells—We next asked whether the osmotic regulation of NPR-B is specific to NIH3T3 cells or is a general characteristic of this receptor by investigating the osmotic regulation of NPR-B in the A10 vascular smooth muscle cell line. We have shown previously that NPR-B is expressed and regulated appropriately in these cells (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As with the NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we found that acute but not chronic exposure to hyperosmotic medium inhibited CNP-dependent NPR-B activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Hence, both the acute osmotic effect and the lack of a chronic osmotic effect are general characteristics of this receptor.Hyperosmolarity Inhibits CNP-dependent cGMP Elevations—Because the previous experiments were conducted by directly measuring the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-B in broken cell preparations, we examined the hyperosmotic effect in the more physiologic environment of an intact cell. Whole cells were incubated with 50, 100, or 150 mm additional NaCl for 30 min as shown in Fig. 1A, but instead of measuring cyclase activity in crude membrane preparations, we treated the cells with 20 nm CNP and measured intracellular cGMP concentrations. CNP-dependent cGMP elevations in the whole cellsweremarkedlyinhibitedbyNaClexposureinaconcentration-dependent manner (IC50 ∼50 mm) (Fig. 2, top panel). Remarkably, the maximal concentration tested, 150 mm, suppressed CNP-dependent cGMP production to less than 15% of control values.Fig. 2Hyperosmolarity decreases CNP-dependent NPR-B activity in NIH3T3 cells. Top panel, cells were incubated with increasing amounts of NaCl for 30 min. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were stimulated with 20 nm CNP for 3 min. Cyclic GMP concentrations were estimated by radioimmunoassay. Values are the mean of six separate determinations. Vertical bars within symbols represent the S.E. Middle panel, cells were incubated with 100 mm additional NaCl for 30 min. The hypertonic medium was replaced with normotonic medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min and then stimulated with 20 nm CNP for 3 min. Bottom panel, cells were incubated with 100 mm additional NaCl for 30 min. Then the hyperosmotic medium was removed and replaced by a normotonic medium for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. Crude membranes were prepared at the indicated time points and assayed for CNP-dependent (squares) and Triton X-100-dependent (circles) guanylyl cyclase activities. Values are the mean of five separate experiments that were assayed in duplicate (n = 10). The vertical bars within each column represent the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Hyperosmotic Effect Is Reversible—To confirm that the acute suppression of the CNP-dependent activity was not because of irreversible cellular damage, we incubated whole cells with hypertonic medium for 30 min and then replaced the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking exogenous salt and measured the CNP-dependent cGMP response after an additional 30-min incubation. In this “washout” experiment, we found that removal of the hypertonic medium resulted in a marked recovery of the CNP-dependent cGMP response (Fig. 2, middle panel). In a similar experiment, we incubated cells in hypertonic medium for 30 min and then replaced it with medium lacking additional salt for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. After the indicated times, we prepared membranes from these cells and assayed them for guanylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 2, bottom panel). CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity increased from the inhibited levels as early as 5 min after the removal of the hypertonic medium and was completely recovered by 30 min. Detergent-dependent cyclase activity was unaffected by the presence or absence of exogenous NaCl. These data indicate that the hyperosmotic inhibition of NPR-B is reversible. It also suggests that the reductions in cyclase activity do not result from receptor degradation as was reported for the osmotic inhibition of NPR-A (24Iimura O. Kusano E. Ishida F. Oono S. Ando Y. Asano Y. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Calcium Elevations Are Required for Hyperosmotic and LPA-dependent Inhibition of NPR-B—We recently demonstrated that the arginine-, vasopressin-, and sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent desensitization of NPR-B requires elevated calcium concentrations (17Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Abbey-Hosch S.E. Cody A.N. Potter L.R. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether calcium also mediates the hyperosmotic effect. To determine whether hyperosmotic medium elevates intracellular calcium, we employed a confocal imaging approach based on the calcium indicator fluo-4-AM. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, superfusion of the NIH3T3 cells with modified HEPES buffer containing 150 mm additional NaCl caused a sustained increase in intracellular calcium as evidenced by increased fluo-4-AM fluorescence at the calcium-bound wavelength. We also performed parallel experiments with GFP-transfected fibroblasts to confirm that changes in fluorescence represented bona fide calcium signals rather than simply a change in fluorophore distribution resulting from altered cell morphology. We examined the concentration dependence of the response by incubating the cells with 25, 50, 100, or 150 mm additional NaCl. In all cells the -fold change in fluo-4-AM fluorescence was greater than that observed with GFP (Fig. 3, middle panel). The net difference between these curves (% change in fluo-4-AM fluorescence–% change in GFP fluorescence) is displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 3, along with the concentration response curve for CNP-evoked guanylyl cyclase activity to highlight the correlation between calcium levels and desensitization. Small elevations in media osmolarity (25 mm NaCl) did not cause significant cytoplasmic calcium elevations or NPR-B desensitization. However, over the higher range of 50 to 150 mm supplemental NaCl, the amplitude of the calcium signals and NPR-B desensitization were generally correlated.Fig. 3Hypertonic medium increases cytoplasmic calcium in concert with NPR-B desensitization. Top panel, NIH3T3 cells loaded with fluo-4-AM (black) or transiently transfected with GFP (gray) were superfused with modified HEPES buffer containing 150 mm additional NaCl. The resulting changes in fluorescence emission were monitored from single cells as a function of time. Middle panel, additional extracellular NaCl increases intracellular calcium concentrations in a concentration-dependent manner. Cumulative data are from the fluorescence traces of fluo-4-AM-loaded NIH3T3 and GFP-transfected NIH3T3 cells expressed as a ratio of fluorescence intensity (F) versus initial fluorescence intensity (Fo) at any time. Bottom panel, the lower curve (triangles) represents the net fluorescence change evoked by NaCl obtained by subtracting the mean amplitudes of the GFP signal from the fluo-4-AM signal at each point (triangles). The upper curve (squares) represents the CNP-dependent NPR-B desensitization after treatment of NIH3T3 cells with the indicated additional NaCl concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the absolute requirement of intracellular calcium elevations in the osmotic and LPA-dependent desensitization of NPR-B, we tested whether the cell-permeable calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, could prevent either process. Consistent with a common calcium-dependent mechanism, pretreatment of the cells with 50 μm BAPTA-AM completely blocked the ability of LPA and hyperosmolarity to inhibit NPR-B (Fig. 4, top panel). In contrast, the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF-109203X, was ineffective, although it blocked the PMA-dependent inhibition (Fig. 4, bottom panel). These data indicate that elevated intracellular calcium but not protein kinase C activation is required for these inhibitory processes.Fig. 4NaCl- and LPA-dependent desensitization of NPR-B require intracellular calcium elevations. Top panel, NIH3T3 cells were pretreated with 50 μm BAPTA-AM or with buffer for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with or without 10 μm LPA or 100 mm additional NaCl for 30 min. Crude membranes were prepared and assayed for CNP-dependent and detergent-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities. Bottom panel, serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were pretreated with or without 1 μm GF-109203X (GFX), for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with or without 1 μm PMA or 100 mm NaCl for an additional 30 min. Crude membranes were prepared and assayed as described for the top panel. For each experiment, values represent the average of six separate experiments that were assayed in duplicate (n = 12).

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we tested whether the calcium-elevating treatments stimulate NPR-B dephosphorylation.

This is the first report on the use of the direct mutagenic approach into the RC-related genes in green sulfur bacteria. The RC complex of C. tepidum is supposed to form a homodimer of two identical PscA subunits together with three other subunits: PscB (FA/FB-containing protein), PscC (cytochrome cz), and PscD.

We studied the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of a mutant lacking PscD in order to elucidate its unknown function. 1) The RC complex isolated from the mutant cells showed no band corresponding to PscD on SDS-PAGE analysis. 2) The growth rate of the PscD-less mutant was slower than that of the wild-type cells at low light intensities. 3) Time-resolved fluorescence spectra at 77 K revealed prolonged decay times of the fluorescence from bacteriochlorophyll c on the antenna chlorosome and from bacteriochlorophyll a on the Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna protein in the mutant cells. The loss of PscD led to a much slower energy transfer from the antenna pigments to the special pair bacteriochlorophyll a (P840). 4) The mutant strain exhibited slightly less activity of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction compared with that in the wild-type strain. The extent of suppression, however, was less significant than that reported in the PsaD-less mutants of cyanobacterial photosystem I.

Photosynthetic organisms convert light energy into electrochemical free energy by carrying out a series of light-driven electron transfer reactions. This process, which is fundamental for life, is mediated by reaction center (RC) 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; Chl, chlorophyll; Fd, ferredoxin; FMO, Fenna-Matthews-Olson; FNR, ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; Chl, chlorophyll; Fd, ferredoxin; FMO, Fenna-Matthews-Olson; FNR, ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. complexes. The RCs are primarily grouped into two types based on their terminal electron acceptors, type I (FeS-type) RCs and type II (quinone-type) RCs. Purple photosynthetic bacteria contain only type II RCs, which do not evolve oxygen, whereas oxygenic cyanobacteria and plants utilize both type I (photosystem I) and type II (photosystem II) RCs, which are connected in-line through the b6f complex. Green sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria have unique type I RCs, so-called “homodimeric” RCs, which are made of two identical core polypeptides.The “heterodimeric” type I and II RCs, which are found in all photosynthetic organisms other than green sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria, consist of a set of two partially different core polypeptides that produce a slightly asymmetric arrangement of cofactors. A three-dimensional structure of the heterodimeric RC was first obtained from the type II RC of the purple bacterium Blastochloris viridis in 1985 (1Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Recently, those of photosystem I and II RCs from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were determined at high resolutions (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 3Zouni A. Witt H. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). These structures have clarified that the folding motifs of membrane-spanning α-helices within core proteins as well as the spatial configurations of the electron transfer components are essentially identical in type I and II RCs, suggesting that they have a common origin. Various methods of gene manipulation have been applied to pursue research on heterodimeric RCs on the molecular level, and the results have led us to a comprehensive understanding of the electron transfer mechanisms and molecular architectures as well. The electron transfer reactions within these heterodimeric RCs occur via one of the two pathways that contain almost symmetrically arranged cofactors.On the other hand, homodimeric type I RCs have never been successful targets for crystal structural analysis and mutagenic approach due to the obligate anaerobic and photoautotrophic nature of green sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria. In fact, the RC complexes isolated from them are very fragile when exposed to oxygen, and many RC-related genes are essential. However, a study on the molecular level of the homodimeric RCs, which have a simple architecture and still retain the features of an ancestral RC, will offer valuable information to understand the mechanism and evolution of photosynthetic apparatuses.The RC complex of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum consists of four subunits, PscA, PscB, PscC, and PscD with an antenna size of about 30 bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules, whereas the heterodimeric photosystem I complex is made of 12 polypeptides with a much larger antenna size of nearly 100 chlorophyll (Chl) molecules (4Hauska G. Schoedl T. Rémigy H. Tsiotis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 260-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Fyfe P.K. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 2003; 358: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The functions of PscA, PscB, and PscC have been studied intensively using biochemical and spectroscopic methods. A pair of PscA forms a core protein, which is supposed to make up a homodimeric (PscA)2 structure, unlike a PsaA/PsaB heterodimeric one in photosystem I (6Büttner M. Xie D. Nelson H. Pinther W. Hauska G. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This core protein contains a special pair, P840, a primary electron acceptor, Chl a-670 (A0), and an iron-sulfur center, FX, although the existence of the acceptor quinone (A1) remains controversial (4Hauska G. Schoedl T. Rémigy H. Tsiotis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 260-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PscB ligates two iron-sulfur clusters that are comparable with the FA and FB centers in PsaC of photosystem I but these proteins show almost no significant similarity to each other in their amino acid sequences (6Büttner M. Xie D. Nelson H. Pinther W. Hauska G. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Vassiliev I.R. Antonkine M.L. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PscC is the monoheme-type cytochrome cz, which serves as a direct electron donor to the special pair of BChl a, P840 (8Okkels J.S. Kjær B. Handdon O. Svendsen I. Møller B.L. Schller H.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12293-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and has no counterpart in photosystem I. This cytochrome cz mediates the electron transfer between the cytochrome bc and RC complexes without participation of other soluble cytochromes (10Oh-oka H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12293-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).However, the function of PscD has been unknown because of the absence of any cofactors within it. Three-dimensional imaging analysis with the electron microscopic technique (STEM) suggested that PscD was in contact with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein on the cytoplasmic side (11Rémigy H. Stahlberg H. Fotiadis D. Muller S.A. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Hauska G. Tsiotis G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although PscD has been assumed to function in the same way as PsaD in photosystem I, as judged from their sequence similarities (12Hager-Braun C. Xie D. Jarosch U. Herold E. Büttner M. Zimmermann R. Deutzmann R. Hauska G. Nelson N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9617-9624Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), there is no definite evidence for this speculation. The PsaD of photosystem I has been demonstrated to stabilize FA/FB-containing PsaC and facilitate the electron transfer reaction to ferredoxin (Fd). The Chlorobium RC complex also donates electrons to Fd (13Seo D. Tomioka A. Kusumoto N. Kamo M. Enami I. Sakurai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and NADPH is finally produced by Fd:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) (13Seo D. Tomioka A. Kusumoto N. Kamo M. Enami I. Sakurai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Kjær B. Scheller H.V. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 33-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Furthermore, the Chlorobium RC complex is associated with antenna protein, the FMO protein. The FMO protein is water-soluble and contains seven molecules of BChl a. X-ray crystallographic analyses conducted by two research groups have shown that this protein forms a trimeric structure (15Matthews B.W. Fenna R.E. Bolognesi M.C. Schmid M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 259-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Li Y.-F. Zhou W. Blankenship R.E. Allen J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 456-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is estimated that one or two FMO trimers have been included in the RC preparations so far reported, probably depending on the chemical properties of the detergents used in their isolation procedures (4Hauska G. Schoedl T. Rémigy H. Tsiotis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 260-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Sakurai H. Kusumoto N. Inoue K. Photochem.

Res. 2002; 71: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).In the photosynthesis of green sulfur bacteria, light energy is captured by a supramolecular antenna complex, so-called chlorosome, which contains self-aggregates formed by large amounts of BChl c, d, or e depending on the species (e.g. the chlorosomes of C. tepidum contain BChl c aggregates) (19Blankenship R.E. Olson J.M. Miller M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 399-435Google Scholar, 20Olson J.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 67: 61-75Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The BChl aggregates in chlorosomes make rod structures that are surrounded by a lipid monolayer envelop attached to the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane. The light energy absorbed by the BChl c aggregates in chlorosomes is transferred to the baseplate, which contains a small amount of BChl a, and then to the FMO protein, which seems to be located between chlorosomes and the RC complex and finally to the RC complex.In this study, we constructed a C. tepidum mutant lacking PscD with the recently established natural transformation system in this organism (21Frigaard N.-U. Bryant D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PscD was shown to be involved in the efficient energy transfer from chlorosomes to P840, probably by allocating FMO proteins properly, and to enhance the NADP+ photoreduction via Fd. PscD was suggested to have an important role in the survival of green sulfur bacteria, even in the light-limited environment in which they are found in nature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth Conditions—The strain of C. tepidum used in this study was WT2321 (22Wahlund T.M. Madigan M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2583-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For liquid cultivation and plating incubation, CL and CP media were prepared, respectively, as previously described (21Frigaard N.-U. Bryant D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The growth temperature was set at 40 °C during the present work. The anaerobic growth on CP plates was carried out in an anaerobic jar (model G, code HP31; OXOID, Ltd.) equipped with a palladium catalyst andaH2/CO2-generating gas pack (BBL Gas Pack; BD Biosciences) and supplemented with 0.1 g of thioacetoamide to generate H2S by adding 1 ml of 0.5 m HCl.Plasmid Construction and Transformation of C. tepidum—A 1.2-kb fragment containing the pscD gene of C. tepidum was amplified by PCR, using a pscdF primer (5′-CTGAATTCAGTGGTACGAGAAGGCCATCC) and a pscdR primer (5′-CGGAATTCCGCTTGGCTGCAATTGCATCG), and cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC18, yielding plasmid pCD1. A 2.0-kb fragment containing the aadA gene, which was produced by SmaI digestion of pHP45Ω (23Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), was inserted into the NaeI site of pCD1, yielding plasmid pCDA (Fig. 1). Plasmid pCDA was then prepared in large amounts by using a MIDI-prep kit (Invitrogen). About 1 μg of AhdI-digested pCDA was used for the transformation. A natural transformation method was performed as described previously by Frigaard and Bryant (21Frigaard N.-U. Bryant D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transformants grown on selective (Smr/Spr) CP plates were restreaked three times onto selective CP plates. Each single colony on the third CP plate was inoculated into a fresh liquid CL medium containing selective antibiotics. The cultures to start growth were cultivated two or three times and used for further investigations.Preparation of Genomic DNA and Hybridization—Cell lysates were prepared essentially as previously reported (24Tsukatani Y. Matsuura K. Masuda S. Shimada K. Hiraishi A. Nagashima K.V.P. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An equal volume of phenol was added to the cell lysate and centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of chloroform. After recentrifugation, nucleic acids in the aqueous phase were precipitated with 99.5% (v/v) ethanol supplemented with 300 mm sodium acetate, washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, and suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). RNase was added to a final concentration of 50 μgml–1, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The suspension was mixed with 3 times the volume of the polyethylene glycol solution (13% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, 1.6 m NaCl) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Genomic DNA was precipitated, washed, and suspended in TE buffer.One microgram of genomic DNA was digested by HincII and used for hybridization analysis. Southern hybridization was carried out according to a manual on molecular cloning (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or instructions supplied by the manufacturer. PCR analysis was also used as a convenient means to confirm the insertional inactivation of the targeted gene. DNA fragments containing the pscD gene were amplified by the same primers as those used for cloning. The aadA marker in the mutant genome was detected by using the primers aadA946 and aadA947 (26Frigaard N.-U. Voigt G.D. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 184: 3368-3376Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Preparation of the RC Complex and SDS-PAGE—The RC complex was isolated from the wild-type and mutant cells as described previously by Oh-oka et al. (27Oh-oka H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9267-9272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All procedures for the preparation were carried out under anaerobic conditions in a chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A protein marker kit for the molecular mass estimation was purchased from New England BioLabs Inc.Spectral Analysis—The steady-state fluorescence emission spectra and absorption spectra were measured with a spectrofluorophotometer RF-1500 (Shimadzu) and spectrophotometer UV-3101PC (Shimadzu), respectively. The cells were suspended in 40 mm MOPS-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) in an anaerobic chamber and placed in an air-tight anaerobic cuvette. The concentrations of the samples were adjusted to give an absorbance of 0.5 at 750 nm when measuring the fluorescence spectra.The time-resolved fluorescence spectra and kinetics were measured by a streak scope (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu) with an excitation flash from a laser diode of 50-ps full width at half-maximum intensity operated at 1 MHz (Hamamatasu Photonics, Hamamatsu). The fluorescence excited by a laser beam was focused onto the entrance slit of the 30-cm monochrometer and dispersed depending on the wavelength inside the monochrometer along the horizontal axis. An image of the spectrum of the fluorescence at the exit slit of the monochrometer then excited the image intensifier at the entrance of the streak camera. A number of electrons produced by each photon in the image intensifier were biased by a time-dependent electric field along the vertical axis with respect to the delay of arrival and made an image on the phosphor plate. The images of each photon, whose location was biased due to wavelength along the x axis and the arrival time along the y axis, were captured by a CCD camera. The location of the trace of each photon on each image of CCD was counted and accumulated in the memory of a computer as shown in Fig. 6A.Fig. 6Time-resolved fluorescence analysis in wild-type (left side) and PscD-less mutant cells (right side) measured at 77 K. A and D, two-dimensional images of fluorescence emission represented with wavelength versus time. The horizontal axis indicates the wavelength, and the vertical axis shows the delay time after the peak of diode laser excitation. B and E, time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra at given times. C and F, kinetic decays of fluorescence intensities measured at 785 and 830 nm. Cells were suspended in a buffer containing 40 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and an excess amount of dithionite. Samples were excited by a 645-nm laser pulse with a 50-ps full width at a half-maximum repeatedly at the repetition rate of 1 MHz.

A gas flow temperature control system (CF935; Oxford Instruments) was used. Samples for measurements were chlorosome-free membranes prepared by disruption of cells and subsequent centrifugations before solubilization with detergents (10Oh-oka H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12293-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).NADP+Photoreduction—The rates of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction were measured using membrane preparations (A810 = 0.7, corresponding to ∼3 μg of BChl a/ml) in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mm sodium ascorbate, 100 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol, 50 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, 5 mm glucose, 2 units of glucose oxidase, 20 units of catalase, 0.5 mm NADP+, 0.2 μm FNR, and various concentrations of ferredoxin, basically according to the compositions reported by two research groups (13Seo D.

Res. 1996; 47: 33-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes free from chlorosomes were prepared as previously described (10Oh-oka H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12293-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The C. tepidum ferredoxin was a generous gift of Dr. D. Seo and Prof. H. Sakurai (Waseda University) (13Seo D. Tomioka A. Kusumoto N. Kamo M. Enami I. Sakurai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This ferredoxin was named FdC in their previous study (13Seo D. Tomioka A. Kusumoto N. Kamo M. Enami I. Sakurai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ferredoxin and FNR from Spirulina sp. were purified by Cui et al. (29Cui J.Y. Wakabayashi S. Wada K. Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Reduction of NADP+ was measured by monitoring absorption changes at 340 nm with a UV-3101PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) and a combination of appropriate filters. The samples were illuminated by actinic light with wavelengths longer than 490 nm. The photomultiplier was protected by a 340-nm interference filter with a bandwidth of 10 nm.RESULTSConstruction of the PscD-less Mutant—The pscD gene was inactivated by insertion of the aadA streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1) as described in Ref. 21Frigaard N.-U. Bryant D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Southern hybridization analysis verified the insertion of a 2.0-kb aadA marker into the genome of the mutant (Fig. 2). A pscD probe hybridized with a 2.2-kb fragment in the wild type and with a 4.2-kb fragment in the mutant. In addition, an aadA probe hybridized with a 4.2-kb fragment in the mutant but not with the wild-type genomic DNA. PCR analysis using pscdF and pscdR primers (Fig. 1) also exhibited a 2.0 kb longer fragment in the mutant than in the wild type (data not shown). These results indicated that the aadA cassette was introduced correctly into the targeted pscD gene.Fig. 2Southern hybridization analysis of HincII-digested genomic DNAs isolated from the wild-type (lanes 1 and 3) and mutant (lanes 2 and 4) strains of C. tepidum. A probe for the detection of pscD was used in lanes 1 and 2, and a probe specific for aadA (streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance cassette) was used in lanes 3 and 4. The HindIII digests of λDNA were used as molecular weight markers. The numbers indicate the lengths of DNA fragments in base(s).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The RC complexes were isolated from the mutant and wild-type strains according to the method described previously (27Oh-oka H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9267-9272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) clearly indicated the absence of PscD in the mutant strain. It is characteristic that no other subunits appeared to be affected prominently in their contents due to the deletion of PscD, suggesting that PscD would be loosely associated with and/or functionally independent of other subunits within the Chlorobium RC complex.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis of the isolated RC complexes stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lanes M, WT, and D represent molecular weight markers, RC isolated from the wild type strain, and RC isolated from the PscD-less mutant strain, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Growth of the ΔpscD Strain—Growth rates were measured under high and low light conditions (Fig. 4). At a high light intensity of 164 μmol photons/m2/h, both the wild-type and mutant cells showed the same rates of photosynthetic growth. On the other hand, at a low light intensity of 2.5 μmol photons/m2/h, the growth rate of the ΔpscD mutant strain was almost the same as that of the wild-type strain until their culture turbidity, measured at 660 nm (OD660), reached 0.5. However, the former growth rate declined to about one-third beyond OD660 = 0.5, whereas the latter continued to grow at the same rate. A possible explanation of this rate transition during growth is that the light intensity penetrating into the interior portion of the culture would decrease far below 2.5 μmol photons/m2/h after the culture finally became turbid. Therefore, these results suggested that the ΔpscD mutant strain was incapable of collecting extremely low light energy at full efficiency, probably due to some damage in its antenna system. Another possibility might be that a subtle difference in some metabolic activity might be amplified during their growth, resulting in the delayed growth of the ΔpscD mutant strain compared with the normal one of the wild-type strain.Fig. 4Growth curves of the wild-type (filled symbols) and PscD-less mutant cells (open symbols). The average of three of the five independent measurements of cell density measured at 660 nm (the minimum and maximum values were omitted) was taken as the cell density and plotted against the time. Measurements started just after the inoculation of one-five hundredth volume of cells collected at the early stationary phase. The photoautotrophic growth of cells was performed in screw-capped test tubes (18-mm diameter) filled with the medium under low (2.5 μmol photons/m2/h) and high light (164 μmol photons/m2/h) conditions at 40 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra at Room Temperature—Absorption spectra of the wild-type and mutant cells are shown in Fig. 5A. They showed similar absorption spectra with high amounts of chlorosome BChl c pigments, although the absorption peak of chlorosome in the mutant cells was blue-shifted only by 3–4 nm. The contents of BChl c and BChl a did not show a significant change in the wild-type and mutant cells.Fig. 5A, absorption spectra of the wild-type C. tepidum (solid line) and PscD-less mutant (gray-shaded line). B, steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of the wild-type (solid line) and PscD-less mutant cells (broken line) measured in the presence of 0.5 mm Na2S.

Both types of cells exhibited emission peaks at 768 and 807 nm, which were derived from BChl c and BChl a, respectively. The spectrum with the high 807-nm BChl a peak in Fig. 5B was somewhat different from that reported in the isolated chlorosomes, which gave higher BChl c fluorescence compared with that of BChl a in the baseplates (19Blankenship R.E.

Of all the syndecans, syndecan-4 is the most ubiquitously expressed. Of the remaining family members, syndecan-1 is primarily expressed in epithelia, syndecan-2 in connective tissue, and syndecan-3 in nervous tissues. A number of studies have shown that syndecan-4 is important in adapting to physiological stresses. Its expression is up-regulated in response to hypoxia (2Zhang Y. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Simons M.

A number of studies implicate syndecan-4 in the regulation of the small GTPase Rho in events associated with cell attachment and migration. First, syndecan-4 co-operates, in a Rho-mediated manner, with integrins in the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers when cells adhere to the ECM molecule fibronectin (FN) (8Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are macromolecular complexes that are composed of transmembrane receptors and structural and signaling cytoplasmic molecules. Integrins and syndecan-4 are the two transmembrane receptors of focal adhesions (9Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Denhez F. Iwabuchi T. Saoncella S. Calautti E. Goetinck P.F. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 19: 305-313Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syndecan-4 ligation is necessary for the phosphorylation of Tyr397 of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The syndecan-4 dependent phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 is also Rho-dependent and we have shown that syndecan-4-null cells have reduced levels of activated Rho (10Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Denhez F. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32970-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FAK participates in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK and JNK (11Igishi T. Fukuhara S. Patel V. Katz B.Z. Yamada K.M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Although a role of syndecan-4 in the activation of the three major MAPKs has not been systematically investigated, it has been shown that syndecan-4 ligation is not involved in the activation of ERK (18Kim J. Han I. Kim Y. Kim S. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have observed that syndecan-4-null fibroblasts plated on FN display a morphology that suggests an alteration in Rac1 signaling. Since Rac1 regulates the activation of JNK and p38, we tested the hypothesis that syndecan-4 may regulate the activity of Rac1 and the stress responsive MAPKs JNK and p38 leading to changes in nuclear signaling. We report that syndecan-4-null fibroblasts have elevated levels of GTP-bound Rac1. They also have elevated levels of the activated forms of p38, JNK, and increased ATF-2 transcriptional activity. The introduction of a dominant-negative construct of Rac1 or the reexpression of syndecan-4 in the syndecan-4-null cells lowers the activation states of the two MAPKs as well as the ATF-2 transcriptional activity.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). For experimental analyses, 6 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish were seeded in DMEM with 10% FBS overnight and subsequently switched to serum-free medium (SFM) for 24 h. At this point they were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline minus calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (PBS, Invitrogen), detached with a 1:1 dilution of PBS/EDTA, and 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), and maintained in suspension for 3 h at 37 °C in SFM before plating either on tissue culture plates or on glass coverslips that were coated with 10 μg/ml of FN (BD Biosciences) diluted in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates and coverslips were washed with PBS before the fibroblasts were allowed to attach and spread for the indicated time in SFM. DNA and Viral Constructs—p-CMV-SPORT6-S4, a mouse syndecan-4 core protein encoding cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC002312) was from ATCC. A syndecan-4 recombinant adenovirus (AdS4) was generated by subcloning the mouse cDNA for syndecan-4 into the pAdTrack-CMV expression vector, which already carries a cDNA for the GFP, and used as a shuttle vector for the generation of replication-defective adenovirus as described by He et al. (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar).

The fusion trans-activator plasmid pFA-ATF-2 and the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc was from Stratagene, and the reporter plasmid phRL-TK (GenBank™ accession number AF362545) was from Promega. Syndecan-4 Recombinant Adenovirus Infection and Transfections— AdS4 and the control virus, AdGFP, were purified by double banding on CsCl2 gradients and used at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Infection of primary fibroblasts was performed in DMEM for 1 h, followed by a further incubation for 24 h in complete medium and 24 h in DMEM. Transient transfection of primary syndecan-4-WT and syndecan-4-nul fibroblasts were performed with the indicated expression constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cell extracts were analyzed after 24 h in SFM. Immunofluorescence—Fibroblasts of both genotypes were seeded for 1 h on FN-coated glass slides, fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 15 min, and stained for Rac1 or actin. The Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used at a 1/50 dilution. To visualize the primary antibody staining, the slides were incubated with a 1/100 dilution of Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 45 min at 37 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used for actin staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemical analysis was done with a Leica TCS NT4D confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The lack of bleed-through between channels in the double labeling experiments was verified experimentally. Rac1 Activation Assay—Levels of GTP-bound Rac1 were determined in syndecan-4-null and WT fibroblasts adherent to FN-coated tissue culture dishes using the Rac1 Activation Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with a fusion protein of GST with the PDB domain of human PAK-1 that selectively binds the GTP-bound form of Rac1. Bound proteins were washed and eluted with boiling sample buffer before electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE. Rac1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). A fraction of the cell lysates used in the Rac1 activation assay was directly assayed by immunoblotting Rac1 for assay normalization. The blots were washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, and developed with the West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Immunodetection of Proteins—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in boiling SDS-lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), supplemented with 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween and incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies were used for the dually phosphorylated active forms of ERK-1 and -2 (Thr202/Tyr204), p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), and JNK/SAPK (Thr183/Tyr185) and for p38-substrate site Thr69/71 of ATF-2. Phospho-specific antibodies and antibodies for the corresponding total proteins were purchased from Cell Signaling and Technology. An antibody directed against actin (Sigma) was used to monitor gel loading. Immunoblots were developed with the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and quantified by densitometric analysis using the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). The amount of each activated protein relative to the total amount of that protein of at least three independent experiments was used to calculate a ratio that quantifies the fold induction relative to controls. Syndecan-4 core protein was detected using a goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after cell lysates were treated with heparitinase I using the protocol of Ott and Rapraeger (20Ott V.L. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35291-35298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—ATF-2 transcriptional activity was assayed by transiently transfecting cells with the pFA-ATF-2 trans-activator plasmid (0.1 μg) and the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (2 μg) (Path-Detect in Vivo Signal Transduction Pathway Reporter System, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reporter plasmid pRL-TK (0.025 μg) that expresses Renilla luciferase from Renilla reniformis was co-transfected in each experiment as an internal control for assay normalization. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities of the cellular lysates were assayed after cells were kept in complete media for 20 h and in DMEM supplemented with 1% of FBS for an additional 20 h, using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). Light emission was quantified using a Victor 2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The firefly luciferase activity of each sample was normalized for the Renilla luciferase activity of the same sample. The values plotted were the average ± S.E. of triplicate samples from typical experiments, which were repeated at least three times with nearly identical results. Results are expressed as arbitrary units relative to the indicated control samples. Syndecan-4-null Fibroblasts Display Enhanced Lamellipodia, Altered Subcellular Localization of Rac1, and Increased Rac1 Activity—When syndecan-4-null and WT fibroblasts were plated on FN for 1 h, the mutant cells displayed enhanced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia compared with the WT cells. Such a cellular morphology is usually associated with Rac1 function early in the cell adhesion process (21Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar, 22Nobes C.D.

Immunocytochemical analysis for the localization of Rac1 revealed a pronounced sublocalization of the small GTPase in the membrane lamellipodia and ruffles of the syndecan-4-null cells compared with WT cells. In addition, a punctate perinuclear staining pattern of Rac1 was more pronounced in the mutant cells (Fig 1A). These data suggest a functional link between syndecan-4 and Rac1 during cell-matrix interactions. The small GTPase Rac1 cycles between a GTP-bound active and a GDP-bound inactive state (28Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). To test whether the altered cell morphology and localization of Rac1 in the syndecan-4-null fibroblasts reflects alterations in Rac1 activity, we analyzed the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 in syndecan-4-null and WT fibroblasts that had adhered to FN for 1 h. We found that the level of GTP-bound Rac1 was 4.6-fold higher in syndecan-4-null cells compared with WT cells relative to the total amount of Rac1 protein (Fig. 1B). The level of GTP-bound Rac1 in syndecan-4-null cells was still elevated after 3 h of attachment to FN, whereas the level in the WT cells had diminished (data not shown). These results are consistent with the possibility that the enhanced lamellipodia in the syndecan-4-null cells are associated with an increased Rac1 activity. To test directly whether the elevated level of GTP-bound Rac1 in the syndecan-4-null cells results from the absence of syndecan-4, syndecan-4 was re-introduced in the mutant cells using an adenoviral delivery system. The effectiveness of the re-expression of syndecan-4 in syndecan-4-null fibroblasts was evident when extracts from cells infected with the AdS4 virus, but not from extracts of cells infected with the control AdGFP virus, are immunoblotted with syndecan-4 antibodies (Fig. 1C). When adenovirally delivered syndecan-4 was re-expressed in the syndecan-4-null cells, the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 were 3.6-fold lower compared with the levels seen in mutant cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 1D). These cells also showed a concomitant decrease in lamellipodia (data not shown). These data indicate a role for syndecan-4 in modulating the activation state of Rac1 and/or its targeting to the cell membrane. The Levels of p38, JNK, and ATF-2 Phosphorylation Are Elevated in Syndecan-4-null Fibroblasts through a Rac1-dependent Mechanism—The Rho GTPases play a role in transducing cell surface originated signals intracellularly and in the regulation of gene expression through the activation of the MAPKs, p38, SAPK/JNK, and ERK (15Coso O.A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Specifically, activated Rac1 has been shown to activate p38 and JNK but not ERK (16Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Anchorage of cells to the ECM through integrins and stimulation of cells with soluble ligands through receptor tyrosine kinases are known to regulate ERK and JNK (29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 30Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since syndecan-4 co-operates with integrins in cells adherent to FN (8Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and in light of the observation that the absence of syndecan-4 results in elevated levels of GTP-bound Rac1, we analyzed the possible contribution of syndecan-4 to MAPK signaling in cells adherent to FN for 3 h. These analyses indicated that the levels of phosphorylated, active p38 MAPK and JNK are, respectively, 2.4- and 2.2-fold higher in cells lacking syndecan-4 compared with WT cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that syndecan-4 signaling may negatively regulate the stress-activated p38 and JNK MAPK cascades. The activation level of ERK in syndecan-4-null cells did not differ from that of syndecan-4 WT cells in three independent tests (Fig. 2C). This observation is consistent with the results obtained by Kim et al. (18Kim J. Han I. Kim Y. Kim S. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that syndecan-4 does not co-operate with integrins in modulating ERK signaling during cell-FN adhesion. Activation of MAPKs results in their translocation to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate transcription factors (31Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 32Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J.

We tested whether the elevated levels of p38 and JNK might be reflected in changes in the activity of transcription factors. As a representative transcription factor, we analyzed the ATF-2 protein, which can be phosphorylated and activated by both p38 and JNK (34Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 35Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 36van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). For this purpose we compared syndecan-4-null and WT cells for their levels of dually phosphorylated Thr69/71 of ATF-2, which represent the p38 and JNK phosphorylation sites of this transcription factor. Consistent with the elevated levels of active p38 and JNK seen in the mutant cells, the syndecan-4-null cells exhibited a 2.7-fold higher level of ATF-2 phosphorylation levels compared with WT cells (Fig. 2D). The results shown in Fig. 2 were obtained with cells adherent to FN for 3 h, and identical data were obtained with cells adherent to FN for as long as 24 h or with cells seeded in serum (data not shown). An identical pattern of activation for p38, JNK, and ATF-2 is also observed between syndecan-4-null and WT cells transfected with an empty expression vector and subjected to the same culture conditions. Under these conditions the levels of activation for p38, JNK, and ATF-2 in the syndecan-4-null cells were 3.1, 2.1, and 2.2, respectively, compared with WT cells (Fig. 3, A–C). These data suggest a novel role for syndecan-4 in the integration of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus at the level of MAPK signaling. To test whether the elevated level of active, phosphorylated p38, JNK, and ATF-2 detected in syndecan-4-null cells depends on Rac1 signaling, syndecan-4-null and WT fibroblasts were transiently transfected with a dominant-negative Rac1 mutant (RacN17). The syndecan-4-null cells transfected with RacN17 show a restoration in the phosphorylation levels of p38, JNK, and ATF-2 to the levels of the WT mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A′—C′). Thus, the elevated levels of activated p38, JNK, and ATF-2 seen in syndecan-4-null cells depend on Rac1 signaling. ATF-2 Transcriptional Activity Is Elevated in Syndecan-4-null Cells—To verify whether the increased Thr69/71 phosphorylation of ATF-2 in the syndecan-4-null cells represents an increase in ATF-2 dependent transcription, we quantified the transcriptional activity of ATF-2 in syndecan-4-WT and null fibroblasts using a luciferase-based assay. Syndecan-4-null cells showed a 6.7-fold increase in ATF-2-dependent luciferase activity compared with WT cells (Fig. 4A). We then tested whether this elevated transcription is Rac1-dependent by repeating the assay in cells transfected with the expression vector for RacN17 or an empty vector that were co-transfected with the ATF-2-Luc reporter plasmids in both syndecan-4-WT and null cells. The mock-transfected syndecan-4-null cells showed a 10.3-fold higher ATF-2 transcriptional activity relative to the mock-transfected WT cells. RacN17-transfected WT and syndecan-4-null cells showed levels of ATF-2 luciferase activity that were 0.43- and 1.85-fold those of the control value, respectively (Fig. 4B). Together these results indicate that syndecan-4-null cells have increased ATF-2 transcriptional activity that is Rac1-dependent. Re-expression of Syndecan-4 in Syndecan-4-null Cells Suppresses the Elevated Levels of ATF-2 Phosphorylation and Transcriptional Activity Observed in the Mutant Cells—To assess whether the elevated ATF-2 activation and transcriptional activity seen in syndecan-4-null cells is truly syndecan-4-dependent, we measured ATF-2 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity in syndecan-4-null cells in which syndecan-4 was re-expressed either by infection with the AdS4 virus or by transient transfection with a plasmid expression vector that harbors the mouse syndecan-4 cDNA. The re-expression of syndecan-4 in the mutant cells resulted in a 2.1-fold reduction of Thr69/71 ATF-2 phosphorylation compared with control virus-infected cells (Fig. 4C). In the experiments designed to measure the effect of re-expressing syndecan-4 on ATF-2 transcriptional activity we observe a 6.6-fold higher activity in the mock-transfected syndecan-4-null cells compared with mock-transfected WT cells. Upon transfection of the syndecan-4 construct, we observed a reduction in ATF-2 activity to 0.45 in the WT cells and to 2.45 in the syndecan-4-null cells relative to the levels measured in the mock-transfected WT cells (Fig. 4D). The reduction in ATF-2 transcriptional activity seen in the mutant cells has not reached levels of activity seen in WT cells. This may result from a limited efficiency of syndecan-4 expression by transient transfection. Consistent with this view is the observation that when mutant cells are transfected with a lower concentration of the syndecan-4 construct, we observe less of a reduction in ATF-2 transcriptional activity. Together, these results indicate that the elevated levels of ATF-2 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity in syndecan-4-null fibroblasts are substantially diminished by the re-expression of syndecan-4 Conclusion—In the present study we have demonstrated that fibroblasts that lack syndecan-4 have elevated levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and as a result elevated levels of the activated forms of the stress-activated MAPKs p38 and JNK and the transcription factor ATF-2. We also demonstrate an increased transcriptional activity of ATF-2. ATF-2 is a transcription factor that is involved in a number of biological functions such as growth factor signaling, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and in the regulation of stress responsive genes (34Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The syndecan-4-dependent, and Rac1-mediated, regulation of ATF-2 transcriptional activity represents a novel function for this cell surface proteoglycan. There is increasing evidence that suggests that syndecan-4 mRNA and syndecan-4 levels are up-regulated in physiological stress situations. In addition, in the absence of syndecan-4 there is a decreased ability of adapting to physiological stress situation (reviewed in Ref. 9Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Denhez F. Iwabuchi T. Saoncella S. Calautti E. Goetinck P.F. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 19: 305-313Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the elevated levels of GTP-bound Rac1, p38, JNK, and ATF-2 in the syndecan-4-null cells documented in the present study may be a reflection of a deregulation of signaling pathways that are normally controlled by syndecan-4 during stress situations. The exact mechanisms of such regulation remain to be elucidated. We thank Fabienne Denhez, Tokuro Iwabuchi, and Sarah Wilcox-Adelman for many helpful discussions."

Here we describe the cloning and characterization of viral IAP-associated factor (VIAF), a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed phosphoprotein with limited homology to members of the phosducin family that associates with baculovirus Op-IAP. VIAF bound Op-IAP both in vitro and in intact cells, with each protein displaying a predominantly cytoplasmic localization. VIAF lacks a consensus IAP binding motif, and overexpression of VIAF failed to prevent Op-IAP from protecting human cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that VIAF does not function as an IAP antagonist. VIAF was unable to directly inhibit caspase activation in vitro and a reduction of VIAF protein levels by RNA interference led to a decrease in Bax-mediated caspase activation, suggesting that VIAF functions to co-regulate the apoptotic cascade. Finally, VIAF is a substrate for ubiquitination mediated by Op-IAP. Thus, VIAF is a novel IAP-interacting factor that functions in caspase activation during apoptosis.

Several members of this family are potent inhibitors of apoptotic cell death, and functional studies have indicated that IAPs exert their protective effects at both proximal and distal stages in the apoptotic cascade, in part through the direct inhibition of caspases, cysteine proteases known to play key effector roles in the cell death pathway (4Budihardjo I.

The prototype iap gene (Op-iap) from the baculovirus OpM-NPV was originally identified through its ability to inhibit apoptotic cell death in insect cells (2Miller L.K.

This class of IAP interacting factors typically contains a consensus IAP binding motif, known as an IBM, at their N terminus that is required for binding. In an attempt to further understand the mechanisms by which IAPs can suppress apoptosis in mammalian cells, we screened a human B-cell two-hybrid library using Op-IAP as bait. Here we report the identification of viral IAP-associated factor (VIAF), a ubiquitously expressed phosphoprotein with limited homology to members of the phosducin family. VIAF homologs exist in a number of eukaryotic genomes, including mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila, and yeast, suggesting that the function of this gene is conserved throughout evolution. VIAF efficiently binds Op-IAP both in vitro and in intact cells, yet VIAF does not appear to contain a consensus IBM within the primary sequence. Indeed, overexpression of VIAF does not alter the ability of Op-IAP to prevent Bax-mediated death in human cells, suggesting that VIAF does not function as an IAP antagonist. However, suppression of VIAF by RNA interference markedly inhibited the processing of caspase-3 following the induction of the apoptotic program by Bax. VIAF was found to be a substrate of Op-IAP-mediated ubiquitination, suggesting that VIAF may be regulated by IAP proteins in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. Thus VIAF is a novel factor conserved throughout evolution that interacts with IAPs and modulates the activation of caspases during apoptosis. Materials—Reagents were obtained from the following sources: glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences); Ni2+-NTA-agarose, l-glutamine, and PBS (Invitrogen); FBS (HyClone); DMEM (Mediatech); Apo-Target protease assay kit (BIOSOURCE); DEVD-AFC, (BioMol); protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete mini) (Roche Applied Science); all other chemicals were from Sigma.

Anti-Op-IAP was a gift of Dr. Maria S. Robles (Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid). A polyclonal VIAF antiserum was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with full-length recombinant VIAF. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and cDNA Cloning—The entire open reading frame of Op-IAP was cloned in-frame into the Gal4 expression vector pAS1 (59Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid library screening and analysis were performed exactly as described previously (60Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Duckett C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol.

Full-length VIAF clones were identified by BLAST analysis of human EST databases, and clones from non-human species were subsequently identified by BLAST and TFASTA searches (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin). To obtain the full-length Drosophila gene, 3′-end rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed. Sequence Analysis—The GenBank™ accession numbers used for alignments are as follows: for VIAF genes, AF110511 (human), AF110512 (mouse), AF110513 (Drosophila), AF175204 (zebrafish), XP_237079.2 (rat); for Phosducin genes, AAH21920.1 (mouse), P20942 (rat), CAD10383.2 (dog), P20941 (human), P219632 (cow); for PhLP genes, AAH06578.1 (mouse), NP_071583.1 (rat), AAH17227.1 (human), NP_777184 (cow); for mouse PhLP-mGCPHLP gene, AAH48432.1; for yeast PLP2 gene, AAG21890.1.

In Vitro GST Precipitation—For GST precipitation experiments, VIAF was subcloned into pGEX-2TK (N-terminal tag) (Amersham Biosciences). GST-VIAF fusion protein and GST control protein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and purified exactly as described previously (60Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Duckett C.S.

SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) were visualized by autoradiography. Cells and Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All transfections for both plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (49Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J.

GST and Ni-NTA Precipitations—Cell lysates were prepared in Triton lysis buffer and normalized for protein content by the method of Bradford (63Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). For precipitation of GST-tagged proteins and for precipitation of His6-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, glutathione-Sepharose beads or nickel-agarose beads were added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed in Triton buffer, and precipitated proteins were eluted by adding LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Recovered proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS containing 0.02–0.2% Tween, then incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Kodak XAR film. Northern Blot Hybridization and Metabolic Labeling—Northern blot analysis of a human multiple tissue blot (Clontech) was performed under high stringency conditions with a radiolabeled full-length cDNA of human VIAF according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, the blot was incubated with a radioactive probe for β-actin. For metabolic labeling experiments, HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human VIAF were incubated for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM, 10% FBS supplemented with 500 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free, ICN). Cells were harvested on ice and solubilized with Triton buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells (105) were plated onto cover-glass chamber slides and transfected either with a plasmid encoding VIAF-dsRED, or plasmids encoding FLAG-VIAF and Op-IAP. For VIAF-dsRED transfectants, live cells were stained with the nuclear dye Hoechst and immediately examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta spectrometer. Cells transfected with FLAG-VIAF and Op-IAP were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with mouse anti-FLAG or rabbit anti-Op-IAP antibodies. Following washing, cells were then incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse and Texas-Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies prior to analysis as described above. Cellular Fractionation—Cell fractions were prepared using 5 × 107 HEK293 cells as described (64Johnson B.W. Cepero E. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31546-31553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Complete-mini) per 10 ml) and equilibrated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then disrupted with a Wheaton overhead stirrer with Teflon pestle and a 5-ml glass tube (7 strokes at setting 3.5), and centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitated material was used to prepare a nuclear extract as previously described (65Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitated material, constituting the mitochondrial fraction, was washed once in buffer A and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The remaining supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected as the cytosolic fraction, and the precipitate constituted the light membrane fraction, which was also resuspended in RIPA buffer. Apoptosis Assays—HEK293 cells (3.0 × 105) were transfected as described above with pEBB-GFP and pCDNA3-Bax in the presence of pEBB-HA-Op-IAP and pEBB-VIAF and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Morphological assays for cell viability were performed by observing GFP fluorescent cells with a Leica DM IRB inverted fluorescence microscope. For caspase activation assays, supernatants and cells were pooled, centrifuged at 800 × g and resuspended in 50 μl of cell lysis buffer (BioSource). Caspase assays were performed using the ApoTarget protease assay kit (BioSource) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Caspase activity was measured for 1 h at 3 min intervals on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems) with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 508 nm. RNA Interference—All double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Xeragon/Qiagen. RNA oligonucleotides targeting GFP and survivin have been described (7Wilkinson J.C. Cepero E. Boise L.H.

Gene-specific targeting of VIAF was performed using an oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 189–209 (aatgaggaggatgaacgtgct) of the coding sequence of VIAF. Cloning and Expression of the VIAF Gene—To gain insight into the mechanism by which Op-IAP can suppress cell death in mammalian cells, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed on a human B-cell cDNA two-hybrid library using Op-IAP as bait. Three overlapping, independent groups of clones, whose in-frame coding sequences possessed identical C termini, were isolated. These were found to interact specifically with Op-IAP but not a variety of negative controls (data not shown), including the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone and the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor family member CD30 (60Gedrich R.W.

During animal embryogenesis, communication mediated by a miscellaneous cast of secreted signaling factors controls many of the complex interactions within cellular assemblies that are necessary for the correct patterning of tissues and the creation of functional organs. Secreted glycoproteins of the Wnt family take an eminent place among such signaling factors, and their widespread expression has been linked with various aspects of cellular behavior during normal and malignant development such as proliferation, survival, differentiation, polarity, and migration (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin.

Most progress has been made in untwining the molecular interactions that govern canonical Wnt signaling, which is hallmarked by its dependence on the stabilization of soluble β-catenin (as opposed to β-catenin tethered to the cytoplasmic tail of cell surface cadherins).Canonical Wnt signaling proceeds through an evolutionarily conserved pathway and starts at the cell membrane when a Wnt ligand stimulates a Frizzled-LRP5/6 receptor complex (5Tamai K.

Intracellularly the signal is transmitted by Dsh and results in the inhibition of a cytoplasmic, Axin-nucleated complex containing casein kinase-Iα, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, in addition to other proteins (7Ikeda S.

In the quiescent situation, this complex serves to constitutively phosphorylate the soluble pool of β-catenin, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome (10Jiang J. Struhl G. Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt stimulation, β-catenin thus becomes stabilized and acts in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator of target genes by interacting with high mobility group box transcription factors of the Lef1/Tcf subfamily (11Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Embryos from Xenopus have been remarkably useful in elucidating several of the mechanistic intricacies at play during canonical Wnt signaling. Xenopus also became the first vertebrate organism in which a major role for canonical Wnt signaling was unveiled, i.e. the specification of the dorsal territory in the pregastrula embryo. Despite other, more recent insights into the functional significance of canonical Wnt signaling in a number of biological systems, its full spectrum of cellular and supracellular implications still holds many aspects to be uncovered. Traditional knock-out models in vertebrates can only partially succeed in building our understanding most notably because of the frequent occurrence of functional redundancy of pathway components. Morpholino-mediated gene knock-down strategies in Xenopus only permit the evaluation of phenotypes during the first days of development, and potential early developmental perturbations can obfuscate later phenotypes. Here we describe an alternative loss-of-function approach that makes use of transgenically modified Xenopus laevis embryos in which transcription of Lef1/Tcf-β-catenin target genes can be blocked in a temporally controlled way. Besides its clear potential for advancing our comprehension of canonical Wnt signals during embryogenesis, our transgenic system opens the opportunity to identify transcriptional targets within the pristine confinements of an intact, developing organism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—Standard cloning techniques were used to generate the different constructs.

An artificial Lef1/Tcf-responsive promoter followed by the luciferase gene is present in the TOPFLASH reporter, while the FOPFLASH control plasmid contains a mutated, nonresponsive promoter. SW480 cells were grown at 37 °C in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-Gln, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected in triplicate using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfection mixtures were mass-equalized using empty pCS2+ vector and spiked with an internal standard expressing β-galactosidase (pRSV-LacZ) (18Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were further incubated with or without 10–5m dexamethasone (DX) (throughout this study diluted from a 10–2m stock made in Me2SO). Cell lysates were prepared in Reporter Assay Lysis Buffer (Roche Applied Science) 48 h post-transfection and tested for luciferase activity in the presence of substrate solution (40 mm Tricine, 2.14 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2, 5.34 mm MgSO4, 66.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 521 μm CoA, 734 μm ATP, 940 μm luciferin). Luciferase values were normalized against β-galactosidase expression determined using the Galacto-Star kit (Tropix). All measurements were carried out in a Topcount NXT luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.).In Vitro Transcription and RNA Injections—Constructs were linearized and in vitro synthesis of capped RNA was performed using SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (19Vleminckx K. Wong E. Guger K. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Eggs from X. laevis were collected, fertilized, and dejellied according to Sive et al. (20Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Volumes of 5 nl of RNA were microinjected while embryos were submerged in 0.5× MMR (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2) and 5% Ficoll. Following injection, embryos were transferred to 0.1× MMR and grown at 18 °C in the absence or presence of 10–5m DX.RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR analysis was done on individual embryos. Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol reagent (Tel-Test). First strand cDNA synthesis was done using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers in a 20-μl reaction volume containing half of the RNA preparation. A cDNA aliquot of 1 μl of RNA was amplified using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP label. Sequences of forward and reverse primers were as follows (5′ to 3′ orientation): CAGATTGGTGCTGGATATGC and ACTGCCTTGATGACTCCTAG for EF-1α, TTGTCTCTACCGCACTGA and TCCTGTTGACTGCAGACT for Siamois, GTGAATCCACTTGTGCAGTT and ACAGAGCCAATCTCATGTGC for Xnr3, TTCATCAGGTCCGAGATC and TCCTTTGAAGTGGTCGCG for En-2, CACAGTTCCACCAAATGC and GGAATCAAGCGGTACAGA for N-CAM, GGATACGATGAAGCCTCAAACCC and GTCAGCAGAAGCGGAGTCAGAG for EPH-B3, GCTGACAGAATGCAGAAG and TTGCTTGGAGGAGTGTGT for muscle actin, and TGCTGTCTCACACCATCCAGG and TCTGTACTTGGAGGTGAGGACG for α-globin. Amplified fragments were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).Transgenesis in X. laevis—Transgenic F0 embryos of X. laevis were raised following the procedure described by Kroll and Amaya (21Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sperm nuclei were freshly prepared using digitonin and filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh prior to use. SpeI was used to linearize the transgene vector and to accomplish restriction enzyme-mediated integration. After eggs were dejellied, they were handled in buffer solutions supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For transplantation of sperm nuclei, eggs were wedged in concave sided grooves fabricated from cured Sylguard 184 elastomer (Dow Corning Corp.). This type of “hanging-egg” injection facilitates penetration of the vitelline envelope and avoids piercing of eggs. Eggs were injected in series of ∼100 before being transferred to a dish containing fresh 0.1× MMR buffer and left undisturbed for about 2 h. Following the exclusion of aberrant cleavers, post-transplantation F0 embryos were cultured in 0.1× MMR at 18 °C and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (22Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin): a Systematical and Chronological Survey of Development from the Fertilized Egg Till the End of Metamorphosis. Garland Science, New York1994Google Scholar) (bovine serum albumin was omitted after stage 12.5). DX (10–5m) was added at the indicated stages and was refreshed every 3 days.Fluorescence Imaging—Embryos were photographed using a Leica MZ FLIII stereomicroscope equipped with a digital color camera (Leica DC 300F). EGFP fluorescence was visualized using the GFP3 filter set (470 nm excitation filter; narrow band pass 525 nm barrier filter) because of its ability to block most autofluorescence. Equal exposure times and fixed software settings were applied throughout. Because of their size, EGFP images of older embryos were made at the lowest magnification, producing a relative under-representation of the actual signal strength.Western Blot Analysis—Total protein lysates were prepared by homogenizing Xenopus embryos individually in 60 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Following centrifugation, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (half of the supernatants was loaded) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 prior to incubation with the following antibodies: mouse anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (Babco), mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (clone C4) (MP Biomedicals), and rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (BD Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies combined with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).BrdUrd Incorporation Assays and Whole-mount Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Analysis—Explants of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs were isolated from tadpoles and immersed for 2 h at 26 °C in 60% L-15 medium containing 20 μm BrdUrd (BrdUrd Labeling and Detection Kit II, Roche Applied Science) (23Ishizuya-Oka A. Ueda S. Damjanovski S. Li Q. Liang V.C. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following fixation in 70% ethanol, the explants were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6-μm thickness. Sections were deparaffinized, blocked with 10% goat serum, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Incubation with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and subsequent staining steps were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Whole-mount TUNEL staining of Xenopus embryos was done as described by Hensey and Gautier (24Hensey C. Gautier J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) using BM Purple (Roche Applied Science) as a chromogenic substrate. Following the staining reaction, embryos were further processed by rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20 and by refixing overnight in Bouin's fixative. After several washings with phosphate-buffered saline containing 70% ethanol, 0.03% Tween 20, embryos were bleached in 0.5× SSC, 1% H2O2, 5% formamide and then cleared in benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol (2:1).RESULTSAn Optimized Inducible Repressor of Target Genes of Lef1/Tcf-dependent β-Catenin Signaling—To block transcriptional activation of target genes of canonical Wnt signaling in a way that would permit temporal control we resorted to the use of a hormone-inducible fusion composed of the high mobility group box of mouse Lef1 (LefΔN), the repression domain of Drosophila Engrailed, and the hormone-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor. The high mobility group box present in Lef1/Tcf transcription factors consists of a highly conserved DNA-binding domain and mediates recognition of a conserved consensus sequence in the promoter region of target genes (25Clevers H. van de Wetering M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of a steroid-binding domain aims at keeping the corresponding protein quiescent until an appropriate ligand liberates its functional activity (27Picard D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most often, inducible transcription factors of this kind have been utilized to achieve gain-of-function of target genes. Given the lower success rate with a gene repression domain, we decided to generate a set of three variants of the fusion by combining the respective domains in distinct arrangements (see Supplemental Fig. S1). These variants were functionally tested by means of TOP/FOPFLASH reporter assays in SW480 cells, which are characterized by constitutive activation of the canonical Wnt pathway (Fig. 1A). All constructs respond to DX, but considerable differences were measured with regard to the actual strength of the repression that was incited. In addition, varying degrees of background repression could be detected when DX was absent. Based on this comparative analysis, we chose to proceed with EnR-LefΔN-GR since this variant displays a low level of background activity combined with a fairly strong functional activation. This favorable fusion was then further optimized by mutational inactivation of the TAF-2 motif in the GR domain (Glu to Ala substitution at position 755). This motif has the capacity to recruit transcriptional coactivators (28Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 29Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), which may operate in quenching the activity of the EnR repression domain. The resulting mutant fusion, referred to as EnR-LefΔN-GR755A, was found to exert superior repression coupled with a strong functional inducibility.EnR-LefΔN-GR755A Strongly Inhibits Lef1/Tcf-β-Catenin Signaling in Xenopus Embryos—We then examined whether our optimized fusion could also inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos. In blastula stage embryos, dorsal activation of the maternal Wnt pathway prevents the initiation of a ventral fate program. Following dorsal microinjection with EnR-LefΔN-GR755A, embryos were kept in culture with or without DX. The powerful inhibitory effect of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A on canonical Wnt signaling was evidenced by severe ventralization of the phenotype in the presence of DX (Fig. 1B). At the dose used, no signs of ventralization were observed when DX was omitted. DX-dependent inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling in injected embryos was further confirmed by demonstrating repression of the transcriptional targets Siamois and Xnr3 (Fig. 1C). These results also highlight the fact that although the fusion incorporates the DNA-binding domain of Lef1, its capacity to inhibit target genes is not subordinate to the particular type of endogenous Lef1/Tcf usage, as Siamois is controlled via Tcf3 (30Brannon M. Gomperts M. Sumoy L. Moon R.T. Kimelman D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar).Design and Integration of a Transgene Vector Based on EnR-LefΔN-GR755A—Clearly, integration of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A as a transgene strongly requires that the activity of the fusion can be blocked firmly until DX is added. We were uncertain whether this aspect was sufficiently bolstered to permit constitutive expression of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A as a transgene. Despite the strong inducibility of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A, a ∼2-fold reduction of TOPFLASH reporter activity was observed upon transfection when DX was absent (Fig. 1A). This partial leakiness in DX dependence was also observed in Xenopus embryos upon microinjection with EnR-LefΔN-GR755A RNA in excess of a certain threshold dose (not shown).To warrant leak-proof control of the fusion, we extended the inducibility of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A by DX to its transcriptional level by incorporating a Gal4-VP16-GR/UAS induction loop. We created a single, composite transgene vector featuring all the required sequences (Fig. 2). A fusion encoding a DX-inducible Gal4-VP16-GR transactivator was placed under transcriptional control of the ubiquitously active Xenopus EF-1α promoter. The minimal carp E1b promoter preceded by a multimer of 14 Gal4-binding UAS elements was used to drive expression of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A. Because amphibian transgenesis gives rise to a mixed population of transgenic and non-transgenic post-transplantation embryos, an EGFP expression cassette containing a small size, basic derivative of the human E-cadherin promoter (16Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. Van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) was built into this vector as well, thus providing a screenable marker and allowing verification of proper non-mosaic integration. Transgenic embryos were usually characterized by a faint gloss of fluorescence. A clear advantage of the basic E-cadherin promoter is its early onset of activity in the superficial tissue layers, enabling identification of bona fide transgenic F0 embryos already at midgastrulation. In early embryos, EGFP appears to be expressed in most tissues. Later, EGFP fluorescence acquires a more tissue-specific character, while its overall intensity seems to decline.Fig. 2Design of a multicomponent transgenesis vector containing EnR-LefΔN-GR755A. A vector suited for transgenesis in Xenopus was designed by combining several elements on a single plasmid. DX-dependent transcription of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A was accomplished through use of the Gal4-based binary expression system. An EGFP expression cassette was inserted to mark transgenic embryos. A unique SpeI site upstream of the EF-1α promoter was used to linearize the vector. Coding and intervening sequences are drawn to scale. E-cadh., E-cadherin promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then verified whether EnR-LefΔN-GR755A was firmly quenched by this double mode of dependence on DX. A problem inherent to the nuclear transplantation technique in Xenopus transgenesis is the fairly high frequency of defects that arise during gastrulation of post-transplantation F0 embryos. Although often resulting in early mortality, these gastrulation defects also yield a sundry collection of malformations at later embryonic stages, which can seriously obfuscate the transgeneelicited phenotype. The physical linkage of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A with a screenable EGFP marker provides a useful aid to distinguish specific defects from spontaneous anomalies. To ascertain whether our inducible system was leak-proof, transgenic, healthy end-gastrula F0 embryos were singled out at random and followed through development for the appearance of phenotypic defects. We focused particularly on embryos characterized by strong fluorescence, since these would be more susceptible to functional leakiness of the construct because of multiple transgene copies or because of integrations in transcriptionally hyperactive loci. However, no phenotypic abnormalities could be detected. In fact, transgenic embryos could be raised to well beyond the limb bud stage (see Supplemental Fig. S2). To the extent that these external inspections allow dependable inference, we conclude that transgenically integrated EnR-LefΔN-GR755A does not perturb normal premetamorphic development as long as DX is excluded from the medium.DX Induces Expression of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A in Transgenic Embryos—To test proper induction of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A expression upon treatment with DX, transgenic F0 embryos were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A was clearly induced upon culturing with DX. No clear protein band could be detected in the absence of DX. It is difficult to predict whether this low background expression makes additional, protein-intrinsic DX dependence of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A dispensable. It is important to keep in mind, however, that in nonestablished F0 embryos carrying random transgene integrations, individual differences in background expression are likely to exist as was also demonstrated recently using a doxycycline-inducible system (31Das B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4839-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In light of this, we judge that the post-translational inducibility of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A adds a secure fail-safe.Fig. 3Western blot analysis of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A expression in transgenic embryos treated with DX. Transgenic F embryos (stage 26 and stage 44) were treated with DX for 24 h or left 0untreated before being processed by Western blot analysis. EnR-LefΔN-GR755A protein was detected using an antibody against the C-terminal hemagglutinin epitopes. Expression of EnR-LefΔN-GR755A was clearly induced upon DX treatment. Similar amounts of EGFP were detected in transgenic embryos, consistent with the comparable fluorescence intensities of the respective embryos prior to the treatment (pictures on top).

Beyond the gastrula stage of Xenopus development, only the En-2 marker gene of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary has so far been identified as a direct transcriptional target (32McGrew L.L. Takemaru K. Bates R. Moon R.T. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, addition of DX at the end-gastrula stage nearly completely abolished En-2 expression. A second candidate we investigated was the tyrosine kinase receptor EPH-B3, which was identified as a downstream target of canonical Wnt signaling in the mammalian intestine and in ovarian tumors (33Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

In addition, its embryonic expression pattern has been partially described in chicken (35Baker R.K. Vanderboom A.K. Bell G.W. Antin P.B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 104: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of EPH-B3 in the presence of DX was less prominent but nevertheless clearly appreciable when compared with a set of control genes (Fig. 4B). Together, these results validate the use of our inducible Wnt-inhibitory transgenic system.Fig. 4RT-PCR analysis of target gene repression in EnR-LefΔN-GR755A transgenic embryos treated with DX.

In the case of bacteria, replication of the chromosome, plasmids, and infecting phages occurs at the cell membrane (for review see Ref. 1Firshein W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 89-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Besides acting as a scaffold and inherently compartmentalizing DNA replication, membranes are also likely to play an important role in the organization and function of the DNA replication complex (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Sueoka N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 3Cronan J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, very little is known about proteins participating in these processes. We started to investigate this fundamental process by using the Bacillus subtilis phage φ29, one of the best studied phages (for review see Ref. 4Meijer W.J.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as a model system. The genome of φ29 encodes most, if not all, proteins required for phage DNA replication, and detailed knowledge is available on in vitro φ29 DNA replication. This makes φ29 an attractive system to study membrane-associated DNA replication. The genome of φ29 consists of a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; TP, terminal protein; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; RP-LC/MS, reverse phase-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry; IT, ion trap. that contains a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked at each 5′ end. Initiation of φ29 DNA replication occurs via a so-called protein-primed mechanism (4Meijer W.J.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). First, the TP-containing DNA ends are recognized by a φ29 DNA polymerase/TP heterodimer. Then, after a transition step, these two proteins dissociate, and the DNA polymerase continues processive elongation, which is coupled to strand displacement, until replication of the nascent DNA strand is completed. Consequently, the DNA replication intermediates can contain extremely long stretches of ssDNA. Ivarie and Pène (7Ivarie R.D. Pène J.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) provided evidence that early expressed φ29 protein(s) are required for membrane-associated φ29 DNA replication. Gene 16.7, present in an early expressed operon, is conserved in all φ29-related phages studied so far (4Meijer W.J.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Studies using a soluble variant in which the membrane anchor is replaced by a histidine tag, p16.7A, revealed (i) that it is a dimer in solution, (ii) that it has both single-stranded (ss) and dsDNA binding activity, and (iii) that it has affinity for the φ29 TP (8Meijer W.J.J.

Chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and ampicillin were added to cultures and plates at final concentrations of 10, 20, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. DNA Techniques—All DNA manipulations were carried out according to Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Overexpression and Purification of p16.7A and Its Derivatives and of TP—Protein p16.7A and all its derivatives, except p16.7Cb, contain an N-terminal His6 tag (see Fig. 1A). Therefore, these proteins were purified from the corresponding E. coli strains in which they were overexpressed using Ni2+-NTA resin columns as described before (8Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, overnight cultures of E. coli harboring the appropriate plasmid were diluted 100-fold in fresh prewarmed LB medium and grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.7. Expression, induced upon isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition to a final concentration of 1 mm, was allowed for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C until further use. Frozen cells were thawed at 4 °C and ground with twice their weight of alumina powder (Merck) for 20 min. The slurry was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using 4 volumes per g of cells. To remove the alumina and intact cells, the mixture was centrifuged at 2500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged again as before. The pooled supernatants were next centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to pellet the insoluble proteins. After dialyzing the soluble fraction against buffer B (50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.8), the cell extract was centrifuged again for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was subsequently passed twice over a Ni2+-NTA resin column equilibrated in buffer B. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 20, 30, 40, and 45 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was eluted with 5 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole. Next, the eluate was dialyzed against buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 50% glycerol, and the protein was stored at -70 °C in aliquots. Wild type TP was purified from B. subtilis 110NA cells harboring the TP expression plasmid pPR54w3 (15Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) essentially as described before (16Zaballos A. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein p16.7Cb was obtained by digestion of protein p16.7C with thrombin using the thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen). Complete cleavage of p16.7C with thrombin, carried out according to the manual, was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The biotinylated thrombin used to cleave p16.7C was then removed from the sample by using the streptavidin-agarose column provided with the kit, and SDS-PAGE was used to verify the removal of thrombin. Next, the sample was passed over a Ni2+-NTA resin column to remove the cleaved histidine tag and possible trace amounts of undigested p16.7C. Finally, the sample containing purified p16.7Cb was dialyzed against buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 50% glycerol and was stored at -70 °C in aliquots. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of the intact protein p16.7Cb gave a single peak corresponding to 8461.6 Da (average molecular weight), which corresponds well with the calculated molecular mass of 8457.6 Da if thrombin had cleaved p16.7C at its expected site indicated in Fig. 1A. Moreover, the peptide map obtained after in-gel tryptic digestion of p16.7Cb contained a fragment with a molecular mass of 674.3 Da, which matches the calculated molecular weight of the “GSHMDK” peptide corresponding to the expected N-terminal tryptic fragment. Finally, the sequence of this peptide was confirmed by RP-LC/ESI-IT mass spectrometry analysis. In Vitro Cross-linking and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Cross-linking reactions using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) as cross-linking agent and gel retardation assays were performed as described before (8Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Serna-Rico A. Muñoz-Espín D. Villar L. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy and Dissociation/Unfolding Equilibrium Analyses—CD measurements were carried out using a Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a NESLAB RTE-100 temperature control unit interfaced to a computer. The recorded far-UV spectra were the average of three to five scans obtained at a rate of 50 nm/min, a response time of 2 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Samples were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 250 mm NaCl, at the indicated concentrations. The temperature was kept constant at 25, 15, or 4 °C, and each sample was allowed to reach chemical and thermal equilibrium. The percent helicity of the protein was calculated by using the following equation (17Chen Y. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar): % helicity = θR/(θRH(1 - k/n)), where θR is the molar ellipticity per residue at 222 nm; θRH is the molar ellipticity per residue at 222 nm for a 100% α-helical protein, taken as -34,500 degrees·cm2/dmol; k is a constant factor (k = 2.57 for λ = 222 nm); and n is the number of peptide bonds in the protein. Chemical denaturation equilibrium experiments were carried out by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm of p16.7N solutions at 548 μm in 23 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 117 mm NaCl, containing different concentrations of GdmHCl (from 0 to 3.5 m), and using 0.1-mm path length cells. The temperature was kept constant at 4 °C, and each sample was allowed to reach chemical and thermal equilibrium. The data were fitted to a folded dimer-to-unfolded monomer, two-state transition. The equations described in Mateu (18Mateu M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software) were used. Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—A calibrated Superdex 75 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) was used. The chromatographic process was carried out at constant room temperature (23 °C) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 1 ml/min. For an estimation of dissociation constants, analytical gel filtration experiments were carried out as described (19Darling P.J. Holt J.M. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11500-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Partial Proteolytic Digestion of p16.7A—Proteolytic digestion was performed in a final volume of 25 μl, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 9 μg of purified p16.7A protein, and the indicated amount (ng) of proteinase K. After incubation for 1 min at 30 °C, proteolysis was stopped by addition of 4× loading buffer after which the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Protein bands were cut from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, minimizing the amount of polyacrylamide gel. Each band was digested “in situ” with trypsin as described before (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). A small aliquot of the trypsin digestion supernatant (0.5 μl) was analyzed directly by MALDI-TOF-type of mass spectrometry using an Autoflex model of Bruker Daltonic (Bremen, Germany) equipped with a reflector and employing 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix and a Anchor-Chip surface target (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). The experimentally obtained tryptic peptide maps were assigned by comparing their masses with the calculated ones obtained after theoretical tryptic digestion. The assignation was verified by analyzing the various peptides by reverse phase-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (RP-LC/MS). For this, an electrospray with an ion trap analyzer (ESI-IT) mass spectrometer (model Deca-XP; Thermo-Finnigan, San José, CA) and a ThermoHypersil (0.18 × 150 mm) C18 column was used. The digests were dried in a speedvac and resuspended in 0.5% acetic acid (dissolved in water) before they were supplied to LC/RP-MS and subjected to an organic gradient. The solvents used are as follows: 0.5% acetic acid in water (aqueous solvent) and 80% acetonitrile in water (organic solvent) at a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min using a micro-spray “metal needle-kit” (Thermo-Finnigan, San José, CA) interface. The analyzer was programmed to isolate and fragment the masses of interest. The obtained MS/MS spectra from each of the peptides were analyzed by assigning the fragments to each of the candidate sequences after calculating the series of theoretical fragmentations according to the nomenclature of the ion series described before (22Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling and Computer Analysis—The secondary structure of p16.7C was predicted using different programs including SAM-T02, PredictProtein, Psi-Pred, and Jpred. The identities of p16.7C with other DNA-binding proteins were screened against the protein data base using the three-dimensional PSSM program (URL, sbg.bio.ic.a-c.uk/3dpssm/). The three-dimensional model of the C-terminal half of p16.7 was carried out by the Swiss Model program (URL, expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) (23Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar, 24Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

The p16.7 Region Spanning Residues 21–68 Is Able to Dimerize as a Low Affinity Coiled Coil—Protein p16.7, in which the N-terminal transmembrane domain has been replaced by a histidine tag (Fig. 1A, p16.7A), is a dimer in solution (8Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analyses of the p16.7A sequence revealed that the region spanning amino acid residues ∼25–60 (residue numbering is referred to the complete p16.7 sequence) has a high probability to form a coiled coil (8Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A coiled coil consists of at least two amphipathic α-helices that are wound into a superhelix having a hydrophobic interface (26Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The protein sequences of coiled coils are characterized by a heptad repeat of amino acids, denoted a–g. Residues at positions “a” and “d,” which are located at the same face of the helix, are predominantly hydrophobic and form the helix-helix interphase. A helical wheel showing the amphipathic character of this p16.7 region is presented in Fig. 1B. The following reasons made this region of p16.7 the prime candidate to be responsible for p16.7 dimerization. First, coiled-coils are ubiquitous dimerization domains found in a wide range of structural and regulatory proteins. Second, no other region was detected by analyses of the p16.7 protein sequence that a priori would hint to a possible involvement in dimerization. To test the possibility that the putative coiled-coil region is responsible for p16.7 dimerization, plasmids pET-16.7N and pET-16.7N4 were constructed and used to purify proteins p16.7N and p16.7N4 (Fig. 1A). Protein p16.7N encompasses the wild type sequence of the predicted p16.7 coiled-coil region. Protein p16.7N4 contains the same region but includes four Leu (Leu-36, Leu-39, Leu-50, and Leu-53) to Arg substitutions that would completely disrupt the hydrophobic face of the putative α-helix (Fig. 1B) and therefore would be unable to form a coiled-coil-mediated dimer. To determine their oligomeric state in solution, proteins p16.7N and p16.7N4 were subjected to in vitro cross-linking (Fig. 2A). Whereas a band with a molecular weight corresponding to a dimer was observed in the case of the wild type p16.7N protein after DSS treatment, no cross-linked species were observed for the mutant p16.7N4 protein. These results indicate that, contrary to mutant protein p16.7N4, the wild type protein p16.7N is able to dimerize in solution. The secondary structure of the wild type and mutant proteins was analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of p16.7N and p16.7N4 at low and intermediate concentrations (15 and 75 μm) at 25 °C was characteristic of a random coil (not shown). However, the spectrum of protein p16.7N obtained at high concentration (590 μm) revealed a substantial helical content at 25 °C, which increased progressively at lower temperatures (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, the CD spectrum of the mutant p16.7N4 remained characteristic of a random coil at high concentration (590 μm), even at 4 °C (Fig. 3A). The estimated helical content of the proteins at the various conditions tested are given in Table I. A maximum helical content of 44% was obtained for p16.7N at 590 μm and 4 °C. Because p16.7N is 72 amino acids long, about 31 amino acids must be contained in a helical structure under these conditions, which is consistent with the sequence-based prediction of a coiled coil spanning residues 29–57 of p16.7 (see above and Fig. 1).Fig. 3Circular dichroism analyses of p16.7N, p16.7N4, p16.7A, p16.7A4, and p16.7C.A, far-UV CD spectra of protein p16.7N (solid, dashed, and dotted lines) and p16.7N4 (dot-dashed lines) at high protein concentration (590 μm) and different temperatures: 4 (solid and single dot-dashed lines), 15 (dashed line), and 25 °C (dotted and double dot-dashed lines). Far-UV spectra of p16.7N and p16.7N4 at low (15 μm) or intermediate (75 μm) concentrations at 25 °C were highly similar to those of the presented p16.7N4 spectra (not shown). The spectra, as well as those shown in C, are truncated at a low wavelength where the measurement became unreliable. The background has been subtracted, and the spectra have been normalized.

Dimerization of p16.7N is a very low affinity process, however, because the dimeric form is favored only at high protein concentrations and low temperatures. Moreover, the presence of an isodichroic point for the CD spectra obtained at different temperatures is consistent with a two-state transition between unfolded monomer and folded dimer, with no stable intermediates (27Engel M. Williams R.W. Erickson B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3161-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Krylov D. Mikhailenko I. Vinxon C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2849-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Finally, the observation that mutant p16.7N4 was unstructured under all conditions tested further supports that dimerization of p16.7N proceeds through formation of a coiled coil. The dissociation/unfolding equilibrium of p16.7N was quantitated in chemical dissociation/denaturation experiments. Samples of p16.7N (548 μm) were treated with increasing concentrations of GdmHCl, and the ellipticity of the samples at 222 nm was obtained from the corresponding CD spectra (Fig. 3B). Because of the very low dimerization affinity, the equilibrium was studied at 4 °C. The data fitted well a two-state monomer-dimer equilibrium with a free energy difference in the absence of denaturant ΔGuH2O = 5.7 ± 0.6 kCal/mol in the standard (1 m) state at 4 °C, and an m value (the increase in ΔGu upon increasing the denaturant concentration by 1 m), m = (-2.7) ± 0.7 kcal/mol·m. The value of ΔGuH2O corresponds to an equilibrium dissociation/unfolding constant Ku = 33 μm at 4 °C. In summary, the results clearly indicate that an isolated protein containing amino acid residues 21–68 of p16.7 is able to form, albeit with low affinity, a dimeric coiled coil of about 30 residues in length, in a coupled folding and association process. Fig. 3C is described below. Protein p16.7C Forms High affinity Homodimers—To study whether the coiled coil of p16.7A is the main dimerization determinant, a mutant 16.7A gene was constructed encoding a protein, p16.7A4, that contains the same four Leu to Arg substitutions present in p16.7N4 (Fig. 1A). In vitro DSS cross-linking analysis of p16.7A and p16.7A4 (Fig. 2B) revealed two interesting features. First, the amount of cross-linked dimer species was much higher for these proteins as compared with that obtained with p16.7N at the same protein concentration, which suggests that p16.7A and p16.7A4 dimerize much more readily than p16.7N. Second, similar amounts of dimers were obtained for p16.7A and p16.7A4 after DSS cross-linking, indicating that the mutant protein p16.7A4 does form dimers in solution, despite having a disrupted coiled-coil region (see also below). The oligomerization state of p16.7A (14.5 kDa) and p16.7A4 (14.65 kDa) was confirmed by analytical gel filtration. Both proteins behaved essentially as dimers, even at low concentrations. Their respective apparent molecular masses were 35.5 and 36.3 kDa, close to the calculated values (29.0 and 29.3 kDa, respectively). Analytical gel filtration was also used to estimate the order of magnitude of the dissociation constant. The elution volumes at the extremely low protein concentrations where the monomeric form would predominate could not be determined because of the very low signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, only the final part of the association curve could be traced. Nevertheless, a very good fitting to a dimer-monomer equilibrium was obtained (Fig. 4). Also, the fitting for p16.7A yielded an apparent molecular mass of 13.5 kDa for the monomeric form, which is very close to the calculated value (14.5 kDa). The dissociation constant thus obtained for p16.7A was about 20 nm. The actual value could be even somewhat lower, because of the possible dilution of the sample in small zone elution experiments (20Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the dissociation constant of p16.7A4 was also in the nanomolar range. These results can be summarized as follows. First, the dissociation constant obtained for p16.7A was more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of p16.7N. Second, no significant reduction in the dissociation constant was observed for p16.7A4 with respect to p16.7A, despite the fact that this variant could not dimerize through the coiled-coil domain. This constitutes strong evidence that a region other than the coiled coil is responsible for the high p16.7A dimerization affinity. To study whether the isolated C-terminal half of p16.7 is able to dimerize, plasmid pET-16.7C was constructed and used to purify protein p16.7C (Fig. 1A). In vitro cross-linking analyses (Fig. 2C) and analytical gel filtration studies (Table II) demonstrated that p16.7C forms dimers in solution. The values obtained for the weight average partition coefficient corresponded very well with that calculated for the dimeric form (Table II) and remained constant over the protein concentration range tested (from 50 down to 0.1 μm). As no significant amount of the monomeric form could be detected at concentrations as low as 100 nm, the dissociation constant cannot be higher than about 10 nm (at 25 °C). This value is in the same order of magnitude as that of p16.7A and p16.7A4 at the same temperature and is more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the dissociation constant of p16.7N, even though the latter value was determined at a lower temperature (4 °C).Table IIAnalytical gel filtration of p16.7CCtaCt is the total protein (monomer) concentrationσexpbσ is the weight average partition coefficient, σ = (Ve"

These RTs specifically recognize RNA structures in their individual primer-template RNAs to initiate cDNA synthesis from the 2′-OH group of a specific internal G residue (branching G residue). Here, we purified the 66-residue, C-terminal fragment of RT-Ec86, RT from E. coli, which is responsible for the synthesis of multicopy single-stranded DNA-Ec86. This fragment, RT-Ec86-(255–320), was found to consist mainly of α-helical structures on the basis of its CD spectrum, which is consistent with the prediction of this region as the thumb domain from the structural alignment of RT-Ec86 with human immunodeficiency virus-1 RT. RT-Ec86-(255–320) was able to bind to a 28-base synthetic RNA consisting of the 5′-end single-stranded RNA containing the branching G residue and the recognition stem-loop structure in the RT-Ec86 primer-template RNA with a Kd value of 5 × 10–8m. By stepwise shortening of the 5′-end single-stranded region of the RNA, RT-Ec86-(255–320) was found still to be able to form a stable complex with only the stem-loop structure consisting of an 8-bp stem and a 3-base loop. In this stem-loop structure, the UUU loop was essential for the complex formation. RT-Ec73-(251–316) from another E. coli RT could not bind to the 28-base RNA for RT-Ec86 but could bind to its own stem-loop structure having a 3-base AGU loop. These results support the notion that the highly diverse C-terminal regions of bacterial RTs play an important role in recognizing their own specific primer-template RNA structure for the cDNA priming reaction.

Shimamoto T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 784-795Crossref Google Scholar). These RTs are encoded from a genomic element called a retron (see Fig. 1). One long retron transcript serves as an mRNA for RT at the 3′-end region, whereas the 5′-end region forms unique secondary structures using two inverted repeats, a1/a2 and b1/b2 (see Fig. 1A). In this secondary structure, an internal G residue is placed at the end of the a1/a2 stem, serving as a primer for cDNA synthesis by the RT encoded by the same transcript. Bacterial RTs are unique in using the 2′-OH group of the internal G residue (termed the branching G residue) for the cDNA priming reaction, thus forming a 2′,5′-phosphodiester linkage. As the cDNA synthesis stops before reaching the branching G residue, the final product, called msDNA, consists of both RNA and DNA, in which the cDNA is branching out from the branching G residue and the 3′-end region of the RNA molecule forms a duplex with the 3′-end region of the DNA molecule (Fig. 1A). Seven different retron species have been identified in E. coli: retron-Ec48 (2Mao J.R. Inouye S. Inouye M. J.

As can be seen, there is hardly any homology in their primary sequences in both RNA and DNA molecules. It has been demonstrated that this msDNA synthesis is highly specific, as RTs are not exchangeable between two different retrons (9Shimamoto T. Hsu M.Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol.

From the study on hybrid RT proteins between RT-Ec86 and RT-Ec73, it has been shown that the RNA structure immediately downstream of the branching G residue is responsible for the recognition of individual RTs for their own primer-template RNA molecules (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This region, shown in bold in Fig. 1A, is termed the recognition RNA structure. Using RT-Ec86 and primer RNAs of random sequences, the identical sequence to the recognition RNA for RT-Ec86 was enriched by the SELEX method, which consists of the identical 3-U loop and the 8-base pair stem structure with the 9-base sequence centering the branching G residue (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the C-terminal domain of RT-Ec86 is responsible for this specific RNA recognition, which is presumed to correspond to the thumb domain of RT molecules (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we further characterize the specific recognition of the RNA structure by the thumb domain. We demonstrate that the C-terminal region consisting of only 66-amino acid residues is sufficient for the recognition. This RT C-terminal fragment, RT-Ec86-(255–320), specifically binds to a 28-base RNA that is identical to those of the recognition RNA for RT-Ec86 with a Kd value of 5 × 10–8m. Using a number of RNA molecules with altered structures, it was found that the UUU loop is essential for the RNA-thumb domain interaction, and that the 5′-end extension including the branching G residue can be removed, forming a complex only with the stem-loop structure consisting of 21 bases. We also constructed RT-Ec73-(251–311) and demonstrate that it binds to its own step-loop structure having the AGU loop but not the RNA molecules for RT-Ec86-(255–320). The present results support the notion that the highly diversified C-terminal structures of all bacterial RTs were evolved to specifically recognize the highly diverse RNA structures in their cognate primer-template RNA molecules. Materials—[α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. RNA fragments were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Purification of RT-Ec86-(255–320) and RT-Ec73-(251–316)—For the purification of RT-Ec86-(255–320), the DNA fragment corresponding to the 66-residue, C-terminal region was PCR-amplified and cloned into a T7 expression vector so that an initiation codon was added at the N-terminal end and six His residues were added at the C-terminal end. The resulting clone was termed p86RTαG. E. coli cells LE392(DE3) (11Shimamoto T. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 581-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) transformed with p86RTαG were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a mid-log phase. After a 3-h induction, cells from 6 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation and disintegrated by a French press. The cytoplasmic soluble fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation of the cell lysates was fractionated by (NH4)2SO4. The fraction precipitated between 30 and 60% (NH4)2SO4 and was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 150 ml of RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mm NaCl), and the solution was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of RT buffer at 4 °C. The dialyzed solution was then applied to a HiTrap SP column, and RT-Ec86-(255–320) was eluted by an NaCl gradient (0.2–1 m) in RT buffer. The elution of the protein fraction was examined by SDS-PAGE. The RT-Ec86-(255–320) fraction obtained was diluted five times with RT buffer, and 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin were added to the solution. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. The mixture was then applied to a column, the column was washed with 200 ml of RT buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with RT buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The protein was further purified with G-Sepharose followed by SD-Sepharose using a NaCl gradient (0.2–1 m) in RT buffer. The final sample was dialyzed against the RT buffer and stored at –80 °C. RT-Ec73-(251–316) was purified in the same method as RT-Ec86-(255–320). Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism measurement was performed on an automated Aviv-60DS spectrophotometer controlled by an online temperature control unit. Purified RT-Ec86-(255–320) (200 μg ml–1) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, was scanned between wavelength 260 and 190 nm in a cuvette with 1-mm path length maintained at 25 °C. RNA Binding Assay—RNA binding assay by gel electrophoresis was carried out as previously described (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The filter binding assay for the Kd measurement was carried out as described previously (12Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay was carried out in 15 μl of the reaction mixture consisting of 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, and 7.4% glycerol. Variable amounts of proteins were incubated with constant amounts (50 fmol) of RNA. The binding reaction was carried out on ice for 20 min. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was passed through a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schüll) to isolate protein-bound RNA from free RNA. RNA was labeled at the 5′-end with [α-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). All RNA molecules used in the present study were commercially synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) Purification of RT-Ec86-(255–320)—In a previous paper (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the C-terminal 91-residue sequence from RT-Ec86 is able to bind the primer-template RNA. In the present study, we further attempted to shorten the C-terminal fragment on the basis of the structural alignment of all E. coli RTs so far identified with HIV-1 RT, of which the x-ray structure has been determined (13Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C.

In Fig. 2, the C-terminal halves of these E. coli RTs are aligned, including the highly conserved YXDD box, which is known to be located in the loop region between β9 and β10 strands in HIV-1 RT (13Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In this alignment, we assumed that all bacterial RTs have three-dimensional structures similar to HIV-1 RT, which has an RT domain consisting of 14 β strands and 10 α helices (13Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). With the help of the secondary structure prediction, the C-terminal halves of all E. coli RTs were thus aligned with HIV-1 RT from β9 strand to αJ helix, the last helix in the RT domain (Fig. 2). Although the thumb domain regions were poorly aligned, we hypothesized that these regions of bacterial RTs also consist of four helices, αG, αH, αI, and αJ, as in the case of HIV-1 RT. We have previously shown that the C-terminal region of RT plays a crucial role in recognition of its cognate primer-template RNA molecule (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, for the primer-template RNA molecule to form the initial complex with its cognate RT for the cDNA priming, we hypothesized that the recognition RNA region (shown in bold in Fig. 1A) may be able to interact only with the thumb domain consisting of four helices, αG, αH, αI, and αJ (see Fig. 2). If so, the region encompassing β11, β12, β13, and β14 strands in our previous C-terminal construct, RT-Ec86-(230–320), may be removed without losing the RNA binding activity. On the basis of this assumption, RT-Ec86-(230–320) used in the previous study (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was further shortened by 25 residues to construct the 66-residue fragment from residue 255 (Ile-255 shown by an arrow in Fig. 2) to residue 320, called RT-Ec86-(255–320). This fragment was tagged with six His residues at the C-terminal end and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the final product (final yield, ∼2 mg/liter) is shown in Fig. 3A, lane 4. However, the purified RT-Ec86-(255–320) migrated somewhat faster than the one present in the crude extract likely because of the lipopolysaccharide in the total cell lysate, which was absent in the purified sample. When analyzed by Tricine gel electrophoresis, they migrated at the same position. Its CD spectrum shown in Fig. 3B indicates that the C-terminal fragment has a very high α-helical content, which is consistent with the predicted structure in Fig. 2. RNA Binding to RT-Ec86-(255–320)—Next we examined the ability of the purified RT-Ec86-(255–320) to bind RNA. On the basis of the previous SELEX experiments (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a 28-base RNA (RNA 86msr-28; Fig. 4A, a) was synthesized, which consisted of a stem-loop structure identical to that of the recognition RNA for RT-Ec86 with the identical 9-base extension at the 5′-end including the branching G residue. Note that of the two stem-loop structures in the RNA molecule of msDNA-Ec86, the second stem-loop structure downstream of the branching G residue plays the major role for the specific interaction with RT-Ec86 (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the gel retardation assay shown in Fig. 4B, lane 1, RNA 86msr-28 was retarded in gel electrophoresis in the presence of RT-Ec86-(255–320). When intact RT-Ec86 was added, the RNA was also retarded with a much slower mobility (data not shown). This slower mobility of the RNA is due to the much higher molecular weight of the intact RT-Ec86 compared with RT-Ec86-(255–320). To quantitatively analyze the interaction between RT-Ec86-(255–320) and RNA 86msr-28, a filter binding assay was carried out (Fig. 5). Variable amounts of the protein were incubated with a constant amount of the 32P-labeled RNA probe (50 fmol). The apparent Kd value of the binding reaction was defined as the concentration of protein at which half of maximum binding was observed as described by Kajita et al. (15Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that RT-Ec86-(255–320) binds to the RNA molecule with a Kd of 5 × 10–8m. Structural Requirement of RNA for Binding to RT-Ec86-(255–320)—Next, we further examined the length requirement of the 5′-end extension by stemwise shortening of RNA 86msr-28 as shown in Fig. 4A. To our surprise, all of the RNA molecules, 86msr-26(b), 86msr-25(c), 86msr-24(d), and 86msr-19(e), were able to bind to RT-Ec86-(255–320) as shown in Fig. 4B, lanes 2-5. These results indicate that the 5′-end single-stranded extension, including the branching G residue, is not required for RT-Ec86-(255–320) binding. It seems that the presumed four-helix bundle structure no longer recognizes the branching G residue, as also evident from the fact that the G to C substitution mutation in RNA 86msr-28 (RNA 86msr-28 m1; Fig. 4A, f) did not affect the gel retardation pattern (Fig. 4B, lane 6). On the other hand, substitution mutations in the loop region of RNA 86msr-28, either UUU to UGC (RNA 86msr-28m2; Fig. 4A, g) or UUU to UCU (RNA 86msr-28m3; Fig. 4A, h), prevented the formation of retarded bands as shown in Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8, respectively. We also synthesized two other RNA molecules, one corresponding to the first stem-loop structure of RNA from msDNA-Ec73 (Fig. 4A, i; also see Fig. 1B) and the other corresponding to the second stem-loop structure (j in Fig. 4A; also see Fig. 1B). RT-Ec86-(255–320) bound to neither of them as shown in Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10, respectively. Conversely, when RT-Ec73-(251–316) was used, it did not bind to RNAmsr-28 (Fig. 4A, a), RNAmsr-24 (d), and RNAmsr-28m3 (h) as shown in Fig. 4C, lanes 1-3, respectively. However, RT-Ec73-(251–316) did bind to RNA-73msr-29 (Fig. 4C, lane 5). Note that a faint band observed in the (–) lane is because of a double-stranded RNA dimer formed by two molecules of RNA-73msr-29, which could not be completely removed by heat treatment followed by rapid cooling. It also should be noted that RT-Ec73-(251–316) could not form a complex with RNA-73msr-26 (Fig. 4C, lane 4), indicating that as in the case of RT-Ec73, only the second but not the first stem-loop RNA structure in msDNA-Ec73 serves as the recognition RNA. In the present paper, we identified a minimum domain in RT-Ec86 that is capable of specifically recognizing the secondary structure in the primer-template RNA. The RT-RNA interactions in the same retrons are known to be highly specific for the cDNA priming reaction for msDNA synthesis. We found that the C-terminal 66-residue fragment of RT-Ec86 (RT-Ec86-(255–320)) is able to specifically bind to the recognition RNA (RNA-86msr-28), with a Kd value of 5 × 10–8m. This value agrees with a preliminary result previously obtained with RT-Ec86 (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also determined a minimum RNA structure of 19 bases consisting of only a stem-loop structure (RNA-86msr-19), which was able to bind to RT-Ec86-(255–320). A minimum structure of RT-Ec73 consisting of 66 residues was also determined, which was able to specially recognize the recognition RNA for RT-Ec73. The C-terminal fragment was predicted to form a four-helix bundle or the thumb domain of RT on the basis of alignment of RT-Ec86 with HIV-1 RT (see Fig. 2). Through the alignments of bacterial RTs, this C-terminal region is highly diverse with few homologous sequences between any two bacterial RTs. Therefore, one may speculate that these diverse regions in bacterial RTs may be responsible for the recognition of highly diverse primer-template RNA structures or the recognition RNA structures except for the branching G residue (see Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 2, the C-terminal regions of bacterial RTs can be aligned with HIV-1 RT at the YXDD boxes of bacterial RTs and HIV-1 RT, which are located between the β9 and β10 strains. In addition, the G residue between the β12 and β13 strands in HIV-1 RT can be aligned with the G residue in the VTGL(V/I) sequence highly conserved in all bacterial RTs. The β12 and β13 strands are designated as the “primer grip” because of their proximity to phosphate joining the nucleotides at the primer end (14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In bacterial RTs, the VTGL sequence may play an essential role in orienting the 2′-OH group of the branching G residue at the priming site. The thumb domain of bacterial RTs probably participates not only in translocation of the template-primer following nucleotide incorporation as proposed by Jacobo-Molina et al. (14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) but also in the specific recognition of the stem-loop structure of the primer-template RNA. On the basis of the above assumption, the β14 strand, the last β strand in the RT domain, can be assigned as shown in Fig. 2. In RT-Ec86, the assumed β14 strand is followed by the GIGRE (residues 254–258) sequence, which is then assumed to be connected to the thumb domain consisting of four helices: αG, αH, αI, and αJ. Although the assignment of these four helices was carried out on the basis of the secondary structure prediction from the primary structure, the exact locations of these helices are not certain at present. Nevertheless, the purified RT86-(255–320) was found to consist mostly of α-helical structures from its CD analysis as predicted. It is important to note that there are critical differences in the way the primer-template RNA binds to RT between bacterial RTs and HIV-1 RT. In HIV-1 RT, the 3′-end CCA sequence of tRNALys3 binds to the primer-binding site of the template, and this RNA-RNA duplex is placed on the palm domain held by the finger and thumb domains (in the right-hand configuration) (16Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Therefore, the remaining tRNA structure is positioned at the lower (or downstream) part of the RNA-RNA duplex, which is then recognized by the lower part of the RT molecule consisting of a part of P51 of the P66/P51 heterodimer of HIV-1 RT. This region is thought to be responsible for the binding of the structure of tRNALys3. In contrast, most bacterial RTs do not have the RNase H domain and thus are likely to exist as a monomer. Furthermore, in the bacterial RT reaction, the primer-template RNA complex is performed before RT interaction, as shown in Fig. 1A, which is then placed on the RT molecule in a similar manner as with the RNA-RNA duplex in HIV-1 RT. Most significantly, the tRNA structure to be recognized by HIV-1 RT locates downstream of the 3′-end priming site at the lower part of the palm region, whereas in bacterial RTs, the recognition RNA locates upstream of the 3′-end of the branching G residue, in which the 2′-OH group is exposed to the active center of the RTs. Therefore, in contrast to HIV-1 RT, the secondary structure to be specifically recognized by bacterial RTs locates at the opposite side of the palm domain in HIV-1 RTs so that the region with which the recognition RNA is able to interact is likely to be only the thumb domain and not the palm domain. It should be noted that for msDNA synthesis the RNA duplex formation immediately upstream of the branching G residue is essential (17Hsu M.Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6214-6219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This stem region is assumed to be positioned on the palm domain held by both the finger domain and the thumb domain. There are a few key features for the RNA-RT-Ec86-(255–320) interaction. First, the 3U loop is essential because the replacement of the UUU loop with UGC or UCU resulted in complete loss of the RNA interaction with the protein. In the SELEX selection for stem-loop structures with intact RT-Ec86 (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the central U residue was absolutely conserved, although the first and the third U residues were substitutable, albeit with a very low frequency, indicating that the central U residue is essential for the RNA-protein interaction. Secondly, at least the structure of the upper part of the stem (4 base pairs) is likely to play an important role in the interaction, as 10 of 14 sequences selected from the SELEX experiment had the identical sequence to Ec86 RNA (10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this stem region contains two U-G pairs flanked by a G-C pair, suggesting that structural instability residing in the upper part of the stem due to the U-G pairs may also be important for the RNA-protein interaction. Third, the 5′-end single-stranded extension is no longer essential for the RNA-primer interaction with the presumed four-helix bundle thumb domain of RT-Ec86. The previous SELEX screening identified a 5′-extension having the highly enriched AGC sequence (G corresponds to the branching G residue; see Ref. 10Inouye S. Hsu M.Y. Xu A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31236-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that the 5′-extension containing the branching G residue may interact with other parts of the RT molecule rather than with the four-helix bundle thumb domain at the C-terminal end. Fourth, the 66-residue, C-terminal domain of RT-Ec86 is highly unique in its amino acid composition. The fragment is very basic, having 16 basic residues (41%), whereas it contains only 6 acidic residues. It is also interesting to note that the fragment contains six aromatic residues. These unique features may be important for the specific interaction of the fragment with Ec86 RNA. Similarly, the 66-residue, C-terminal domain of RT-Ec73 is unique, having 13 basic, 8 acidic, and 7 aromatic residues. It is interesting to note that msDNA synthesis stops at a certain base in a highly specific manner leaving a RNA-DNA duplex at the 3′-ends of both molecules (1Yamanaka K. Shimamoto T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 784-795Crossref Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1B). This accurate termination of cDNA synthesis in the middle of a template RNA by bacterial RTs appears to occur before RT reaches the recognition RNA structure: 3 bases for msDNA-Ec86 to 13 bases for msDNA-Ec73 (see Fig. 1B). However, when a retroviral RT is added to msDNA isolated from cDNA, synthesis can continue all the way to the branching G residue in all msDNA thus far tested (1Yamanaka K. Shimamoto T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 784-795Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the stable interaction of the recognition RNA stem-loop structures with the thumb domains of individual RTs prevents RTs from proceeding further with the cDNA synthesis at a certain distance from the recognition RNA structure. The thumb domain of retroviral RTs has been proposed to participate in translocation of the template-primer duplex following the addition of a nucleotide at the β active center (14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). It is rather astounding that the thumb domains of bacterial RTs evolved to acquire a seemingly additional function to recognize specific RNA structures. Because it is considered that retroviral RTs evolved from a common ancestral RT with bacterial RTs (1Yamanaka K. Shimamoto T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 784-795Crossref Google Scholar), retroviral RTs might have lost the function of the thumb domain for RNA recognition during evolution. Structural elucidation of the precise interaction between RNA and the thumb domain will no doubt shed light onto the general molecular mechanism of RNA recognition by a protein consisting of a four-helix bundle and may provide important insights into the versatility of a four-helix bundle protein for the recognition of a large number of unique RNA structures. It will also be of great interest to examine whether the thumb domains of at least some eukaryotic RTs may retain the ability to recognize specific RNA structures. We are grateful to Dr. M. Roth and Dr. Sangita Phadtare for their critical reading of this manuscript."
