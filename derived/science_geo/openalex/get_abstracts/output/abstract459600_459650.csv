https://openalex.org/W2053090472,"In view of the steadily increasing use of zinc oxide nanoparticles in various industrial and consumer applications, toxicological investigations to evaluate their safety are highly justified. We have investigated mechanisms of ZnO nanoparticle-induced apoptosis and necrosis in macrophages in relation to their important role in the clearance of inhaled particulates and the regulation of immune responses during inflammation. In the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line, ZnO treatment caused a rapid induction of nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of hypodiploid DNA nuclei and apoptotic bodies. The involvement of the essential effector caspase-3 in ZnO-mediated apoptosis could be demonstrated by immunocytochemical detection of activated caspase-3 in RAW 264.7 cells. ZnO specifically triggered the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, because Jurkat T lymphocytes deficient in the key mediator caspase-9 were protected against ZnO-mediated toxicity whereas reconstituted cells were not. ZnO also caused DNA strand breakage and oxidative DNA damage in the RAW 264.7 cells as well as p47phox NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide generation in bone marrow-derived macrophages. However, ZnO-induced cell death was not affected in bone marrow-derived macrophages of mice deficient in p47phox or the oxidant responsive transcription factor Nrf2. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles trigger p47phox NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS formation in macrophages, but that this is dispensable for caspase-9/3-mediated apoptosis. Execution of apoptotic cell death by ZnO nanoparticles appears to be NADPH oxidase and Nrf2-independent but rather triggered by alternative routes."
https://openalex.org/W2019603142,"We examined the contribution of the nigrostriatal DA system to instrumental learning and behavior using optogenetics in awake, behaving mice. Using Cre-inducible channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (Th-Cre), we tested whether selective stimulation of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC), in the absence of any natural rewards, was sufficient to promote instrumental learning in naive mice. Mice expressing ChR2 in SNC DA neurons readily learned to press a lever to receive laser stimulation, but unlike natural food rewards the lever pressing did not decline with satiation. When the number of presses required to receive a stimulation was altered, mice adjusted their rate of pressing accordingly, suggesting that the rate of stimulation was a controlled variable. Moreover, extinction, i.e. the cessation of action-contingent stimulation, and the complete reversal of the relationship between action and outcome by the imposition of an omission contingency, rapidly abolished lever pressing. Together these results suggest that selective activation of SNC DA neurons can be sufficient for acquisition and maintenance of a new instrumental action."
https://openalex.org/W1997692924,"Sarcopenia is associated with loss of independence and ill-health in the elderly although the causes remain poorly understood. We examined the association between two screen-based leisure time sedentary activities (daily TV viewing time and internet use) and muscle strength.We studied 6228 men and women (aged 64.9 ± 9.1 yrs) from wave 4 (2008-09) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospective study of community dwelling older adults. Muscle strength was assessed by a hand grip test and the time required to complete five chair rises. TV viewing and internet usage were inversely associated with one another. Participants viewing TV ≥ 6 hrs/d had lower grip strength (Men, B = -1.20 kg, 95% CI, -2.26, -0.14; Women, -0.75 kg, 95% CI, -1.48, -0.03) in comparison to <2 hrs/d TV, after adjustment for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, chronic disease, disability, depressive symptoms, social status, and body mass index. In contrast, internet use was associated with higher grip strength (Men, B = 2.43 kg, 95% CI, 1.74, 3.12; Women, 0.76 kg, 95% CI, 0.32, 1.20). These associations persisted after mutual adjustment for both types of sedentary behaviour.In older adults, the association between sedentary activities and physical function is context specific (TV viewing vs. computer use). Adverse effects of TV viewing might reflect the prolonged sedentary nature of this behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1974661288,"Obesity is a major health issue. Obesity started from teenagers has become a major health concern in recent years. Intermittent fasting increases the life span. However, it is not known whether obesity and intermittent fasting affect brain functions and structures before brain aging. Here, we subjected 7-week old CD-1 wild type male mice to intermittent (alternate-day) fasting or high fat diet (45% caloric supplied by fat) for 11 months. Mice on intermittent fasting had better learning and memory assessed by the Barnes maze and fear conditioning, thicker CA1 pyramidal cell layer, higher expression of drebrin, a dendritic protein, and lower oxidative stress than mice that had free access to regular diet (control mice). Mice fed with high fat diet was obese and with hyperlipidemia. They also had poorer exercise tolerance. However, these obese mice did not present significant learning and memory impairment or changes in brain structures or oxidative stress compared with control mice. These results suggest that intermittent fasting improves brain functions and structures and that high fat diet feeding started early in life does not cause significant changes in brain functions and structures in obese middle-aged animals."
https://openalex.org/W2043278872,"Outpatient Therapeutic feeding Program (OTP) brings the services for management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) closer to the community by making services available at decentralized treatment points within the primary health care settings, through the use of ready-to-use therapeutic foods, community outreach and mobilization. Little is known about the program outcomes. This study revealed the levels of program outcome indictors and determinant factors to recovery rate.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 628 children who had been managed for SAM under OTP from April/2008 to January/2012. The children were selected using systematic random sampling from 12 health posts and 4 health centers. The study relied on information of demographic characteristics, anthropometries, Plumpy'Nut, medical problems and routine medications intakes. The results were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank test and Cox-regression.The recovery, defaulter, mortality and weight gain rates were 61.78%, 13.85%, 3.02% and 5.23 gm/kg/day, respectively. Routine medications were administered partially and children with medical problems were managed inappropriately under the program. As a child consumed one more sachet of Plumpy'Nut, the recovery rate from SAM increased by 4% (HR = 1.04, 95%-CI = 1.03, 1.05, P<0.001). The adjusted hazard ratios to recovery of children with diarrhea, appetite loss with Plumpy'Nut and failure to gain weight were 2.20 (HR = 2.20, 95%-CI = 1.31, 3.41, P = 0.001), 4.49 (HR = 1.74, 95%-CI = 1.07, 2.83, P = 0.046) and 3.88 (HR = 1.95, 95%-CI = 1.17, 3.23, P<0.001), respectively. Children who took amoxicillin and de-worming had 95% (HR = 1.95, 95%-CI = 1.17, 3.23) and 74% (HR = 1.74, 95%-CI = 1.07, 2.83) more probability to recover from SAM as compared to those who didn't take them.The OTP was partially successful. Management of children with comorbidities under the program and partial administration of routine drugs were major threats for the program effectiveness. The stakeholders should focus on creating the capacity of the OTP providers on proper management of SAM to achieve fully effective program."
https://openalex.org/W1972864198,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has seriously impacted the health of individuals and populations. In this study, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR)-based metabonomics combined with multivariate pattern recognition analysis was applied to investigate the metabolic signatures of patients with COPD. Serum and urine samples were collected from COPD patients (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 21), respectively. Samples were analyzed by high resolution (1)H NMR (600 MHz), and the obtained spectral profiles were then subjected to multivariate data analysis. Consistent metabolic differences have been found in serum as well as in urine samples from COPD patients and healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, COPD patients displayed decreased lipoprotein and amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and increased glycerolphosphocholine in serum. Moreover, metabolic differences in urine were more significant than in serum. Decreased urinary 1-methylnicotinamide, creatinine and lactate have been discovered in COPD patients in comparison with healthy controls. Conversely, acetate, ketone bodies, carnosine, m-hydroxyphenylacetate, phenylacetyglycine, pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate exhibited enhanced expression levels in COPD patients relative to healthy subjects. Our results illustrate the potential application of NMR-based metabonomics in early diagnosis and understanding the mechanisms of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2057705084,"The conversion of mangrove forest to aquaculture ponds has been increasing in recent decades. One of major concerns of this habitat loss is the release of stored ‘blue’ carbon from mangrove soils to the atmosphere. In this study, we assessed carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from soil in intensive shrimp ponds in Bali, Indonesia. We measured CO2 efflux from the floors and walls of shrimp ponds. Rates of CO2 efflux within shrimp ponds were 4.37 kg CO2 m−2 y−1 from the walls and 1.60 kg CO2 m−2 y−1 from the floors. Combining our findings with published data of aquaculture land use in Indonesia, we estimated that shrimp ponds in this region result in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere between 5.76 and 13.95 Tg y−1. The results indicate that conversion of mangrove forests to aquaculture ponds contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that are comparable to peat forest conversion to other land uses in Indonesia. Higher magnitudes of CO2 emission may be released to atmosphere where ponds are constructed in newly cleared mangrove forests. This study indicates the need for incentives that can meet the target of aquaculture industry without expanding the converted mangrove areas, which will lead to increased CO2 released to atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2168257803,"Environmental contaminants are suspected to be involved in the epidemic incidence of metabolic disorders, food ingestion being a primarily route of exposure. We hypothesized that life-long consumption of a high-fat diet that contains low doses of pollutants will aggravate metabolic disorders induced by obesity itself. Mice were challenged from preconception throughout life with a high-fat diet containing pollutants commonly present in food (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyl 153, diethylhexyl phthalate, and bisphenol A), added at low doses in the tolerable daily intake range. We measured several blood parameters, glucose and insulin tolerance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and gene expression in adult mice. Pollutant-exposed mice exhibited significant sex-dependent metabolic disorders in the absence of toxicity and weight gain. In males, pollutants increased the expression of hepatic genes (from 36 to 88%) encoding proteins related to cholesterol biosynthesis and decreased (40%) hepatic total cholesterol levels. In females, there was a marked deterioration of glucose tolerance, which may be related to the 2-fold induction of estrogen sulfotransferase and reduced expression of estrogen receptor α (25%) and estrogen target genes (> 34%). Because of the very low doses of pollutants used in the mixture, these findings may have strong implications in terms of understanding the potential role of environmental contaminants in food in the development of metabolic diseases.—Naville, D., Pinteur, C., Vega, N., Menade, Y., Vigier, M., Le Bourdais, A., Labaronne, E., Debard, C., Luquain-Costaz, C., Bégeot, M., Vidal, H., Le Magueresse-Battistoni, B., Low-dose food contaminants trigger sex-specific, hepatic metabolic changes in the progeny of obese mice.

https://openalex.org/W2013061648,"Biomedical applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) often involve improving their hydrophilicity and dispersion in biological media by modifying them through noncovalent or covalent functionalization. However, the potential adverse effects of surface-functionalized CNTs have not been well characterized. In this study, we functionalized multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) via carboxylation, to produce MWCNTs-COOH, and via poly (ethylene glycol) linking, to produce MWCNTs-PEG. We used these functionalized MWCNTs to study the effect of surface functionalization on MWCNTs-induced toxicity to macrophages, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. Our results revealed that MWCNTs-PEG were less cytotoxic and were associated with less apoptotic cell death of macrophages than MWCNTs-COOH. Additionally, MWCNTs-PEG induced less generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving less activation of NADPH oxidase compared with MWCNTs-COOH, as evidenced by membrane translocation of p47(phox) and p67(phox) in macrophages. The less cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of MWCNTs-PEG compared with MWCNTs-COOH resulted from the lower cellular uptake of MWCNTs-PEG, which resulted in less activation of oxidative stress-responsive pathways, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. These results demonstrate that surface functionalization of CNTs may alter ROS-mediated cytotoxic and apoptotic response by modulating apoptotic signaling pathways. Our study thus provides new insights into the molecular basis for the surface properties affecting CNTs toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2010667218,"Histopathology forms the gold standard for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has been proposed to be a potentially powerful adjunct to current histopathological techniques. A label-free imaging based on two- photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic generation is developed for differentiating normal breast tissues, benign, as well as breast cancer tissues. Human breast biopsies (including human normal breast tissues, benign as well as breast cancer tissues ) that are first imaged (fresh, unfixed, and unstained) with MPM and are then processed for routine H-E histopathology. Our results suggest that the MPM images, obtained from these unprocessed biopsies, can readily distinguish between benign lesions and breast cancers. In the tissues of breast cancers, MPM showed that the tumor cells displayed marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. The tumor cells, characterized by irregular size and shape, enlarged nuclei, and increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, infiltrated into disrupted connective tissue, leading to the loss of second-harmonic generation signals. For breast cancer, MPM diagnosis was 100% correct because the tissues of breast cancers did not have second-harmonic generation signals in MPM imaging. On the contrary, in benign breast masses, second-harmonic generation signals could be seen easily in MPM imaging. These observations indicate that MPM could be an important potential tool to provide label-free noninvasive diagnostic impressions that can guide surgeon in biopsy and patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2127415197,"Molecular divergence time analyses often rely on the age of fossil lineages to calibrate node age estimates. Most divergence time analyses are now performed in a Bayesian framework, where fossil calibrations are incorporated as parametric prior probabilities on node ages. It is widely accepted that an ideal parameterization of such node age prior probabilities should be based on a comprehensive analysis of the fossil record of the clade of interest, but there is currently no generally applicable approach for calculating such informative priors. We provide here a simple and easily implemented method that employs fossil data to estimate the likely amount of missing history prior to the oldest fossil occurrence of a clade, which can be used to fit an informative parametric prior probability distribution on a node age. Specifically, our method uses the extant diversity and the stratigraphic distribution of fossil lineages confidently assigned to a clade to fit a branching model of lineage diversification. Conditioning this on a simple model of fossil preservation, we estimate the likely amount of missing history prior to the oldest fossil occurrence of a clade. The likelihood surface of missing history can then be translated into a parametric prior probability distribution on the age of the clade of interest. We show that the method performs well with simulated fossil distribution data, but that the likelihood surface of missing history can at times be too complex for the distribution-fitting algorithm employed by our software tool. An empirical example of the application of our method is performed to estimate echinoid node ages. A simulation-based sensitivity analysis using the echinoid data set shows that node age prior distributions estimated under poor preservation rates are significantly less informative than those estimated under high preservation rates."
https://openalex.org/W1996510479,"Cisplatin is widely used as an antineoplastic drug, but its ototoxic and nephrotoxic side-effects, as well as the inherent or acquired resistance of some cancers to cisplatin, remain significant clinical problems. Cisplatin's selectivity in killing rapidly proliferating cancer cells is largely dependent on covalent binding to DNA via cisplatin's chloride sites that had been aquated. We hypothesized that cisplatin's toxicity in slowly proliferating or terminally differentiated cells is primarily due to drug-protein interactions, instead of drug-DNA binding. To identify proteins that bind to cisplatin, we synthesized two different platinum-agarose conjugates, one with two amino groups and another with two chlorides attached to platinum that are available for protein binding, and conducted pull-down assays using cochlear and kidney cells. Mass spectrometric analysis on protein bands after gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining identified several proteins, including myosin IIA, glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), calreticulin, valosin containing protein (VCP), and ribosomal protein L5, as cisplatin-binding proteins. Future studies on the interaction of these proteins with cisplatin will elucidate whether these drug-protein interactions are involved in ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, or contribute to tumor sensitivity or resistance to cisplatin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2013485159,"Aberrant gluconeogenic gene expression is associated with diabetes, glycogen storage disease, and liver cancer. However, little is known how these genes are regulated at the chromatin level. In this study, we investigated in HepG2 cells whether histone demethylation is a potential mechanism. We found that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of histone demethylase LSD1 causes remarkable transcription activation of two gluconeogenic genes, FBP1 and G6Pase, and consequently leads to increased de novo glucose synthesis and decreased intracellular glycogen content. Mechanistically, LSD1 occupies the promoters of FBP1 and G6Pase, and modulates their H3K4 dimethylation levels. Thus, our work identifies an epigenetic pathway directly governing gluconeogenic gene expression, which might have important implications in metabolic physiology and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2048950747,"There is increasing evidence that most parapatric cryptic/sister taxa are reproductively compatible across their areas of contact. Consequently, the biological species concept, which assumes absence of interbreeding, is becoming a not so effective criterion in evolutionary ecology. Nevertheless, the few parapatric sister taxa showing complete reproductive barriers represent interesting models to study speciation processes and the evolution of reproductive isolation. In this study, we examined contact populations in northwestern Italy of two butterfly species, Zerynthia polyxena and Z. cassandra, characterized by different genitalic morphotypes. We studied levels of divergence among 21 populations distributed from Sicily to France using three genetic markers (the mitochondrial COI and ND1 genes and the nuclear wingless gene) and genitalic geometric morphometrics. Moreover, we performed species distribution modelling to estimate different climatic requirements of Z. polyxena and Z. cassandra. We projected climatic data into glacial maximum scenarios in order to verify if and to which extent glacial cycles could have contributed to speciation processes. Genetic and morphometric analyses identified two main groups. All specimens showed a concordant pattern of diversification, including those individuals sampled in the contact area. Haplotype distribution and climatic models showed that during glacial maxima both species experienced a strong range contraction and presumably remained separated into different microrefugia in southern France, in the Italian Peninsula and on the islands of Elba and Sicily. Long term separation was probably favoured by reduced dispersal ability and high phylopatry, while genitalic diversification probably favoured interbreeding avoidance. Conversely, the aposematic wing pattern remained almost identical. We compared our results with those obtained in other species and concluded that Z. polyxena and Z. cassandra represent a valuable model in the study of speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2087672997,"Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors (Smurfs) are HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases that regulate diverse cellular processes, including normal and tumor cell migration. However, the underlying mechanism of the Smurfs' role in cell migration is not fully understood. Here we show that Smurf1 induces ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) at K190. Using the K190R mutant of TRAF4, we demonstrate that Smurf1-induced ubiquitination is required for proper localization of TRAF4 to tight junctions in confluent epithelial cells. We further show that TRAF4 is essential for the migration of both normal mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. The ability of TRAF4 to promote cell migration is also dependent on Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination, which is associated with Rac1 activation by TRAF4. These results reveal a new regulatory circuit for cell migration, consisting of Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF4 and Rac1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2099881626,"Rice white tip nematode, Aphelenchoides besseyi, is a kind of plant parasitic nematodes that cause serious losses in rice and many other crops. Fatty acid and retinoid binding protein (FAR) is a specific protein in nematodes and is related to development, reproduction, infection to the host, and disruption of plant defense reactions, so the inhibition of FAR function is the potential approach to control A. besseyi. The full-length of Ab-far-1 cDNA is 805 bp, including 546 bp of ORF that encodes 181 amino acids. Software analysis revealed that the Ab-FAR-1 was rich in α-helix structure, contained a predicted consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation site and a hydrophobic secretory signal peptide, but did not have glycosylation sites. The Ab-FAR-1 had 52% homology to Gp-FAR-1 protein. The Ab-FAR-1 and Gp-FAR-1 were grouped in the same branch according to the phylogenetic tree. Fluorescence-based ligand binding analysis confirmed that the recombinant Ab-FAR-1 (rAb-FAR-1) bound with the fluorescent analogues 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) amino) undecannoic acid (DAUDA), cis-parinaric acid and retinol, but the oleic acid would compete with the binding site. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to assess the expression level of Ab-far-1 at different development stages of A. besseyi, the highest expression was found in the females, followed by eggs, juveniles and males. Using in situ hybridization technique, Ab-far-1 mRNA was present in the hypodermis of juveniles and adults, the ovaries of females and the testes of males. When A. besseyi was treated with Ab-far-1 dsRNA for 48 h, the silencing efficiency of Ab-far-1 was the best and the number of nematodes on the carrot was the least. Thus FAR plays important roles in the development and reproduction of nematodes. This study is useful and helpful to figure out a new way to control the plant parasitic nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2168485451,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important biological mediator involved in the defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Previously, we reported that in macrophages (Mϕs), infection with avirulent Mtb H37Ra resulted in inhibition of necrosis by an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial permeability transition via the PGE2 receptor EP2. However, human Mϕs also express EP4, a PGE2 receptor functionally closely related to EP2 that also couples to stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein, but the functional differences between EP2 and EP4 in Mtb-infected Mϕs have been unclear. EP4 antagonist addition to H37Ra-infected Mϕs inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), which are involved in PGE2 production. Moreover, H37Ra infection induced PGE2 production through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Induction of COX2 and mPGES-1 expression by TLR2 stimulation or Mtb infection was increased after additional stimulation with EP4 agonist. Hence, in Mtb-infected Mϕs, PGE2 production induced by pathogen recognition receptors/p38 MAPK signaling is up-regulated by EP4-triggered signaling to maintain an effective PGE2 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2079735423,"In order to study the mechanisms behind the infection process of the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, the subcellular distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was monitored over a time frame of 96 h post inoculation (hpi) in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 leaves at the inoculation site (IS) and the area around the IS which was defined as area adjacent to the inoculation site (AIS). H2O2 accumulation was correlated with changes in the compartment-specific distribution of ascorbate and glutathione and chloroplast fine structure. This study revealed that the severe breakdown of the antioxidative system, indicated by a drop in ascorbate and glutathione contents at the IS at later stages of infection correlated with an accumulation of H2O2 in chloroplasts, mitochondria, cell walls, nuclei and the cytosol which resulted in the development of chlorosis and cell death, eventually visible as tissue necrosis. A steady increase of glutathione contents in most cell compartments within infected tissues (up to 600% in chloroplasts at 96 hpi) correlated with an accumulation of H2O2 in chloroplasts, mitochondria and cell walls at the AIS indicating that high glutathione levels could not prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which resulted in chlorosis. Summing up, this study reveals the intracellular sequence of events during Botrytis cinerea infection and shows that the breakdown of the antioxidative system correlated with the accumulation of H2O2 in the host cells. This resulted in the degeneration of the leaf indicated by severe changes in the number and ultrastructure of chloroplasts (e.g. decrease of chloroplast number, decrease of starch and thylakoid contents, increase of plastoglobuli size), chlorosis and necrosis of the leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2066286771,"Despite the increasing numbers of travel-acquired dengue, few studies have assessed virologic markers of the disease in non-endemic populations. We examined the kinetics of diagnostic markers and their associations with clinical parameters in 93 patients with travel-acquired dengue fever. Kinetics analyses suggested a longer average duration for viremia (9 days, CI95%: 8-10) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigenemia (15 days, CI95%: 12-20) than reported in endemic populations. While none of the tests sufficed alone, the best diagnostic coverage was achieved by combining antibody detection with RNA or NS1 testing. Studied by regression models, early relative levels of viremia and NS1 antigenemia proved to be significantly associated with several clinical parameters: high viremia predicted greater likelihood and increased length of hospitalization, the degree of NS1 antigenemia correlated positively with hematocrit and liver transaminases, and both viremia and NS1 antigenemia levels negatively with platelet counts in follow-up. Levels of viremia and NS1 antigenemia may serve as predictors of the clinical manifestations in travel-acquired dengue."
https://openalex.org/W2107091244,"Management of painful peripheral neuropathies remains challenging, since patients with chronic pain respond poorly to the available pharmacopeia. In recent years, the G-protein-coupled receptor neurotensin (NT) type 2 (NTS2) emerged as an attractive target for treating transitory pain states. To date, however, there is no evidence for its role in the regulation of chronic peripheral neuropathies. Here, we found that NTS2 receptors were largely localized to primary afferent fibers and superficial dorsal horns. Changes in the time course of the gene expression profile of NT, NTS1, and NTS2 were observed over a 28-d period following the sciatic nerve constriction [chronic constriction injury (CCI) model]. We next determined the effects of central delivery of selective-NTS2 agonists to CCI-treated rats on both mechanical allodynia (evoked withdrawal responses) and weight-bearing deficits (discomfort and quality-of-life proxies). The NTS2 analogs JMV431, levocabastine, and β-lactotensin were all effective in reducing ongoing tactile allodynia in CCI-treated rats. Likewise, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and morphine significantly attenuated CCI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. NTS2 agonists were also efficient in reversing weight-bearing and postural deficits caused by nerve damage, unlike reference analgesics currently used in the clinic. Thus, NTS2 agonists may offer new treatment avenues for limiting pain associated with peripheral neuropathies and improve functional rehabilitation and well-being.— Tétreault, P., Beaudet, N., Perron, A., Belleville, K., René, A., Cavelier, F., Martinez, J., Stroh, T., Jacobi, A.

https://openalex.org/W2080104294,"Agp2 is a plasma membrane protein of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae amino acid transporter family, involved in high-affinity uptake of various substrates including L-carnitine and polyamines. The discovery of two high affinity polyamine permeases, Dur3 and Sam3, prompted us to investigate whether Agp2 directly transports polyamines or acts instead as a regulator. Herein, we show that neither dur3Δ nor sam3Δ single mutant is defective in polyamine transport, while the dur3Δ sam3Δ double mutant exhibits a sharp decrease in polyamine uptake and an increased resistance to polyamine toxicity similar to the agp2Δ mutant. Studies of Agp2 localization indicate that in the double mutant dur3Δ sam3Δ, Agp2-GFP remains plasma membrane-localized, even though transport of polyamines is strongly reduced. We further demonstrate that Agp2 controls the expression of several transporter genes including DUR3 and SAM3, the carnitine transporter HNM1 and several hexose, nucleoside and vitamin permease genes, in addition to SKY1 encoding a SR kinase that positively regulates low-affinity polyamine uptake. Furthermore, gene expression analysis clearly suggests that Agp2 is a strong positive regulator of additional biological processes. Collectively, our data suggest that Agp2 might respond to environmental cues and thus regulate the expression of several genes including those involved in polyamine transport."
https://openalex.org/W2075227250,"Prolonged hypothermic storage elicits severe ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to renal grafts, contributing to delayed graft function (DGF) and episodes of acute immune rejection and shortened graft survival. Organoprotective strategies are therefore needed for improving long-term transplant outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the renoprotective effect of xenon on early allograft injury associated with prolonged hypothermic storage. Xenon exposure enhanced the expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP-70) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and promoted cell survival after hypothermia-hypoxia insult in human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells, which was abolished by HSP-70 or HO-1 siRNA. In the brown Norway to Lewis rat renal transplantation, xenon administered to donor or recipient decreased the renal tubular cell death, inflammation, and MHC II expression, while delayed graft function (DGF) was therefore reduced. Pathological changes associated with acute rejection, including T-cell, macrophage, and fibroblast infiltration, were also decreased with xenon treatment. Donors or recipients treated with xenon in combination with cyclosporin A had prolonged renal allograft survival. Xenon protects allografts against delayed graft function, attenuates acute immune rejection, and enhances graft survival after prolonged hypothermic storage. Furthermore, xenon works additively with cyclosporin A to preserve post-transplant renal function."
https://openalex.org/W2048591882,"Corky split vein caused by boron (B) deficiency in ‘Newhall’ Navel Orange was studied in the present research. The boron-deficient citrus exhibited a symptom of corky split vein in mature leaves. Morphologic and anatomical surveys at four representative phases of corky split veins showed that the symptom was the result of vascular hypertrophy. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed based on the Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 platform, which was applied to analyze the gene expression profilings of corky split veins at four morphologic phases. Over 5.3 million clean reads per library were successfully mapped to the reference database and more than 22897 mapped genes per library were simultaneously obtained. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the expressions of genes associated with cytokinin signal transduction, cell division, vascular development, lignin biosynthesis and photosynthesis in corky split veins were all affected. The expressions of WOL and ARR12 involved in the cytokinin signal transduction pathway were up-regulated at 1st phase of corky split vein development. Furthermore, the expressions of some cell cycle genes, CYCs and CDKB, and vascular development genes, WOX4 and VND7, were up-regulated at the following 2nd and 3rd phases. These findings indicated that the cytokinin signal transduction pathway may play a role in initiating symptom observed in our study."

Because GRP78 plays an important role in tumorigenesis, inhibitors such as VCD might harbor cancer therapeutic potential. We therefore sought to characterize VCD's anticancer activity in vitro. Triple-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were treated with VCD under different conditions known to trigger increased expression of GRP78, and a variety of cellular processes were analyzed. We show that VCD was highly cytotoxic only under hypoglycemic conditions, but not in the presence of normal glucose levels, and VCD blocked GRP78 expression only when glycolysis was impaired (due to hypoglycemia or the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose), but not when GRP78 was induced by other means (hypoxia, thapsigargin, tunicamycin). However, VCD's strictly hypoglycemia-specific toxicity was not due to the inhibition of GRP78. Rather, VCD blocked mitochondrial energy production via inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain. As a result, cellular ATP levels were quickly depleted under hypoglycemic conditions, and common cellular functions, including general protein synthesis, deteriorated and resulted in cell death. Altogether, our study identifies mitochondria as the primary target of VCD. The possibility that other purported GRP78 inhibitors (arctigenin, biguanides, deoxyverrucosidin, efrapeptin, JBIR, piericidin, prunustatin, pyrvinium, rottlerin, valinomycin, versipelostatin) might act in a similar GRP78-independent fashion will be discussed."

We report here that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) directly interacts with and deacetylates cyclin A. HDAC3 interacts with a domain included in the first 171 aa of cyclin A, a region involved in the regulation of its stability. In cells, overexpression of HDAC3 reduced cyclin A acetylation whereas the knocking down of HDAC3 increased its acetylation. Moreover, reduction of HDAC3 levels induced a decrease of cyclin A that can be reversed by proteasome inhibitors. These results indicate that HDAC3 is able to regulate cyclin A degradation during mitosis via proteasome. Interestingly, HDAC3 is abruptly degraded at mitosis also via proteasome thus facilitating cyclin A acetylation by PCAF/GCN5, which will target cyclin A for degradation. Because cyclin A is crucial for S phase progression and mitosis entry, the knock down of HDAC3 affects cell cycle progression specifically at both, S phase and G2/M transition. In summary we propose here that HDAC3 regulates cyclin A stability by counteracting the action of the acetylases PCAF/GCN5."
https://openalex.org/W2033442019,"Successful establishment of plants is limited by both biotic and abiotic conditions and their interactions. Seedling establishment is also used as a direct measure of habitat suitability, but transient changes in vegetation might provide windows of opportunity allowing plant species to colonize sites which otherwise appear unsuitable. We aimed to study spatio-temporal variability in the effects of resident vegetation on establishment, growth and reproduction of dry grassland species in abandoned arable fields representing potentially suitable habitats. Seeds were sown in disturbed (bare of vegetation and roots) and undisturbed plots in three fields abandoned in the last 20 years. To assess the effects of temporal variation on plant establishment, we initiated our experiments in two years (2007 and 2008). Seventeen out of the 35 sown species flowered within two years after sowing, while three species completely failed to become established. The vegetation in the undisturbed plots facilitated seedling establishment only in the year with low spring precipitation, and the effect did not hold for all species. In contrast, growth and flowering rate were consistently much greater in the disturbed plots, but the effect size differed between the fields and years of sowing. We show that colonization is more successful when site opening by disturbance coincide with other suitable conditions such as weather or soil characteristics. Seasonal variability involved in our study emphasizes the necessity of temporal replication of sowing experiments. Studies assessing habitat suitability by seed sowing should either involve both vegetation removal treatments and untreated plots or follow the gradient of vegetation cover. We strongly recommend following the numbers of established individuals, their sizes and reproductive success when assessing habitat suitability by seed sowing since one can gain completely different results in different phases of plant life cycle."

Several functional studies using SMP30 knockout (Smp30(Y/-) ) mice established that SMP30 functions as an antioxidant and protects against apoptosis. To address the potential role of SMP30 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis, we established Smp30(Y/-) mice on a Lepr(db/db) background (Lepr(db/db)Smp30(Y/-) mice). RESEARCH DESIGN/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Male Lepr(db/db)Smp30(Y/-) mice were fed a standard diet (340 kcal/100 g, fat 5.6%) for 16 weeks whereupon the lipid/lipoprotein profiles, hepatic expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were analyzed by HPLC, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Changes in the liver at a histological level were also investigated. The amount of SMP30 mRNA and protein in livers was decreased in Lepr(db/db)Smp30(Y/+) mice compared with Lepr(db/+)Smp30(Y/+) mice. Compared with Lepr(db/db)Smp30(Y/+) mice, 24 week old Lepr(db/db)Smp30(Y/-) mice showed: i) increased small dense LDL-cho and decreased HDL-cho levels; ii) fatty liver accompanied by numerous inflammatory cells and increased oxidative stress; iii) decreased mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (PPARα) and lipoprotein uptake (LDLR and VLDLR) but increased CD36 levels; and iv) increased endoplasmic reticulum stress.Our data strongly suggest that SMP30 is closely associated with NAFLD pathogenesis, and might be a possible therapeutic target for NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W1966222851,"Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia and development of vascular pathology. Endothelial cell dysfunction is a starting point for pathogenesis of vascular complications in diabetes. We previously showed the polyol erythritol to be a hydroxyl radical scavenger preventing endothelial cell dysfunction onset in diabetic rats. To unravel mechanisms, other than scavenging of radicals, by which erythritol mediates this protective effect, we evaluated effects of erythritol in endothelial cells exposed to normal (7 mM) and high glucose (30 mM) or diabetic stressors (e.g. SIN-1) using targeted and transcriptomic approaches. This study demonstrates that erythritol (i.e. under non-diabetic conditions) has minimal effects on endothelial cells. However, under hyperglycemic conditions erythritol protected endothelial cells against cell death induced by diabetic stressors (i.e. high glucose and peroxynitrite). Also a number of harmful effects caused by high glucose, e.g. increased nitric oxide release, are reversed. Additionally, total transcriptome analysis indicated that biological processes which are differentially regulated due to high glucose are corrected by erythritol. We conclude that erythritol protects endothelial cells during high glucose conditions via effects on multiple targets. Overall, these data indicate a therapeutically important endothelial protective effect of erythritol under hyperglycemic conditions."

However, the product of the gene Rv1248c (annotated as the E1o of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex) could catalyze the synthesis of HOA in vitro using either 2-ketoglutarate and glyoxylate or a small molecule extract of mycobacteria as a source of substrates. Overexpression of Rv1248c in M. tuberculosis led to an increase in the abundance of HOA (detected as 2-hydroxylevulinate by mass spectrometry), suggesting that the HOA synthase activity arises from Rv1248c in vivo (7.de Carvalho L.P.

Acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) was recently identified as an allosteric activator, and GarA (Rv1827) was identified as an allosteric inhibitor of Mycobacterium smegmatis 2-ketoglutarate decarboxylase, a homolog of HOAS (9.Wagner T.

However, GarA inhibited the two activities to a different extent. To gain more insight into the function of this still enigmatic enzyme, we attempted to identify the individual chemical steps affected by these allosteric modulators. We used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to monitor accumulation of a stable predecarboxylation intermediate analog and chemical quench NMR to assess rate-limiting steps to gain further insight into the various reactions catalyzed by HOAS under multiple conditions. These methods allowed us to study events in active sites containing ThDP so that the effect of allosteric regulation on individual catalytic steps could be determined.

The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and proteins migrating at the Mr ∼135,000 band were subjected to tryptic digestion followed by LC/MS analysis to detect enrichment of HOAS. In a duplicate experiment, after SDS-PAGE (7.5%) separation, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the HOAS-enriched band was subjected to Edman degradation for N-terminal sequence determination. The M. tuberculosis ketoglutarate decarboxylase (kgd) gene (Rv1248c) was PCR-amplified from H37Rv genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-TCGAGGCGAACAGCGCATATGGCCAACATAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGTCTCCTCGAGCGTTAAGCTTAGCGAA-3′. Restriction sites for NdeI and HindIII, respectively, are underlined. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pET-11c vector, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RILP competent cells. Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 50 mg/liter carbenicillin, 1 mm thiamin, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. At an A600 of ∼0.6–0.8, target protein overexpression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was incubated at 18 °C while shaking at 220 rpm overnight. Harvested cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm ThDP and 5 mm MgCl2 (Buffer A). PMSF (1 mm final concentration), lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml final concentration), one protease inhibitor mixture tablet, and 1 μg/ml DNase were added to the cell suspension and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press operating at 1000 p.s.i. in an ice-cooled chamber. All further operations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was diluted to 200 ml in Buffer A, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to make the solution 15% (w/v) in (NH4)2SO4 with stirring for 30 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 25 min, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to make the solution 45% (w/v) saturated with stirring for 30 min. The resulting clear white suspension was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 25 min, and the pellets were collected, dissolved in Buffer A, and dialyzed against 4 liters of Buffer A overnight. Batch purification was performed using a Q Sepharose FF column (20 ml). The column was washed with Buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with Buffer B (Buffer A + 1 m NaCl) with a linear gradient in 15 column volumes. Fractions containing HOAS (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against Buffer A overnight. Additional purification was achieved by using a Mono Q (8-ml) column equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted using Buffer B with a linear gradient in 11 column volumes. Fractions containing HOAS were pooled and purified further on Sephacryl S-100 HR (320 ml) equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted with Buffer A. Fractions containing HOAS were pooled, concentrated, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. In a typical batch, protein was purified to ∼90% homogeneity according to Coomassie staining and densitometry analysis.

The PCR fragment containing additional TCA coding for N-terminal Ser (to assist in complete Ulp protease cleavage of the SUMO tag) was cloned into the pET-SUMO vector using the TA Cloning® method. After the sequence had been verified, the resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RILP competent cells. Three liters of LB containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin were inoculated with 60 ml of overnight starter culture and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm.

PMSF (1 mm final concentration), lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml final concentration), one protease inhibitor mixture tablet, and 1 μg/ml DNase were added to the suspension and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min. The lysozyme-treated cell suspension was passed twice through a French press operating at 1000 p.s.i. in an ice-cooled chamber. All further operations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The lysed cells were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 25 min. Batch purification was performed with a His-Trap FF (5 ml) column washed with Buffer C, and the protein was eluted with Buffer D (Buffer C + 500 mm imidazole) with a linear gradient in 7 column volumes. Fractions containing the target SUMO fusion protein were pooled and treated with ubiquitin-like protein 1 (Invitrogen) at 1 μg/mg protein and incubated at ambient temperature for 6 h. Next, the mixture was loaded onto a His-Trap FF column (5 ml) equilibrated with Buffer C and eluted with Buffer D. The flow-through containing GarA without the fusion SUMO tag was concentrated and dialyzed against Buffer C overnight. Aliquots of the dialyzed protein were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay method (12.Bradford M.M.

Succinate semialdehyde production was monitored using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of NADH, and the disappearance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm.

The reaction was started with addition of 1 μm HOAS. Assays were performed using a Uvikon XL UV-visible spectrophotometer (SI Analytics GmbH, Mainz, Germany) equipped with a circulating water bath and thermospacers operating at 37 °C. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the experiment was performed at least twice. A three-component buffer system (50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm MES, and 100 mm Tris) (13.Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Buffers of constant ionic strength for studying pH-dependent processes.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) containing additional 500 μm ThDP and 5 mm MgCl2 was used in the pH range 4.5–8.5 to assay for the ferricyanide reductase and carboligase activities. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for the ferricyanide reductase activity was determined using the assay modified for the plate reader format described in the following section. CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) in a 1-cm-path length cell in the near-UV (280–400-nm) wavelength region. Time-dependent synthesis of chiral 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate by HOAS from 2-ketoglutarate and glyoxylate was monitored continuously at 278 nm in the kinetics mode by CD. A typical reaction mixture in a 2.4-ml cuvette contained 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 200 μm ThDP, 5 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of either 2-ketoglutarate or glyoxylate in the presence of a fixed (10 mm) concentration of the second substrate. The reaction was started by addition of 500 nm HOAS and was monitored for 500 s at 37 °C, and data points were averaged every 10 s. Lineweaver-Burk plots were obtained by varying 2-ketoglutarate (0.5 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm) in the presence of various fixed concentrations of glyoxylate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm). Steady state velocities calculated from the linear region of the progress curves were either fit to a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten plot (Equation 1) or to Equation 2 when linear substrate inhibition at high concentrations was observed. (v/E)=(Vmax/E)×SKm+S(Eq. 1) (v/E)=(Vmax/E)×SKm+S(1+S/Ki)(Eq. 2) In this expression, v is the steady state linear velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity at saturating substrate, E is the enzyme concentration, S is the concentration of the varied substrate, Km is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, and Ki is the apparent substrate inhibition constant at high substrate concentration. A typical ferricyanide reductase assay reaction mixture (200 μl) in 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) contained 5 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 200–1000 nm HOAS, and varying amounts of ThDP (0–500 μm), 2-ketoglutarate (0–20 mm), AcCoA (0–2000 μm), MSP (0–2000 μm), or GarA (0–30 μm). The time-dependent decrease in absorbance at 420 nm was monitored over 20 min at 37 °C. The linear region of the progress curves was used to calculate the steady state velocities. All assays were carried out in triplicate in Corning 96-well transparent clear bottom plates using a Spectramax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Kinetic data were fitted using the nonlinear, least square, curve fitting program of SigmaPlot v.10.0 for Windows. The data points are the means of experimental triplicates, and the error bars are the standard deviation. The solid lines are the regression fits. Standard errors are reported with the fitted constants. The kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km obtained from Michaelis-Menten plots upon varying either 2-ketoglutarate or ThDP in the presence of various fixed concentrations of the allosteric regulators were fit to Equation 3 for hyperbolic increase, Equation 4 for hyperbolic increase with reversal at high concentrations, or Equation 5 for hyperbolic decrease. β=β0+βmax×[L]KL+[L](Eq. 3) β=β0+βmax×[L]KL+[L]×(1+[L]/KR)(Eq. 4) β=β0−(β0−βmin)×[L]nKLn+[L]n(Eq. 5) In these expressions, L is the concentration of the varied regulator, β is the value of the kinetic parameters at various L, β0 is the value in the absence of the regulator, βmax is the maximal value, and βmin is the minimal value. KL is the concentration of the regulator at which the half-maximal regulatory effect is observed on each of the parameters. KR is the constant for loss of activation, and n is the Hill coefficient. Ki of MSP was estimated by global fit of inhibition performed using Equation 6 where the varied substrate S is 2-ketoglutarate. (v/E)=(Vmax/E)×SS+Km(1+[MSP]/Ki)(Eq. 6) The effect of regulators on the steady state linear velocity in the (R)-HOA synthase assay was determined by fitting the data to Equation 3 for AcCoA and Equation 5 for GarA. Here, β is the steady state linear velocity v/E where E is the enzyme concentration. L is the concentration of the regulator, and KL is the apparent activation or inactivation constant. Data for GarA, plotted in the fractional inhibition form, were fitted to Equation 3. Here, β is the percentage of inhibition, β0 was set to zero, and βmax is the maximal percentage of inhibition. L is the concentration of GarA, and KL is the apparent inactivation constant, Kinact. Ki of GarA was estimated by global fit of inhibition performed using Equation 7 where the varied substrate S is glyoxylate. All data were fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot v.10.0. (v/E)=(Vmax/E)×S(S+Km)×(1+[GarA]/Ki)(Eq. 7) To a 2.4-ml cuvette containing HOAS (2.75 mg/ml; 20 μm) in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) with additional 200 μm ThDP and 5 mm MgCl2, incremental amounts of MSP were added from a 1 m stock solution to obtain the desired final concentrations (0–20 mm). After mixing for 10 s and incubation for an additional 30 s, near-UV (280–400 nm) CD spectra were collected at 25 °C. The procedure was essentially the same for experiments with HOAS (20 μm) in the presence of saturating concentrations of the allosteric regulator, either AcCoA (500 μm) or GarA (50 μm). For quantitative analysis, the amplitude of the CD band pertaining to the 1′,4′-iminopyrimidine tautomer of the MSP-ThDP complex at 302 nm corrected for dilution was plotted against MSP concentration. Apparent dissociation constants (Kdapp) were calculated by fitting the data to the Hill function described in Equation 8 using SigmaPlot v.10.0. CD302=CD0+CD302max×[MSP]n(Kdapp)n+[MSP]n(Eq. 8) In this expression, CD302 is the observed CD signal at the given wavelength, CD0 is the CD signal of the protein at this wavelength in the absence of MSP, CD302max is the maximum CD signal at saturation with MSP, [MSP] is the concentration of substrate analog, and n is the Hill coefficient. Apo-HOAS (25 mg/ml; 185.2 μm) was incubated with 2 eq of [C2,C6′-13C2]ThDP (370.4 μm) in 20 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.0) containing MgCl2 (5 mm) at 4 °C for 30 min. For experiments with the allosteric modulators, the enzyme reconstituted with labeled ThDP was divided into 200-μl aliquots, 2 eq of GarA (370.4 μm) or AcCoA (370.4 μm) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. Typical reactions were started by addition of substrates to a final concentration of 40 mm each to 200 μl of the enzyme aliquot at 25 °C, and the reaction was stopped after 30 s by addition of 100 μl of 12.5% TCA in 1 m DCl/D2O. The carboligase reaction in the presence of activator AcCoA was stopped at 5 s. The quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 15,700 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered using a Gelman nylon Acrodisc (0.45 μm). D2O (80 μl) was added to the filtered samples. The resultant samples were analyzed by a one-dimensional 1H gradient carbon heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiment on a Varian 600-MHz NMR instrument. Data acquisition was at 25 °C, and sample pH was ∼0.75. 2816 transients in the 1H dimension were collected with a recycle delay time of 2 s. Data processing (exponential window function and zero filling) and analyses (base-line correction, integration, and signal-to-noise ratio estimates) were performed using ACD/NMR processor academic edition (v12.01, Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, Canada). The relative integrals of C6′-H signals of respective ThDP-bound covalent intermediates represent their relative ratios after correction for the amount of unbound ThDP estimated using Equations 9 and 10.

The bioinformatics prediction of the N terminus of HOAS has been revised since the M. tuberculosis enzyme was first studied (14.de Souza G.A. Målen H. Søfteland T. Saelensminde G. Prasad S. Jonassen I. Wiker H.G. High accuracy mass spectrometry analysis as a tool to verify and improve gene annotation using Mycobacterium tuberculosis as an example.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To ensure that our recombinant protein included the native N terminus, we identified the N-terminal start sequence of endogenous HOAS. We immunoprecipitated HOAS from M. tuberculosis H37Rv lysates using α-HOAS antibodies (7.de Carvalho L.P. Zhao H. Dickinson C.E. Arango N.M. Lima C.D. Fischer S.M. Ouerfelli O. Nathan C. Rhee K.Y.

The first 5 amino acids were determined to be ANISS in agreement with recent observations (15.Kelkar D.S. Kumar D. Kumar P. Balakrishnan L. Muthusamy B. Yadav A.K. Shrivastava P. Marimuthu A.

Next, HOAS was cloned into the pET-11c vector, and tagless recombinant HOAS was overexpressed and purified to >90% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal start sequence of the recombinant enzyme was confirmed by Edman sequencing. GarA was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pET-SUMO vector, and recombinant GarA was overexpressed and purified to >95% purity. Approximately 15 mg of pure HOAS and 15 mg of pure GarA were obtained per liter of culture. Carboligase products of ThDP-dependent enzymes can be detected by CD spectroscopy in the near-UV region (250–400 nm) because the products are chiral. A negative band at λmax = 278 nm showed a time-dependent increase in the presence of HOAS (500 nm), 2-ketoglutarate, and glyoxylate (Fig. 1A). This band, suggestive of accumulation of a chiral product, was observed in the supernatant after enzyme removal and did not appear when one of the three components was omitted. Earlier, 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses of this reaction assigned the product as 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate, which is decarboxylated non-enzymatically to hydroxylevulinate (7.de Carvalho L.P. Zhao H.

https://openalex.org/W2014717092,"We had previously shown that deoxynojirimycin-polysaccharide mixture (DPM) not only decreased blood glucose but also reversed the damage to pancreatic β-cells in diabetic mice, and that the anti-hyperglycemic efficacy of this combination was better than that of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) or polysachharide alone. However, the mechanisms behind these effects were not fully understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DPM on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic symptoms and their potential mechanisms. Diabetic mice were treated with DPM (150 mg/kg body weight) for 90 days and continued to be fed without DPM for an additional 30 days. Strikingly, decrease of blood glucose levels was observed in all DPM treated diabetic mice, which persisted 30 days after cessation of DPM administration. Significant decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin and hepatic pyruvate concentrations, along with marked increase of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen levels were detected in DPM treated diabetic mice. Results of a labeled (13)C6-glucose uptake assay indicated that DPM can restrain glucose absorption. Additionally, DPM down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of jejunal Na(+)/glucose cotransporter, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and glucose transporter 2, and enhanced the activities as well as mRNA and protein levels of hepatic glycolysis enzymes (glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, private kinase and pyruvate decarboxylas E1). Activity and expression of hepatic gluconeogenesis enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase) were also found to be attenuated in diabetic mice treated with DPM. Purified enzyme activity assays verified that the increased activities of glucose glycolysis enzymes resulted not from their direct activation, but from the relative increase in protein expression. Importantly, our histopathological observations support the results of our biochemical analyses and validate the protective effects of DPM on STZ-induced damage to the pancreas. Thus, DPM has significant potential as a therapeutic agent against diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2030887241,"Polyamines decrease the permeability of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones and β-lactams. In this study, we tested the effect of four polyamines (spermidine, spermine, cadaverine and putrescine) on fluoroquinolone uptake in Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Our results show that polyamines are also capable of reducing the permeability of the mycobacterial outer membrane to fluoroquinolones. Spermidine was most effective and demonstrated reversible dose- and pH-dependent inhibition of ciprofloxacin accumulation. The extent of this inhibition was demonstrated across the fluoroquinolone compound class to varying degrees. Furthermore, we have shown that the addition of spermidine increases the survival of M. bovis BCG after a 5-day exposure to ciprofloxacin by up to 25 times. The treatment of actively-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis with spermidine reduced ciprofloxacin accumulation by half while non-replicating nutrient-starved M. tuberculosis cultures lacked similar sensitivity to polyamines. Gene expression studies showed that several outer membrane proteins are significantly down–regulated during the shift to non–replication. Collectively, these characteristics of fluoroquinolone uptake in M. bovis BCG are consistent with facilitated transport by porin-like proteins and suggest that a reduction in intracellular uptake contributes to the phenotypic drug resistance demonstrated by M. tuberculosis in the non-replicating state."
https://openalex.org/W2090772524,"Background In prostate cancer, tumour expression of cannabinoid CB1 receptors is associated with a poor prognosis. One explanation for this association comes from experiments with transfected astrocytoma cells, where a high CB receptor expression recruits the Akt signalling survival pathway. In the present study, we have investigated the association between CB1 receptor expression and the Akt pathway in a well-characterised prostate cancer tissue microarray. Methodology/Principal Findings Phosphorylated Akt immunoreactivity (pAkt-IR) scores were available in the database. CB1 receptor immunoreactivity (CB1IR) was rescored from previously published data using the same scale as pAkt-IR. There was a highly significant correlation between CB1IR and pAkt-IR. Further, cases with high expression levels of both biomarkers were much more likely to have a more severe form of the disease at diagnosis than those with low expression levels. The two biomarkers had additive effects, rather than an interaction, upon disease-specific survival. Conclusions/Significance The present study provides data that is consistent with the hypothesis that at a high CB1 receptor expression, the Akt signalling pathway becomes operative."
https://openalex.org/W2104244548,"Increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass is believed to underlie the relatively fixed airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. Developments of therapeutic approaches to reverse airway remodeling are impeded by our lack of insight on the mechanisms behind the increase in mass of contractile ASM cells. Increased expression of laminin, an extracellular matrix protein, is associated with asthma. Our studies investigate the role of laminin-induced ASM survival signals in the development of increased ASM and AHR. Antagonizing laminin integrin binding using the laminin-selective competing peptide, YIGSR, and mimicking laminin with exogenous α2-chain laminin, we show that laminin is both necessary and sufficient to induce ASM cell survival, concomitant with the induction of ASM contractile phenotype. Using siRNA, we show that the laminin-binding integrin α7β1 mediates this process. Moreover, in laminin-211-deficient mice, allergen-induced AHR was not observed. Notably, ASM cells from asthmatic airways express a higher abundance of intracellular cell survival proteins, consistent with a role for reduced rates of cell apoptosis in development of ASM hyperplasia. Targeting the laminin-integrin α7β1 signaling pathway may offer new avenues for the development of therapies to reduce the increase in mass of contractile phenotype ASM cells that underlie AHR in asthma.—Tran, T., Teoh, C.

https://openalex.org/W2073173352,"Tacrolimus (FK506) is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Its effects on hepatic fibrosis have been controversial and attributed to immunosuppression. We show that in vitro FK506, inhibited synthesis of type I collagen polypeptides, without affecting expression of collagen mRNAs. In vivo, administration of FK506 at a dose of 4 mg/kg completely prevented development of alcohol/carbon tetrachloride induced liver fibrosis in rats. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was absent in the FK506 treated livers and expression of collagen α2(I) mRNA was at normal levels. Collagen α1(I) mRNA was increased in the FK506 treated livers, but this mRNA was not translated into α1(I) polypeptide. No significant inflammation was associated with the fibrosis model used. FK506 binding protein 3 (FKBP3) is one of cellular proteins which binds FK506 with high affinity. We discovered that FKBP3 interacts with LARP6 and LARP6 is the major regulator of translation and stability of collagen mRNAs. In the presence of FK506 the interaction between FKBP3 and LARP6 is weakened and so is the pull down of collagen mRNAs with FKBP3. We postulate that FK506 inactivates FKBP3 and that lack of interaction of LARP6 and FKBP3 results in aberrant translation of collagen mRNAs and prevention of fibrosis. This is the first report of such activity of FK506 and may renew the interest in using this drug to alleviate hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2071743369,"Recent evidences show that osthole possesses anti-inflammatory properties and protective effects following shock-like states, but the mechanism of these effects remains unknown. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway exerts anti-inflammatory effects in injury. The aim of this study was to investigate whether p38 MAPK plays any role in the osthole-mediated attenuation of hepatic injury after trauma-hemorrhage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent trauma-hemorrhage (mean blood pressure maintained at approximately 35–40 mmHg for 90 minutes), followed by fluid resuscitation. During resuscitation, a single dose of osthole (3 mg/kg, intravenously) with and without a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580 (2 mg/kg, intravenously), SB-203580 or vehicle was administered. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations and various hepatic parameters were measured (n = 8 rats/group) at 24 hours after resuscitation. The results showed that trauma-hemorrhage increased hepatic myeloperoxidase activity, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-6 levels, and plasma ALT and AST concentrations. These parameters were significantly improved in the osthole-treated rats subjected to trauma-hemorrhage. Osthole treatment also increased hepatic phospho-p38 MAPK expression compared with vehicle-treated trauma-hemorrhaged rats. Co-administration of SB-203580 with osthole abolished the osthole-induced beneficial effects on the above parameters and hepatic injury. These results suggest that the protective effect of osthole administration on alleviation of hepatic injury after trauma-hemorrhage, which is, at least in part, through p38 MAPK-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2087989515,"The oncogenic nature ascribed to the PIM-2 kinase relies mostly on phosphorylation of substrates that act as pro-survival/anti-apoptotic factors. Nevertheless, pro-survival effects can also result from activating DNA repair mechanisms following damage. In this study, we addressed the possibility that PIM-2 plays a role in the cellular response to UV damage, an issue that has never been addressed before. We found that in U2OS cells, PIM-2 expression and activity increased upon exposure to UVC radiation (2-50 mJ/cm(2)), and Pim-2-silenced cells were significantly more sensitive to UV radiation. Overexpression of PIM-2 accelerated removal of UV-induced DNA lesions over time, reduced γH2AX accumulation in damaged cells, and rendered these cells significantly more viable following UV radiation. The protective effect of PIM-2 was mediated by increased E2F-1 and activated ATM levels. Silencing E2F-1 reduced the protective effect of PIM-2, whereas inhibiting ATM activity abrogated this protective effect, irrespective of E2F-1 levels. The results obtained in this study place PIM-2 upstream to E2F-1 and ATM in the UV-induced DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2034851342,"It is now recognized that innate immunity to intestinal microflora plays a significant role in mediating immune health, and modulation of microbial sensing may underpin the impact of plant natural products in the diet or when used as nutraceuticals. In this context, we have examined five classes of plant-derived flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, catechins, and cyanidin) for their ability to regulate cytokine release induced by the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist Pam3CSK4. We found that the flavonols selectively co-stimulated IL-1β secretion but had no impact on the secretion of IL-6. Importantly, this costimulation of TLR2-induced cytokine secretion was dependent on regiospecific methylation of the flavonol scaffold with a rank order of quercetin-3,4'-dimethylether > quercetin-3-methylether > casticin. The mechanism underpinning this costimulation did not involve enhanced inflammasome activation. In contrast, the methylated flavonols enhanced IL-1β gene expression through transcriptional regulation, involving mechanisms that operate downstream of the initial NF-κB and STAT1 activation events. These studies demonstrate an exquisite level of control of scaffold bioactivity by regiospecific methylation, with important implications for understanding how natural products affect innate immunity and for their development as novel immunomodulators for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2091380135,"When two targets are presented in close temporal succession, the majority of people frequently fail to report the second target. This phenomenon, known as the 'attentional blink' (AB), has been a major topic in attention research for the past twenty years because it is informative about the rate at which stimuli can be encoded into consciously accessible representations. An aspect of the AB that has long been ignored, however, is individual differences.Here we compare a group of blinkers (who show an AB) and non-blinkers (who show little or no AB), and investigate the boundary conditions of the non-blinkers' remarkable ability. Second, we directly test the properties of temporal selection by analysing response errors, allowing us to uncover individual differences in suppression, delay, and diffusion of selective attention across time. Thirdly, we test the hypothesis that information concerning temporal order is compromised when an AB is somehow avoided. Surprisingly, compared to earlier studies, only a modest amount of suppression was found for blinkers. Non-blinkers showed no suppression, were more precise in selecting the second target, and made less order reversals than blinkers did. In contrast, non-blinkers made relatively more intrusions and showed a selection delay when the second target immediately followed the first target (at lag 1).The findings shed new light on the mechanisms that may underlie individual differences in selective attention. The notable ability of non-blinkers to accurately perceive targets presented in close temporal succession might be due to a relatively faster and more precise target selection process compared to large blinkers."
https://openalex.org/W2050340474,"Iron is an essential mineral for the body, and iron deficiency generally leads to anemia. However, because non-anemic iron deficiency can exist, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the liver to define the effects of this condition on the body. Four-week-old male rats were fed a low-iron diet (approximately 3 ppm iron) for 3 days and compared with those fed a normal diet (48 ppm iron) by pair feeding as a control. The rats in the iron-deficient diet group developed a non-anemic iron-deficient state. DNA microarray analysis revealed that during this short time, this state conferred a variety of effects on nutrient metabolism in the liver. In comparison with long-term (17 days) iron-deficiency data from a previous study, some of the changed genes were found to be common to both short- and long-term iron deficiency models, some were specific to the short-term iron deficiency model, and the others were oppositely regulated between the two feeding terms. Taken together, these data suggest that although the blood hemoglobin level itself remains unchanged during non-anemic iron deficiency, a variety of metabolic processes involved in the maintenance of the energy balance are altered."
https://openalex.org/W2143024212,"Adiponectin, an adipose derived hormone with pleiotropic functions, binds to several proteins, including T-cadherin. We have previously reported that adiponectin deficient (Adipo(-/-)) mice have increased IL-17A-dependent neutrophil accumulation in their lungs after subacute exposure to ozone (0.3 ppm for 72 hrs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether this anti-inflammatory effect of adiponectin required adiponectin binding to T-cadherin. Wildtype, Adipo(-/-) , T-cadherin deficient (T-cad(-/-) ), and bideficient (Adipo(-/-)/T-cad(-/-) ) mice were exposed to subacute ozone or air. Compared to wildtype mice, ozone-induced increases in pulmonary IL-17A mRNA expression were augmented in T-cad(-/-) and Adipo(-/-) mice. Compared to T-cad(-/-) mice, there was no further increase in IL-17A in Adipo(-/-)/T-cad(-/-) mice, indicating that adiponectin binding to T-cadherin is required for suppression of ozone-induced IL-17A expression. Similar results were obtained for pulmonary mRNA expression of saa3, an acute phase protein capable of inducing IL-17A expression. Comparison of lung histological sections across genotypes also indicated that adiponectin attenuation of ozone-induced inflammatory lesions at bronchiolar branch points required T-cadherin. BAL neutrophils and G-CSF were augmented in T-cad(-/-) mice and further augmented in Adipo(-/-)/T-cad(-/-) mice. Taken together with previous observations indicating that augmentation of these moieties in ozone exposed Adipo(-/-) mice is partially IL-17A dependent, the results indicate that effects of T-cadherin deficiency on BAL neutrophils and G-CSF are likely secondary to changes in IL-17A, but that adiponectin also acts via T-cadherin independent pathways. Our results indicate that T-cadherin is required for the ability of adiponectin to suppress some but not all aspects of ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation."

Msp disorients chemotaxis through inhibition of a Rac1-dependent signaling pathway, but the upstream mechanisms are unknown. We challenged murine bone marrow neutrophils with enriched native Msp to determine the role of phospholipid modifying enzymes in chemotaxis and actin assembly downstream of fMLP-stimulation. Msp modulated cellular phosphoinositide levels through inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) together with activation of the lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). Impaired phosphatidylinositol[(3,4,5)]-triphosphate (PIP3) levels prevented recruitment and activation of the downstream mediator Akt. Release of the actin capping proteins gelsolin and CapZ in response to fMLP was also inhibited by Msp exposure. Chemical inhibition of PTEN restored PIP3 signaling, as measured by Akt activation, Rac1 activation, actin uncapping, neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis in response to fMLP-stimulation, even in the presence of Msp. Transduction with active Rac1 also restored fMLP-mediated actin uncapping, suggesting that Msp acts at the level of PIP3 in the hierarchical feedback loop of PIP3 and Rac1 activation. Taken together, Msp alters the phosphoinositide balance in neutrophils, impairing the cell ""compass"", which leads to inhibition of downstream chemotactic events."

https://openalex.org/W1992109218,"Water shrews (Sorex palustris) depend heavily on their elaborate whiskers to navigate their environment and locate prey. They have small eyes and ears with correspondingly small optic and auditory nerves. Previous investigations have shown that water shrew neocortex is dominated by large representations of the whiskers in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2). Flattened sections of juvenile cortex processed for cytochrome oxidase revealed clear borders of the whisker pad representation in S1, but no cortical barrels. We were therefore surprised to discover prominent barrelettes in brainstem of juvenile water shrews in the present investigation. These distinctive modules were found in the principal trigeminal nucleus (PrV), and in two of the three spinal trigeminal subnuclei (interpolaris--SpVi and caudalis--SpVc). Analysis of the shrew's whisker pad revealed the likely relationship between whiskers and barrelettes. Barrelettes persisted in adult water shrew PrV, but barrels were also absent from adult cortex. Thus in contrast to mice and rats, which have obvious barrels in primary somatosensory cortex and less clear barrelettes in the principal nucleus, water shrews have clear barrelettes in the brainstem and no barrels in the neocortex. These results highlight the diverse ways that similar mechanoreceptors can be represented in the central nervous systems of different species."

Although structural studies show that the aromatic patch region of CdtA plays an important role in its biological activity, the functional sites of CdtA have not been firmly established. In this study, site-specific mutagenesis strategy was employed for cdtA point mutations construction so as to examine the contributions of individual amino acids to receptor binding and the biological activity of holotoxin. The binding ability was reduced in CdtAY181ABC holotoxin and the biological function of CDT was not weaken in CdtAY105ABC, CdtAY125ABC, CdtAF109ABC and CdtAS106NBC holotoxin suggesting that these sites were not critical to CDT. But the binding activity and cell cycle arrest ability of holotoxin complexes were inhibited in CdtAW115GBC. And this site did not affect the holotoxin assembly by size exclusion chromatography. Therefore, W115 might be a critical site of CdtA binding ability. These findings suggest that the functional sites of CdtA are not only in the aromatic patch region.

An appropriate therapy may require multiple genes to enhance therapeutic outcome by modulating inflammatory response and angiogenesis in a controlled and time-dependent manner. Thus, the aim of this research was to assess the spatiotemporal efficacy of a dual-gene therapy model based on 3D collagen scaffolds loaded with the therapeutic genes interleukin 10 (IL-10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a promoter of angiogenesis. A collagen-based scaffold loaded with plasmid IL-10 polyplexes and plasmid eNOS polyplexes encapsulated into microspheres was used to transfect HUVECs and HMSCs cells.The therapeutic efficacy of the system was monitored at 2, 7 and 14 days for eNOS and IL-10 mRNA expression using RT-PCR and live cell imaging molecular beacon technology. The dual gene releasing collagen-based scaffold provided both sustained and delayed release of functional polyplexes in vitro over a 14 day period which was corroborated with variation in expression levels seen using RT-PCR and MB imaging. Maximum fold increases in IL-10 mRNA and eNOS mRNA expression levels occurred at day 7 in HMSCs and HUVECs. However, IL-10 mRNA expression levels seemed dependent on frequency of media changes and/or ease of transfection of the cell type. It was demonstrated that molecular beacons are able to monitor changes in mRNA levels at various time points, in the presence of a 3D scaffolding gene carrier system and the results complemented those of RT-PCR."

They go through a critical step transforming from multipolar to bipolar before outward migration. A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is a transmembrane protease which can process many substrates involved in cell-cell interaction, including Notch, ligands of EGFR, and some cell adhesion molecules. In this study, we used in utero electroporation to knock down or overexpress ADAM17 at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) in neuronal progenitor cells to examine the role of ADAM17 in cortical embryonic neurogenesis. Our results showed that the radial migration of ADAM17-knocked down cells were normal till E16.5 and reached the intermediate zone (IZ). Then most transfected cells stopped migration and stayed at the IZ to inner cortical plate (CP) layer at E18.5, and there was higher percentage of multipolar cells at IZ layer in the ADAM17-knocked down group compared to the cells in control group. Marker staining revealed that those ADAM17-knocked down cells differentiated normally from neural stem cells (NSCs) to neuronal intermediate progenitor cells (nIPCs) but did not differentiate into mature neurons. The migration and multipolar exit defects caused by ADAM17 knockdown could be partially rescued by over-expressing an shRNA resistant ADAM17, while overexpressing ADAM17 alone did not affect the radial migration. Taken together, our results showed for the first time that, ADAM17 is critical in regulating the multipolar-stage exit and radial migration of the nIPCs during telencephalon cortex development in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2092922783,"We have previously described a novel modulator of the actin cytoskeleton that also regulates Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase activities in TGFβ-sensitive epithelial cells. Here we examined the functional role of this signaling regulatory protein (km23-1) in mediating the migration, invasion, and tumor growth of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. We show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of km23-1 in human CRC cells inhibited constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, as well as pro-invasive ERK effector functions that include phosphorylation of Elk-1, constitutive regulation of c-Fos-DNA binding, TGFβ1 promoter transactivation, and TGFβ1 secretion. In addition, knockdown of km23-1 reduced the paracrine effects of CRC cell-secreted factors in conditioned medium and in fibroblast co-cultures. Moreover, km23-1 depletion in human CRC cells reduced cell migration and invasion, as well as expression of the ERK-regulated, metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin. Finally, km23-1 inhibition significantly suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Thus, our results implicate km23-1 as a novel anti-metastasis target for human colon carcinoma cells, capable of decreasing tumor growth and invasion via a mechanism involving suppression of various pro-migratory features of CRC. These include a reduction in ERK signaling, diminished TGFβ1 production, decreased expression of the plasma membrane-cytoskeletal linker Ezrin, as well as attenuation of the paracrine effects of colon carcinoma-secreted factors on fibroblast migration and mitogenesis. As such, km23-1 inhibitors may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for interfering with colon cancer progression and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2036154031,"Environmental gradients and wastewater discharges produce aggregated effects on marine populations, obscuring the detection of human impact. Classical assessment methods do not include environmental effects in toxicity tests designs, which could lead to incorrect conclusions. We proposed a modified Whole Effluent Toxicity test (mWET) that includes environmental gradients in addition to effluent dilutions, together with the application of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to assess and decouple those effects. We tested this approach, analyzing the lethal effects of wastewater on a marine sandy beach bivalve affected by an artificial canal freshwater discharge used for rice crops irrigation. To this end, we compared bivalve mortality between canal water dilutions (CWd) and salinity controls (SC: without canal water). CWd were prepared by diluting the water effluent (sampled during the pesticide application period) with artificial marine water. The salinity gradient was included in the design by achieving the same final salinities in both CWd and SC, allowing us to account for the effects of salinity by including this variable as a random factor in the GLMM. Our approach detected significantly higher mortalities in CWd, indicating potential toxic effects of the effluent discharge. mWET represents an improvement over the internationally standardized WET tests, since it considers environmental variability and uses appropriate statistical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2010627956,"Multiple treatment options exist for the management of renal cell carcinomas. Preoperative evaluation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) grades is important for deciding upon the appropriate method of therapy. We hypothesize that susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is sensitive enough to detect intratumoral microvessles and microbleeding in renal cell carcinoma, which can be used to grade CRCC.Retrospective reviews of 37 patients with pathologically proven CRCCs were evaluated. All patients underwent SWI examinations. The characteristics of intratumoral susceptibility signal intensity (ITSS) includes the likelihood of the presence of ITSS, morphology of ITSS, dominant structure of ITSS and ratio of ITSS area to tumor area, which were all assessed on SWI. The results were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.ITSS was seen in all patients except 4 patients with low-grade CRCCs. There was no significant difference between low and high-grade CRCCs when looking at the likelihood of the presence of ITSS. There was a significant difference in the mean score of dominant structures between low and high-grade CRCCs. Specifically, more dominant vascular structures and less hemorrhage were seen in low-grade tumors (2.15±1.05) compared to high-grade tumors (1.27±0.47) (P<0.005). The ratio of ITSS area to tumor area was also significantly higher for the high-grade group (1.55±0.52) than that for the low-grade group (0.88±0.43) on SWI (P<0.005).SWI is useful for grading CRCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2025067247,"Riemerella anatipestifer was cultured in both iron restriction media and normal media. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis identified 23 proteins that significantly increased in the iron restriction media. Of them 12 proteins were analyzed with mass spectrography. Nine of 12 proteins belong to 6 different protein families: fibronectin type iii domain protein, secreted subtilase family protein, phosphoglycerate kinase, translation elongation factor, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, and Galactose-binding domain-like protein. Other 3 proteins were novel with unknown function. Two novel proteins (Riean_1750 and Riean_1752) were expressed in prokaryotic expression systems. The specificities of these 2 novel proteins to R. anatipestifer were confirmed by western-blotting analysis. The ducks immunized with either protein had low mortality challenged by R. anatipestifer, 33.3% and 16.7%, respectively. The ducks developed 100% immunity when immunized with combined Riean_1750 and Riean_1752 proteins. The data suggested 2 novel proteins play important roles in the bacterial survival in the iron restricted environment. They could be used as subunit vaccines of R. anatipestifer."
