https://openalex.org/W1604233325,"Beef heart mitochondrial ATPase (F1) exhibited a single binding site for Pi. The interaction with Pi was reversible, partially dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, and characterized by a dissociation constant at pH 7.5 of 80 micronM. A variety of substances known to influence oxidative phosphorylation or the activity of the soluble ATPase (F1) also influenced Pi binding by the enzyme. Thus aurovertin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, which was bound tightly by F1 and inhibited ATPase activity, enhanced Pi binding via a 4-fold increase in the affinity of the enzyme for Pi (KD = 20 micronM) but did not alter binding stoichiometry. Anions such as SO4(2-), SO3(2-), chromate, and 2,4-dinitrophenolate, which stimulated ATPase activity of F1, also enhanced Pi binding. Inhibitors of ATPase activity such as nickel/bathophenanthroline and the protein ATPase inhibitor of Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M. E., and Monroy, G. C. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762-3769) inhibited Pi binding. The adenine nucleotides ADP, ATP, and the ATP analog adenylyl imidodiphosphate as well as the Pi analog arsenate, also inhibited Pi binding. The observations suggest that the Pi binding site was located in or near an adenine nucleotide binding site on the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1518382908,"The effects of exogenous thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) on beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat myocardium were investigated. The potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, was used to directly estimate the number and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat heart membranes from control and hyperthyroid rats. Cardiac membranes from hyperthyroid rats contained 196 +/- 7 fmol of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites/mg of protein which was significantly (p less than 0.005) greater than the number of binding sites (89 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein) present in control membranes. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of receptors with dihydroalprenolol was the same (2 to 15 nM) in membranes from control and hyperthyroid rats. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the control and hyperthyroid membranes in the affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites for the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. The results of this study demonstrate that thyroid hormones can regulate the number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. The increased numbers of receptors may be responsible, at least in part, for the enhanced catecholamine sensitivity of beta-adrenergic-coupled cardiac responses in the hyperthyroid state."

These effects were inhibited by cortisol but were not altered by hormones that normally stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. There was no evidence of morphologic differentiation of the monocytes into osteoclasts during bone resorption.

https://openalex.org/W1485248300,"Mitochondria isolated from rat liver cells or mycoplasma-free HeLa cells contain a single DNA polymerase activity which is closely related to, or identical to, the DNA polymerase gamma activity found in the homologous cell. In rat liver cells, about 16% of the total cytoplasmic gamma-polymerase activity is found associated with mitochondria and in HeLa cells about 20% of the total cellular gamma-polymerase is mitochondria associated. Since mitochondria possess no unique DNA polymerase activity, the number of DNA polymerases now known in mammalian cells is reduced, from the previously proposed four enzymes, to three--DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1557101255,"A new DNA endonuclease has been purified 3000-fold from Escherichia coli. The enzyme specifically catalyzes the formation of single strand breaks at apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in DNA, but has no activity on intact or single-stranded DNA. Further, the enzyme shows little or no activity on heavily ultraviolet-irradiated DNA, but cleaves x-irradiated DNA, presumably at apurinic and apyrimidinic sites introduced by the radiation treatment. The enzyme, which is tentatively named endonuclease IV, has no detectable associated exonuclease or DNA N-glycosidase activity and does not seem to be identical with any previously known E. coli endonuclease. Endonuclease IV has no Mg2+ requirement, and is fully active in the presence of EDTA. Enzyme activity is stimulated by 0.2 to 0.3 M NaCl and is unusually salt-resistant. Further, the enzyme is fairly heat-stable, and is not inhibited by tRNA. The sidimentation coefficient, S(o)20,w, is 3.4 S. It seems that endonuclease IV is active in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1873137632,"We have isolated glutamic acid 5-methyl ester from an Escherichia coli protein that is involved in chemotaxis. The bacteria were first incubated with [methyl-3H]methionine under conditions which are known to result in methylation of the protein. The protein, isolated by gel electrophoresis, was then digested by successive treatment with three proteolytic enzymes. One of the products was [methyl-3H]glutamic acid 5-methyl ester, identified by comparison with an authentic sample in the following studies: (a) chromatography on an automatic amino acid analyzer, (b) chromatography on paper in two solvent systems, (c) chromatography on paper of the N-acetyl derivatives, and (d) stability of the ester bond to various pH conditions. No aspartic acid 4-methyl ester was found in the enzymatic digest. Treatment of the methylated protein with alkali released the radioactivity as [3H]methanol, which was identified by gas chromatography and by preparation of the 3,5-dinitrobenzoate."

https://openalex.org/W1579004914,"An endonuclease which is active upon DNA exposed to ultraviolet light at a photoproduct other than thymine dimers has been extensively purified from Escherichia coli. The small (2.7 S) enzyme is active in the presence of EDTA, has a neutral pH optimum, and is inhibited by tRNA and 1 M NaCl. It has no detectable exonuclease, DNA-N-glycosidase, or ribonuclease activities. The enzyme also nicks duplex DNA exposed to OsO4, x-rays, or acid, but it does not act upon undamaged DNA or irradiated single-stranded DNA. The majority of sites of action in DNA exposed to ultraviolet light or OsO4 appear to be alkali-stable, but those in DNA exposed to x-rays or acid are not. The incisions created by the endonuclease contain 5'-phosphate termini. The enzyme is possibly the same as E. coli endonuclease III described by Radman (Radman, M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1438-1445), but it is distinguishable from the other endodeoxyribonucleases described from that organism."
https://openalex.org/W1601897738,"It has been proposed (Slayman, C.L., Long W.S., and Lu, C.Y.-H. (1973) J. Membr. Biol. 14, 305--338) that in Neurospora crassa, a plasma membrane ATPase functions to pump H+ ions out of the cell, thereby generating an electrochemical gradient that can drive transport processes. Using the concanavalin A method of Scarborough (Scarborough G.A. (1975)J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1106--1111), we have prepared plasma membranes of Neurospora and have deomonstrated that they do contain a distinct ATPase activity with the following properties. It has a pH optimum of 6.0, is highly specific for ATP (hydrolyzing other nucleoside triphosphates less than 6% as rapidly), requires Mg2+ at concentrations approximately equimolar to the concentration of ATP, is weakly stimulated by certain monovalent cations (K+ and NH4+) and anions (SCN- and acetate), is inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but is not affected by oligomycin or ouabain. The plasma membrane fraction also contains residual mitochondrial contamination, which can be determined quantitatively by assaying oligomycin-sensitive ATP-ase activity, at pH 8.25, and succinic dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1564076298,"Vesicles were reconstituted from a purified dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide-sensitive ATPase complex (TF0-F1) and phospholipids of a thermophilic bacterium PS3. These vesicles synthesized ATP from ADP and Pi with energy from an electrochemical proton gradient (delta-micronH+) formed by a pH gradient and an electrical potential across their membranes. Maximal ATP synthesis was achieved by incubating the vesicles in malonate at pH 5.5 with valinomycin, and then rapidly transferring them to a solution of pH 8.4 and 150 mM K+. Under these conditons ATP synthesis continued at a decreasing rate for 30 s at 40 degrees. Appreciable formation of ATP (40 to 150 nmol/mg of TF0-F1) occurred at an initial delta-micronH+ above 205 mV and moderate formation at an initial value above 180 mV. ATP hydrolysis by the vesicles produced a delta-micronH+, and the additions of 32Pi and hexokinase to them resulted in 32Pi esterification. Analysis of the time courses of 32Pi esterification and decays of the pH difference and membrane potential, followed using 9-aminoacridine and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate, respectively, as probes, showed a relationship between delta-micronH+ and the rate of ATP synthesis. These results demonstrate that purified TF0-F1 is itself a reversible H+-translocating ATPase of oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2156781216,"Chitin synthetase was isolated and purified 120-fold from the supernatant fraction (54,500 X g) of broken yeast cells of Mucor rouxii. The purified preparations consisted mainly of chitin synthetase particles (chitosomes) with an average size larger than 7 X 10(6) daltons (by gel filtration) and an average sedimentation coefficient of 105 S. The samples also contained other enzyme complexes (fatty acid synthetase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and, depending on method, ribosomes). Nearly all of the chitosomal chitin synthetase occurred in a zymogenic form that required proteolytic activation. In most properties, the chitosomal enzyme was similar to crude enzyme (54,000 X g sediment): kinetics, activation by proteases, response to metals, stimulation by N-acetylglucosamine, and inhibition by polyoxin or UDP. One mamor difference was the much greater stability of the chitosomal chitin synthetase zymogen against spontaneous activation and destruction. Product (chitin microfibril) and enzyme (chitin synthetase) remained associated in a complex that was readily separated by centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1494395030,"A particulate fraction from porcine aorta catalyzed the incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc into both GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylpolyprenol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylpolyprenol. This transfer utilized endogenous lipid and required a divalent cation. Mn2+ was the best metal ion and was optimum at 2.3 mM. This same particulate fraction was previously shown to transfer mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose to endogenous lipid to form mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol (Chambers, J., and Elbein, A.D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6904-6915). Both the GlcNAc activities and the mannose activity were solubilized by treatment of the particulate fraction with the detergent Nonidet P-40. The enzymes were partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and on Sephadex G-200. These soluble enzymes required the addition of acceptor lipid for activity. An acidic lipid fraction, isolated from pig liver and having the properties of dolichyl phosphate, was active with either the GlcNAc or the mannose transferase. Chemically synthesized dolichyl phosphate was also active with either of these enzymes. The products formed from either GlcNAc or mannose by the soluble transferases were similar to those formed by the particulate enzyme. Thus the major product formed from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc was GlcNAc-pyrophosphoryldolichol with small amounts of the disaccharide-lipid while the product formed from GDP-[14C]mannose was mannosylphosphoryldolichol."
https://openalex.org/W1563480367,"The pressor enzyme renin (EC 3.4.99.19) was isolated in a pure and stable form from hog kidney by affinity chromatography on a pepstatin/agarose gel followed by three additional steps of conventional chromatography. Destruction of the enzyme by proteolysis during isolation was prevented by chemically eliminating proteases in extracts. The pure preparation was used for the characterization of this enzyme. Renin was found to be a glycoprotein containing glucosamine and possessing binding affinity to concanavalin A. Contrary to previous reports, pure renin is stable at neutral pH either at 4 or -20 degrees for 3 to 8 weeks. It has a molecular weight of 36,400 as determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, an isoelectric point of 5.2 and E1%1cm (280 nm) of 9.1. In contrast to crude preparations, the enzyme activity has a broad pH optimum between pH 5.5 and 7.0 for both hog angiotensinogen and the synthetic octapeptide substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-Ser-beta-naphthylamide. The rate of formation of angiotensin I from hog angiotensinogen at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees was 267 microng/h/microng of renin, or 2000 Goldblatt units/mg of renin. For the synthetic fluorogenic octapeptide substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-Ser-beta-naphthylamide, a Km of 33 micronM and a Vmax of 0.94 micronmol/h/mg of enzyme were obtained at pH 6.5 and 37 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W2120668704,"In this study, we report the preparation of [3H]glucagon and its characteristics of binding to receptors in the rat liver plasma membrane. Binding of the labeled hormone is optimal at pH 7.0. In the absence of GTP, [3H]glucagon binding to receptors is slow and the time of equilibration is inversely proportional to the hormone concentration. In the presence of GTP, equilibrium is reached within 30 s regardless of hormone levels, and the kinetics of binding are in accord with the kinetics of activation of adenylate cyclase by native glucagon in the presence of the nucleotide. Equilibrium binding measurements indicate that, in the absence of GTP, the binding isotherm is sigmoidal with an apparent Kd of 2 nM. The addition of GTP results in a complex binding isotherm with about 90% of the binding sites having a considerably lower apparent dissociation constant (greater than 10 nM) and a small population of sites having high affinity for the hormone. The binding properties of [3H]glucagon are compared with those of 125I-glucagon, and the implications of the actions of GTP on glucagon binding are discussed in relation to the overall regulation of adenylate cyclase by hormone and the nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1505239158,"Bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase has been obtained in a form that is 85 to 90% pure. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and density gradient centrifugation studies have established that the subunit molecular weight of the chymotrypsin-solubilized enzyme is 34,000. The presence of iron in the purified enzyme (0.50 to 0.75 mol of iron/mol of enzyme) has been established. Crude particulate tyrosine hydroxylase can be activated by the phospholipid, phosphatidyl-L-serine, or by exposure to enzymatic phosphorylating conditions. Both forms of activation lower the Km of the enzyme for its 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine cofactor. By contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase that has been solubilized by chymotrypsin cannot be activated by either of these methods."
https://openalex.org/W1493002016,"Rat liver ornithine decarboxylase induced by injection of thioacetamide has been separated into at least two fractions by covalent chromatography on an activated thiol-Sepharose 4B column. The two major fractions could be distinguished by ion exchange chromatography and electrophoresis on acrylamide gels. In addition, the two forms displayed different Km values for ornithine. Although the two forms are separable, they display identical antigenic properties, pH optima, and they appear to be the same molecular size. The biological significance or the relationship between multiple forms of ornithine decarboxylase is not understood."
https://openalex.org/W1599495162,"Amino acid starvation causes an adaptive increase in the initial rate of transport of selected neutral amino acids in an established line of rat hepatoma cells in tissue culture. After a lag of 30 min, the initial rate of transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) increases to a maximum after 4 to 6 h starvation of 2 to 3 times that seen in control cells. The increased rate of transport is accompanied by an increase in the Vmax and a modest decrease in the Km for this transport system, and is reversed by readdition of amino acids. The enhancement is specific for amino acids transported by the A or alanine-preferring system (AIB, glycine, proline); uptake of amino acids transported by the L or leucine-preferring system (threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine) or the Ly+ system for dibasci amino acids (lysine) is decreased under these conditions. Amino acids which compete with AIB for transport also prevent the starvation-induced increase in AIB transport; amino acids which do not compete fail to prevent the enhancement. Paradoxically threonine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, which do not compete with AIB for transport, block the enhancement of transport upon amino acid starvation. The starvation-induced enhancement of amino acid transport does not appear to be the result of a release from transinhibition. After 30 min of amino acid starvation, AIB transport is either unchanged or slightly decreased even though amino acid pools are already depleted. Furthermore, loading cells with high concentrations of a single amino acid following a period of amino acid starvation fails to prevent the enhancement of AIB transport, whereas incubation of the cells with the single amino acid for the entire duration of amino acid starvation prevents the enhancement; intracellular amino acid pools are similar under both conditions. The enhancement of amino acid transport requires concomitant RNA and protein synthesis, consistent with the view that the adaptive increase reflects an increased amount of a rate-limiting protein involved in the transport process. Dexamethasone, which dramatically inhibits AIB transport in cells incubated in amino acid-containing medium, both blocks the starvation-induced increase in AIB transport, and causes a time-dependent decrease in transport velocity in cells whose transport has previously been enhanced by starvation."

https://openalex.org/W1534413084,"Two forms of ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) were purified from the livers of rats which had been treated with thioacetamide for 16 h (for details, see miniprint to Obenrader, M.F., and Prouty, W. F. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2860-2865). The enzyme was purified over 7,000-fold from liver cytosol with an overall yield of 8%. Enzyme activity was eluted finally in two distinct fractions by chromatography on activated thiol-Sepharose 4B. Both forms appear to be dimeric proteins having molecular weights of approximately 100,000 by equilibrium sedimentation and analysis on a calibrated Sephadex G-200 column. The apparent subunits are approximately 50,000 daltons as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since electrophoresis in the presence of detergent is the only method used here to indicate subunits, the possibility that conditions of sample preparation resulted in splitting of a labile protein cannot be excluded from consideration. Ornithine decarboxylase has a very broad pH-activity curve with an optimum that shifts from pH 7.0 to pH 7.8 as the enzyme is purified. The apparent Km values for a highly purified mixture of the two forms of enzyme for L-ornithine and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were determined to be 0.13 mM and 0.25 micronM, respectively. Both sodium and potassium chloride were shown to inhibit enzymatic activity; 50% inhibition occurred at 270 mM for each when Km amounts or ornithine were used. Rat liver ornithine decarboxylase antiserum was prepared in rabbits using Form I of the enzyme as the antigen. The antibody was shown to precipitate quantitatively the ornithine decarboxylase activity isolated from induced rat liver and rat ventral prostate. The specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by rocket immunoelectrophoresis and by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate using immunoprecipitates obtained from enzyme preparations labeled either in vivo, with [3H]leucine, or in vitro, by reductive methylation using formaldehyde and sodium [3H]borohydride. The antibody preparation has been used in a titration method to assess the half-life of antigen in livers of rats induced for ornithine decarboxylase by injection of thioacetamide. In two experiments, the t1/2 of activity at the height of induction, following injection of cycloheximide, was 19 and 24 min, while the t1/2 of disappearance of antigen was 28 and 33 min, respectively. In each experiment the t1/2 for antigen was significantly longer than the t1/2 for loss of enzyme activity. Enzyme levels appear to be modulated primarily by synthesis and degradation of antigen. Furthermore, the observation that enzyme activity is lost with a shorter t1/2 than antigen is consistent with the idea that denaturation is an initial step in the degradation of this enzyme..."

The enzyme tends to dissociate to monomers at low protein concentration, but the tendency is much diminished in the phosphoenzyme form, suggesting that enzyme phosphorylation is accompanied by a structural rearrangement in the subunit contact domain. The enzyme appears to show half of the sites reactivity with respect to its phosphorylation by ATP. Several lines of evidence, including identification of 3-phosphohistidine in alkaline digests of the phosphoenzyme, indicate that a histidyl residue is the site of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1504126582,"Adrenodoxin reductase, the flavoprotein moiety of the adrenal cortex mitochondrial steroid hydroxylating system, participates in adrenodoxin-dependent cytochrome c and adrenodoxin-independent ferricyanide reduction, with NADPH as electron donor for both of these 1-electron reductions. For ferricyanide reduction, adrenodoxin reductase cycles between oxidized and 2-electron-reduced forms, reoxidation proceeding via the neutral flavin (FAD) semiquinone form (Fig. 9). Addition of adrenodoxin has no effect upon the kinetic parameters of flavoprotein-catalyzed ferricyanide reduction. For cytochrome c reduction, the adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin 1:1 complex has been shown to be the catalytically active species (Lambeth, J. D., McCaslin, D. R., and Kamin, H. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7545-7550). Present studies, using stopped flow techniques, have shown that the 2-electron-reduced form of the complex (produced by reaction with 1 eq of NADPH) reacts rapidly with 1 eq of cytochrome c (k approximately or equal to 4.6 s-1), but only slowly with a second cytochrome c (k = 0.1 to 0.3 s-1). However, when a second NADPH is included, two more equivalents of cytochrome are reduced rapidly. Thus, the adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin complex appears to cycle between 1- and 3-electron reduced states, via an intermediate 2-electron-containing form produced by reoxidation by cytochrome (Fig. 10). For ferricyanide reduction by adrenodoxin reductase, the fully reduced and semiquinone forms of flavin each transfer 1 electron at oxidation-reduction potentials which differ by approximately 130 mV. However, adrenodoxin in a complex with adrenodoxin reductase allows electrons of constant potential to be delivered from flavin to cytochrome c via the iron sulfur center..."
https://openalex.org/W1581510423,"A macromolecular binder of folic acid and folic acid derivatives has been identified in the particulate fraction of homogenates of rabbit choroid plexus. Within the choroid plexus, there are 2.3 nmol of folate-binding activity (binder) per g of tissue. The molecular weight of the folate binder complex, separated from the particulate fraction after solubilization with Triton X-100, was 340,000 to 400,000 by Sephadex gel filtration. The partially purified binder, when freed of endogenous folates, bound equivalent amounts of both [3H]folic acid and [methyl-14C]methyltetrahydrofolic acid per mg of protein. Folic acid, homofolic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and to a lesser degree, methotrexate, inhibited the binding of both [3H]folic acid and [14C]methyltetrahydrofolic acid. Binding activity, which decreased below pH = 7.0, was unaffected by pretreatment with ribonuclease but was eliminated completely by papain and a protease (Streptomyces griseus). Although dihydrofolate reductase was present in choroid plexus, the binder was distinct from dihydrofolate reductase as judged by gel filtration and methotrexate sensitivity. This high affinity binder of folates may be responsible, in part, for the rapid, saturable uptake of folic acid and methyltetrahydrofolic acid by rabbit choroid plexus in vitro."

It was increased 8- to 10-fold by the removal of serum from the growth medium. The presence of steroids, specifically of the glucocorticoid series, in the serum-less growth medium elicited an additional 100 to 345% increase over the serum-less control, whereas the addition of N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate to the medium or dexamethasone to the assay mixture was without any stimulatory effect. Both inductions were blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, suggesting a protein synthesis-dependent elevation of enzyme activity. Glucocorticoids were effective in the induction at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-8) M and there was a demonstrated parallel between the magnitude of enzyme induction and glucocorticoid potency. The HMG-CoA reductase activities from steroid-induced and control cultures had identical assay characteristics (pH optima and apparent Km values for both NADPH and HMG-CoA). This induction of the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterogenesis occurred despite the observation that glucocorticoids specifically depress the rate of acetate or water, but not mevalonate, incorporation into cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1898519241,"The m7(G(5')pppN-pyrophosphatase activity previously detected in HeLa cells has been further characterized. Results from DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions revealed only one enzyme activity in HeLa cell extracts which was capable of selectively hydrolyzing m7G(5')pppN to yield m7pG + ppN (where N = 2'-O-methylated or unmethylated ribonucleosides or oligonucleotides of up to 8 to 10 nucleosides in length). The majority (approximately 95%) of this activity was found in the cytoplasmic extract but appeared not to be associated with the lysosomal fraction. m7G(5')pppG was hydrolyzed by the partially purified enzyme in the absence of divalent cations at a pH optimum of 7.5 and a temperature optimum of 45 degrees, with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 1.7 micronM. Sedimentation analysis and gel filtration showed the molecular weight of the enzyme as approximately 81,000. Inhibition studies testing the effect of a number of prospective substrates on the rate of m7G(5')pppG hydrolysis have confirmed the importance of the methyl moiety at the N7 position of guanosine for enzyme-substrate interaction. Furthermore, the trimethylated guanosine-containing 5'-terminal structure derived from U-2 RNA was found not to serve as substrate, and 7-methylinosine, unlike 7-methylguanosine, was not an effective inhibitor of m7G(5')pppG hydrolysis. Thus, the 2-amino group of the 7-methylguanosine portion of m7G(5')pppN is also important for substrate interaction with this specific pyrophosphatase."

If erythrocytes are present in such a peroxidizing system, they hemolyze. Filtrates obtained by ultrafiltration of peroxidizing microsomal systems were found to have the capacity to produce prelytic damage in red cells. Filtrates obtained from microsomes that had not undergone peroxidative lipid decomposition were inert. The toxic activity in the active filtrates was not due to continuing oxidation of NADPH nor to continuing liver microsomal lipid peroxidation. Neither the chemical identity of the toxic product or products in active filtrates nor the mechanisms involved in the erythrocyte damage are known at this time."

VANDENHEEDE,~~ AND EDWIN G. KREBS** From the Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, California 95616 Using a highly purified enzyme from rabbit skeletal mus- cle, it has been demonstrated that the glycogen phosphoryl- ase kinase reaction is reversible. In addition to the phospho- rylated protein substrate, phosphorylase a, the reverse reac- tion requires Mg’+, ADP, Ca*+, and glucose. Glucose cannot be replaced by glucose 6-phosphate or glucose l-phosphate but can be partially replaced by glycogen. The half-maximal concentration of glucose required for the reverse reaction is approximately 25 mM at pH 8.2 and 30”. Ultracentrifugation experiments have indicated that glucose exerts its effect by facilitating the formation of a dimer from the tetrameric form of phosphorylase a, the major form present under the reaction conditions used. The quaternary structure of phos- phorylase kinase itself is not influenced by the presence of glucose. These results suggest that the kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of phosphate using as substrate only the dimeric forms of phosphorylase a and b. In contrast to what is seen for the torward reaction, the optimum pH for the reverse reaction is in the range of 6.8 to 7.6 and is not markedly changed when the kinase itself is activated by phosphorylation using the cyclic 3’:5’-AMP-dependent pro- tein kinase. Among the nucleotide substrates tested, ADP and GDP serve as the best phosphoryl group acceptors. The saturation curve of the enzyme for ADP is biphasic with an approximate so,5 value of 10 mM whereas that for phospho- rylase a gives a hyperbolic curve with an approximate"
https://openalex.org/W1566723240,"The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of Acetobacter xylinum was purified to homogeneity. It consists of three main polypeptide chains with a total molecular weight of about 2.4 X 10(6). It catalyzes the overall Mg2+ and thiamin pyrophosphate-dependent, NAD+- and CoA-linked oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as the partial reactions characteristic of the three enzyme components described for the complex from other sources. Initial velocity studies revealed marked positive cooperativity for the substrate alpha-ketoglutarate (Hill coefficient (nH) = 2.0; concentration of ligand at half-maximum effect (S0.5) = 8 mM). The sigmoidal [alpha-ketoglutarate]-velocity relationship became hyperbolic upon addition of AMP or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyAD) or in the presence of high concentrations of NAD. S0.5 (alpha-ketoglutarate) decreased to 1 mM, but Vmax was unchanged. Saturation curves for NAD and AMP are sigmoidal (nH = 2) at low alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations and become hyperbolic at high alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations. As judged by S0.5, the relative efficiency of the allosteric effectors is AcPyAD greater than AMP greater than alpha-ketoglutarate- greater than NAD+. Half-maximal changes in nH, S0.5, and activation by AMP occur at a pH significantly different from that of half-maximal activity. A model for the allosteric behavior of the complex is proposed in which the first enzyme component of the complex (E1) is the site for the allosteric interactions and AMP is the primary positive modifier, whereas NAD and AcPyAD act as AMP analogues. The overall reaction is competitively inhibited by NADH with respect to NAD (K1 = 20 micronM) and by succinyl-CoA with respect of CoA (K1 = 3 micronM). The properties of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of A. xylinum appear to provide for appropriate partitioning of alpha-ketoglutarate carbon between competing pathways in response to the energy state of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517973426,"An endonuclease which hydrolyzes depurinated DNA has been isolated from Phaseolus multiflorus enbryos; it has a molecular weight around 40,000. The enzyme is specific for apurinic sites; it has no action on normal DNA strands or on alkylated sites, and is without exonulcease activity. The rate of phosphoester bond hydrolysis near apurinic sites is far greater in native than in denatured DNA. The endonuclease is not inactivated by 10 mM EDTA, but is activity is however stimulated by Mg2+ or Mn2+. Its optimum pH is 7.5 to 8.0, and its optimum temperature 40degrees although, at this temperature, it is rapidly denatured; even low NaCl concentrations inhibit the enzyme activity. The endonuclease for apurinic sites of P. multiflorus is a non-histone protein of chromatin; the properties (like thermosensitivity of susceptibility to ionic strength) of the enzyme in situ, working on chromatin DNA, might be different from those described for the isolated endonuclease in homogenous aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W2113127234,"From the Department ofPharmacology and Therapeutics, University ofFlorida, College ofMedicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610 We compare the effect of buffers on the catalysis by bovine carbonic anhydrase, human carbonic anhydrase C (HCA 0, and human carbonic anhydrase B (HCA B) of two types of ‘“0 exchange. Type I, resulting from the hydration- dehydration reaction, is the exchange of IsO between CO, and water. Type II is the exchange of IsO between ‘*C- containing and ‘“C-containing species of COZ. Imidazole, 2,4-lutidine, and N-methylmorpholine are used as buffers near neutral pH. The buffer dependence of type I exchange in the presence of HCA B is analogous to that observed for HCA C and bovine carbonic anhydrase (Silverman, D. N., and Tu, C. K. (1975) J. Am. Chem. Sot. 97,2263-2269) and is consistent with the hypothesis that buffer-facilitated proton transfer enhances the catalysis in these three forms of car- bonic anhydrase. Type II exchange when catalyzed by HCA C and bovine carbonic anhydrase decreases in rate as buffer concentration increases up to about 5 mM buffer. In con- trast, type II exchange when catalyzed by HCA B does not change appreciably as buffer concentration increases up to 50 mM buffer. These data indicate a significant difference in the possible forms of each enzyme which are involved in proton transfer. Whereas buffer-facilitated proton transfer involving free, unbound bovine carbonic anhydrase is com- patible with the observed data, such a buffer-facilitated proton transfer pathway alone cannot account for type II exchange as catalyzed by HCA B. As one possible hypothesis which is consistent with the data, we suggest that for HCA B proton transfer between the active site and buffer occurs at a rate comparable to or greater than the rate of dissociation of CO, from the active site.

https://openalex.org/W1546883553,"A repressible alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from the extreme bacterial thermophile. Thermus aquaticus, and has been purified to homogeneity as judged by disc acrylamide electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. Upon investigation, the purified enzyme was shown to hydrolyze certain phosphodiesters in addition to a wide variety of phosphomonoesters. The diesters included bis-p-nitro-phenyl phosphate and thymidine 3'-monophospho-p-nitro-phenyl ester. The temperature optimum for the diesterase activity was 80--85 degrees at pH 7.2. Orthophosphate competitively inhibited both activities. Nucleotides such as AMP, ADP, and ATP also inhibited both esterase activities as did alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and alpha-sodium glycerol phosphate. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined to be 8.4."
https://openalex.org/W1525229825,"Cytosol from the rat preputial gland has been shown to contain a protein which binds both estrone and estradiol. The protein, after a 26-fold purification from the cytosol of female Sprague-Dawley rats, migrated as one band during electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on acrylamide gel. The electrophoretic mobility indicated a molecular weight of 15,000. The association constant for estrone as determined by equilibrium dialysis was 1.2 X 10(7) M-1, while that for 17beta-estradiol was 3.3 X 10(6) M-1. Progesterone, cortisol, testosterone, or diethylstilbestrol did not bind to the purified protein, whereas 17alpha-estradiol or estriol bound only slightly. In the presence of retinoic acid, but not retinol, the binding of estrone was reduced. Optimum binding for estrone was at pH 6.5 to 8.5."
https://openalex.org/W1564288065,"It is known that most of the oxygen-linked carbamate which is formed in normal adult human hemoglobin (Hb A) is confined to the beta subunits rather than to the alpha subunits. In order to find out if similar differences exist in the isolated protomers of Hb A we have measured the effect of various pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2) on the oxygen affinity in the following heme pigments: isolated alpha and beta subunits with free --SH groups (alphaSH, betaSH), mercurated beta subunits (betaPMB), myoglobin (Mb), and betaSH/PLP in which the terminal alpha-amino group of betaSH was irreversibly blocked with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Similar measurements were done on Hb A and the fraction of oxygen-linked carbamate calculated from the effect of pCO2 (at constant pH) on the oxygen half-saturation pressure (p50). A distinct influence of CO2 on p50 was observed in betaSH which was absent in betaSH/PLP and thus indicates that the terminal alpha-amino group mediates the oxygen-linked binding of CO2 in betaSH as it does in the beta subunits of Hb A. However, the fraction of oxygen-linked carbamate was much less dependent on pH and pCO2 in betaSH than in Hb A. Neither alphaSH, betaPMB, or Mb, all of which are known to exist largely or wholly as monomers but have free terminal alpha-amino groups, showed a shift of p50 upon addition of CO2. As both betaSH and betaSH/PLP were shown to be tetrameric molecules, we conclude from this study that homotetramers composed of isolated beta subunits do exhibit a reciprocal interaction between the binding of O2 and CO2."

https://openalex.org/W1506866365,"The low field regions of the 220 MHz proton magnetic resonance spectra of concanavalin A (Con A) complexes with metal ions show well resolved resonances from the C2 protons of histidine side chains. Shifts of these resonances are observed when Zn2+ ions at the transition metal ion binding site, S1, are replaced by CO2 ions. The magnitude of these shifts can be used to determine the orientation of axis of anisotropy of the Co2+ ligand field since the distances from the C2 protons of the histidines to S1 can be computed from the crystal structure coordinates. Assignment of the separate peaks in the spectrum of the Con A-Co2+-Ca2+ complex and of the Con A-Zn2+-Ca2+ complex, to particular histidines in the amino acid sequence of Con A then follows. The refined crystal coordinates of both Reeke et al. (Reeke, G. N., Jr., Becker, J. W., and Edelman, G. M. (1975) J. Biol. Chem, 250, 1525-1547) and of Hardman and Ainsworth (private communication) have been used. These two sets of coordinates both yield orientations for the axis of anisotropy which are approximately in the direction of the His 24 nitrogen ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1589941321,"The hemoglobin oxidation Bohr effect is larger than the ligation Bohr effect, even when the former is corrected for any ionization of the water molecule bound to the ferric iron of methemoglobin. This residual oxidation Bohr effect is here shown to be solely caused by the influence of the positively charged ferriheme, and is abolished when the oxidized heme binds an anion. This result frees the formal equivalence of hemoglobin ligation and oxidation from the last apparent experimental discrepancy."
