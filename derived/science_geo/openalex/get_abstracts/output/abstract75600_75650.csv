The rates of conversion of oleic into octadeca-6,9-dienoic, linoleic into γ-linolenic, and linolenic into octadeca-6,9,12, 15-tetraenoic acids were measured, and Lineweaver-Burk plots showed the existence of competitive reactions among the three acids. Saturated acids were ineffective in altering the percentage of desaturation of the acids, whereas polyunsaturated acids of 20 and 22 carbon atoms generally activated the conversion of the three acids. Docosahexaenoic acid decreased the percentage of desaturation of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. The unsaturated acids of 18 carbons apparently competed for the same oxygenase, and the order of affinity was linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids. Substrate fatty acids and products after the incubation were shown to be mainly esterified to choline and ethanolamine glycerophosphatides."

Estimates of molecular weight made by several procedures, 76,900 ± 5,000 (sedimentation and diffusion), 90,000 ± 4,000 (sedimentation equilibrium), and 90,000 ± 10,000 (14C-iodoacetamide incorporation), show some variation. The s25,w0 and D25,w values for transglutaminase were determined as 5.40 x 10-13 and 6.44 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, respectively. The —SH content, 16 to 17 residues/90,000 g, was determined on native and denatured enzyme by two procedures. The amino acid composition of transglutaminase is reported. The effects of several —SH reagents on enzymatic activity have been investigated. Irreversible inhibition by 14C-iodoacetamide at pH 6.8 occurs only in the presence of the essential cation, Ca++. One mole of 14C-carbamidomethyl is incorporated per mole of enzyme with the complete loss of enzymatic activity. Substrate affords efficient protection against inactivation and 14C-carbamidomethyl incorporation. Analyses of the 14C-iodoacetamide-inactivated enzyme show that inactivation results from alkylation of 1 cysteine residue."

The effect is seen as early as 6 hours after addition of the steroid to the culture medium, and concentrations of steroids as low as 10-9 m (6α,9α-difluoro-11β, 16α, 17α, 21-tetrahydroxy-1, 4-pregnadiene-3, 20-dione 16,17-acetonide) to 10-7 m (cortisol) are effective. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis is depressed earlier and to a greater degree than ribonucleic acid synthesis. Protein synthesis is not depressed within the first 24 hours after steroid addition. The locus of the biochemical effect of the steroid seems to be at the stage of the DNA-dependent polymerization of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates into DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1596086690,"Abstract The values of the equilibrium and kinetic constants for the reactions with oxygen and carbon monoxide of the isolated α and β chains of human hemoglobin, both in the form with sulfhydryl groups blocked by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and in the form with freely titratable sulfhydryl groups, have been determined. The data show clearly that the behavior of the isolated chains is not only unlike that of hemoglobin A, but also differs markedly from that of myoglobin. Since the isolated chains behave as simple systems without heme-heme interaction (n = 1 in the O2 equilibrium), they have been used to test the proposition that the binding of a ligand is correctly expressed as a single step reaction. In at least one case it appears that it is not."
https://openalex.org/W1552536197,"Abstract A trypsin inhibitor has been isolated in 54% yield from bovine pancreatic juice by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 at pH 8.1 and by elution chromatography on DEAE-cellulose at pH 9.0. It appears to be homogeneous by equilibrium chromatography, equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation, and amino acid analysis, and on the basis of the stoichiometry of its interaction with trypsin. The polypeptide inhibitor has a molecular weight of 6155 and has the following amino acid composition: Asp7, Thr4, Ser2, Glu7, Pro4, Gly5, Ala1, Cys6, Val4, Met1, Ileu3, Leu4, Tyr2, Lys3, and Arg3. The inhibitor is secreted in the pancreatic juice in the free form (not in a complex with trypsin) and it prevents the trypsin-catalyzed activation of the proteolytic zymogens. The amount of inhibitor is equivalent to 1% of the total potential trypsin in pancreatic juice. Although two trypsin inhibitors have been isolated from acid extracts of the gland, only one (Kazal type) is present in the secretion. This suggests that the inhibitors are segregated at the subcellular level in the pancreatic acinar cells."
https://openalex.org/W1596880757,"Dietary protein depletion results in a decrease in rat hepatic xanthine oxidase activity to about 10% of control levels. Refeeding of a high protein diet leads, after a 6-hour lag phase, to a 5-fold increase in enzyme activity by 12 hours. The mechanism of this increase was studied utilizing actinomycin D, 5-fluorouracil, and puromycin. These agents all blocked the increase in enzyme activity, indicating that both ribonucleic acid and protein syntheses were involved. Following administration of 14C-leucine, specific radioactivities of xanthine oxidase were identical in the livers of protein-depleted and control animals, despite a 10-fold difference in enzyme activity levels. These results indicated that the fractional turnover rates were the same in the two groups of rats and suggested that the rate of xanthine oxidase synthesis was reduced 10-fold in the depleted rats prior to protein re-feeding. Greatly increased isotopic labeling of highly purified enzyme with 14C-leucine during the phase of restoration of enzyme levels indicated that the increase in activity was the result of accelerated apoenzyme synthesis de novo."
https://openalex.org/W1544099313,"Abstract Glutarate ion is bound to the pig heart extramitochondrial glutamic-aspartic transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) by both carboxylate groups at low pH values but by only one carboxylate group at high pH values. The positively charged protein site which binds a carboxylate group at both high and low pH values is normally masked by the buffer anion. A spectroscopic method is presented for studying the affinity of this one site on the protein for any anion. Although there is little free energy and no enthalpy change in the equilibrium, glutarate cannot displace this buffer anion directly at high pH values but does so by a series of reactions involving the acidic glutarate complex which has both carboxylate groups bound. The site at which the second carboxylate group is bound at low pH values is thought to be the quaternary nitrogen atom corresponding to the e-amino group of a lysine residue involved in binding the aldehyde group of the chromophoric prosthetic group, pyridoxal phosphate. It is suggested that the binding of substrate anions to proteins in other enzymatic reactions does not necessarily involve the unmasking of a positive site by a conformational change but commonly involves displacement either of the buffer ion or the reaction product. Experimental methods are presented to test this hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W1915361630,"Formation of 3-phosphoglycerate, glycolate, glycerate, and serine by tobacco leaves was analyzed between 4 and 60 sec of 14CO2 fixation during photosynthesis. With decreasing time, the percentage of the total 14C incorporated into 3-phosphoglycerate increased; the percentage into the other compounds, including glycolate, decreased to nearly zero. At 4 or 11 sec 3-phosphoglycerate and glycerate were predominantly carboxyl labeled; glycolate was uniformly labeled. At 4 sec the specific activity of the carboxyl group of 3-phosphoglycerate was about 100-fold greater than that of either carbon atom of glycolate. Carbon atoms 2 and 3 of 3-phosphoglycerate were uniformly labeled at 4 or 11 sec and had a 10-fold higher specific activity than the carbon atoms of glycolate. 3-Phosphoglycerate became uniformly labeled between 30 and 60 sec, and the specific activities of carbon atoms of 3-phosphoglycerate and glycolate became similar. Addition of α-hydroxy-2-pyridinemethanesulfonate did not alter the initial rates of labeling or specific activity of 3-phosphoglycerate or glycolate, but glycolate-14C accumulated while the percentage of 14C decreased in products formed from glycolate, such as glycine, serine, glycerate, and sucrose. Glycine, like glycolate, was uniformly labeled even at the shortest times. After 4 sec serine was equally labeled in carbon atoms 1 and 2. Carbon atom 3 was slightly less active. In 11 sec serine was uniformly labeled. Results were consistent with serine formation from glycolate and glycine and a small unlabeled C1 pool. After 4 sec in the presence of the glycolate oxidase inhibitor, the small amount of labeled serine was slightly carboxyl labeled, as if part of the serine came from 3-phosphoglycerate. In 60 sec, tobacco leaves incorporated 12% of the total 14C in glycerate. The percentage distribution of 14C in glycerate carbon atoms was similar to that in 3-phosphoglycerate. The specific activity of glycerate carbon atoms was one-one hundredth that of 3-phosphoglycerate at 4 and 11 sec and one-tenth that of 3-phosphoglycerate at 60 sec."

The A protein is mainly associated with the microsomal fraction, whereas the B protein is distributed between the microsomal and soluble fraction. The B protein is more readily dissociated from the microsomes than the A protein. Microsomes present in milk have the same specific activity of the A and B protein as microsomes isolated from mammary tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1618822970,"Abstract 1. The effect of acidification on the fluorescence, absorption, viscosity, sedimentation, optical rotatory dispersion, and polarization of fluorescence of bovine growth hormone has been measured. All the data are consistent with a molecular transition that results in increased unfolding of the hormone as the pH is reduced from 5 to 2. A pK of 3.55 and a hydrogen ion dependence of 1.5 have been determined from the increase in fluorescence that accompanies the molecular transition. 2. Although major changes occur in all the properties studied, the helical content, as determined either from the Moffitt or Schechter-Blout equations, remains the same. Apparently major modifications in tertiary structure can occur independently of those in secondary structure. 3. A second transition in the neutral pH range has been observed by polarization of fluorescence measurements."

The enzyme was specific for the indicated substrates, and the available data suggest that a single enzyme catalyzes the condensation reaction with either N-acetyl- or N-glycolyl- d -mannosamine-6-P.

https://openalex.org/W1513796916,"Abstract The monovalent cation requirement for a highly purified acetyl coenzyme A synthetase derived from bovine heart mitochondria was investigated. When removal of stimulatory cations from the reaction components was accomplished, no catalytic activity was detected. Adding chloride salts of rubidium, ammonium, potassium, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, sodium, or lithium to a final concentration of 5 to 10 mm stimulated the over-all reaction maximally. Stimulating monovalent cations acted catalytically and all of their apparent Km values fell into a range of 1 to 3 mm. Activating monovalent cations could be separated into two groups on the basis of their kinetic behavior in the over-all reaction. Cations in the first group (Rb+, NH4+, K+) gave optimal rates of acetyl coenzyme A formation at concentrations of 10 to 200 mm, showed atypical kinetics at elevated concentrations of acetate (10 to 40 mm), but failed to show altered Km values in the presence of increasing magnesium ion concentrations (3 to 27 mm). In contrast, cations in the second group (Na+ and Li+) inhibited the reaction at concentrations greater than 10 mm, had this inhibition partially reversed by monovalent cations in the first group, did not have their kinetics effected by acetate, but did show decreasing Km values as the magnesium ion concentration was increased from 3 to 27 mm. Two different activating cations, each at a concentration of 60% of its apparent Km, produced an appreciably greater reaction rate than a single cation at twice this concentration. Yet the maximal velocity obtainable with a single species was not exceeded by various combinations of activating alkali metal ions. Activating monovalent cations were also shown to be necessary for formation of enzyme-bound acetyladenylate, either from acetate and adenosine triphosphate or from acetyl coenzyme A and adenosine monophosphate. Substrate quantities of enzyme were used to demonstrate this product of both partial reactions under equilibrium conditions. Optimal yields of acetyladenylate were obtained with 5 mm rubidium or sodium chloride. Sodium chloride at 10 mm decreased this yield, whereas rubidium ions did not. These observations suggest that activating monovalent cations participate in the catalytic mechanism of acetyl coenzyme A synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W72203548,"Abstract The interaction of ribonuclease A with cupric and zinc ions has been studied spectrophotometrically and by potentiometric titration in the presence and absence of cytidylic acid derivatives. In the absence of cytidylic acid, the results suggest that each cupric ion distributes among a set of approximately four spectrally similar sites; each site appears to consist mainly of a single imidazole side chain and its adjacent peptide bond nitrogen atoms at neutral pH. No evidence for the preferential chelation of a single cupric or zinc ion between histidines-12 and -119 has been found. In the presence of 3'-cytidylate, binding of both cupric and zinc ions is strengthened. In addition, spectrophotometric studies indicate that cupric ion-binding sites are altered in the presence of 3'-cytidylate. These data are compatible with formation of a ternary complex between a cupric or zinc ion, 3'-cytidylate, and ribonuclease. By contrast, 2'-cytidylate does not alter the type of ligand to which cupric ion binds, but appears to diminish very slightly the affinity of ribonuclease for cupric ion; these results suggest that 2'-cytidylate may compete for one of the sites usually available to cupric ion. Several possible mechanisms for the inhibition of ribonuclease by cupric and zinc ions are suggested. These include blocking of the active site by bound metal ions and conformational changes induced by binding of metal ions elsewhere in the protein. The importance of cooperative interactions between 3'-cytidylate and metal ions in binding to ribonuclease is particularly stressed as a mechanism of inhibition."

The enzyme was specific for ATP and either N-acetyl- or N-glycolyl-d-mannosamine. The results of fractionation, partial heat inactivation, and kinetic experiments indicated that a single enzyme was responsible for the phosphorylation of the two N-acylmannosamines.

https://openalex.org/W1600896165,"Abstract Photosynthesis by the algae Chlamydomonas or Chlorella was altered in three major ways by treatment with 0.001 m α-hydroxy-2-pyridinemethanesulfonate or hydroxymethanesulfonate. (a) At pH 7.6 or 8.3 these sulfonates restored the 14CO2-fixation rate to that which occurs normally at pH 6.5. This represented a 6- to 7-fold increase in rate at pH 8.3 over the rate in the nontreated algae. At pH 6.5 no stimulation of photosynthesis occurred. (b) In the presence of these sulfonates the algae accumulated much of the newly fixed 14C into sugar diphosphates, particularly ribulose diphosphate. During a 10- to 120-sec period at pH 8.3 about 18% of the total 14C fixed accumulated at a linear rate into ribulose diphosphate. At pH 6.5 the sulfonates also stimulated sugar diphosphate accumulation, but its conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate was more extensive. (c) At both pH 6.5 and 8.3 14C labeling of the amino acids was greatly inhibited by either sulfonate, and there was some increase in the percentage of 14C in pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate. Although the reason for these changes in photosynthesis caused by the hydroxymethanesulfonates remains obscure, evidently the hydroxymethanesulfonates are not specific inhibitors of glycolate oxidase. Treatment of the algae with the hydroxymethanesulfonates did not result in the accumulation of glycolate-14C as did occur in treated leaves of higher plants during 14CO2 photosynthesis. This result correlates with the absence of glycolate oxidase in algae. Thus, glycolate metabolism represents a major difference between algae and higher plants."

https://openalex.org/W1515347745,"Abstract Long term extraction of lyophilized chloroplasts with heptane removes plastoquinones A 45 and C. Hill reaction activity as measured by photoreduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol is decreased in proportion to the extraction of plastoquinone C, whereas up to 40% of the plastoquinone A can be removed without affecting photoreductase activity. Some restoration of activity may be obtained by adding plastoquinones A and C separately, but maximum restoration is obtained by adding both quinones. Optimum restoration is obtained with 0.1 µmole of plastoquinone A and 0.01 µmole of plastoquinone C per mg of chlorophyll. Plastoquinone B can replace plastoquinone C, but other chloroplast quinones, such as plastoquinone D, α-tocopherylquinone, and vitamin K1 do not help to restore activity."

On assay for biological activity, 5-valine-oxytocin was found to possess approximately 0.3 unit per mg of oxytocic activity and 0.1 unit per mg of avian vasodepressor activity. The 1-deamino-5-valine-oxytocin possesses approximately 0.7 unit per mg of oxytocic activity and 0.3 unit per mg of avian vasodepressor activity. Both of these analogues exhibit approximately 0.01 unit per mg of rat pressor and less than 0.001 unit per mg of rat antidiuretic activity.

https://openalex.org/W1551173757,"Abstract Weanling male rats were fed for approximately 3 weeks either a vitamin E-deficient or a vitamin E-supplemented diet. Liver homogenates were prepared and separated into mitochondrial, microsomal, and supernatant fractions, and the contributions of the microsomal and supernatant fractions to the maintenance or inhibition of mitochondrial oxidation of β-hydroxybutyrate were studied. When microsomes were added to mitochondria such that approximately equal amounts of protein from each fraction were present, oxidation was inhibited in a manner similar to that of vitamin E-deficient homogenates, regardless of whether the mitochondria or microsomes were derived from either vitamin E-deficient or vitamin E-supplemented rats. The further addition of the supernatant fraction from either type of liver resulted in maintenance of oxygen consumption when vitamin E-supplemented microsomes were present. The microsomal inhibitor was inactivated by boiling, but remained bound to the microsomal membranes after both sonic disruption followed by dialysis and sonic disruption followed by centrifugation. Dialysis of the supernatant fraction removed the factor, or factors, which overcame the inhibition due to the vitamin E-supplemented microsomes. Inhibition of oxygen consumption was not correlated with either peroxidation or lysosomal enzyme activity. It is suggested that the microsomal inhibitor is protein in nature."
