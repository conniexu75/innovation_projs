https://openalex.org/W3133902999,"Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from humans to animals has been reported for many domesticated species, including farmed minks. The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. One genetic variant, known as “cluster five,” arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the world’s largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the cluster-five variant, which contains a mutation resulting in a Y453F residue change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Using an ELISA-based angiotensin-converting enzyme-2/RBD inhibition assay, we show that the Y453F variant does not decrease established humoral immunity from previously infected individuals or affect the neutralizing antibody response in a vaccine mouse model based on the original Wuhan strain RBD or spike as antigens. However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor with a 4-fold higher affinity than the original strain, suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in the frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.

The spike protein mediates the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor (11Walls A.C. Park Y.-J.J. Tortorici M.A. Wall A. McGuire A.T. Veesler D.

Moreover, the spike protein is the main target for the host's protective antibody response (11Walls A.C. Park Y.-J.J. Tortorici M.A. Wall A. McGuire A.T. Veesler D.

Mutations arising through antigenic drift may thus result in novel viral escape strains. One of these cluster variants, disclosed as “cluster five,” has been discovered in Denmark and bears a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution (Y453F) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (15Lassauniére R. Fonager J. Rasmussen M. Frische A. Strandh C.P. Fomsgaard V.A. Working Paper on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations Arising in Danish Mink, Their 1 Spread to Humans and Neutralization Data, Preliminary Report. SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark2020: 1-7Google Scholar). This position is conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and analyses of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE-2 reveal that it is directly involved in the interaction of the virus with the host cell receptor (16Yan R. Zhang Y. Li Y. Xia L. Guo Y. Zhou Q. Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2.Science. 2021; 367: 1444-1448Crossref Scopus (3286) Google Scholar, 17Li F. Li W.

However, the role of this variant concerning functional transmission and establishment of immunity is unknown. At present, two new RBD variants known as N439K and N501Y have been found in humans. The latter appears to have a better transmission or improved immune evasion than the original counterpart, and this variant is currently increasing in the infection cases in the United Kingdom (18Davies N.G. Barnard R.C. Jarvis C.I. Kucharski A.J. Munday J. Pearson C.A.B. Russell T.W. Tully D.C. Abbott S. Gimma A. Waites W. Wong K.L.M. van Zandvoort K. Eggo R.M. Funk S. et al.Estimated transmissibility and impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England.medRxiv. 2021; : 1-80https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248822Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There is a general lack of evidence characterizing the pathogenesis, functional properties, and impact on these new cluster variants' immune recognition and memory responses. Despite this, there have been speculations and reports suggesting that the cluster-five variant might have evasion potential by reducing the immunity of convalescent individuals and that it could even challenge the current global vaccine strategies (15Lassauniére R. Fonager J. Rasmussen M. Frische A. Strandh C.P. Fomsgaard V.A. Working Paper on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations Arising in Danish Mink, Their 1 Spread to Humans and Neutralization Data, Preliminary Report. SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark2020: 1-7Google Scholar). Based on these presumptions, the Danish government in November 2020 decided to completely shut down all Danish mink farms, which at that time represented the largest mink fur production in the world. To address the biophysical characteristics and the impact of this variant on established immunity, we expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD WT (WT, from the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 isolate) and “cluster-five” Y453F and the ACE-2 ectodomain. The Y453F variant did not alter the inhibition potency of sera from convalescent individuals exposed to the WT strain in the spring of 2020, nor did it challenge the humoral vaccine response in a mouse model immunized with WT RBD or prefusion-stabilized spike protein ectodomain. However, we found a 4-fold affinity increase of the Y453F variant to the ACE-2 binding that could result in an enhanced spreading potential. To determine the biological significance of the Y453F mutation, we studied the impact on protein stability and function by thermal denaturation and binding kinetics experiments (Fig. 1). Using the ratio of the intrinsic fluorescence at 350 and 330 nm over a temperature gradient from 35 to 95 °C, we observed no significant differences in the inflection temperatures (53.43 and 53.37 °C for the WT RBD and Y453F, respectively), suggesting that the variant has no critical effect on protein stability (Fig. 1B). We also determined the kinetics of the interaction with the ectodomain of human ACE-2 by biolayer interferometry (Fig. 1, C and D). The Y453F variant bound with a 4-fold higher affinity than the WT (3.85 nM vs 15.5 nM) and analyses of the Ka and Kdis revealed that it bound faster to ACE-2 (Ka 1.5 x 105 Ms vs 4 x 105 Ms) and remained bound for longer (7 x 10−4 s−1 vs 6 x 10−3 s−1). To clarify whether the tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution in the surface of the RBD affects not only its functionality but also recognition by the immune system, we determined the inhibition potency of sera from qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 convalescent individuals (n = 141) using a previously described ACE-2/RBD antibody inhibition assay (19Bayarri-Olmos R. Idorn M. Rosbjerg A. Pérez-Alós L. Hansen C. Johsen L. Helgstrand C. Öberg F.K. Søgaard M. Paludan S. Bak-Thomsen T. Jardine J. Skjoedt M.-O. Garred P. Vaccine monitoring shows that focused immunization with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain provides a better neutralizing antibody response than full-length spike protein.Res. Sq. 2021; : 1-24https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-134388/v1Crossref Google Scholar). We observed no significant difference between the inhibition of the two variants (Fig. 2A) and a tight linear relationship (R2 = 0.9430) with a highly significant correlation (ρ = 0.9711, p < 0.0001) of the serum antibody inhibition capacity to both RBD variants (Fig. 2B). Next, we evaluated the inhibition potency of polyclonal sera and mouse mAbs isolated from mice immunized with WT RBD or prefusion-stabilized spike protein as a preclinical vaccine model (described elsewhere (19Bayarri-Olmos R. Idorn M. Rosbjerg A. Pérez-Alós L. Hansen C. Johsen L. Helgstrand C. Öberg F.K. Søgaard M. Paludan S. Bak-Thomsen T. Jardine J. Skjoedt M.-O. Garred P. Vaccine monitoring shows that focused immunization with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain provides a better neutralizing antibody response than full-length spike protein.Res. Sq. 2021; : 1-24https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-134388/v1Crossref Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3). Sera from RBD immunized mice inhibited the WT and Y453F RBD binding to ACE-2 with an IC50 of 28,369 and 26,579, respectively, several fold more effectively than sera from spike immunized mice (IC50 of 7,075 and 6,363, respectively) (Fig. 3A). More importantly, and regardless of the immunization strategy, the mouse sera did not show differences in the inhibition potency of the two RBD variants. Finally, we compared the inhibition of high-affinity mAbs (n = 18) derived from immunized mice (Fig. 3B). Linear regression and Spearman rank correlation analyses of the IC50 values against WT and Y453F RBD revealed that the inhibition potencies against both variants correlated strongly (R2 = 0.9613, ρ = 0.8919, p < 0.0001). The inhibition capacity of the individual mAbs was assessed separately. The emergence of nonsynonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene has been reported since the beginning of 2020. The main part of these mutations has been identified within the European continent (>20), with fewer identifications on the Asian and American continents (20Mishra D. Suri G.S. Kaur G. Tiwari M.

Virol. 2021; 93: 2406-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The vast majority of these residue substitutions are located in the spike regions outside of the RBD with the D614G mutation being a common variant reported on all continents and which seems to be taking over likely because of selective advantages (21Zhang L.

Recently, three new genetic mutations inducing residue changes in the RBD have been reported in Europe, that is, N439K, Y453F, and N501Y. The N439K may make the virus more infectious because of an increased affinity toward ACE-2 and/or a reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies (25Li Q. Wu J. Nie J. Zhang L. Hao H. Liu S. Zhao C.

The N501Y mutant is a part of a novel strain, “Variant of Concern 202012/01”/B.1.1.7, that has accumulated 17 mutations—8 of them in the spike gene—and in some areas of England may account for most of the new cases at the time of writing (18Davies N.G. Barnard R.C. Jarvis C.I. Kucharski A.J. Munday J. Pearson C.A.B. Russell T.W. Tully D.C. Abbott S. Gimma A. Waites W. Wong K.L.M. van Zandvoort K. Eggo R.M.

The Y453F was first identified in Denmark in the summer of 2020 among farmed minks. The variant was coupled to the “cluster five” mutation (15Lassauniére R. Fonager J. Rasmussen M. Frische A. Strandh C.P. Fomsgaard V.A. Working Paper on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations Arising in Danish Mink, Their 1 Spread to Humans and Neutralization Data, Preliminary Report. SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark2020: 1-7Google Scholar) and arose a great international concern when it was reported to have been transmitted to humans. Millions of minks were culled and their pelts discarded, effectively shutting down a country-wide industry. However, a thorough functional characterization of the impact of the Y453F RBD variant on immunity and ACE-2 interaction has so far not been conducted. When we challenged the RBD:ACE-2 interaction with COVID-19 convalescent sera from 141 qPCR-confirmed individuals that have been infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, we found no reduction in the serum capacity to inhibit the binding of the Y453F variant to ACE-2. This conflicts with a preliminary report (“working paper”) that found that plasma samples from four convalescent individuals (out of a total of nine individuals) with low and intermediate neutralization titers had a reduced neutralization potency against the variant (15Lassauniére R. Fonager J. Rasmussen M. Frische A. Strandh C.P. Fomsgaard V.A. Working Paper on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations Arising in Danish Mink, Their 1 Spread to Humans and Neutralization Data, Preliminary Report. SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark2020: 1-7Google Scholar). The major difference in the study setups besides the number of included plasma samples is that the study from Lassauniere et al. (15Lassauniére R. Fonager J. Rasmussen M. Frische A. Strandh C.P. Fomsgaard V.A. Working Paper on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations Arising in Danish Mink, Their 1 Spread to Humans and Neutralization Data, Preliminary Report. SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark2020: 1-7Google Scholar) uses the bona fide plaque reduction neutralization test, where we have only addressed the inhibition of the ACE-2/RBD interaction under less physiologically comparable conditions. To further examine the possible inhibition differences between the two RBD variants, we used a traditional vaccine approach applying mice immunized with WT RBD or the full WT ectodomain spike and assessed the antibody titers and neutralization capacity of WT and Y453F RBD. In the vaccine models, we found no difference concerning the antibody-mediated ACE-2/RBD inhibition of the two variants, which was also the case when we challenged 18 different verified neutralizing mAbs raised against WT RBD or spike antigens. The tyrosine at position 453 has been shown to be a critical residue engaged in direct interaction with the ACE-2 receptor via the tyr OH group (16Yan R. Zhang Y. Li Y. Xia L. Guo Y. Zhou Q. Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2.Science. 2021; 367: 1444-1448Crossref Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that there would be either a reduced or similar affinity with the substitution to a phenylalanine. However, to our surprise, we found a four-fold higher affinity of the 453F RBD binding to ACE-2 (KD 3.85 nM) compared with WT RBD. The precise reason for this remains to be established, but there are several other tyrosine residues in RBD that might be used in the ACE-2 interaction. The consequence of this affinity increase on the physiological avidity could even be more pronounced for the multimeric spike/ACE-2 interaction. However, since our findings are only indicative, caution should be taken when evaluating the transmission capacity of this SARS-CoV-2 variant. Regardless, our results highlight two essential points regarding the developing clusters of spike variants: that immunity might not be dramatically challenged and that emphasis should also be placed on characterizing the transmission capacity and interaction properties of new emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains. This follows in the line of the new UK discovered N501Y mutant that within a short time gained transmission dominance in many areas including London, where by mid-December represented more than 60% of the cases (28Kupferschmidt K. Mutant coronavirus in the United Kingdom sets off alarms, but its importance remains unclear.Science (80-). 2020; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg2626Crossref Google Scholar). The functional properties of the N501Y mutant variant are not yet established. Taken together, these results suggest that the molecular evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has so far been taken it in the direction of receptor affinity adaptation and optimization rather than toward an immune evasion strategy. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 Y453F RBD variant with a C-terminal 10xHis-AviTag (SGSGHHHHHHHHHHGSGGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) was synthesized and subcloned into a pcDNA3.4-TOPO expression vector by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Recombinant Y453F RBD was produced by transiently transfecting Expi293 cells (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. On day four after transfection, the supernatant was collected, and the protein was batch-purified by incubating 2 h at room temperature (RT) with HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (1 ml of sedimented resin/100 ml of supernatant) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by wash and elution according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The eluted protein was subsequently applied to a HiLoad Superdex 16/600 200 pg size-exclusion chromatography column (Cytiva, MA) equilibrated in PBS. Purified RBD Y453F was buffer-exchanged and biotinylated on the C-terminal AviTag with a biotin ligase kit (Avidity, CO). The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the sequence of human ACE-2 ectodomain (aa. 17–740) with a CD33 signal peptide and a C-terminal human IgG1 was synthesized by Twist Bioscience (San Francisco, CA) and subcloned into a pTT5 expression vector. Recombinant ACE-2-Fc was produced by transiently transfecting Expi293 cells (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. On day 5 after transfection, the supernatant was collected and the protein was affinity-purified on a 5-ml MabSelect SuRe column, followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 26/600 200 pg column (both Cytiva, MA) equilibrated in PBS.

The next day, sera/mAbs were incubated for 1 h in low-binding round-bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a solution of biotinylated WT or Y453F RBD (4 ng/ml) with HS-strep-HRP (1:16,000 dilution) in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) as follows: COVID-19 convalescent sera in a 10% dilution, immunized mouse sera in an 8-point 4-fold dilution starting at 1.25% dilution, and mAbs in a 6-point 4-fold dilution starting at 20 μg/ml. Afterward, the sera/mAbs:RBD:HS-Strep-HRP solution was transferred to ACE-2 plates and incubated for 15 min. The plates were developed with TMB One (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics, Taastrup, Denmark) for 20 min and stopped with 0.3 M H2SO4. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. Between steps, the plates were washed thrice with PBS-T. Unless otherwise stated, all incubations were performed in an orbital shaker at RT.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 severity where adjusted relative risk (ARR), P-value and 95 CI for ARR were used to test significance. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 outcome where adjusted odds ratio (AOR), P-value and 95%CI for AOR were used for testing significance. Results Among the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease. Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive. Age group (ARR = 1.779, 95%CI = 1.405–2.252, p-value &lt;0.0001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (ARR = 4.769, 95%CI = 2.419–9.402 p-value &lt;0.0001), Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (ARR = 1.358, 95%CI = 1.109–1.662 p-value = 0.003), Sodium (ARR = 1.321, 95%CI = 1.091–1.600 p-value = 0.004) and Potassium (ARR = 1.269, 95%CI = 1.059–1.521 p-value = 0.010) were found to be significant predictors of COVID-19 severity. The following factors were significantly associated with COVID-19 outcome; age group (AOR = 2.767, 95%CI = 1.099–6.067, p-value = 0.031), white blood cell count (WBC) (AOR = 4.253, 95%CI = 1.918–9.429, p-value = 0.0001) and sodium level (AOR = 3.435, 95%CI = 1.439–8.198, p-value = 0.005). Conclusions Assessing and monitoring the laboratory markers of WBC, NLR, SGOT, sodium and potassium levels at the earliest stage of the disease could have a considerable role in halting disease progression and death."
https://openalex.org/W3109252042,"Purpose Virus epidemics may be mitigated if people comply with directives to stay at home and keep their distance from strangers in public. As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. Data Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. Conclusion Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations."
https://openalex.org/W3137115587,"Metabolic reprogramming is considered hallmarks of cancer. Aerobic glycolysis in tumors cells has been well-known for almost a century, but specific factors that regulate lactate generation and the effects of lactate in both cancer cells and stroma are not yet well understood. In the present study using breast cancer cell lines, human primary cultures of breast tumors, and immune deficient murine models, we demonstrate that the POU1F1 transcription factor is functionally and clinically related to both metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer cells and fibroblasts activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that POU1F1 transcriptionally regulates the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) gene. LDHA catalyzes pyruvate into lactate instead of leading into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Lactate increases breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, it activates normal-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Conversely, LDHA knockdown in breast cancer cells that overexpress POU1F1 decreases tumor volume and [18F]FDG uptake in tumor xenografts of mice. Clinically, POU1F1 and LDHA expression correlate with relapse- and metastasis-free survival. Our data indicate that POU1F1 induces a metabolic reprogramming through LDHA regulation in human breast tumor cells, modifying the phenotype of both cancer cells and fibroblasts to promote cancer progression."

However, most of the studies applied variable-centered approaches. The heterogeneity of smartphone addiction severity has not been examined for the associations with negative emotion variables. The purposes of the present study is to explore the latent classes of smartphone addiction and analyze the relationships between depression, social anxiety and boredom and these subgroups. The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) and three negative emotion scales were employed to conduct a survey of 539 college students. Mplus8.3 software was applied to perform the latent class analysis (LCA) based on the smartphone addiction symptom ratings. ANOVA and multinomial logistic regression were used to explore the differences among these latent categories and the associations between these subgroups and negative emotion variables. Results demonstrated that Negative emotional variables were significantly correlated with smartphone addiction proneness. Based on their scores on the Smartphone Addiction Scale, smartphone users were divided into three latent classes: low risk class, moderate class and high risk class. Women were more likely to be classified in the high-risk class. The severity of depression and boredom was able to predict the membership of the latent class effectively; while social anxiety failed to do this in the high risk class."

From the perspective of financial support, using the DEA global Malmquist productivity index model and based on the data of 13 main grain producing areas in China from 2001 to 2017, this paper discusses the evolution characteristics and regional distribution differences of the total factor productivity index of grain production in China’s main grain producing areas. The results show that from 2001 to 2017, the total factor productivity index of grain production in China’s main grain producing areas showed an overall fluctuation trend of gradual decline, with an average annual decline of 7.3%. From the perspective of spatial analysis, the grain production efficiency in China’s main grain producing areas is characterized by uneven spatial development, which is generally manifested as the decreasing trend from the central region to the eastern and western regions. Meanwhile, it can be seen from the decomposition index that the change of total factor productivity of grain production in China’s main grain producing areas mainly depends on the change of technical efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3137786933,"The emergence and dissemination of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli is a global health issue. Food-producing animals, including pigs, are significant reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which can be transmitted to humans. Thus, the rapid detection of ESBLs is required for efficient epidemiological control and treatment. In this study, multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a single-stranded tag hybridization chromatographic printed-array strip (STH-PAS), as a lateral flow strip assay (LFA), was established for the rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple bla genes in a single reaction. Visible blue lines, indicating the presence of the bla CTX-M , bla SHV , and bla OXA genes, were observed within 10 min by the naked eye. The limit of detection of all three genes was 2.5 ng/25 μL, and no cross-reactivity with seven commensal aerobic bacteria was observed. A total of 93.9% (92/98) and 96% (48/50) of the E . coli isolates from pork meat and fecal samples, respectively, expressed an ESBL-producing phenotype. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR amplicons showed that bla CTX-M was the most prevalent type (91.3–95.83%), of which the main form was bla CTX-M-55 . The sensitivity and specificity of the RPA-LFA were 99.2% and 100%, respectively, and were in almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.949–1.000) with the results from PCR sequencing. Thus, the RPA-LFA is a promising tool for rapid and equipment-free ESBL detection and may facilitate clinical diagnosis in human and veterinary medicine, as well as AMR monitoring and surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W3137755898,"Enhanced glucose uptake is coupled with elevated aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in cancer cells and is closely correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We previously discovered that ATM, a protein kinase deficient in Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) disease, is an insulin-responsive protein that participates in insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscle cells by stimulating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation. However, the role of ATM in glucose uptake and tumorigenesis of cancer cells is unclear. In the present study, we found that aggressive breast and prostate cancer cell lines with overactivated Akt activity exhibit enhanced glucose uptake and GLUT1 translocation upon insulin treatment, and KU-55933, a specific inhibitor of ATM, inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake by blocking translocation of GLUT1 to the cell surface. KU-55933 also inhibits aerobic glycolysis and ATP production in these cells. Moreover, KU-55933 induces apoptosis and inhibits motility of cancer cells by inhibiting glucose uptake. Our results showed that while high concentration of glucose and insulin promote the expression of a mesenchymal biomarker (vimentin) in these cancer cells, KU-55933 strongly inhibits its expression as well as epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The roles of ATM in stimulating glucose uptake, glycolysis, motility, and proliferation of cancer cells were demonstrated by knocking-down ATM in these cells. KU-55933 treatment also inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in mouse mammary tumors through inhibition of GLUT1 translocation and vimentin expression. These results suggest that ATM acts as a promoter of tumorigenesis in cancer cells with overactivated Akt, and KU-55933 induces apoptosis and inhibits motility by blocking GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake and glycolysis in these cancer cells, which may lead to the use of KU-55933 and its analogs as new preventive or therapeutic agents against cancer."

The immune response of broiler chickens to C . jejuni is under-researched. This study aimed to characterize the immune response of chickens to Campylobacter jejuni colonization. Birds were challenged orally with 0.5 mL of 2.4 x 10 8 CFU/mL of Campylobacter jejuni or with 0.5 mL of 0.85% saline. Campylobacter jejuni persisted in the ceca of challenged birds with cecal colonization reaching 4.9 log10 CFU/g on 21 dpi. Campylobacter was disseminated to the spleen and liver on 7 dpi and was cleared on 21 dpi from both internal organs. Challenged birds had a significant increase in anti- Campylobacter serum IgY (14&amp;21 dpi) and bile IgA (14 dpi). At 3 dpi, there was a significant suppression in T-lymphocytes derived from the cecal tonsils of birds in the challenge treatment when compared to the control treatment after 72 h of ex vivo stimulation with Con A or C . jejuni . The T-cell suppression on 3 dpi was accompanied by a significant decrease in LITAF, K60, CLAU-2, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-6 mRNA levels in the ceca and an increase in nitric oxide production from adherent splenocytes of challenged birds. In addition, on 3 dpi, there was a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the challenge treatment. On 14 dpi, both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the spleen, and a significant increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes in Campylobacter -challenged birds’ ceca was observed. The persistence of C . jejuni in the ceca of challenged birds on 21 dpi was accompanied by an increase in IL-10 and LITAF mRNA levels, an increase in MNC proliferation when stimulated ex-vivo with the diluted C . jejuni , an increase in serum specific IgY antibodies, an increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and a decrease in CD4+:CD8+ cell ratio. The balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses against C . jejuni might explain the ceca’s bacterial colonization and the absence of pathology in Campylobacter -challenged birds. Future studies on T lymphocyte subpopulations should elucidate a pivotal role in the persistence of Campylobacter in the ceca."
https://openalex.org/W3139104055,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the tumor microenvironment serves a vital role during tumor progression. ATP synthase F1 β subunit (ATP5B) is one of the most important subunits of ATP synthase and increases cellular ATP levels. ATP5B reportedly participates in carcinogenesis in several tumors. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ATP5B remain poorly understood in gastric cancer (GC). Here, we determined that high ATP5B expression in tumor tissues of GC is positively correlated with age, the tumor size, the TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and patients’ poor prognosis. The overexpression of ATP5B in GC cells elevated the cellular ATP content and promoted migration, invasion and proliferation. The levels of MMP2 expression, phosphorylated FAK, and phosphorylated AKT were increased after ATP5B overexpression in GC cells. Additionally, ATP5B overexpression increased the extracellular ATP level through the secretion of intracellular ATP and activated the FAK/AKT/MMP2 signaling pathway. ATP5B-induced downstream pathway activation was induced through the plasma membrane P2X7 receptor. Inhibitors of P2X7, FAK, AKT, and MMP2 suppressed the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of GC cells. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that ATP5B contributes to tumor progression of GC via FAK/AKT/MMP2 pathway. ATP5B, therefore, may be a biomarker of poor prognosis and a potential therapeutic target for GC."
https://openalex.org/W3139197312,"Sepsis and sepsis-associated lung inflammation significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality of critical illness. Here, we examined the hypothesis that neuronal guidance proteins could orchestrate inflammatory events during endotoxin-induced lung injury. Through a targeted array, we identified netrin-1 as the top upregulated neuronal guidance protein in macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we found that netrin-1 is highly enriched in infiltrating myeloid cells, particularly in macrophages during LPS-induced lung injury. Transcriptional studies implicate hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α in the transcriptional induction of netrin-1 during LPS treatment. Subsequently, the deletion of netrin-1 in the myeloid compartment (Ntn1loxp/loxp LysM Cre) resulted in exaggerated mortality and lung inflammation. Surprisingly, further studies revealed enhanced natural killer cells (NK cells) infiltration in Ntn1loxp/loxp LysM Cre mice, and neutralization of NK cell chemoattractant chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) reversed the exaggerated lung inflammation. Together, these studies provide functional insight into myeloid cell-derived netrin-1 in controlling lung inflammation through the modulation of CCL2-dependent infiltration of NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W3138085946,"Forest stand reflectance at the canopy level results from various factors, such as vegetation chemical properties, leaf morphology, canopy structure, and tree sizes. These factors are dependent on the species, age, and health statuses of trees, as well as the site conditions. Sentinel-2 imagery with the high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, has enabled analysis of the relationships between vegetation properties and their spectral responses at large spatial scales. A comprehensive study of these relationships is needed to understand the drivers of vegetation spectral patterns and is essential from the point of view of remote sensing data interpretation. Our study aimed to quantify the site and forest parameters affecting forest stands reflectance. The analysis was conducted for common beech-, silver fir- and Scots pine-dominated stands in a mountainous area of the Polish Carpathians. The effect of stands and site properties on reflectance in different parts of the growing season was captured using the dense time series provided by Sentinel-2 from 2018–2019. The results indicate that the reflectance of common beech stands is mainly influenced by elevation, particularly during spring and autumn. Other factors influencing beech stand reflectance include the share of the broadleaved understory, aspect, and, during summer, the age of stands. The reflectance of coniferous species, i.e., Scots pine and silver fir, is mainly influenced by the age and stand properties, namely the crown closure and stand density. The age is a primary driver for silver fir stands reflectance changes, while the stand properties have a large impact on Scots pine stands reflectance. Also, the understory influences Scots pine stands reflectance, while there appears to be no impact on silver fir stands. The influence of the abovementioned factors is highly diverse, depending on the used band and time of the season."
https://openalex.org/W3138351078,"Introduction Post-operative CSF leak still represents the main drawback of Endoscopic Endonasal Approach (EEA), and different reconstructive strategies have been proposed in order to decrease its rate. Objective To critically analyze the effectiveness of different adopted reconstruction strategies in patients that underwent EEA. Materials and methods Adult patients with skull base tumor surgically treated with EEA were retrospectively analyzed. Data recorded for each case concerned patient demographics, type of surgical approach, histotype, anatomical site of surgical approach, intra-operative CSF leak grade (no leak (INL), low flow (ILFL), high flow (IHFL)), reconstructive adopted strategy, Lumbar Drain positioning, post-operative CSF leak rate and intra/post-operative complications. Results A total number of 521 patients (January 2012-December 2019) was included. Intra-operative CSF leak grade showed to be associated with post-operative CSF leak rate. In particular, the risk to observe a post-operative CSF leak was higher when IHFL was encountered (25,5%; Exp(B) 16.25). In particular, vascularized multilayered reconstruction and fat use showed to be effective in lowering post-operative CSF leaks in IHFL (p 0.02). No differences were found considering INL and ILFL groups. Yearly post-operative CSF leak rate analysis showed a significative decreasing trend. Conclusion Intra-operative CSF leak grade strongly affected post-operative CSF leak rate. Multilayer reconstruction with fat and naso-septal flap could reduce the rate of CSF leak in high risk patients. Reconstructive strategies should be tailored according also to the type and the anatomical site of the approach."
https://openalex.org/W3136396062,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in the viability and survival of implanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We hypothesized that coating of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue-derived hiPSC-CMs with the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) would improve the survival of transplanted cells in the heart and improve heart function in a rat model of ischemic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we first explored the tolerance of FN-coated hiPSC-CMs to hypoxia in an in vitro study. For in vivo assessments, we constructed 3D-hiPSC cardiac tissues (3D-hiPSC-CTs) using a layer-by-layer technique, and then the cells were implanted in the hearts of a myocardial infarction rat model (3D-hiPSC-CTs, n = 10; sham surgery control group (without implant), n = 10). Heart function and histology were analyzed 4 weeks after transplantation. In the in vitro assessment, cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that FN-coated hiPSC-CMs had improved tolerance to hypoxia compared with the control cells. In vivo , the left ventricular ejection fraction of hearts implanted with 3D-hiPSC-CT was significantly better than that of the sham control hearts. Histological analysis showed clear expression of collagen type IV and plasma membrane markers such as desmin and dystrophin in vivo after implantation of 3D-hiPSC-CT, which were not detected in 3D-hiPSC-CMs in vitro . Overall, these results indicated that FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT could improve distressed heart function in a rat myocardial infarction model with a well-expressed cytoskeletal or basement membrane matrix. Therefore, FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT may serve as a promising replacement for heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices and has the potential to improve survivability and therapeutic efficacy in cases of ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W3137651914,"Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) remains a key cause of poor maternal and neonatal health outcomes, particularly in the African region. Two strategies globally promoted to address MiP require pregnant women in malaria-endemic regions to sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and take at least three doses of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) during pregnancy. Yet, several multilevel factors influence the effective uptake of these strategies. This study explored the factors for the poor uptake of IPTp and use of ITNs in lower socio-economic communities in Nigeria. We conducted semi-structured interviews (SSI) and focus group discussions (FGD) with a total of 201 key stakeholders in six communities in Ogun State, South-Western Nigeria. Twelve SSIs were conducted with traditional birth attendants (TBAs), faith-based birth attendants and healthcare providers operating in public health facilities. Community leaders (7), pregnant women (30) and 20 caregivers were individually interviewed. Sixteen FGDs were conducted with multi- and first-time pregnant women grouped by location and pregnancy experiences. A thematic approach was used for data analysis. At the individual and social levels, there is a high general awareness of MiP, its consequences and ITNs but low awareness of IPTp, with type of antenatal care (ANC) provider being a key factor influencing access to IPTp. The choice of ANC provider, which facilitates access to IPTp and ITNs, is influenced by the experiences of women, relatives and friends, as well as the attitudes of ANC providers and community perceptions of the type of ANC providers. Concurrent use of multiple ANC providers and ANC providers’ relationships further influence acceptability and coverage for IPTp and ITN use. At the health sector level, there is low awareness about preventive malarial strategies including IPTp among TBAs and faith-based birth attendants, in contrast to high IPTp awareness among public healthcare providers. The findings highlight several factors that influence the utilisation of IPTp services and call for greater synergy and collaboration between the three groups of healthcare providers towards enhancing access to and acceptability of IPTp for improving maternal and child outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3139310004,"Staphylococcus chromogenes is a common skin commensal in cattle and has been identified as a frequent cause of bovine mastitis and intramammary infections. We have developed a seven locus Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme for typing S . chromogenes . Sequence-based typing systems, such as MLST, have application in studies of genetic diversity, population structure, and epidemiology, including studies of strain variation as a factor in pathogenicity or host adaptation. The S . chromogenes scheme was tested on 120 isolates collected from three geographic locations, Vermont and Washington State in the United States and Belgium. A total of 46 sequence types (STs) were identified with most of the STs being location specific. The utility of the typing scheme is indicated by a discrimination power of 95.6% for all isolates and greater than 90% for isolates from each of the three locations. Phylogenetic analysis placed 39 of the 46 STs into single core group consistent with a common genetic lineage; the STs in this group differ by less than 0.5% at the nucleotide sequence level. Most of the diversification in this lineage group can be attributed to mutation; recombination plays a limited role. This lineage group includes two clusters of single nucleotide variants in starburst configurations indicative of recent clonal expansion; nearly 50% of the isolates sampled in this study are in these two clusters. The remaining seven STs were set apart from the core group by having alleles with highly variable sequences at one or more loci. Recombination had a higher impact than mutation in the diversification of these outlier STs. Alleles with hypervariable sequences were detected at five of the seven loci used in the MLST scheme; the average sequence distances between the hypervariable alleles and the common core alleles ranged from 12 to 34 nucleotides. The extent of these sequence differences suggests the hypervariable alleles may be remnants of an ancestral genotype."
https://openalex.org/W3136249649,"The objective of this pilot study was to describe the microbial profiles present in the plaque and saliva of children who continued to develop new carious lesions following treatment with silver diamine fluoride (“nonresponders”) compared to caries active, caries-free, and children immediately receiving SDF treatment for untreated caries in order to identify potential microbial differences that may relate to a re-incidence of caries. Saliva and plaque samples from infected and contralateral sites were obtained from twenty children who were either caries free, had active carious lesions, were caries active and received SDF treatment immediately before sampling, or had previously received SDF treatment and developed new caries. In total, 8,057,899 Illumina-generated sequence reads from 60 samples were obtained. Reads were processed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology pipeline. Group differences were assessed using Analysis of Variance Models and Tukey Honest Significant Differences. To identify significant taxa between treatment groups, Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LefSe) and Analysis of Differential Abundance Taking Sample Variation Into Account were used. Differential abundant analysis indicated that members of the Lachnospiraceae family were significantly enriched in non-responders and the genus Tannerella and species Granulicatella adiances were also highly abundant in this group. LefSe analysis between non-responders and SDF-treated groups revealed that genera Leptotrichia and Granulicatella were enriched in non-responders. We observed the highest abundance of phosphotransferase system and lowest abundance of lipopolysaccharide synthesis in non-responders. The microbiome in dental biofilms is responsible for initiation and progression of dental caries. SDF has been shown to be effective in arresting the progression carious lesions, in part due to its antimicrobial properties. Findings suggest that the differential abundance of select microbiota and specific pathway functioning in individuals that present with recurrent decay after SDF treatment may contribute to a potential failure of silver diamine fluoride to arrest dental caries. However, the short duration of sample collection following SDF application and the small sample size emphasize the need for further data and additional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3137592408,"Retrograde intrarenal surgery is a common procedure that carries a risk of radiation exposure for urologists. This study aimed to measure the amount of radiation that urologists are exposed to during surgery, and to estimate how many procedures can be safely performed by one urologist per year. Variables that affect radiation exposure were also identified. Radiation exposure doses were measured for the eye, neck, chest, arms, and hands of a urologist who performed 226 retrograde intrarenal surgeries. To determine how many procedures could be safely performed per year, the Annual Permissible Occupational Exposure Radiation Dose Guidelines of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements were consulted. Correlations between radiation exposure dose and the patient's age, sex, body mass index, stone number/burden/laterality/location/Hounsfield unit, and their renal calculi were calculated. The mean surgery and fluoroscopy durations were 83.2 and 5.13 min; the mean tube voltage and current were 68.88 kV and 2.48 mA, respectively. Cumulative radiation doses for the eye, neck, chest, right upper arm, left hand, and right hand were 65.53, 69.95, 131.79, 124.43, 165.66, and 126.64 mSv, respectively. Radiation reduction rates for lead collars and aprons were 97% and 98%, respectively. If the urologists wear only radiation shields and lead apron but do not wear safety glasses during RIRS, the recommended by the ICRP publication 103 is taken into consideration, our results showed that 517 RIRS can be performed per year safely. However, if no protective measures are taken, this number decreases to only 85 RIRS per year. At all measurement sites, significant correlations were observed between the radiation exposure dose and stone numbers and Hounsfield unit values. In conclusion, it is imperative that urologists wear protective gear. Greater effort should be made to reduce radiation exposure when renal calculi have a large number of stones or large Hounsfield unit values."
https://openalex.org/W3138285868,"Amyloid β (Aβ) is a crucial component of drusen, the hallmark of the early stage of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and can cause retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell damage through activation of the inflammatory response. MicroRNAs play a critical role in inflammation. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of microRNAs on the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by Aβ remains poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that Aβ1-40-mediated RPE damage by inducing a decrease in endogenous miR-191-5p expression. This led to the upregulation of its target gene, C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ acts as a transcription factor for NLRP3, promotes its transcription, and upregulates the downstream inflammatory factors Caspase-1 and IL-1β. Correspondingly, overexpression of miR-191-5p alleviated RPE cell injury by suppressing inflammation. The present study elucidates a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our findings suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of miR-191-5p in Aβ1-40-induced RPE impairment, shedding light on novel preventive or therapeutic approaches for AMD-associated RPE impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3136680431,"Excess salt intake harms the brain health and cognitive functions, but whether a maternal high-salt diet (HSD) affects the brain development and neural plasticity of offspring remains unclear. Here, using a range of behavioral tests, we reported that the offspring of maternal HSD subjects exhibited short- and long-term memory deficits, especially in spatial memory in adulthood. Moreover, impairments in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus were observed in adult offspring by using in vivo electrophysiology. Consistently, the number of astrocytes but not neurons in the hippocampus of the offspring from the HSD group were significantly decreased, and ERK and AKT signaling pathways involved in neurodevelopment were highly activated only during juvenile. In addition, the expression of synaptic proteins decreased both in juvenile and adulthood, and this effect might be involved in synaptic dysfunction. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the maternal HSD might cause adult offspring synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. It is possibly due to the reduction of astrocytes in juvenile."
https://openalex.org/W3137409545,"Pyrolysis has gained a strong interest in recent times for sustainable treatment and recovery of energy-rich products from different wastes including plastic. Waste plastic pyrolytic char (PPC) generated as a carbonaceous by-product in the pyrolysis process, is gaining attention as an asphalt binder modifier. Adequate thermal storage stability is an essential requirement for a modified asphalt binder to ensure that the composite offers integrity and homogeneous properties during its storage, handling and transportation in the field. The objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize the thermal storage stability properties of PPC modified binders. PPC modified asphalt binders were fabricated and evaluated at multiple dosages of sulfur as a cross-linking agent. In addition to the conventionally used softening point difference (SPD), characterization of thermal storage stability was attempted using rheology-based separation indices (SIs) derived through temperature sweep, frequency sweep, and multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR) tests. These rheological SIs were based on complex modulus (G*), Superpave rutting parameter (G*/sin δ), Shenoy rutting parameter (SRP), zero shear viscosity (ZSV), and MSCR J nr (at three stress levels 0.1, 3.2 and 10 kPa). Two formulations of each rheology-based separation index were studied: (1) ratio, and (2) maximum-average difference formulations. The temperature and frequency dependencies of rheological SIs were also evaluated. Further, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize storage stability by comparing the chemical functionalities of the PPC modified binders. A 0.3% dosage of sulfur was found to produce the best results considering all SPD, rheology-based SIs and FTIR. Principal component analysis showed that the ratio and maximum-average formulations had similar contributions to the first principal component accounting for more than 99% of the variability."
https://openalex.org/W3137831765,"Lactococcus lactis strains are important components in industrial starter cultures for cheese manufacturing. They have many strain-dependent properties, which affect the final product. Here, we explored the use of machine learning to create systematic, high-throughput screening methods for these properties. Fast acidification of milk is such a strain-dependent property. To predict the maximum hourly acidification rate (V max ), we trained Random Forest (RF) models on four different genomic representations: Presence/absence of gene families, counts of Pfam domains, the 8 nucleotide long subsequences of their DNA (8-mers), and the 9 nucleotide long subsequences of their DNA (9-mers). V max was measured at different temperatures, volumes, and in the presence or absence of yeast extract. These conditions were added as features in each RF model. The four models were trained on 257 strains, and the correlation between the measured V max and the predicted V max was evaluated with Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PC) on a separate dataset of 85 strains. The models all had high PC scores: 0.83 (gene presence/absence model), 0.84 (Pfam domain model), 0.76 (8-mer model), and 0.85 (9-mer model). The models all based their predictions on relevant genetic features and showed consensus on systems for lactose metabolism, degradation of casein, and pH stress response. Each model also predicted a set of features not found by the other models."

However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in liver I/R injury. Therefore, the study of miRNAs function will contribute a new biological marker diagnosis of liver I/R injury. This study aims to evaluate effects of miR-497-5p in liver I/R injury in mice. The related regulatory factors of miR-497-5p in liver I/R injury were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Vascular occlusion was performed to establish the liver I/R injury animal models. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) was performed to establish the in vitro models. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was conducted to assess liver injury. The inflammatory factors were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry was adopted to assess the cell apoptosis. The expression of miR-497b-5p was increased in liver I/R injury. Knockdown of miR-497b-5p inhibited the production of inflammatory factors and cell apoptosis. Overexpression of mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) inhibited cell apoptosis to alleviate liver I/R injury. miR-497b-5p could activate the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway by inhibiting the MED1/TIMP-2 axis to promote liver I/R injury.

In this study, we investigated the pathophysiological roles of 5,6-DiHETE in murine colitis and its underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on the effects on transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel activity. Oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 2%, for 4 days) caused colon inflammation, which peaked on day 7 and gradually declined by day 18. 5,6-DiHETE concentration in colon tissue was significantly increased during the healing phase of colitis (days 9 to 18). In vitro study showed that pretreatment with 5,6-DiHETE (0.1-1 μM, 30 minutes) significantly inhibited endothelial barrier disruption induced by a TRPV4 agonist (GSK1016790A, 50 nM). Intracellular Ca2+ imaging also showed that pretreatment with 5,6-DiHETE (1 μM, 10 minutes) reduced GSK1016790A-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase in HEK293T cells overexpressing TRPV4. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of 5,6-DiHETE (50 µg kg−1 day−1) during the healing phase accelerated the recovery from DSS-induced colitis. Pathological studies showed that the administration of 5,6-DiHETE inhibited edema formation and leukocyte infiltration in inflamed colon tissue. In conclusion, we identified 5,6-DiHETE as a novel endogenous TRPV4 antagonist, and we also demonstrated that its administration promotes the healing of colitis by inhibiting inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W3136795285,"Hyperandrogenism is the main characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome, which affects placental function and fetal growth, and leads to reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in female offspring. Adiponectin acts on the placenta and may exert endocrine effects on the developing fetus. This study aims to investigate if maternal and/or fetal adiponectin can prevent metabolic and reproductive dysfunction in prenatal androgenized (PNA) female offspring. Adiponectin transgenic (APNtg) and wild-type dams received dihydrotestosterone/vehicle injections between gestational days 16.5-18.5 to induce PNA offspring, which were followed for 4 months. Offspring from APNtg dams were smaller than offspring from wild-type dams, independent of genotype. Insulin sensitivity was higher in wild-type mice from APNtg dams compared to wild-types from wild-type dams, and insulin sensitivity correlated with fat mass and adipocyte size. PNA increased visceral fat% and adipocyte size in wild-type offspring from wild-type dams, while wild-type and APNtg offspring from APNtg dams were protected against this effect. APNtg mice had smaller adipocytes than wild-types and this morphology was associated with an increased expression of genes regulating adipogenesis (Ppard, Pparg, Cebpa, and Cebpb) and metabolism (Chrebp and Lpl). Anogenital distance was increased in all PNA-exposed wild-type offspring, but there was no increase in PNA APNtg offspring, suggesting that adiponectin overexpression protects against this effect. In conclusion, elevated adiponectin levels in utero improve insulin sensitivity, reduce body weight and fat mass gain in the adult offspring and protect against PNA-induced visceral adiposity. In conclusion, these data suggest that PNA offspring benefit from prenatal adiponectin supplementation."

Genetic selection for resistant animals is a potential sustainable control strategy. Advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of several molecular genetic markers associated with genes affecting economic relevant traits. In this study, the variants in the genome of Creole goats resistant or susceptible to GIN were discovered from RNA-sequencing. We identified SNPs, insertions and deletions that distinguish the two genotypes, resistant and susceptible and we characterized these variants through functional analysis. The T cell receptor signalling pathway was one of the top significant pathways that distinguish the resistant from the susceptible genotype with 78% of the genes involved in this pathway showing genomic variants. These genomic variants are expected to provide useful resources especially for molecular breeding for GIN resistance in goats."
https://openalex.org/W3137828929,"The gut microbiota contributes to shaping efficient and safe immune defenses in the gut. However, little is known about the role of the gut and/or lung microbiota in the education of pulmonary innate immune responses. Here, we tested whether the endogenous microbiota in general can modulate the reactivity of pulmonary tissue to pathogen stimuli by comparing the response of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice. Thus, we observed earlier and greater inflammation in the pulmonary compartment of GF mice than that of SPF mice after intranasal instillation to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was more abundantly expressed in the lungs of GF mice than those of SPF mice at steady state, which could predispose the innate immunity of GF mice to strongly react to the environmental stimuli. Lung explants were stimulated with different TLR agonists or infected with the human airways pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), resulting in greater inflammation under almost all conditions for the GF explants. Finally, alveolar macrophages (AM) from GF mice presented a higher innate immune response upon RSV infection than those of SPF mice. Overall, these data suggest that the presence of microbiota in SPF mice induced a process of innate immune tolerance in the lungs by a mechanism which remains to be elucidated. Our study represents a step forward to establishing the link between the microbiota and the immune reactivity of the lungs."

We here performed a retrospective study in order to develop prediction models for spherical and cylinder refraction in children. The enrolled 1221 eyes of 617 children were divided into three groups: the development group (710 eyes of 359 children), the validation group (385 eyes of 194 children), and the comparison group (126 eyes of 64 children). We determined noncycloplegic and cycloplegic refraction values by autorefractometry. In addition, several noncycloplegic parameters were assessed with the use of ocular biometry. On the basis of the information obtained from the development group, we developed prediction models for cycloplegic spherical and cylinder refraction in children with the use of stepwise multiple regression analysis. The prediction formulas were validated by their application to the validation group. The similarity of noncycloplegic and predicted refraction to cycloplegic refraction in individual eyes was evaluated in the comparison group. Application of the developed prediction models for spherical and cylinder refraction to the validation group revealed that predicted refraction was significantly correlated with measured values for cycloplegic spherical refraction ( R = 0.961, P &lt; 0.001) or cylinder refraction ( R = 0.894, P &lt; 0.001). Comparison of noncycloplegic, cycloplegic, and predicted refraction in the comparison group revealed that cycloplegic spherical refraction did not differ significantly from predicted refraction but was significantly different from noncycloplegic refraction, whereas cycloplegic cylinder refraction did not differ significantly from predicted or noncycloplegic values. Our prediction models based on ocular biometry provide estimates of refraction in children similar to measured cycloplegic spherical and cylinder refraction values without the application of cycloplegic eyedrops."
https://openalex.org/W3139397572,"Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in many functions related to trafficking and remodeling of membranes and cytoskeleton dynamics. Mutations in the DNM2 gene cause the autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (AD-CNM), characterized mainly by muscle weakness and central nuclei. Several defects have been identified in the KI-Dnm2R465W/+ mouse model of the disease to explain the muscle phenotype, including reduction of the satellite cell pool in muscle, but the functional consequences of this depletion have not been characterized until now. Satellite cells (SC) are the main source for muscle growth and regeneration of mature tissue. Here, we investigated muscle regeneration in the KI-Dnm2R465W/+ mouse model for AD-CNM. We found a reduced number of Pax7-positive SCs, which were also less activated after induced muscle injury. The muscles of the KI-Dnm2R465W/+ mouse regenerated more slowly and less efficiently than wild-type ones, formed fewer new myofibers, and did not recover its normal mass 15 days after injury. Altogether, our data provide evidence that the muscle regeneration is impaired in the KI-Dnm2R465W/+ mouse and contribute with one more layer to the comprehension of the disease, by identifying a new pathomechanism linked to DNM2 mutations which may be involved in the muscle-specific impact occurring in AD-CNM."
https://openalex.org/W3135922248,"Background Ischemic stroke is a common and debilitating disease with limited treatment options. Protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is a fundamental cell signaling mediator in the central nervous system (CNS). It can be activated by many proteases including thrombin and plasmin, with various down-stream effects, following brain ischemia. Methods A permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAo) model was used in PAR1 KO and WT C57BL/6J male mice. Mice were evaluated for neurological deficits (neurological severity score, NSS), infarct volume (Tetrazolium Chloride, TTC), and for plasmin and thrombin activity in brain slices. Results Significantly low levels of plasmin and thrombin activities were found in PAR1 KO compared to WT (1.6±0.4 vs. 3.2±0.6 ng/μl, p&lt;0.05 and 17.2±1.0 vs. 21.2±1.0 mu/ml, p&lt;0.01, respectively) along with a decreased infarct volume (178.9±14.3, 134.4±13.3 mm 3 , p&lt;0.05). Conclusions PAR1 KO mice have smaller infarcts, with lower thrombin and plasmin activity levels. These findings may suggest that modulation of PAR1 is a potential target for future pharmacological treatment of ischemic stroke."

This study sought to validate the CSHM-Q using the Rasch measurement model. Methods 322 participants were recruited based on a convenience sampling method. The Rasch analysis was carried out using the RUMM2030 software. Results Local item dependency was accommodated using the ‘super item’ approach. Disordered thresholds were resolved by collapsing some response options. After modification, each component of the CSHM-Q showed acceptable overall fit, item and person fit, internal consistency, and targeting. Unidimensionality was supported at the subscale level. Items did not exhibit disordered threshold, local item dependency, or differential item functioning. Transforming tables were also created to help convert the raw score into an interval scale. Conclusions Results of the Rasch analysis supported the interval scale measurement properties of the CSHM-Q and offered health education researchers an instrument to measure emerging adults’ health motivation in the higher education context."
https://openalex.org/W3136777903,"The role of Sidt2 in the process of glucose and lipid metabolism has been recently reported. However, whether Sidt2 is involved in the metabolic regulation in skeletal muscle remains unknown. In this study, for the first time, using skeletal muscle-selective Sidt2 knockout mice, we found that Sidt2 was vital for the quality control of mitochondria in mouse skeletal muscle. These mice showed significantly reduced muscle tolerance and structurally abnormal mitochondria. Deletion of the Sidt2 gene resulted in decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion protein 2 (Mfn2) and Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC1-α). In addition, the clearance of damaged mitochondria in skeletal muscle was inhibited upon Sidt2 deletion, which was caused by blockade of autophagy flow. Mechanistically, the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes was compromised in Sidt2 knockout skeletal muscle cells. In summary, the deletion of the Sidt2 gene not only interfered with the quality control of mitochondria, but also inhibited the clearance of mitochondria and caused the accumulation of a large number of damaged mitochondria, ultimately leading to the abnormal structure and function of skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3138035523,"C57BL/6 laboratory mice usually show black coat color. We observed a dilute (gray) coat color phenotype in progenies of two C57BL/6 mice. This phenotype is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this naturally occurring phenotypic variation, we performed whole-genome sequencing (25×) on 10 offspring of the two founder mice. The whole-genome DNA sequencing and additional RNA-Seq data reveal that Myo5a is the gene responsible for the coat color dilution in C57BL/6 mice, and novel mutations in the Myo5a gene are likely causal. We further performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and showed increased expression of truncated Myo5a transcripts encoding dysfunctional proteins and decreased expression of Myo5a full-length transcripts encoding functional proteins in mutant individuals. The decrease in full-length messenger RNA abundance was accompanied by reduced Myo5a protein level and deficient melanosome transport, a potential mechanistic link between the Myo5a mutations and the dilute color phenotype. This study not only advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pigmentation in mice, but also provides a typical case of deciphering the molecular basis of phenotypic variation in mice by genomic analyses and subsequent functional work."
https://openalex.org/W3139335117,"The importance of cellular metabolic adaptation in inducing robust T cell responses is well established. However, the mechanism by which T cells link information regarding nutrient supply to clonal expansion and effector function is still enigmatic. Herein, we report that the metabolic sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical link between cellular energy demand and translational activity and, thus, orchestrates optimal expansion of T cells in vivo. AMPK deficiency did not affect T cell fate decision, activation, or T effector cell generation; however, the magnitude of T cell responses in murine in vivo models of T cell activation was markedly reduced. This impairment was global, as all T helper cell subsets were similarly sensitive to loss of AMPK which resulted in reduced T cell accumulation in peripheral organs and reduced disease severity in pathophysiologically as diverse models as T cell transfer colitis and allergic airway inflammation. T cell receptor repertoire analysis confirmed similar clonotype frequencies in different lymphoid organs, thereby supporting the concept of a quantitative impairment in clonal expansion rather than a skewed qualitative immune response. In line with these findings, in-depth metabolic analysis revealed a decrease in T cell oxidative metabolism, and gene set enrichment analysis indicated a major reduction in ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA translation in AMPK-deficient T cells. We, thus, provide evidence that through its interference with these delicate processes, AMPK orchestrates the quantitative, but not the qualitative, manifestation of primary T cell responses in vivo."

Achalasia has been associated with extraesophageal dysmotility, suggesting alterations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that extend beyond the esophagus. The purpose of the present contribution is to investigate whether achalasia may be interpreted as the esophageal manifestation of a more generalized disturbance of the ANS which includes alterations of heart rate and/or blood pressure. Therefore simultaneous non-invasive records of the heart inter-beat intervals (IBI) and beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 14 patients (9 female, 5 male) with achalasia were compared with the records of 34 rigorously screened healthy control subjects (17 female, 17 male) in three different conditions: supine, standing up, and controlled breathing at 0.1 Hz, using a variety of measures in the time and spectral domains. Significant differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) were observed which seem to be due to cardiovagal damage to the heart, i.e., a failure of the ANS, as expected according to our hypothesis. This non-invasive methodology can be employed as an auxiliary clinical protocol to study etiology and evolution of achalasia, and other pathologies that damage ANS."

Both Arf and Arl proteins cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms, where guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) regulate the exchange of GDP for GTP, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP. Human Arl1 is located at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and regulates the function and structure of the Golgi complex. However, neither GEFs nor GAPs for human Arl1 have been identified. Here, we report that ArfGAP1, an Arf1 GAP, can promote GTP hydrolysis of Arl1. We show that ArfGAP1 directly interacts with GTP-bound Arl1 and exhibits GAP activity toward Arl1 in vitro. Exogenous expression of ArfGAP1, but not ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, causes dissociation of endogenous Arl1 from the TGN. In addition, GAP activity-deficient ArfGAP1 fails to regulate the Golgi localization of Arl1. Using an activity pull-down assay, we demonstrated that ArfGAP1 regulates the levels of Arl1-GTP in cells expressing ArfGAP1-myc or with ArfGAP1 knockdown. Finally, we observed that, similar to expression of putative active Arl1 (Arl1QL), ArfGAP1 knockdown impairs endosome-to-TGN retrograde transport of the Shiga toxin B-subunit. Thus, our findings support the idea that ArfGAP1 acts as an Arl1 GAP to regulate the function of Arl1 in vesicle trafficking at the TGN."
https://openalex.org/W3135974394,"Introduction Serious bacterial neonatal infections are a major cause of global neonatal mortality. While hospitalized treatment is recommended, families cannot access inpatient treatment in low resource settings. Two parallel randomized control trials were conducted at five sites in three countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria) to compare the effectiveness of treatment with experimental regimens requiring fewer injections with a reference regimen A (injection gentamicin plus injection procaine penicillin both once daily for 7 days) on the outpatient basis provided to young infants (0–59 days) with signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when the referral was not feasible. Costs were estimated to quantify the financial implications of scaleup, and cost-effectiveness of these regimens. Methods Direct economic costs (including personnel, drugs and consumable costs) were estimated for identification, prenatal and postnatal visits, assessment, classification, treatment and follow-up. Data on time spent by providers on each activity was collected from 83% of providers. Indirect marginal financial costs were estimated for non-consumables/capital, training, transport, communication, administration and supervision by considering only a share of the total research and health system costs considered important for the program. Total economic costs (direct plus indirect) per young infant treated were estimated based on 39% of young infants enrolled in the trial during 2012 and the number of days each treated during one year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated using treatment failure after one week as the outcome indicator. Experimental regimens were compared to the reference regimen and pairwise comparisons were also made. Results The average costs of treating a young infant with clinical severe infection (a sub-category of PSBI) in 2012 was lowest with regimen D (injection gentamicin once daily for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin twice daily for 7 days) at US$ 20.9 (95% CI US$ 16.4–25.3) or US$ 32.5 (2018 prices). While all experimental regimens B (injection gentamicin once daily plus oral amoxicillin twice daily, both for 7 days), regimen C (once daily of injection gentamicin injection plus injection procaine penicillin for 2 days, thereafter oral amoxicillin twice daily for 5 days) and regimen D were found to be more cost-effective as compared with the reference regimen A; pairwise comparison showed regimen D was more cost-effective than B or C. For fast breathing, the average cost of treatment with regimen E (oral amoxicillin twice daily for 7 days) at US$ 18.3 (95% CI US$ 13.4–23.3) or US$ 29.0 (2018 prices) was more cost-effective than regimen A. Indirect costs were 32% of the total treatment costs. Conclusion Scaling up of outpatient treatment for PSBI when the referral is not feasible with fewer injections and oral antibiotics is cost-effective for young infants and can lead to increased access to treatment resulting in potential reductions in neonatal mortality. Clinical trial registration The trial was registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry under ID ACTRN 12610000286044 ."
https://openalex.org/W3136993545,"Obesity is common in the middle aged population and it increases the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and dementia. Yet, its etiology remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that ectopic expression of HB-EGF, an important regulator of neurogenesis, in Nestin+ neuroepithelial progenitors with the Cre-LoxP system leads to development of spontaneous middle age obesity in male mice accompanied by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The Nestin-HB-EGF mice show decreases in food uptake, energy expenditure, and physical activity, suggesting that reduced energy expenditure underlies the pathogenesis of this obesity model. However, HB-EGF expression in appetite-controlling POMC or AgRP neurons or adipocytes fails to induce obesity. Mechanistically, HB-EGF suppresses expression of Hypocretin/Orexin, an orexigenic neuropeptide hormone, in the hypothalamus of middle aged Nestin-HB-EGF mice. Hypothalamus Orexin administration alleviates the obese and hyperglycemic phenotypes in Nestin-HB-EGF mice. This study uncovers an important role for HB-EGF in regulating Orexin expression and energy expenditure and establishes a midlife obesity model whose pathogenesis involves age-dependent changes in hypothalamus neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3137008110,"Background NT-proBNP is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Little is known about the heritability and genetic variants associated with NT-proBNP. Therefore, we estimated the heritability of and examined genetic associations of SNPs in the BNP gene region with circulating NT-proBNP and prevalent CVD in 4,331 participants from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). Methods and results Genotypes of 10 SNPs from the NPPB and NPPA regions that encode BNP and A-type natriuretic peptide, respectively, were tested for association with NT-proBNP and prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors. We performed analyses using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis (SOLAR) program to account for family relatedness, and adjusted all models for age, sex, and field center. The mean age of the LLFS was 69.8 years (range 24–110) with 55.4% females. NT-proBNP was significantly heritable (h 2 = 0.21; P = 4x10 -14 ), and the minor alleles of rs632793 (p&lt;0.001) and rs41300100 (p = 0.05) were independently associated with higher serum NT-proBNP levels. Additionally, the minor allele of rs632793 was significantly and consistently associated with lower prevalent CVD, including blood pressures, independent of NT-proBNP level (all P&lt;0.05). Results for prevalent CVD, but not NT-proBNP levels, showed significant interaction by familial generation. Conclusion In this family-based study of subjects with exceptional longevity, we identified several allelic variants in the BNP gene region associated with NT-pro-BNP levels and prevalent CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3138244827,"Keloids are fibroproliferative dermal tumors of unknown origin that are characterized by the overabundant accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The mechanism of keloid formation has remained unclear because of a poor understanding of its molecular basis. In this study, the dermal ECM components of keloids were identified and the pathological features of keloid formation were characterized using large-scale quantitative proteomic analyses of decellularized keloid biomatrix scaffolds. We identified a total of 267 dermal core ECM and ECM-associated proteins that were differentially expressed between patients with keloids and healthy controls. Skin mechanical properties and biological processes including protease activity, wound healing, and adhesion were disordered in keloids. The integrated network analysis of the upregulated ECM proteins revealed multiple signaling pathways involved in these processes that may lead to keloid formation. Our findings may improve the scientific basis of keloid treatment and provide new ideas for the establishment of keloid models."
https://openalex.org/W3138491784,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are multipotent cells giving rise to all blood lineages during life. HSPCs emerge from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VDA) during a specific timespan in embryonic development through endothelial hematopoietic transition (EHT). We investigated the ontogeny of HSPCs in mutant zebrafish embryos lacking functional pten, an important tumor suppressor with a central role in cell signaling. Through in vivo live imaging, we discovered that in pten mutant embryos a proportion of the HSPCs died upon emergence from the VDA, an effect rescued by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Surprisingly, inhibition of PI3K in wild-type embryos also induced HSPC death. Surviving HSPCs colonized the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) normally and committed to all blood lineages. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that inhibition of PI3K enhanced survival of multipotent progenitors, whereas the number of HSPCs with more stem-like properties was reduced. At the end of the definitive wave, loss of Pten caused a shift to more restricted progenitors at the expense of HSPCs. We conclude that PI3K signaling tightly controls HSPCs survival and both up- and downregulation of PI3K signaling reduces stemness of HSPCs."
https://openalex.org/W3138576000,"Copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) are essential trace minerals for the reproduction, growth, and immunity of mammalian herbivore populations. We examined the relationships between Cu, Fe, and Zn in soils, common plants, and hepatic stores of two wild herbivores to assess the effects of weather, sex, and population density on the transfer of trace minerals from soils to mammals during the growing season. Soils, grasses, woody browse, hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were sampled across 19 sites. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Zn in grasses and browse species were not correlated with concentrations of those minerals in soils sampled from the same areas. Leaves of woody browse were higher in Cu, lower in Fe, and similar in Zn when compared with grasses. Available concentrations of soils were positively related to liver Cu and Zn in hispid cotton rats, which was consistent with the short lives and high productivity of these small mammals that rely on grass seed heads. Interactions between soil concentrations and weather also affected liver Cu and Fe in deer, which reflected the greater complexity of trophic transfers in large, long-lived, browsing herbivores. Population density was correlated with liver concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Zn in hispid cotton rats, and concentrations of Cu and Fe in deer. Liver Cu was < 5 mg/kg wet weight in at least 5% of animals at two of eight sites for hispid cotton rats and < 3.8 mg/kg wet weight in at least 5% of animals at three of 12 sites for deer, which could indicate regional limitation of Cu for populations of mammalian herbivores. Our data indicate that supplies of trace minerals may contribute to density dependence of herbivore populations. Local population density may therefore influence the prevalence of deficiency states and disease outbreak that exacerbate population cycles in wild mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3136072277,"The bearing-rotor system is prone to faults during operation, so it is necessary to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the bearing-rotor system to discuss the optimal structure of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in system fault detection and classification. The turbo expander is undertaken as the research object. Firstly, the hybrid magnetic bearing-rotor system is modeled into the form of four stiffness coefficients and four damping coefficients, so as to analyze and explain the dynamic characteristics of the system. Secondly, the ambient pressure is introduced to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the elastic foil gas bearing-rotor system based on the changes in the dynamic stiffness and dynamic damping of the gas bearing. Finally, the CNN is introduced to be applied in the detection of faults of bearing-rotor system through determining the parameters of the constructed CNN. The results show that the displacement of the rotor increases and the stiffness decreases with the acceleration of the speed of the electromagnetic bearing. The maximum displacement of the rotor can reach 135μm, and the maximum stiffness can be reduced to 35×10 5 N/m. Increase of ambient pressure causes enhancement of main stiffness of the gas bearing, and the main damping decreases accordingly. Analysis of the classification accuracy and loss function based on the CNN model shows that the convolution kernel size of 7*1 and the batch size of 128 can realize the best performance of CNN in fault classification. This provides a data support and reference for studying the dynamic characteristics of the bearing-rotor system and for the optimization of CNN structure in fault classification and detection."
https://openalex.org/W3137343707,"The small (18S) and large (28S) nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) introns have been researched and sequenced in a variety of ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa in this study, it is found that both 18S and 28S rDNA would contain introns and display some degree variation in size, nucleotide sequences and insertion positions within the same fungi species ( Meliniomyces ). Under investigations among the tested isolates, 18S rDNA has four sites for intron insertions, 28S rDNA has two sites for intron insertions. Both 18S and 28S rDNA introns among the tested isolates belong to group I introns with a set of secondary structure elements designated P1-P10 helics and loops. We found a 12 nt nucleotide sequences TACCACAGGGAT at site 2 in the 3’-end of 28S rDNA, site 2 introns just insert the upstream or the downstream of the12 nt nucleotide sequences. Afters sequence analysis of all 18S and 28S rDNA introns from tested isolates, three high conserved regions around 30 nt nucleotides (conserved 1, conserved 2, conserved 3) and identical nucleotides can be found. Conserved 1, conserved 2 and conserved 3 regions have high GC content, GC percentage is almost more than 60%. From our results, it seems that the more convenient host sites, intron sequences and secondary structures, or isolates for 18S and 28S rDNA intron insertion and deletion, the more popular they are. No matter 18S rDNA introns or 18S rDNA introns among tested isolates, complementary base pairing at the splicing sites in P1-IGS-P10 tertiary helix around 5’-end introns and exons were weak."
https://openalex.org/W3139502552,"Background Blood pressure measurement (BPM) is one of the most often performed procedures in clinical practice, but especially office BPM is prone to errors. Unattended automated office BPM (AOBPM) is somewhat standardised and observer-independent, but time and space consuming. We aimed to assess whether an AOBPM protocol can be abbreviated without losing accuracy. Design In our retrospective single centre study, we used all AOBPM (AOBPM protocol of the SPRINT study), collected over 14 months. Three sequential BPM (after 5 minutes of rest, spaced 2 minutes) were automatically recorded with the patient alone in a quiet room resulting in three systolic and diastolic values. We compared the mean of all three (RefProt) with the mean of the first two (ShortProtA) and the single first BPM (ShortProtB). Results We analysed 413 AOBPM sets from 210 patients. Mean age was 52±16 years. Mean values for RefProt were 128.3/81.3 mmHg, for ShortProtA 128.4/81.4 mmHg, for ShortProtB 128.8/81.4 mmHg. Mean difference and limits of agreement for RefProt vs. ShortProtA and ShortProtB were -0.1±4.2/-0.1±2.8 mmHg and -0.5±8.1/-0.1±5.3 mmHg, respectively. With ShortProtA, 83% of systolic and 92% of diastolic measurements were within 2 mmHg from RefProt (67/82% for ShortProtB). ShortProtA or ShortProtB led to no significant hypertensive reclassifications in comparison to RefProt (p-values 0.774/1.000/1.000/0.556). Conclusion Based on our results differences between the RefProt and ShortProtA are minimal and within acceptable limits of agreement. Therefore, the automated procedure may be shorted from 3 to 2 measurements, but a single measurement is insufficient."
https://openalex.org/W3137227789,"This paper analyzes the extent to which economic policy uncertainty affects presidential approval in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico). Using panel (time-series cross-sectional) estimation methods, we show that economic policy uncertainty has a negative impact on presidential approval in our sample. A one-standard-deviation increase in the level of economic uncertainty reduces presidential approval by approximately 12 percent. Our results are consistent with the political economy model of Alesina et al. (1993), which shows that voters are less likely to re-elect the incumbent when faced with uncertainty about economic policy. Incumbent competence signalling can exarcerbate this effect."
