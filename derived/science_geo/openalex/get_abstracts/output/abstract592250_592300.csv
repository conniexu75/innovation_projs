https://openalex.org/W2039616336,"The highly ordered crystal structure of crambin has been solved at 1.5 Å resolution directly from the diffraction data of a native crystal at a wavelength remote from the sulphur absorption edge. The molecule has three disulphide bridges among its 46 amino acid residues, of which 46% are in helices and 17% are in a β-sheet. Crambin is shown to be an amphipathic protein, inasmuch as its six charged groups are segregated from hydrophobic surface elements. Phasing methods used here will also apply elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2741961591,"The human body carries vast communities of microbes that provide many benefits. Our microbiome is complex and challenging to understand, but evolutionary theory provides a universal framework with which to analyse its biology and health impacts. Here we argue that to understand a given microbiome feature, such as colonization resistance, host nutrition or immune development, we must consider how hosts and symbionts evolve. Symbionts commonly evolve to compete within the host ecosystem, while hosts evolve to keep the ecosystem on a leash. We suggest that the health benefits of the microbiome should be understood, and studied, as an interplay between microbial competition and host control. The human microbiome is a tension between microbes evolving to compete within the host ecosystem, and hosts trying to keep them under control. The microbial communities that inhabit the human body provide several benefits to their host, but the evolutionary basis of this complex relationship is unclear. In this Perspective, Kevin Foster and colleagues propose an evolutionary framework for understanding the dynamics of the microbiome. They argue that, in order to understand the microbiome and harness it for health benefits, we need to view the relationship between host and symbiont as one based on microbial competition and host control."

However, the biological function and therapeutic potential of the majority of the 500+ human protein kinases remains unknown. We have developed physical and virtual collections of small molecule inhibitors, which we call chemogenomic sets, that are designed to inhibit the catalytic function of almost half the human protein kinases. In this manuscript we share our progress towards generation of a comprehensive kinase chemogenomic set (KCGS), release kinome profiling data of a large inhibitor set (Published Kinase Inhibitor Set 2 (PKIS2)), and outline a process through which the community can openly collaborate to create a KCGS that probes the full complement of human protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2611244208,"Amyloid beta peptides (A\b{eta}), implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD), interact with the cellular membrane and induce amyloid toxicity. The composition of cellular membranes changes in aging and AD. We designed multi component lipid models to mimic healthy and diseased states of the neuronal membrane. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and black lipid membrane (BLM) techniques, we demonstrated that these model membranes differ in their nanoscale structure and physical properties, and interact differently with A\b{eta}. Based on our data, we propose a new hypothesis that changes in lipid membrane due to aging and AD may trigger amyloid toxicity through electrostatic mechanisms, similar to the accepted mechanism of antimicrobial peptide action. Understanding the role of the membrane changes as a key activating amyloid toxicity may aid in the development of a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2741628467,"In the US, there are more than 163 million dogs and cats that consume, as a significant portion of their diet, animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint. Here, the energy and animal-derived product consumption of these pets in the US is evaluated for the first time, as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them, including feces production. In the US, dogs and cats consume about 19% ± 2% of the amount of dietary energy that humans do (203 ± 15 PJ yr-1 vs. 1051 ± 9 PJ yr-1) and 33% ± 9% of the animal-derived energy (67 ± 17 PJ yr-1 vs. 206 ± 2 PJ yr-1). They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans (5.1 ± Tg yr-1 vs. 17.2 Tg yr-1), and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the environmental impacts from animal production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO2-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but the tradition of pet ownership in the US has considerable costs. As pet ownership increases in some developing countries, especially China, and trends continue in pet food toward higher content and quality of meat, globally, pet ownership will compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices. Reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership, perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar health and emotional benefits would considerably reduce these impacts. Simultaneous industry-wide efforts to reduce overfeeding, reduce waste, and find alternative sources of protein will also reduce these impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2740103085,"Background Adverse effects of spaceflight on sensorimotor function have been linked to altered somatosensory and vestibular inputs in the microgravity environment. Whether these spaceflight sequelae have a central nervous system component is unknown. However, experimental studies have shown spaceflight-induced brain structural changes in rodents’ sensorimotor brain regions. Understanding the neural correlates of spaceflight-related motor performance changes is important to ultimately develop tailored countermeasures that ensure mission success and astronauts’ health. Method Head down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) can serve as a microgravity analog because it mimics body unloading and headward fluid shifts of microgravity. We conducted a 70-day 6° HDBR study with 18 right-handed males to investigate how microgravity affects focal gray matter (GM) brain volume. MRI data were collected at 7 time points before, during and post-HDBR. Standing balance and functional mobility were measured pre and post-HDBR. The same metrics were obtained at 4 time points over ~90 days from 12 control subjects, serving as reference data. Results HDBR resulted in widespread increases GM in posterior parietal regions and decreases in frontal areas; recovery was not yet complete by 12 days post-HDBR. Additionally, HDBR led to balance and locomotor performance declines. Increases in a cluster comprising the precuneus, precentral and postcentral gyrus GM correlated with less deterioration or even improvement in standing balance. This association did not survive Bonferroni correction and should therefore be interpreted with caution. No brain or behavior changes were observed in control subjects. Conclusions Our results parallel the sensorimotor deficits that astronauts experience post-flight. The widespread GM changes could reflect fluid redistribution. Additionally, the association between focal GM increase and balance changes suggests that HDBR also may result in neuroplastic adaptation. Future studies are warranted to determine causality and underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2740849589,"In terms of tillering potential, the aboveground portions of rice are significantly influenced by the nitrogen level (NL) and transplant density (TD). To obtain a suitable combination of NL and TD, five NLs (0, 90, 180, 270 and 360 kg ha-1) and two TDs [high density (HD), 32.5×104 hills ha-1; low density (LD), 25.5×104 hills ha-1] were used in the rice experiments during 2012 to 2014, in Jiangsu, China. The results showed the highest grain yield of rice obtained at HD and LD when N supply was 180 and 270 kg ha-1, respectively. That’s because there are more tillers per unit area, a larger leaf biomass fraction of total aboveground biomass, a larger leaf area index (LAI) and a larger canopy photosynthesis potential (CPP) at HD. It can be concluded that, higher rice planting densities resulted in less N inputs, while more N is needed to improve single plant actual tiller ability under low density to offset the reduced planting density. When the NL was more than 180 kg ha-1, the actual tillering ability of a single plant at LD was 20% more than that at HD. Based on these results, the supply of 1 kg N can be replaced by adding approximately 1000 planting hills per hectare. Therefore, adjusting the transplant density could be an efficient method to reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer and increase the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency, which is very conducive to the sustainable development of agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2740579141,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are hallmarks of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. The specialized proresolving lipid mediator maresin 1 (MaR1) preserves tissue homeostasis by exerting cytoprotective actions, dampening inflammation, and expediting its timely resolution. Here, we explored whether MaR1 protects liver cells from lipotoxic and hypoxia-induced ER stress. Mice were rendered obese by high-fat diet feeding, and experiments were performed in primary hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs). Palmitate-induced lipotoxicity increased ER stress and altered autophagy in hepatocytes, effects that were prevented by MaR1. MaR1 protected hepatocytes against lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis by activating the UPR prosurvival mechanisms and preventing the excessive up-regulation of proapoptotic pathways. Protective MaR1 effects were also seen in hepatocytes challenged with hypoxia and TNF-α-induced cell death. High-throughput microRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed that MaR1 actions were associated with specific miRNA signatures targeting both protein folding and apoptosis. MaR1 also prevented lipotoxic-triggered ER stress and hypoxia-induced inflammation in PCLSs and enhanced Kupffer cell phagocytic capacity. Together, these findings describe the ability of MaR1 to oppose ER stress in liver cells under conditions frequently encountered in NAFLD.-Rius, B., Duran-Güell, M., Flores-Costa, R., López-Vicario, C., Lopategi, A., Alcaraz-Quiles, J., Casulleras, M., Lozano, J.

https://openalex.org/W2739723356,"Natural killer (NK) cells are critical in immune defense against infected, stressed or transformed cells. Their function is regulated by the heterogeneous expression of a wide array of surface receptors that shape its phenotypic diversity. Although NK cells develop in the bone marrow and secondary lymphoid tissues, substantive differentiation is apparent in the peripheral blood including known age-related variation. In order to gain greater insight into phenotypic and functional variation within peripheral blood NK cells across age groups, we used multi-parametric, polyfunctional flow cytometry to interrogate the NK cell variability in 20 healthy adults and 15 5-10, 11-15 and 16-20 year-old children. We found that the normative ranges in both adults and children displayed great inter-individual variation for most markers. While the expression of several receptors did not differ, among those that did, the majority of the differences existed between adults and the three pediatric groups, rather than among children of different ages. Interestingly, we also identified variation in the individual expression of some markers by sex and ethnicity. Combinatorial analysis of NK cell receptors revealed intermediate subsets between the CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells. Furthermore, on examining the NK cell diversity by age, adults were discovered to have the lowest developmental diversity. Thus, our findings identify previously unappreciated NK cell subsets potentially distinguishing children from adults and suggest functional correlates that may have relevance in age-specific host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2740060734,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on retarding the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in a type 2 diabetic animal model, db/db mice. Eight-week-old male db/db diabetic mice and their nondiabetic littermate control db/m mice were used in the present study. AS-IV was administered to the db/db mice by adding it to standard feed at a dose of 1g/kg for 12 weeks. Renal injury was assessed by urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and Periodic acid-Schiff staining. The protein expression levels of mitochondrial quality-control-associated proteins were evaluated using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining analysis. At the end of the experiment, db/db mice showed overt renal injury, as evidenced by increased UAE, increased urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), expansion of mesangial matrix, and increased renal tubular area. AS-IV administration significantly reduced UAE and urinary NAG and ameliorated the renal pathologic injury seen in db/db mice. Furthermore, the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1), mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis-1), and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main regulators of mitochondrial fission, was significantly increased in db/db mice. Moreover, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy was abnormally activated in db/db mice. AS-IV significantly reduced renal Drp-1, Fis-1, and MFF expression and downregulated PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in db/db mice. However, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion-associated protein levels were not significantly different between db/m and db/db mice in our study, with or without AS-IV treatment. In conclusion, administration of AS-IV could retard DN progression in type 2 diabetes mice, which might be associated with restoration of the mitochondrial quality control network."
https://openalex.org/W2741748366,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are Ca2+-permeant, ligand-gated ion channels activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and have well-characterized roles in the nervous system. The expression and function of NMDARs in pancreatic β-cells, by contrast, are poorly understood. Here, we report a novel function of NMDARs in β-cells. Using a combination of biochemistry, electrophysiology, and imaging techniques, we now show that NMDARs have a key role in mediating the effect of leptin to modulate β-cell electrical activity by promoting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent trafficking of KATP and Kv2.1 channels to the plasma membrane. Blocking NMDAR activity inhibited the ability of leptin to activate AMPK, induce KATP and Kv2.1 channel trafficking, and promote membrane hyperpolarization. Conversely, activation of NMDARs mimicked the effect of leptin, causing Ca2+ influx, AMPK activation, and increased trafficking of KATP and Kv2.1 channels to the plasma membrane, and triggered membrane hyperpolarization. Moreover, leptin potentiated NMDAR currents and triggered NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx. Importantly, NMDAR-mediated signaling was observed in rat insulinoma 832/13 cells and in human β-cells, indicating that this pathway is conserved across species. The ability of NMDARs to regulate potassium channel surface expression and thus, β-cell excitability provides mechanistic insight into the recently reported insulinotropic effects of NMDAR antagonists and therefore highlights the therapeutic potential of these drugs in managing type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2740662926,"Cell- and tissue-specific actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in macrophages is essential for cardiac healing after myocardial infarction. Compared with GRflox (wild-type controls), GRLysMCre mice that lacked GR in myeloid cells showed increased acute mortality as a result of cardiac rupture. Seven days after left coronary artery ligation, GRLysMCre mice exhibited worse cardiac function and adverse remodeling associated with impaired scar formation and angiogenic response to ischemic injury. Inactivation of GR altered the functional differentiation/maturation of monocyte-derived macrophages in the infarcted myocardium. Mechanistically, CD45+/CD11b+/Ly6G-/F4/80+ macrophages isolated from GRLysMCre infarcts showed deregulation of factors that control inflammation, neovascularization, collagen degradation, and scar tissue formation. Moreover, we demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts sorted from the ischemic myocardium of GRLysMCre mice compared with cells isolated from injured GRflox hearts displayed higher matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression, and we provide evidence that the macrophage GR regulates myofibroblast differentiation in the infarct microenvironment during the early phase of wound healing. In summary, GR signaling in macrophages, playing a crucial role in tissue-repairing mechanisms, could be a potential therapeutic target during wound healing after ischemic myocardial injury.-Galuppo, P., Vettorazzi, S., Hövelmann, J., Scholz, C.-J., Tuckermann, J.

https://openalex.org/W2742032935,"Due to the impelling urgency of plant conservation and the increasing availability of high resolution spatially interpolated (e.g. climate variables) and categorical data (e.g. land cover and vegetation type), many recent studies have examined relationships among plant species distributions and a diversified set of explanatory factors; nevertheless, global and regional patterns of endemic plant richness remain in many cases unexplained. One such pattern is the 294 endemic vascular plant taxa recorded on a 1 km resolution grid on the environmentally heterogeneous island of Sardinia. Sixteen predictors, including topographic, geological, climatic and anthropogenic factors, were used to model local (number of taxa inside each 1 km grid cell) Endemic Vascular Plant Richness (EVPR). Generalized Linear Models were used to evaluate how each factor affected the distribution of local EVPR. Significant relationships with local EVPR and topographic, geological, climatic and anthropogenic factors were found. In particular, elevation explained the larger fraction of variation in endemic richness but other environmental factors (e.g. precipitation seasonality and slope) and human-related factors (e.g. the Human Influence Index (HII) and the proportion of anthropogenic land uses) were, respectively, positively and negatively correlated with local EVPR. Regional EVPR (number of endemic taxa inside each 100 m elevation interval) was also measured to compare local and regional EVPR patterns along the elevation gradient. In contrast to local, regional EVPR tended to decrease with altitude partly due to the decreasing area covered along altitude. The contrasting results between local and regional patterns suggest that local richness increases as a result of increased interspecific aggregation along altitude, whereas regional richness may depend on the interaction between area and altitude. This suggests that the shape and magnitude of the species-area relationship might vary with elevation. This work provides—for the first time in Sardinia—a comprehensive analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the pattern of EVPR in the entire territory, from sea level to the highest peaks. Elevation, as well as other environmental and human-related variables, were confirmed to be influencing factors. In addition, variations of EVPR patterns at regional-to-local spatial scales inspire next investigations on the possible interaction between elevation and area in explaining patterns of plant species richness."
https://openalex.org/W2740192234,"Deep space travel exposes astronauts to extended periods of space radiation and mechanical unloading, both of which may induce significant muscle and bone loss. Astronauts are exposed to space radiation from solar particle events (SPE) and background radiation referred to as galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). To explore interactions between skeletal muscle and bone under these conditions, we hypothesized that decreased mechanical load, as in the microgravity of space, would lead to increased susceptibility to space radiation-induced bone and muscle loss. We evaluated changes in bone and muscle of mice exposed to hind limb suspension (HLS) unloading alone or in addition to proton and high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) (16O) radiation. Adult male C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to six groups: No radiation ± HLS, 50 cGy proton radiation ± HLS, and 50 cGy proton radiation + 10 cGy 16O radiation ± HLS. Radiation alone did not induce bone or muscle loss, whereas HLS alone resulted in both bone and muscle loss. Absolute trabecular and cortical bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was decreased 24% and 6% in HLS-no radiation vs the normally loaded no-radiation group. Trabecular thickness and mineral density also decreased with HLS. For some outcomes, such as BV/TV, trabecular number and tissue mineral density, additional bone loss was observed in the HLS+proton+HZE radiation group compared to HLS alone. In contrast, whereas HLS alone decreased muscle mass (19% gastrocnemius, 35% quadriceps), protein synthesis, and increased proteasome activity, radiation did not exacerbate these catabolic outcomes. Our results suggest that combining simulated space radiation with HLS results in additional bone loss that may not be experienced by muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2741336716,"Iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that modulate metazoan iron metabolism. Multiple mechanisms are employed to control the action of IRP1 in dictating changes in the uptake and metabolic fate of iron. Inactivation of IRP1 RNA binding by iron primarily involves insertion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster by the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) system, converting it into cytosolic aconitase (c-acon), but can also involve iron-mediated degradation of IRP1 by the E3 ligase FBXL5 that also targets IRP2. How CIA and FBXL5 collaborate to maintain cellular iron homeostasis through IRP1 and other pathways is poorly understood. Because impaired Fe-S cluster biogenesis associates with human disease, we determined the importance of FBXL5 for regulating IRP1 when CIA is impaired. Suppression of FBXL5 expression coupled with induction of an IRP1 mutant (IRP13C>3S) that cannot insert the Fe-S cluster, or along with knockdown of the CIA factors NUBP2 or FAM96A, reduced cell viability. Iron supplementation reversed this growth defect and was associated with FBXL5-dependent polyubiquitination of IRP1. Phosphorylation of IRP1 at Ser-138 increased when CIA was inhibited and was required for iron rescue. Impaired CIA activity, as noted by reduced c-acon activity, was associated with enhanced FBXL5 expression and a concomitant reduction in IRP1 and IRP2 protein level and RNA-binding activity. Conversely, expression of either IRP induced FBXL5 protein level, demonstrating a negative feedback loop limiting excessive accumulation of iron-response element RNA-binding activity, whose disruption reduces cell growth. We conclude that a regulatory circuit involving FBXL5 and CIA acts through both IRPs to control iron metabolism and promote optimal cell growth."

Asthma and rhinitis are chronic widespread heterogeneous conditions. Asthma is characterized by difficulty breathing, wheezing, and cough, whereas symptoms of rhinitis include a running and itchy nose and tearing eyes. Environmental allergens are associated and shared between these two conditions. An important source of allergen is the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and a prominent allergen from the mite is the cysteine protease, Der p1 (1Kauffman H.F. Tamm M. Timmerman J.A.

Here we determine that Der p1 can activate distinct members of the Mrgpr family and identify the N-terminal amino acids in Mrgprs required for cleavage, that N-terminal peptides can activate certain Mrgprs and PARs, and that Der p1 activation of a Mrgpr induces the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Taken together, these data support the possibility that the house dust mite allergen Der p1 may contribute to inflammation through activation of Mrgprs. Because Der p1 is an allergen, we first asked whether it could activate any of the human or mouse Mrgprs associated with allergy or itch. To address this question, we used ratiometric calcium imaging to determine whether Der p1 could activate heterologous cells that had been transfected with cDNAs encoding the human Mrgprs X1–X4 or the relevant mouse Mrgprs. The only Mrgprs activated by Der p1 were the human receptor MRGPRX1 and the mouse receptors MrgprC11 and MrgprA3. These receptors have each been linked to itch but not previously to allergy. Der p1 was also found to activate human PAR2 (Fig. 1). Receptor activation was blocked in all cases by E-64, an established irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases. This result establishes that protease activity was necessary for receptor activation. The data for each receptor are shown in Table 1.Table 1Activation of PAR2 and Mrgprs by Der p1 and Der f1GPCRDer p1 2Der f1 2μmμmPAR2++MRGPRX1++MRGPRX2−−MRGPRX3−−MRGPRX4−−MrgprC11+−MrgprA1−−MrgprA2−−MrgprA3+−MrgprA4−−MrgprA9−−MrgprB2−−MrgprB4−−MrgprB5−− Open table in a new tab We next sought to determine the cleavage sites associated with receptor activation by Der p1. Attention was directed to MRGPRX1 because it was the only human receptor that was activated by Der p1. Attention was also directed to the mouse receptor MrgprC11 because it was activated by Der p1 and is also activated by SLIGRL, the tethered ligand and hexapeptide ligand for PAR2. PAR2 served as a positive control. The N-terminal peptides of MRGPRX1, MrgprC11, and PAR2 were synthesized and incubated with Der p1, and the sequences of the resultant series of cleavage products were obtained via MS/MS arranged in descending order of ion abundance (Fig. 2). It is appreciated that strict quantitative conclusions cannot be drawn from this approach, but the findings establish sites of cleavage. To account for the peptides identified by MS/MS in order of abundance, the major sites for Der p1 cleavage of the N terminus of MRGPRX1 were after Glu11, Leu22, and Asp2, respectively, as indicated below by the double arrows. These sites were followed by cleavage before Asp2, Leu8, and Leu12, as indicated by the regular arrows: 1M↓D⇓PTIST↓LDTE⇓↓LTPINGTEETL⇓CYKQTLSL30. The preferred site for Der p1 cleavage of the N-terminal peptide of MGRPRX1 was deduced to be between Glu11 and Leu12. Both double and regular arrows are noted at this site to account for the two most abundant peptides and the less abundant peptides 6–8. In contrast, the peptides TPINGTEET, TPINGTE, and TPINGTEE result from cleavage after Leu12, but because these peptides were not abundant, no arrow is included after Leu12. The major sites for cleavage of the N terminus of MrgprC11 occurred after Asp2, Glu11, and Glu17 as indicated below by the bold arrows. These were followed by cleavage before Asp2 and before and after Ser12, as indicated by the regular arrows: 1M↓D⇓PTISSHDTE⇓↓S↓TPLNE⇓TGHPNCTPILTLS30. Der p1 cleavage of the N terminus of PAR2 resulted in several peptides associated with pairs of internal cleavage sites. These are identified as Lys14/Gly23, Gly8/Gly23, and Ser6/Gly23 indicated below by the bold arrows. These were followed by Arg9/Gly23, Lys14, and Lys7/Gly23 as indicated by the regular arrows: 1GTNRSS⇓↓KG⇓R↓SLIGK↓⇓VDGTSHVTG⇓KGVT27. We next asked whether hexapeptides (and a nonapeptide in one case) derived from Der p1 cleavage of the N termini of MRGPRX1, MrgprC11, or PAR2 could activate receptors in either a cis or trans fashion (summarized in Table 2). The reason to consider the possibility of cis or trans activation is that SLIGRL, the hexapeptide derived from mouse PAR2, activates both human and mouse PAR2 (cis) and human MRGPRX2 and mouse MrgprC11 (trans) (3Reddy V.B. Sun S. Azimi E. Elmariah S.B. Dong X. Lerner E.A. Redefining the concept of protease-activated receptors: cathepsin S evokes itch via activation of Mrgprs.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but not other Mrgprs.Table 2Peptide activities on PAR2, MRGPRX1, MrgprC11, and MRGPRX2. Peptides are color-coded with respect to the receptor from which they were derived and were tested on all of the receptors Open table in a new tab Der p1 cleavage of the PAR2 N terminus did not generate the conventional hexapeptide SLIGKV (the human ortholog of the mouse hexapeptide SLIGRL). However, from the data on relative ion abundance in Fig. 2, the hexapeptides VDGTSH, RSLIGK, and KGRSLI were synthesized. We asked whether these peptides could activate Mrgprs or PAR2. VDGTSH did not activate PAR2, MRGPRX1, MRGPRX2, or MrgprC11 (Fig. 3a). To address the possibility that the full-length and relatively most abundant cleavage product VDGTSHVTG might activate a receptor, this nonapeptide was synthesized. No activity was found (not shown). In contrast, RSLIGK activated both PAR2 (at 10 μm) and MRGPRX2 (at 50 μm) akin to previous findings with SLIGRL. However, RSLIGK failed to activate MrgprC11, which is in contrast to the overlapping hexapeptide SLIGRL, and RSLIGK did not activate MRGPRX1, even at 100 μm (Fig. 3a). KGRSLI had no activity on the receptors. SLIGKV and RSLIGK activated PAR2 and MRGPRX2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). Hexapeptides associated with N-terminal cleavage products of MRGPRX1 and MrgprC11 by Der p1 were also synthesized and evaluated for their capacity to activate Mrgprs and PAR2. These peptides were PTISTL, LTPING, and CYKQTL from MRGPRX1 and PTISSH, STPLNE, and TGHPNC from MrgprC11. Only CYKQTL had activity, and this activity was in a trans fashion on MRGPRX2. CYKQTL failed to activate its parent MRGPRX1 and either MrgprC11 or PAR2 (Fig. 4). The results are summarized in Table 2. In an effort to complement the cleavage studies and to determine the importance of the relevant residues with respect to cleavage by Der p1, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert selected residues to histidine. Histidine was selected because it is one of the least preferred amino acids associated with Der p1 activity. The amino acids Asp2, Glu11, and Leu22 in the N terminus of MRGPRX1 associated with cleavage by Der p1 are at the P1 position and were converted individually to His. The N-terminal residues Asp2, Glu11, and Glu17 of MrgprC11 at the P1 position of Der p1 cleavage were also altered to His. Similarly, the PAR2 N-terminal amino acids Gly8 and Gly23 in the P1 position and Gly13 in the P2 position were changed to His. Lys14 was not considered for mutagenesis because Der p1 does not prefer Lys in the P1 position. When tested for receptor activation, Der p1 failed to activate the mutant receptors MRGPRX1E11H, MRGPRX1L22H, MrgprC11E11H, MrgprC11E17H, PAR2G8H, and PAR2G13H. However, Der p1 activated the remaining mutants MRGPRX1D2H, MrgprC11D2H, and PAR2G23H (Fig. 4). The results reveal that Asp in the second position of the N termini of MRGPRX1 and MrgprC11 are not crucial for Der p1 cleavage because receptor activity was maintained following site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast, residues Glu11 and Leu22 in MRGPRX1 and Glu11 and Glu17 in mMrgprC11 were important for receptor function as the mutant receptors lost activity. Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis of glycines 8 and 13 resulted in loss of activity to Der p1. Finally, Gly23 in the P1 position was common for Der p1 cleavage; this residue was not found to be important for activation of PAR2 by Der p1. We employed ELISA to establish that Der p1 induced the release of IL-6 from heterologous cells expressing MRGPRX1, MrgprC11, or PAR2 (Fig. 5A). The Mrgpr/PAR2-activating peptides RSLIGK and SLIGKV induced IL-6 from cells expressing these receptors and also cells expressing MRGPRX2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Control cells transfected with vector alone did not release IL-6 into the medium. We next turned to A549 cells, a line derived from human lung epithelia, considered a model with biological relevance to asthma. Der p1 is known to induce the production of IL-6 from A549 cells. RT-PCR revealed abundant transcripts corresponding to PAR2, and transcripts corresponding to MRGPRX1 and MRGPRX2 were present (Fig. 6a). To determine that Der p1 activation of MRGPRX1 and PAR2 could each contribute to the induction of IL-6, we used siRNA to knock down expression of these receptors individually and together and then stimulated the cells with Der p1. Knockdown of MRGPRX1 and PAR2 modulated IL-6 induction by Der p1 (Fig. 6b). The decrease in Der p1 induction of IL-6 following knockdown of MRGPRX1 is ∼5%. In comparison, the decrease in Der p1 induction of Il-6 following knockdown of PAR2 is more substantial. These data are consistent with the lower level of transcription of MRGPRX1 as compared with PAR2. There are more than 10 species of house dust mites releasing protease allergens consisting of cysteine and serine proteases. There are more than 20 Der p1-like cysteine proteases that are thought to contribute to chronic allergic reactions by releasing inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, TNFα, histamine, and prostaglandins (2Shi J.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 4572-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) showed that activation of PAR2 by Der p1 induced the production of IL-6 from transfected cells and A549 lung epithelial cells. We confirm and broaden their findings with the demonstration that Der p1 not only activates PAR2 but also activates the human receptor MRGPRX1 and the mouse homolog MrgprC11. The data presented here also reveal that IL-6 is induced when cells transfected with these Mrgprs were exposed to Der p1. These findings broaden the potential range by which Der p1 may lead to house dust mite allergy. Der f1, which has 83% amino acid homology to der p1 and 100% homology in the cysteine protease active site, QGGCGSCWAFSG, also activated PAR2 and human MRGPRX1. The incubation of N-terminal receptor peptides with Der p1 revealed cleavage after Asp, Glu, Leu, and Gly. Table 3 shows the cleavage preferences for Gly, Asp, Glu, Leu, and His as obtained from the MEROPS website. Gly at P1–P4 and P1′–P3′; Leu at P2–P4, P1′, P3′, and P4′; Asp at P1, P3, and P4; and Glu at P1, P2, and P2′–P4′ are preferred. His is rarely associated with cleavage by Der p1 and was thus selected for site-directed substitution reported here. Analysis of the MS/MS data reveals that Der p1 cleaved the synthetic MRGPRX1 N terminus preferentially after Asp, Glu, and Leu; MrgprC11 after Asp and Glu; and PAR2 after Gly. The residues Asp2, Glu11, and Leu22 in MRGPRX1 and the amino acids Asp2, Glu11, and Glu17 in MrgprC11 are all in P1 positions. For PAR2, the residues Gly8, Gly23, and Gly13 are in P1 and P2 positions, respectively. The preferred cleavages were at Glu11 in MRGPRX1, Glu17 in MrgprC11, and Gly13 and Gly23 in PAR2. The cleavage sites following Der p1 treatment of N-terminal peptides correlated with receptor activity following site-directed mutagenesis. Asp-to-His mutants of both MRGPRX1 and MrgprC11 were activated by Der p1, whereas Glu-to-His and Leu-to-His mutants were not. Similarly, the Gly8-to-His mutant of PAR2 was activated by Der p1, whereas Gly13-to-His and Gly23-to-His mutants were inactive. Thus, Glu11 and Leu22 in MRGPRX1 and Glu11 and Glu17 in MrgprC11 are necessary for Der p1 activation. Gly8 in P1 and P2′, Gly13 in P2, and Gly23 in P1 positions of PAR2 are needed for activation by Der p1.Table 3Der p1 cleavage preferences of amino acids Gly, Leu, Asp, Glu, and HisAmino acidP4P3P2P1P1′P2′P3′P4′Gly******************************Leu**************************Asp******Glu**************His** Open table in a new tab With respect to PAR2, the most abundant N-terminal peptide associated with Der p1 cleavage was VDGTSHVTG. Neither VDGTSHVTG nor its related hexapeptide VDGTSH could activate Mrgprs or PAR2. In contrast, RSLIGK, the hexapeptide associated with the next most abundant cleavage product had the same degree of activity on PAR2 as SLIGKV, the mouse homolog of SLIGRL. KGRSLI, the hexapeptide associated with the third most abundant product, was also inactive. SLIGKV, the hexapeptide associated with the fourth most abundant product, was active and is a known serine protease–tethered ligand (8Sharlow E.R. Paine C.S. Babiarz L. Eisinger M. Shapiro S. Seiberg M. The protease-activated receptor-2 upregulates keratinocyte phagocytosis.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RSLIGK also activated MRGPRX2, although at a higher concentration than SLIGKV. The data reported here reveal that Der p1 can activate MRGPRX1 and that a peptide derived from MRGPRX1 can activate MRGPRX2. The results confirm activation of PAR2 by Der p1 and that receptor activation results in the release of IL-6. These findings may have clinical relevance with respect to allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis via a mechanism of neurogenic inflammation that links interactions between Der p1 and Mrgprs, not only PAR2, on endothelial cells, mast cells, and sensory neurons. Human MRGPRX1 and MRGPRX2 are expressed primarily on sensory nerves and mast cells, respectively, and appear to be expressed on A549 cells, indicating that functional expression on bronchial epithelium could occur. PAR2- and MRGPRX2-expressing mast cells are present in the bronchial epithelium and exposed to Der p1 (1Kauffman H.F. Tamm M. Timmerman J.A. Borger P.

In conclusion, MRGPRX1 and MRGPRX2 may contribute to house dust mite allergy. Antagonists that prevent the activation of these receptors may have therapeutic value in asthma and allergy. HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). Der p1 from Dermatophagoides farinae and Der f1 from D. pteronyssinus were obtained from mite culture and isolated by affinity chromatography, and purity was determined to be >95% based on silver-stained SDS-PAGE. (Indoor Biotechnologies). A formal measure of protease activity was not available. N-terminal peptides from the human receptors MRGPRX1, 30 residues, and PAR2, 27 residues, and the mouse receptor MrgprC11, 30 residues, were synthesized by Peptide 2.0 Inc. SLIGRL, RSLIGK, and other peptides based on Der p1 cleavage were synthesized by Genscript. The irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 and IL-6 ELISA kits were from Sigma. cDNAs encoding Mrgprs were isolated by PCR using forward and reverse primers and human or mouse genomic DNAs as templates. Human receptors are in capital letters, whereas mouse Mrgprs begin with “M” followed by lowercase letters. Primers for MRGPRX1, MRPGRX2, and MrgprC11 are shown. Equivalent primers were used to isolate cDNAs encoding additional Mrgprs in Table 1: MRGPRX1 forward, GCGCTCGAGCTGAGCATGGATCCAACCATC; MRGPRX1 reverse, GCGGAATTCCTCACTGCTCCAATCTGCTTC; MRGPRX2 forward, GCGCTCGAGAGCATGGATCCAACCACC; MRGPRX2 reverse, GCGAAGCTTCTCTACACCAGACTGCTTCTCG; MrgprC11 forward, GCGCTCGAGAGCATGGATCCAACCATCTCATC; and MrgprC11 reverse, GCGAAGCTTTCAATATCTGCTTTCTGAAATCTC. PAR2 cDNA was obtained from Life Technologies. Each of the cDNAs was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(−). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vectors carrying cDNAs for the specific receptors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed via ratiometric calcium imaging as described (9Azimi E. Reddy V.B. Shade K.C. Anthony R.M. Talbot S. Pereira P.J. Lerner E.A. Dual action of neurokinin-1 antagonists on Mas-related GPCRs.JCI Insight. 2016; 1: e89362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Imaging was performed immediately after loading cells with Fura-2, using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope platform equipped with a flipping filter wheel. Axiovision software (version 4.6) was used for image analysis of cells excited at 340 and 380 nm. Proteases were added at 15 s after the start of the excitation procedure. Images were taken every 5 s, including at zero time. Ratiometric changes were measured in 10–20 cells in each individual experiment. Maximum fluorescence of the cells in each image was calculated and plotted against time in seconds. Traces of three representative cells from each image are shown in the figures. Proteases were used at a concentration of 2 μm. Concentration–effect curves were not generated, because proteases were not active at concentrations below 100 nm. Because the specific activity of the preparation of Der p1 has not been established, it is possible that a different method or preparation may be more active. HeLa cells transfected with human PAR2 and MRGPRX2 cDNAs were subjected to ratiometric imaging as described above with SLIGKV and RSLIGK at concentrations from 1 μm to 1 mm. Each of the concentration-dependent readings was performed in triplicate. Maximum intensities at each of the dilutions were calculated and plotted against concentration using GraphPad Prism software. The error bars represent S.E. The N-terminal peptides of the receptors were as follows: MRGPRX1, MDPTISTLDTELTPINGTEETLCYKQTLSL; MrgprC11, MDPTISSHDTESTPLNETGHPNCTPILTLS; and PAR2, GTNRSSKGRSLIGKVDGTSHVTGKGVT. Conditions for cleavage were as reported previously (10Elmariah S.B. Reddy V.B. Lerner E.A. Cathepsin S signals via PAR2 and generates a novel tethered ligand receptor agonist.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e99702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μmol of each peptide were dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20. 100 μl of each mixture were incubated with Der p1 at 1 μm final concentration at 25 °C for 20 min. Acetonitrile and formic acid were added to final concentrations of 2 and 0.1%, respectively, and samples were immediately frozen at −80 °C. Cleavage peptides were subjected to MS/MS analysis at the Harvard Microchemistry & Proteomics Analysis Facility (Cambridge, MA) (10Elmariah S.B. Reddy V.B. Lerner E.A. Cathepsin S signals via PAR2 and generates a novel tethered ligand receptor agonist.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e99702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The preferred sites for proteolysis by Der p1, as identified by MS/MS, were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, and glycine. These residues were changed to histidine by site-specific mutagenesis using the primer sets below. His was selected, because it was one of the few amino acids not preferred by Der p1. The codon for H, CAC, or CAT, is highlighted in bold italics in the forward primer sequences. Following PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs), the reaction mixture was treated with DpnI and transformed into Mach1 Escherichia coli cells. DNAs from three colonies were made for each mutant, verified by sequencing, and transfected into HeLa cells.

Total RNA was extracted from A549 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and the resulting RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase. 20 μg of total RNA was converted into ssDNA by SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out using the following forward and reverse primers: MRGPRX1 forward, GTGGTGCTGATTCTGCTTGGTGTC; MRGPRX1 reverse, TTTTGACGCTGCCTAAAGGAGCCC; MRGPRX2 forward, TCAGCGGTCGTGTGTGTCCTGCTCTGGG; MRGPRX2 reverse, GAAGAAGTAAATGATGGGGTTGGCAC; PAR2 forward, TCTGGCCATTGGGGTCTTTC; and PAR2 reverse, GGACACTTCGGCAAAGGAGA. A549 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 300,000 cells/well/1 ml. Three sets of siRNA duplexes for hPAR2, MRGPRX1, and control were dissolved in RNase-free water to a concentration of 20 μm. 1.5 μl for each of the duplexes for each gene and control were placed into separate tubes (final concentration, 4.5 μl) containing 51 μl of Opti-MEM. 4.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was placed in a separate tube with 51 μl of Opt-MEM and at 25 °C for 5 min. The duplexes and Lipofectamine 2000 were combined and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the transfection complexes added to the cells. This procedure was done in three wells for each of the PAR2 siRNA, MRGPRX1 siRNA, PAR2 siRNA + MRGPEX1 siRNA, and control siRNA, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once in PBS. 300 μl of serum-free DMEM were placed in each of the wells, and Der P1 was added to each of the transfected wells, as well as three non-transfected wells to final concentration of 100 nm. IL-6 was measured as described below. The data presented are representative of three distinct experiments. IL-6 was assayed by ELISA per instructions provided by the vendor. In brief, 300,000 HeLa cells/well were plated into a 24-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of MRGPRX1, MRGPRX2, MrgprC11, or PAR2 or, as a control, vector pcDNA3.1(−) alone, in separate wells. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with 300 μl of DMEM without serum. Der p1 (100 nm), SLIGRL (100 μm), and RSLIGK (100 μm) were added, and the plate was placed in an incubator for 24 h. The medium from each well was transferred into 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, spun for 2 min to pellet dead cells, and assayed (50 μl) in triplicate in 96-well plates. IL-6 was determined by interpolation from the standard curve using Prism 6 software (GraphPad) and plotted as pg/300,000 cells. This experiment was performed three times, with similar results obtained each time. V. B. R. and E. A.

https://openalex.org/W2739484376,"Background Cali, Colombia has experienced chikungunya and Zika outbreaks and hypoendemic dengue. Studies have explained Cali’s dengue patterns but lack the sub-neighborhood-scale detail investigated here. Methods Spatial-video geonarratives (SVG) with Ministry of Health officials and Community Health Workers were collected in hotspots, providing perspective on perceptions of why dengue, chikungunya and Zika hotspots exist, impediments to control, and social outcomes. Using spatial video and Google Street View, sub-neighborhood features possibly contributing to incidence were mapped to create risk surfaces, later compared with dengue, chikungunya and Zika case data. Results SVG captured insights in 24 neighborhoods. Trash and water risks in Calipso were mapped using SVG results. Perceived risk factors included proximity to standing water, canals, poverty, invasions, localized violence and military migration. These risks overlapped case density maps and identified areas that are suitable for transmission but are possibly underreporting to the surveillance system. Conclusion Resulting risk maps with local context could be leveraged to increase vector-control efficiency- targeting key areas of environmental risk."
https://openalex.org/W2739541068,"Cancer related deaths are primarily due to tumor metastasis. To facilitate their dissemination to distant sites, cancer cells develop invadopodia, actin-rich protrusions capable of degrading the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We aimed to determine whether β3 integrin participates in invadopodia formed by lung carcinoma cells, based on our previous findings of specific TGF-β induction of β3 integrin dependent metastasis in animal models of lung carcinoma. In this study, we demonstrate that lung carcinoma cells form invadopodia in response to TGF-β exposure. Invadopodia formation and degradation activity is dependent on β3 integrin expression since β3 integrin deficient cells are not able to degrade gelatin-coated surfaces. Even more, transient over-expression of SRC did not restore invadopodia formation in β3 integrin deficient cells. Finally, we observed that blockade of PLC-dependent signaling leads to more intense labeling for β3 integrin in invadopodia. Our results suggest that β3 integrin function, and location, in lung cancer cells are essential for invadopodia formation, and this integrin regulates the activation of different signal pathways necessary for the invasive structure. β3 integrin has been associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis in several carcinoma types, including lung cancer. Our findings provide new evidence to support the use of targeted therapies against this integrin to combat the onset of metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2742145171,"Pteropid bats (flying-foxes) are the natural reservoir of Hendra virus, an emergent paramyxovirus responsible for fatal infection in horses and humans in Australia. Pteropus alecto (the Black flying-fox) and the paraphyletic P. conspicillatus (the Spectacled flying-fox) appear to be the primary reservoir hosts. Previous studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may underpin infection dynamics in flying-foxes, and subsequent spillover to horses and in turn humans. We sought to examine temporal trends in urinary cortisol concentration in wild Australian flying-fox populations, to elucidate the putative relationship between Hendra virus infection and physiological stress. Pooled and individual urine samples were non-invasively collected from under roosting flying-foxes at two latitudinally disparate regions in the eastern Australian state of Queensland. Hendra virus detection, and (in individual urine samples) sex and species determination were PCR-based. Urinary cortisol measurement used a validated enzyme immunoassay. We found no direct correlation between increased urinary cortisol and Hendra virus excretion, but our findings do suggest a biologically plausible association between low winter temperatures and elevated cortisol levels in P. alecto in the lower latitude Southeast Queensland roosts. We hypothesize an indirect association between low winter temperatures and increased Hendra virus infection and excretion, mediated by the physiological cost of thermoregulation. Our findings and our approach are directly relevant to elaboration of the disease ecology of Nipah virus and other emerging henipaviruses in bats. More broadly, they inform investigation of emerging disease infection dynamics across the wildlife/livestock/human interface."
https://openalex.org/W2739817003,"Prostate cancer is a highly penetrant disease among men in industrialized societies, but the factors regulating the transition from indolent to aggressive and metastatic cancer remain poorly understood. We found that men with prostate cancers expressing high levels of the G protein–coupled receptor LGR4 had a significantly shorter recurrence-free survival compared with patients with cancers having low LGR4 expression. LGR4 expression was elevated in human prostate cancer cell lines with metastatic potential. We therefore generated a novel transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model to investigate the role of Lgr4 in prostate cancer development and metastasis in vivo. TRAMP Lgr4−/− mice exhibited an initial delay in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia formation, but the frequency of tumor formation was equivalent between TRAMP and TRAMP Lgr4−/− mice by 12 weeks. The loss of Lgr4 significantly improved TRAMP mouse survival and dramatically reduced the occurrence of lung metastases. LGR4 knockdown impaired the migration, invasion, and colony formation of DU145 cells and reversed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by up-regulation of E-cadherin and decreased expression of the EMT transcription factors ZEB, Twist, and Snail. Overexpression of LGR4 in LNCaP cells had the opposite effects. Orthotopic injection of DU145 cells stably expressing shRNA targeting LGR4 resulted in decreased xenograft tumor size, reduced tumor EMT marker expression, and impaired metastasis, in accord with our findings in TRAMP Lgr4−/− mice.

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) 5The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial–mesenchymal transitionTRAMPtransgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostatePINprostatic intraepithelial neoplasiaWDwell-differentiatedMDmoderately differentiatedPDpoorly differentiatedDLPdorsolateral prostateAPanterior prostateARandrogen receptorCSCcancer stem cellMEMminimal essential mediumqPCRquantitative real-time PCRPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenIHCimmunohistochemistrysgRNAsingle guide RNAα-SMAα smooth muscle actin. is a developmental process through which epithelial cells lose their epithelial identity, gain mesenchymal characteristics, and migrate to populate distant regions of the body. Tumors often reinitiate EMT to invade local tissue and intravasate into blood vessels early in metastatic progression (2Cervantes-Arias A. Pang L.Y. Argyle D.J. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition as a fundamental mechanism underlying the cancer phenotype.Vet. Comp. Oncol. 2013; 11: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer, morphological evidence of EMT was observed within the Gleason grading system itself. As the Gleason grade increases, the epithelial glandular architecture is degraded, featuring loss of tight junctions and cell polarity and the appearance of invasive cells, cords, and sheets (3Gleason D.F. Classification of prostatic carcinomas.Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1966; 50: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells with mesenchymal characteristics are more invasive in vitro and produce more metastases in vivo (4Drake J.M. Barnes J.M. Madsen J.M. Domann F.E. Stipp C.S.

Key drivers of EMT (including Twist and Snail) have been proposed as targets for the development of novel anti-metastatic prostate cancer therapeutics (5Wallerand H. Robert G. Pasticier G. Ravaud A.

The Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in EMT from the earliest stages of embryonic development to adult tissue repair (7Moustakas A. Heldin C.H.

The leucine-rich repeat–containing G protein–coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4, also called Gpr48) is a regulator of mammalian development that potentiates Wnt signaling following R-spondin binding (12Carmon K.S.

Complete knockout of Lgr4 is frequently embryonic lethal (25Mazerbourg S. Bouley D.M. Sudo S. Klein C.A. Zhang J.V. Kawamura K. Goodrich L.V. Rayburn H. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hsueh A.J.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2241-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); our laboratory has generated an Lgr4−/− mouse using a gene trap approach that largely circumvents embryonic lethality. A point mutation in the human LGR4 gene results in physiological changes similar to the defects observed in Lgr4−/− mice (26Styrkarsdottir U. Thorleifsson G. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D.F. Sigurdsson A.

Bergsteinsdottir K. et al.Nonsense mutation in the LGR4 gene is associated with several human diseases and other traits.Nature. 2013; 497: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Most significantly, Lgr4 ablation impairs prostate development and prostate stem cell differentiation, leading to decreased branching morphogenesis, fewer luminal cells, and reduced luminal secretion (27Luo W. Rodriguez M. Valdez J.M. Zhu X. Tan K. Li D. Siwko S. Xin L. Liu M. Lgr4 is a key regulator of prostate development and prostate stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 2492-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The TRAMP mouse is a widely used model for prostate cancer that well recapitulates the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer (28Hurwitz A.A. Foster B.A. Allison J.P. Greenberg N.M. Kwon E.D. The TRAMP mouse as a model for prostate cancer.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2001; (Chapter 20, Unit 20.25)10.1002/0471142735.im2005s45Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Specific expression of SV40 T antigen in prostate epithelial cells driven by the probasin promoter is androgen-driven and regulated by prostate development. Disease pathogenesis initiates from early PIN lesions between 8 and 12 weeks of age, evolving through well-differentiated (WD) adenocarcinomas at 12 weeks and moderately differentiated (MD) carcinoma by 18 weeks, progressing to poorly differentiated (PD) carcinomas by 24 to 30 weeks. Accumulating evidence supports a key role for Lgr4 in cancers. Lgr4 expression is elevated in gastric cancers and correlated with nodal spread of tumors (29Steffen J.S. Simon E. Warneke V. Balschun K. Ebert M. Röcken C. LGR4 and LGR6 are differentially expressed and of putative tumor biological significance in gastric carcinoma.Virchows Arch. 2012; 461: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lgr4 is overexpressed in colorectal cancers and associated with metastasis, and high Lgr4 levels are a marker for poor prognosis (30Wu J. Xie N. Xie K. Zeng J. Cheng L. Lei Y. Liu Y. Song L. Dong D. Chen Y. Zeng R. Nice E.C. Huang C. Wei Y. GPR48, a poor prognostic factor, promotes tumor metastasis and activates beta-catenin/TCF signaling in colorectal cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2013; 34: 2861-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Lgr4 increased the invasive and metastatic potential of prostate and colon carcinoma cells and prostate cancer xenograft growth; conversely, Lgr4 silencing decreased prostate, cervical, and lung cancer cell invasiveness (31Gao Y. Kitagawa K. Hiramatsu Y. Kikuchi H. Isobe T. Shimada M. Uchida C. Hattori T. Oda T. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka T. Konno H. Kitagawa M.

Oncol. 2015; 32: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Humans bearing a germ line nonsense mutation in Lgr4 curiously have an increased risk of skin squamous cell carcinoma and biliary tract cancer (26Styrkarsdottir U. Thorleifsson G. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D.F. Sigurdsson A. Jonasdottir A. Jonasdottir A. Oddsson A. Helgason A. Magnusson O.T. Walters G.B. Frigge M.L. Helgadottir H.T. Johannsdottir H. Bergsteinsdottir K. et al.Nonsense mutation in the LGR4 gene is associated with several human diseases and other traits.Nature. 2013; 497: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating that Lgr4 has varying roles related to carcinogenesis in different tissues. However, at present, the role of Lgr4 in cancer and cancer stem cells remains unclear. Here we sought to investigate the role of Lgr4 in prostate cancer. We found that LGR4 was overexpressed in human prostate tumors and in cancer cell lines. LGR4 expression was negatively correlated with recurrence-free survival in cancer patients, suggesting an important role of Lgr4 in prostate cancer progression. In addition, we generated a new mouse prostate cancer model by crossing Lgr4−/− mice with TRAMP mice to analyze the effects of Lgr4 loss on prostate tumor development. Systemic analysis of this in vivo model indicated that Lgr4 depletion did not affect tumor initiation but impaired prostate cancer metastasis by delaying EMT. Further studies on LGR4 knockdown DU145 cells revealed that LGR4 inactivation impedes EMT by up-regulating E-cadherin, possibly through attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and decreasing Snail expression levels. Therefore, Lgr4 plays an important role in regulating prostate cancer metastasis. To investigate LGR4 function in prostate cancer progression, we first studied the expression level of LGR4 in human prostate and prostate cancer cell lines. Limited LGR4 expression was found in the normal human prostate luminal epithelial cell line PNT1A (Fig. 1, A and B). An elevated LGR4 level was present in the primary human prostate cancer cell lines MDA-PCa-2a and MDA-PCa-2b. The androgen-dependent cell lines LNCaP, LaPC4, and VCaP also showed higher expression of LGR4, and LGR4 expression was highest in the androgen-independent cell line DU145 (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, LGR4 expression was roughly correlated with the metastatic ability of these cell lines (DU145 and PC-3 > LNCaP), indicating a potential relationship between prostate cancer metastasis and LGR4 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human prostate specimens showed that LGR4 is normally expressed in basal epithelial cells of adult prostates, in accord with our previous report (27Luo W. Rodriguez M. Valdez J.M. Zhu X. Tan K. Li D. Siwko S. Xin L. Liu M. Lgr4 is a key regulator of prostate development and prostate stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 2492-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or prostate cancers, however, showed a change in LGR4 expression pattern, with a more diffuse epithelial localization not just limited to basal cells, suggesting a role of LGR4 in prostate cancer development (supplemental Fig. S1A). In human prostate patient samples, LGR4 mRNA expression was significantly increased by 78% in prostate cancers compared with normal prostate epithelium (Fig. 1C) (GEO accession no. GSE6099) (33Tomlins S.A. Laxman B. Dhanasekaran S.M. Helgeson B.E. Cao X. Morris D.S. Menon A. Jing X. Cao Q. Han B. Yu J. Wang L. Montie J.E. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. et al.Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.Nature. 2007; 448: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Therefore, LGR4 expression was increased in human prostate cancers. We then sought to determine whether tumor Lgr4 expression could predict prostate cancer recurrence by analyzing online microarray databases. According to the Lapointe database (GEO accession no. GSE3933) (34Lapointe J. Li C. Higgins J.P. van de Rijn M. Bair E. Montgomery K. Ferrari M. Egevad L. Rayford W. Bergerheim U. Ekman P. DeMarzo A.M. Tibshirani R. Botstein D. Brown P.O. et al.Gene expression profiling identifies clinically relevant subtypes of prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D), when dividing the 62 prostate cancer patients according to relative tumor LGR4 expression, cancer recurred within 1 year in 37% of patients with high LGR4 expression, in contrast to only 18% of patients with low LGR4 expression. To further validate this correlation, we compared 60 patients with the highest LGR4 expression with 59 patients with the lowest LGR4 expression in the Nakagawa database (GEO accession no. GSE10645) (35Nakagawa T. Kollmeyer T.M. Morlan B.W. Anderson S.K. Bergstralh E.J. Davis B.J. Asmann Y.W. Klee G.G. Ballman K.V. Jenkins R.B. A tissue biomarker panel predicting systemic progression after PSA recurrence post-definitive prostate cancer therapy.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Although cancer recurrence in the LGR4hi and LGR4low groups was similar within 3 years, prostate cancer recurred in 45% of LGR4hi patients from 3 to 8 years, significantly higher than the cancer recurrence rate of 23.7% in LGR4low patients. Together, these data strongly suggested that LGR4 modulates prostate cancer progression and metastasis. To determine LGR4 function in prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated a novel TRAMP/Lgr4−/− mouse model by crossing TRAMP transgenic mice with Lgr4+/− mice (which have a gene trap cassette containing the β-gal coding sequence inserted after exon 1 of the Lgr4 gene). Lac Z staining of TRAMP/Lgr4+/− mouse prostates at various stages of cancer progression was examined to elucidate the Lgr4 expression pattern during prostate cancer progression (supplemental Fig. S1B). Consistent with our earlier description (27Luo W. Rodriguez M. Valdez J.M. Zhu X. Tan K. Li D. Siwko S. Xin L. Liu M. Lgr4 is a key regulator of prostate development and prostate stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 2492-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in adult TRAMP mouse prostates at 8 weeks of age, Lgr4 is expressed in the basal epithelial layer (supplemental Fig. S1B, first column). Luminal epithelial expression of Lgr4 was first observed in the dorsolateral prostate (DLP) at the age of 16 weeks (supplemental Fig. S1B, second column) and in the anterior prostate (AP) from 20 weeks of age (supplemental Fig. S1B, third column). Before 12 weeks of age, Lgr4 ablation in the TRAMP model delayed PIN initiation (Fig. 2A, first and second columns). We found a transient decrease in cell proliferation of prostates lacking Lgr4 at early ages that reached the level of wild-type mice by 12 weeks (Fig. 2, C and D) but no change in apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S2A) in mice lacking Lgr4. As suggested by our previous study (27Luo W. Rodriguez M. Valdez J.M. Zhu X. Tan K. Li D. Siwko S. Xin L. Liu M. Lgr4 is a key regulator of prostate development and prostate stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 2492-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), disruption of prostate luminal cell differentiation, function, and lumen secretion was found at early developmental stages in Lgr4 knockout mice. This may account for the temporary reduction in proliferation of Lgr4−/− prostate cells. However, no significant difference in tumor formation, as examined by pathological analysis of PIN, WD/MD, and PD areas was found in TRAMP/Lgr4−/− mice after 12 weeks (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Lgr4 is important for early prostate development but does not affect tumor formation or cell proliferation at later ages. Because metastasis is the predominant cause of prostate cancer mortality, we evaluated tumor metastasis in TRAMP mice. Mice were matched for primary tumor size and sacrificed at 25, 30, or 33 weeks to evaluate lung metastasis formation (n = 6/group/time point). By 25 weeks, tumor cells had metastasized to the lungs in all TRAMP/Lgr4+/+ mice, whereas no evidence of tumor lung metastasis was found in TRAMP/Lgr4−/− mice (Fig. 3A, left column). At 30 and 33 weeks, macroscopic metastases were found in wild-type TRAMP lungs (24.3 ± 12.3 metastases/mouse, n = 10), whereas there was minimal metastasis formation in TRAMP/Lgr4−/− lungs (10.7 ± 7.4 metastases/mouse, n = 10, mean ± S.D., p < 0.01; Fig. 3, A and B). We performed cytokeratin 18 (CK18) immunofluorescence on 30- and 33-week-old TRAMP mouse lungs to confirm the epithelial identity of metastatic tumor cells (Fig. 3C). CK18+ adenocarcinoma cells were greatly reduced in 30- and 33-week-old TRAMP/Lgr4−/− lungs. Finally, we evaluated the consequences of Lgr4 loss on TRAMP mouse survival. Lgr4 ablation in TRAMP mice significantly improved the survival rate by 40% at 1 year of age and prolonged the median life span from 36 weeks (TRAMP/Lgr4+/+) to 48 weeks (TRAMP/Lgr4−/−) (Fig. 3D). Lgr4 heterozygosity did not significantly affect TRAMP tumor formation or survival, indicating that a single allele of Lgr4 is sufficient to allow tumor development, whereas loss of both Lgr4 alleles significantly improved survival from prostate cancer. Together, these results indicate that Lgr4 is a crucial regulator of tumor metastasis. To explore the mechanism underlying Lgr4 regulation of cell metastasis and invasion, we established DU145 cell lines with stable Lgr4 knockdown using two different LGR4 shRNAs. Lgr4 shRNA-1 and -2 reduced the LGR4 mRNA level in DU145 cells by 75% and 60% and the protein level by 90% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 4A). To determine the effect of LGR4 on cell proliferation, we compared cell growth between non-silencing control shRNA and Lgr4 shRNA knockdown DU145 cells. We found no significant effect of LGR4 down-regulation or knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 on DU145 cell proliferation (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3A). When we analyzed DU145 cells by flow cytometry, we were surprised to observe a decreased forward scatter in cells expressing LGR4 shRNA, suggesting a potential role for LGR4 in cell size regulation (Fig. 4C). As expected from our in vivo data, LGR4 inactivation dramatically impaired DU145 cell migration and invasion. LGR4 knockdown repressed DU145 cell migration by 70% (Fig. 4D) and trans-well invasion by 60 and 75% (Fig. 4E). Three-dimensional Matrigel colony growth was used previously to study prostate cancer invasion. Prostate cancer cell spheroids form either a round phenotype (poor invasiveness), a “mass” phenotype with occasional invasive filopodia, or invasive/stellate structures that express EMT-related mesenchymal markers (highly invasive). Thus, in this study, we used 3D Matrigel colony formation to study the morphological change and invasive potentials in the colonies (36Härmä V. Virtanen J. Mäkelä R. Happonen A. Mpindi J.P. Knuuttila M. Kohonen P. Lötjönen J. Kallioniemi O. Nees M. A comprehensive panel of three-dimensional models for studies of prostate cancer growth, invasion and drug responses.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10431Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). LGR4 silencing dramatically reduced the frequency of 3D Matrigel colony formation (from 18.7% ± 2.2% to 5.5% ± 1.5% (shRNA-1) and from 15.2% ± 1.4% to 6.8% ± 1.1% (shRNA-2) of total cells seeded) (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, we found that DU145 spheroids expressing control shRNA showed occasional invasive filopodia typical of the mass phenotype at the colony edge, whereas colonies containing LGR4 shRNA-1 maintained a less invasive “round” morphology, suggesting that LGR4 silencing might affect the invasive properties of DU145 cells. We further assessed the impact of LGR4 on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by ectopic expression of LGR4 in LNCaP cells. To generate LGR4-overexpressing LNCaP cells, we transduced LNCaP cells with a lentiviral expression vector containing CMV-promoter driven FLAG-tagged LGR4 followed by IRES-GFP (where IRES is an internal ribosomal entry site) to visualize LGR4 overexpressing cells (Fig. 4G). Consistently, LGR4 overexpression did not affect LNCaP cell proliferation (data not shown) but increased LNCaP cell migration by 40%, cell invasion by 2-fold, and nearly doubled the frequency of 3D Matrigel colony formation (from 6.5% ± 1.0% to 12.6% ± 1.2%) (Fig. 4, G–J). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro findings support a key role for Lgr4 in regulating human prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. To elucidate candidate downstream effectors of LGR4 in DU145 cells, reverse-phase protein array analysis was carried out on DU145 cells stably expressing non-silencing control shRNA or Lgr4 shRNA-1. Proteins or phosphoproteins whose levels changed more than 50% in DU145-Lgr4 shRNA cells compared with the average of untransfected control and non-silencing DU145 cells were considered potential targets of LGR4 and are listed in supplemental Table S1. In summary, LGR4 knockdown affected regulators of cell migration and invasion, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and PKC, the EMT modulators E-cadherin and snail, the Wnt pathway component β-catenin, caveolin-1, and c-Myc, supporting our finding that LGR4 down-regulation reduced DU145 cell migration and invasion. LGR4 is known as a potentiator of Wnt pathway signaling. Not surprisingly, LGR4 silencing in DU145 cells attenuated the expression of Wnt target genes, including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP3 (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2740682224,"Surgically invasive interfaces for upper limb prosthesis control may allow users to operate advanced, multi-articulated devices. Given the potential medical risks of these invasive interfaces, it is important to understand what factors influence an individual's decision to try one.We conducted an anonymous online survey of individuals with upper limb loss. A total of 232 participants provided personal information (such as age, amputation level, etc.) and rated how likely they would be to try noninvasive (myoelectric) and invasive (targeted muscle reinnervation, peripheral nerve interfaces, cortical interfaces) interfaces for prosthesis control. Bivariate relationships between interest in each interface and 16 personal descriptors were examined. Significant variables from the bivariate analyses were then entered into multiple logistic regression models to predict interest in each interface.While many of the bivariate relationships were significant, only a few variables remained significant in the regression models. The regression models showed that participants were more likely to be interested in all interfaces if they had unilateral limb loss (p ≤ 0.001, odds ratio ≥ 2.799). Participants were more likely to be interested in the three invasive interfaces if they were younger (p < 0.001, odds ratio ≤ 0.959) and had acquired limb loss (p ≤ 0.012, odds ratio ≥ 3.287). Participants who used a myoelectric device were more likely to be interested in myoelectric control than those who did not (p = 0.003, odds ratio = 24.958).Novel prosthesis control interfaces may be accepted most readily by individuals who are young, have unilateral limb loss, and/or have acquired limb loss However, this analysis did not include all possible factors that may have influenced participant's opinions on the interfaces, so additional exploration is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2739566123,"Objective We tested the hypothesis that HDL-apolipoprotein A-I exchange (HAE), a measure of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and a key step in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is impaired in metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) patients who are asymptomatic for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We also compared HAE with cell-based cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) to address previous reports that CEC is enhanced in MetSyn populations. Methods HAE and ABCA1-specific CEC were measured as tests of HDL function in 60 MetSyn patients and 14 normolipidemic control subjects. Predictors of HAE and CEC were evaluated with multiple linear regression modeling using clinical markers of MetSyn and CVD risk. Results HAE was significantly reduced in MetSyn patients (49.0 ± 10.9% vs. 61.2 ± 6.1%, P < 0.0001), as was ABCA1-specific CEC (10.1 ± 1.6% vs. 12.3 ± 2.0%, P < 0.002). Multiple linear regression analysis identified apoA-I concentration as a significant positive predictor of HAE, and MetSyn patients had significantly lower HAE per mg/dL of apoA-I (P = 0.004). MetSyn status was a negative predictor of CEC, but triglyceride (TG) was a positive predictor of CEC, with MetSyn patients having higher CEC per mg/dL of TG, but lower overall CEC compared to controls. Conclusions MetSyn patients have impaired HAE that contributes to reduced capacity for ABCA1-mediated CEC. MetSyn status is inversely correlated with CEC but positively correlated with TG, which explains the contradictory results from earlier MetSyn studies focused on CEC. HAE and CEC are inhibited in MetSyn patients over a broad range of absolute apoA-I and HDL particle levels, supporting the observation that this patient population bears significant residual cardiovascular disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2739502052,"Rock climbing is among the outdoor activities that have undergone the highest growth since the second half of the 20th century. As a result, cliff habitats, historically one of the least disturbed by human colonization worldwide, are facing more intense human pressure than ever before. However, there is little data on the impact of this activity in plant-communities, and such information is indispensable for adequate manager decision-making. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of rock climbing on plant communities in terms of cover, richness, and composition in relation to climbing intensity on typical Mediterranean limestone cliffs. Three rock-climbing sites were selected in the Baetic range (SE Spain), corresponding to qualitative categories of climbing frequentation: i)“low” (low frequentation with intermittent climbing), ii)“medium” (high frequentation without overcrowding), and iii) “high” (high frequentation with overcrowding). Within each site, we selected climbing routes and adjacent areas free of climbing, then we carried out a photoplot-based sampling by rappelling. We analysed the images to calculate: richness, species cover, and total cover. This study shows that rock climbing negatively affected the cliff plant community at all three study sites. A significant decrease in plant cover, species richness and a shift in the community composition were recorded for climbed areas, the cover being the variable most sensitive to rock climbing. Impact observed proved to be related to the frequentation level. Low-frequentation sites, with usually more specialized climbers, underwent relatively mild damages, whereas at high frequentation sites the impact was severe and the conservation of the species, especially rare ones, became jeopardized. Our study is the first one available to investigate climbing impact on plant communities in Mediterranean areas, but more research on the impact of rock climbing is needed to assess the regulation of this activity. Regarding management guidelines, we propose a management guideline protocol to evaluate climbing routes and design: i) “Sites free of climbing”, ii) “Strictly regulated climbing routes”, iii) “Mildly regulated climbing routes”, or iv) “Free climbing routes”."
https://openalex.org/W2740116819,"Mutations in human genes can be responsible for inherited genetic disorders and cancer. Mutations can arise due to environmental factors or spontaneously. It has been shown that certain DNA sequences are more prone to mutate. These sites are termed hotspots and exhibit a higher mutation frequency than expected by chance. In contrast, DNA sequences with lower mutation frequencies than expected by chance are termed coldspots. Mutation hotspots are usually derived from a mutation spectrum, which reflects particular population where an effect of a common ancestor plays a role. To detect coldspots/hotspots unaffected by population bias, we analysed the presence of germline mutations obtained from HGMD database in the 5-nucleotide segments repeatedly occurring in genes associated with common inherited disorders, in particular, the PAH, LDLR, CFTR, F8, and F9 genes. Statistically significant sequences (mutational motifs) rarely associated with mutations (coldspots) and frequently associated with mutations (hotspots) exhibited characteristic sequence patterns, e.g. coldspots contained purine tract while hotspots showed alternating purine-pyrimidine bases, often with the presence of CpG dinucleotide. Using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, we analysed the global bending properties of two selected coldspots and two hotspots with a G/T mismatch. We observed that the coldspots were inherently more flexible than the hotspots. We assume that this property might be critical for effective mismatch repair as DNA with a mutation recognized by MutSα protein is noticeably bent."
https://openalex.org/W2740371195,"The chloroquine resistance transporter of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, PfCRT, is an important determinant of resistance to several quinoline and quinoline-like antimalarial drugs. PfCRT also plays an essential role in the physiology of the parasite during development inside erythrocytes. However, the function of this transporter besides its role in drug resistance is still unclear. Using electrophysiological and flux experiments conducted on PfCRT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes, we show here that both wild-type PfCRT and a PfCRT variant associated with chloroquine resistance transport both ferrous and ferric iron, albeit with different kinetics. In particular, we found that the ability to transport ferrous iron is reduced by the specific polymorphisms acquired by the PfCRT variant as a result of chloroquine selection. We further show that iron and chloroquine transport via PfCRT is electrogenic. If these findings in the Xenopus model extend to P. falciparum in vivo, our data suggest that PfCRT might play a role in iron homeostasis, which is essential for the parasite's development in erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2740876568,"Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive late onset, progressive myoclonic epilepsy with a high prevalence in the miniature Wirehaired Dachshund. The disease is due to a mutation in the Epm2b gene which results in intracellular accumulation of abnormal glycogen (Lafora bodies). Recent breed-wide testing suggests that the carrier plus affected rate may be as high as 20%. A characteristic feature of the disease is spontaneous and reflex myoclonus; however clinical signs and disease progression are not well described. A survey was submitted to owners of MWHD which were homozygous for Epm2b mutation (breed club testing program) or had late onset reflex myoclonus and clinical diagnosis of LD. There were 27 dogs (11 male; 16 female) for analysis after young mutation-positive dogs that had yet to develop disease were excluded. Average age of onset of clinical signs was 6.94 years (3.5–12). The most common initial presenting sign was reflex and spontaneous myoclonus (77.8%). Other presenting signs included hypnic myoclonus (51.9%) and generalized seizures (40.7%). Less common presenting signs include focal seizures, “jaw smacking”, “fly catching”, “panic attacks”, impaired vision, aggression and urinary incontinence. All these clinical signs may appear, and then increase in frequency and intensity over time. The myoclonus in particular becomes more severe and more refractory to treatment. Signs that developed later in the disease include dementia (51.9%), blindness (48.1%), aggression to people (25.9%) and dogs (33.3%), deafness (29.6%) and fecal (29.6%) and urinary (37.0%) incontinence as a result of loss of house training (disinhibited type behavior). Further prospective study is needed to further characterize the canine disease and to allow more specific therapeutic strategies and to tailor therapy as the disease progresses."
https://openalex.org/W2741176044,"Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) begins with the death of rod photoreceptors and is slowly followed by a gradual loss of cones and a rearrangement of the remaining retinal neurons. Clusterin is a chaperone protein that protects cells and is involved in various pathophysiological stresses, including retinal degeneration. Using a well-established transgenic rat model of RP (rhodopsin S334ter), we investigated the effects of clusterin on rod photoreceptor survival. To investigate the role of clusterin in S334ter-line3 retinas, Voronoi analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the geometry of rod distribution. Additionally, immunoblot analysis, Bax activation, STAT3 and Akt phosphorylation were used to evaluate the pathway involved in rod cell protection. In this study, clusterin (10μg/ml) intravitreal treatment produced robust preservation of rod photoreceptors in S334ter-line3 retina. The mean number of rods in 1mm2 was significantly greater in clusterin injected RP retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P45, P60, & P75) than in age-matched saline injected RP retinas (P<0.01). Clusterin activated Akt, STAT3 and significantly reduced Bax activity; in addition to inducing phosphorylated STAT3 in Müller cells, which suggests it may indirectly acts on photoreceptors. Thus, clusterin treatment may interferes with mechanisms leading to rod death by suppressing cell death through activation of Akt and STAT3, followed by Bax suppression. Novel insights into the pathway of how clusterin promotes the rod cell survival suggest this treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow progression of vision loss in human RP."
https://openalex.org/W2741418571,"The formation of multicellular tissues during development is governed by mechanical forces that drive cell shape and tissue architecture. Protein complexes at sites of adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell neighbors, not only transmit these mechanical forces, but also allow cells to respond to changes in force by inducing biochemical feedback pathways. Such force-induced signaling processes are termed mechanotransduction. Vinculin is a central protein in mechanotransduction that in both integrin-mediated cell-ECM and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions mediates force-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and adhesion strengthening. Vinculin was found to be important for the integrity and remodeling of epithelial tissues in cell culture models and could therefore be expected to be of broad importance in epithelial morphogenesis in vivo. Besides a function in mouse heart development, however, the importance of vinculin in morphogenesis of other vertebrate tissues has remained unclear. To investigate this further, we knocked out vinculin functioning in zebrafish, which contain two fully functional isoforms designated as vinculin A and vinculin B that both show high sequence conservation with higher vertebrates. Using TALEN and CRISPR-Cas gene editing technology we generated vinculin-deficient zebrafish. While single vinculin A mutants are viable and able to reproduce, additional loss of zygotic vinculin B was lethal after embryonic stages. Remarkably, vinculin-deficient embryos do not show major developmental defects, apart from mild pericardial edemas. These results lead to the conclusion that vinculin is not of broad importance for the development and morphogenesis of zebrafish tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2759293971,"Within the kidney, angiotensin II (AngII) targets different cell types in the vasculature, tubuli, and glomeruli. An important part of the renal filtration barrier is composed of podocytes with their actin-rich foot processes. In this study, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize relative changes in the phosphoproteome of human podocytes in response to short-term treatment with AngII. In 4 replicates, we identified a total of 17,956 peptides that were traceable to 2081 distinct proteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that among the increasingly phosphorylated peptides are predominantly peptides that are related to actin filaments, cytoskeleton, lamellipodia, mammalian target of rapamycin, and MAPK signaling. Among others, this screening approach highlighted the increased phosphorylation of actin-bundling protein, l-plastin (LCP1). AngII-dependent phosphorylation of LCP1 in cultured podocytes was mediated by the kinases ERK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, PKA, or PKC. LCP1 phosphorylation increased filopodia formation. In addition, treatment with AngII led to LCP1 redistribution to the cell margins, membrane ruffling, and formation of lamellipodia. Our data highlight the importance of AngII-triggered actin cytoskeleton-associated signal transduction in podocytes.—Schenk, L.

The maximum number of detected airway segments, most peripheral airway generation detected, generation-specific airway wall thickness (WT), total diameter (TD) and normalized wall thickness (pi10) were compared.The number of detected airway segments decreased slightly with dose (324.8±118 at 120kV/120mAs vs. 288.9±130 at 80kV/30mAs with FBP, p<0.05) and was not changed by IR. The 20th generation was constantly detected as most peripheral. WT did not change significantly with exposure parameters and reconstruction algorithm across all generations: range 1st generation 2.4-2.7mm, 5th 1.0-1.1mm, and 10th 0.7mm with FBP; 1st 2.3-2.4mm, 5th 1.0-1.1mm, and 10th 0.7-0.8mm with IR. pi10 was not affected as well (range 0.32-0.34mm).Exposure parameters and IR had no relevant influence on measured airway parameters even for WT <1mm.

https://openalex.org/W2741529315,"The Gram-negative bacterium Sphingomonas sp. A1 incorporates alginate into cells via the cell-surface pit without prior depolymerization by extracellular enzymes. Alginate import across cytoplasmic membranes thereby depends on the ATP-binding cassette transporter AlgM1M2SS (a heterotetramer of AlgM1, AlgM2, and AlgS), which cooperates with the periplasmic solute-binding protein AlgQ1 or AlgQ2; however, several details of AlgM1M2SS-mediated alginate import are not well-understood. Herein, we analyzed ATPase and transport activities of AlgM1M2SS after reconstitution into liposomes with AlgQ2 and alginate oligosaccharide substrates having different polymerization degrees (PDs). Longer alginate oligosaccharides (PD ≥ 5) stimulated the ATPase activity of AlgM1M2SS but were inert as substrates of AlgM1M2SS-mediated transport, indicating that AlgM1M2SS-mediated ATP hydrolysis can be stimulated independently of substrate transport. Using X-ray crystallography in the presence of AlgQ2 and long alginate oligosaccharides (PD 6-8) and with the humid air and glue-coating method, we determined the crystal structure of AlgM1M2SS in complex with oligosaccharide-bound AlgQ2 at 3.6 A resolution. The structure of the ATP-binding cassette transporter in complex with non-transport ligand-bound periplasmic solute-binding protein revealed that AlgM1M2SS and AlgQ2 adopt inward-facing and closed conformations, respectively. These in vitro assays and structural analyses indicated that interactions between AlgM1M2SS in the inward-facing conformation and periplasmic ligand-bound AlgQ2 in the closed conformation induce ATP hydrolysis by the ATP-binding protein AlgS. We conclude that substrate-bound AlgQ2 in the closed conformation initially interacts with AlgM1M2SS, the AlgM1M2SS-AlgQ2 complex then forms, and this formation is followed by ATP hydrolysis."

These normally demand interventions (political, financial and organisational) aimed at improving the efficiency of the health system as a whole and its single components. In 2009, the English NHS Chief Executive, Sir David Nicholson, warned that a potential funding gap of £20 billion should be met by extensive efficiency savings by March 2015. Our study investigates possible drivers of differential Trust performance (productivity) for the financial years 2010/11-2012/13. Methods Following accounting practice, we define Productivity as the ratio of Outputs over Inputs. We analyse variation in both Total Factor and Labour Productivity using ordinary least squares regressions. We explicitly included in our analysis factors of differential performance highlighted in the Nicholson challenge as the sources were the efficiency savings should come from. Explanatory variables include efficiency in resource use measures, Trust and patient characteristics, and quality of care. Results We find that larger Trusts and Foundation Trusts are associated with lower productivity, as are those treating a greater proportion of both older and/or younger patients. Surprisingly treating more patients in their last year of life is associated with higher Labour Productivity."

Non-invasive methods with increased specificity and sensitivity are needed to improve diagnosis of significant PCa. We developed and technically validated four individual immunoassays for cathepsin D (CTSD), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), and thrombospondin 1 (THBS1). These glycoproteins, previously identified by mass spectrometry using a Pten mouse model, were measured in clinical serum samples for testing the capability of discriminating PCa positive and negative samples. The development yielded 4 individual immunoassays with inter and intra-variability (CV) <15% and linearity on dilution of the analytes. In serum, ex vivo protein stability (<15% loss of analyte) was achieved for a duration of at least 24 hours at room temperature and 2 days at 4°C. The measurement of 359 serum samples from PCa positive (n = 167) and negative (n = 192) patients with elevated PSA (2-10 ng/ml) revealed a significantly improved accuracy (P <0.001) when two of the glycoproteins (CTSD and THBS1) were combined with %fPSA and age (AUC = 0.8109; P <0.0001; 95% CI = 0.7673-0.8545).

https://openalex.org/W2741380403,"Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness. Genetics, environmental insult, and age-related factors all play a key role in altering proteostasis, the homeostatic process regulating protein synthesis, degradation and processing. These factors also play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD and it has been well established that cigarette smoking (CS) initiates AMD pathogenic mechanisms. The primary goal of this study is to elucidate whether CS can induce proteostasis/autophagy-impairment in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In our preliminary analysis, it was found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the insoluble protein fraction (p < 0.01), which was subsequently mitigated through cysteamine (p < 0.01) or fisetin (p < 0.05) treatment. Further, it was verified that these CSE induced ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in the peri-nuclear spaces (p<0.05) that were cleared- off with cysteamine (p < 0.05) or fisetin (p < 0.05). Moreover, CSE-induced aggresome-formation (LC3B-GFP and Ub-RFP co-localization) and autophagy-flux impairment was significantly (p<0.01) mitigated by cysteamine (p<0.05) or fisetin (p<0.05) treatment, indicating the restoration of CSE-mediated autophagy-impairment. CSE treatment was also found to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS, p < 0.001) while impacting cell viability (p < 0.001), which was quantified using CMH2DCFDA-dye (ROS) and MTS (proliferation) or propodium iodide staining (cell viability) assays, respectively. Moreover, cysteamine and fisetin treatment ameliorated CS-mediated ROS production (p < 0.05) and diminished cell viability (p < 0.05). Lastly, CSE was found to induce cellular senescence (p < 0.001), which was significantly ameliorated by cysteamine (p < 0.001) or fisetin (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our study indicates that CS induced proteostasis/autophagy-impairment regulates mechanisms associated with AMD pathogenesis. Moreover, autophagy-inducing drugs such as cysteamine or fisetin can ameliorate AMD pathogenesis mechanisms that warrant further investigation in pre-clinical murine models."

In light of its structure, Shp2 contains two tandem N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a catalytic protein–tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, and a C-terminal tail with tyrosyl phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich motif (14Dance M. Montagner A. Salles J.P. Yart A. Raynal P. The molecular functions of Shp2 in the Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway.Cell.

The N-terminal SH2 domain binds to the PTP domain, resulting in Shp2 autoinhibition, which can be relieved by phosphorylation of Tyr542 to disrupt the association of the SH2 and PTP domains (14Dance M.

Hence, phosphorylation of Tyr542 correlates with activity of Shp2, which can be utilized as an indicative marker for the activity of Shp2. Germ line mutations in Shp2 cause Noonan syndrome, which may cause mental retardation and intellectual disability (18Bentires-Alj M. Paez J.G. David F.S. Keilhack H. Halmos B. Naoki K. Maris J.M.

Thus, considerable effort has been directed toward the development of Shp2-specific inhibitors as potential drug therapies. Given this clinical relevance and the emerging role of Shp2 in synaptic plasticity, studies are warranted to further understand the role Shp2 plays in synaptic function and homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Shp2, particularly at Tyr542, is regulated by bidirectional homeostatic plasticity. Additionally, we provide convincing evidence that Shp2 is critical for elevated surface GluA1 expression in homeostatic plasticity. We show that inhibiting Shp2 phosphatase activity with its inhibitors, expressing an Shp2 phosphatase-inactive mutant, and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated KO of Shp2 in hippocampal neurons prevented an increase in pS845 levels and surface GluA1. Therefore, our results reveal an undefined role of Shp2 in regulating GluA1 surface expression in homeostatic plasticity. To explore whether the phosphorylation level of Tyr542 in Shp2 (hereafter referred to as the Tyr(P)542 level) is regulated during synaptic scaling, we treated cultured rat hippocampal neurons with bicuculline (Bic) or tetrodotoxin (TTX) for 48 h to induce synaptic scaling down or scaling up, as reported previously (21Diering G.H. Gustina A.S. Huganir R.L. PKA-GluA1 coupling via AKAP5 controls AMPA receptor phosphorylation and cell-surface targeting during bidirectional homeostatic plasticity.Neuron. 2014; 84: 790-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation level of Ser845 (hereinafter referred to as the Ser(P)845 level) in GluA1 and the total GluA1 level were simultaneously monitored by Western blotting to ascertain the success of synaptic scaling. As expected, TTX treatment elevated GluA1 and Ser(P)845 levels, whereas bicuculline treatment reduced GluA1 and Ser(P)845 levels (Fig. 1, A and B; for GluA1, TTX, 1.494 ± 0.069 and Bic, 0.664 ± 0.075; for Ser(P)845, TTX, 1.760 ± 0.097 and Bic, 0.544 ± 0.040; n = 4), which is consistent with others reports (21Diering G.H.

Clem R.L. Huganir R.L. PICK1 loss of function occludes homeostatic synaptic scaling.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis also showed an increased Tyr(P)542 level in synaptic upscaling and a decreased Tyr(P)542 level in synaptic downscaling (Fig. 1, A and B; TTX, 2.051 ± 0.094 and Bic, 0.369 ± 0.135), respectively. Interestingly, the total Shp2 level exhibited no significant difference among the control, the upscaling (TTX), and the downscaling (Bic) groups (Fig. 1, A and B). These results reveal that the activity of Shp2 is bidirectionally regulated during synaptic scaling. Our previous study suggested increased incorporation of Shp2 into excitatory postsynaptic sites after acute phase of chemical LTP (9Zhang B. Du Y.L. Lu W. Yan X.Y. Yang Q. Yang W. Luo J.H. Increased activity of Src homology 2 domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) regulates activity-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18856-18866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We wondered whether there was a similar process during synaptic upscaling. Therefore, we set out to examine the colocalization of endogenous Shp2 and PSD95 after 48-h TTX treatment. When the neurons were labeled with the secondary antibody but not the primary antibody against Shp2, no signal was detected under microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). Afterward, colocalization analysis of Shp2 and PSD95 in dendrites was assessed by immunocytochemistry with or without 48-h TTX treatment in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that the proportion of Shp2 clusters merged with PSD95 clusters was increased after upscaling (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that Shp2 translocates to postsynaptic sites after synaptic upscaling. To further confirm this result, the 48-h TTX-treated group and the control group were collected, followed by extraction of the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction. Western blot analysis showed an increased Shp2 proportion in TTX-mediated synaptic upscaling against the control group in the PSD fraction (Fig. 2, C and D; GluA1, 2.088 ± 0.189, TTX versus control, n = 4; Shp2, 2.677 ± 0.237, TTX versus control, n = 4), indicating a translocation of Shp2 to postsynaptic sites after TTX-mediated upscaling. The results from confocal imaging and biochemistry suggest that Shp2 is subject to fine regulation by synaptic scaling in hippocampal neurons. Given our demonstration of the regulation of the Tyr(P)542 level in synaptic scaling, we wondered whether activity of Shp2 was required for enhanced surface GluA1 after TTX-induced upscaling. To address this issue, we utilized two widely used inhibitors that block Shp2 activity. Our recent study revealed that 10 μm NSC87877 blocked chemical LTP-induced Tyr(P)542 level elevation in cultured hippocampal neurons (9Zhang B. Du Y.L. Lu W. Yan X.Y. Yang Q. Yang W. Luo J.H. Increased activity of Src homology 2 domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) regulates activity-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18856-18866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on our previous data, we co-incubated 10 μm NSC87877 with TTX for 48 h. A Western blot analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that the level of Tyr(P)542 was dramatically decreased in response to NSC87877 + TTX treatment compared with TTX alone, without altering the total Shp2 level (Fig. 3, A and B; Tyr(P)542 level, TTX, 1.984 ± 0.216; NSC87877 + TTX, 1.028 ± 0.178; NSC87877, 0.974 ± 0.065; n = 3). Additionally, NSC87877 + TTX treatment blunted elevation of the Ser(P)845 level (Fig. 3, A and B; TTX, 1.887 ± 0.144; NSC87877 + TTX, 1.094 ± 0.028; NSC87877, 1.012 ± 0.067; n = 3). Interestingly, NSC87877 also blocked the increase in total GluA1 level induced by TTX treatment (Fig. 3, A and B; TTX, 1.519 ± 0.092; NSC87877 + TTX, 1.072 ± 0.028; NSC87877, 0.905 ± 0.097; n = 3). Notably, the total GluA1 level remained stable under 48-h NSC87877 treatment, suggesting that activity of Shp2 is required for the increased levels of Ser(P)845 and GluA1 during synaptic upscaling. Because phosphorylation of Ser845 is well correlated with surface GluA1 (5Anggono V. Huganir R.L. Regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin.

Regulation of distinct AMPA receptor phosphorylation sites during bidirectional synaptic plasticity.Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), we decided to measure surface GluA1 in the next step. To evaluate surface GluA1 in this process, surface staining of GluA1 was assessed with and without NSC87877 incubation during 48-h TTX treatment. We found that surface GluA1 significantly increased in the 48-h TTX-treated neurons (Fig. 3, C and D). However, surface GluA1 in the TTX and NSC87877 co-incubation group was comparable with the control group or the NSC87877 alone group (Fig. 3, C and D; TTX, 1.406 ± 0.028; NSC87877 + TTX, 0.981 ± 0.063; NSC87877, 0.985 ± 0.054). Collectively, our results suggest that activity of Shp2 is critical for activity-dependent forward trafficking of GluA1 after 48-h TTX-induced synaptic scaling. To strengthen the conclusion from the NSC87877 experiment, we sought to find out whether PHPS1, which interacts with the PTP signature loop of Shp2 to restrain its enzymatic activity (23Hellmuth K. Grosskopf S. Lum C.T. Würtele M. Röder N. von Kries J.P. Rosario M. Rademann J. Birchmeier W. Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7275-7280Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), exerted a similar effect on the Ser(P)845 level and surface GluA1 level during synaptic upscaling. A previous study indicates that a dose range of 5–20 μm PHPS1 exerts effects on Shp2-dependent downstream signaling, i.e. hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor–induced sustained phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 in epithelial cells (23Hellmuth K. Grosskopf S. Lum C.T. Würtele M. Röder N. von Kries J.P. Rosario M. Rademann J. Birchmeier W. Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7275-7280Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we applied 5 μm PHPS1 during a 48-h TTX treatment. Similar to the results observed with NSC87877, the Western blots showed that the Tyr(P)542 level was dramatically reduced in the PHPS1 + TTX group compared with the TTX alone group (Fig. 3, E and F; TTX, 1.857 ± 0.050; PHPS1 + TTX, 0.941 ± 0.159; PHPS1, 0.906 ± 0.135; n = 5), whereas total Shp2 levels were nearly comparable among the four groups. Additionally, PHPS1 blocked elevation of the Ser(P)845 level (Fig. 3, E and F; TTX, 1.920 ± 0.227; PHPS1 + TTX, 0.863 ± 0.164; PHPS1, 0.878 ± 0.156; n = 5). Notably, we observed that the increment of total GluA1 level induced by 48-h TTX treatment was negated by co-application of PHPS1 (Fig. 3, E and F; TTX, 1.615 ± 0.168; PHPS1 + TTX, 0.975 ± 0.065; PHPS1, 0.960 ± 0.048; n = 5). Surface staining of GluA1 in hippocampal neurons was also accessed in PHPS1 experiments. The increase in surface GluA1 was detected in the TTX-treated group but not in the TTX + PHPS1–treated group, which was consistent with changes in the Ser(P)845 level in biochemistry experiments (Fig. 3, G and H; TTX, 1.357 ± 0.047; PHPS1 + TTX, 0.939 ± 0.039; PHPS1, 1.019 ± 0.025). In addition, we evaluated GluA1 and Shp2 levels in the PSD fraction after co-application of TTX and Shp2 inhibitors. We found that NSC87877 and PHPS1 blocked the increase in GluA1 in the PSD fraction after 48-h TTX treatment, whereas these two inhibitors failed to affect the Shp2 level after TTX treatment (Fig. 3, I and J), suggesting that the inhibitors of Shp2 have little effect on the translocation of Shp2 to the PSD fraction after synaptic upscaling. Together, our data suggest that inhibition of Shp2 activity by specific inhibitors dampens Ser(P)845 and GluA1 up-regulation in synaptic upscaling. Accumulating evidence illustrates that Shp2 is a protein–tyrosine phosphatase implicated in activation of cell signaling and that mutation of C459S of Shp2 results in diminished Shp2 enzymatic activity (24Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Shp2, an SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, positively regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating the inhibitor Sprouty.J. Biol.

The tyrosines in the bidentate motif of the env-sea oncoprotein are essential for cell transformation and are binding sites for Grb2 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on the above results, we predicted that the phosphatase-inactive Shp2 mutant, in which Cys459 was substituted with serine, would lead to the same phenomenon that was observed in Shp2 inhibitor experiments. To investigate this hypothesis, we transfected the Shp2 WT or C459S mutation together with GFP in DIV8 hippocampal neurons. The effect of TTX treatment (48 h) on surface expression of GluA1 in GFP-positive hippocampal neurons (DIV16) was assessed by immunostaining of cell surface receptors. As expected, hippocampal neurons transfected with Shp2 WT showed increased surface GluA1 expression after TTX treatment, whereas the increase was not observed in neurons transfected with the Shp2 C459S mutation after 48 h of TTX (Fig. 4, A and B; TTX for Shp2 WT, 1.429 ± 0.070; control for Shp2 C459S, 1.052 ± 0.029; TTX for Shp2 C459S, 1.028 ± 0.031). These data suggest that constitutive inactivation of Shp2 impairs surface GluA1 up-regulation in synaptic upscaling. To rule out possible off-target effects of the Shp2 inhibitor, we utilized AAV-Cre–mediated KO of Shp2 in hippocampal neurons to evaluate the role of Shp2 in synaptic upscaling. As described in our previous study (9Zhang B. Du Y.L. Lu W. Yan X.Y. Yang Q. Yang W. Luo J.H. Increased activity of Src homology 2 domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) regulates activity-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18856-18866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we infected hippocampal neurons on DIV6–7. Seven days post-infection, TTX was applied to the neurons for 48 h. Shp2, Tyr(P)542, GluA1, and Ser(P)845 levels were measured by Western blot analysis afterward. Genetic ablation of Shp2 prevented an increase in GluA1 and Ser(P)845 levels elicited by 48-h TTX treatment (Fig. 4, C and D; GluA1: TTX for AAV-GFP, 1.632 ± 0.108; control for AAV-Cre, 1.187 ± 0.102; TTX for AAV-Cre, 1.077 ± 0.110; Ser(P)845: TTX for AAV-GFP, 1.686 ± 0.083; control for AAV-Cre, 1.025 ± 0.110; TTX for AAV-Cre, 1.061 ± 0.107; n = 4). In addition, surface staining of GluA1 was accessed on hippocampal neurons in the absence or presence of 48-h TTX treatment in WT or Shp2 KO hippocampal neurons. In line with our results from Shp2 inhibitors and the Shp2-inactive mutant, hippocampal neurons infected with AAV-GFP displayed increased surface GluA1 expression after 48-h TTX treatment, whereas surface GluA1 expression failed to elevate in neurons infected with AAV-Cre after 48 h of TTX (Fig. 4, E and F; TTX for AAV-GFP, 1.334 ± 0.039; control for AAV-Cre, 0.990 ± 0.038; TTX for AAV-Cre, 1.093 ± 0.046). These data suggest that loss of Shp2 function occludes surface GluA1 up-regulation during synaptic upscaling. Previously, we have shown that activity of Shp2 is critical for the increase in Ser(P)845 level in GluA1 as well as surface GluA1 after LTP (9Zhang B. Du Y.L. Lu W. Yan X.Y. Yang Q. Yang W. Luo J.H.

Chem. 2016; 291: 18856-18866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the molecular role of Shp2 in homeostatic plasticity and uncovered a novel role of Shp2 in synaptic upscaling-mediated changes of surface GluA1 by pharmacological and genetic approaches. We found that the phosphorylation level of Shp2 at Tyr542 was regulated by synaptic scaling. Additionally, increased colocalization of Shp2 and PSD95 and accumulated Shp2 sorting into the PSD fraction were observed after synaptic upscaling. The results suggest Shp2 translocation into the postsynaptic site to facilitate its function in the synapse during synaptic upscaling. Recently, we showed that Shp2 rapidly accumulated at the postsynaptic site after LTP stimuli (9Zhang B. Du Y.L. Lu W. Yan X.Y. Yang Q. Yang W. Luo J.H. Increased activity of Src homology 2 domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) regulates activity-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18856-18866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Given both synaptic upscaling and LTP-induced Shp2 translocation into the postsynaptic site, the shared phenomenon of accumulation of Shp2 at the postsynaptic site may contribute to modulating the phosphorylation of GluA1 in the two processes. We provide evidence that phosphatase activity of Shp2 is critical for regulating GluA1 in synaptic upscaling. Considering that Shp2 constitutes two tandem SH2 domains (14Dance M. Montagner A. Salles J.P. Yart A. Raynal P. The molecular functions of Shp2 in the Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway.Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is rational to hypothesize that Shp2 may also serve as a scaffolding protein to recruit other signaling proteins during synaptic upscaling for coordinated regulation of GluA1. However, expression of the phosphatase-inactive form of Shp2 in hippocampal neurons sufficed to negate increased surface expression of GluA1 after synaptic upscaling, implying that the phosphatase activity of Shp2 was critical for the process, whereas its scaffolding function exerted minimal effects on synaptic scaling up. It is worth noting that both acute glycine-induced chemical LTP and chronic TTX treatment drive the accumulation of Shp2 at postsynaptic sites and elevate the Ser(P)845 level, which is Shp2-dependent. The signaling pathways are substantially complex with respect to synaptic plasticity (LTP) and synaptic upscaling, consisting of overlapping and separated signaling nodes for these two processes. Nevertheless, how these two distinct stimuli (chemical LTP and chronic TTX treatment) elicit similar phosphorylation outcomes remains elusive. Our results, demonstrating that Shp2 is activated after synaptic upscaling and that phosphatase activi"

However, high structural similarities between the wild-type and mutant SOD1 proteins limit the utility of this approach. Here we addressed this challenge by converting a promiscuous natural human IgG-binding domain, the hyperthermophilic variant of protein G (HTB1), into a highly specific aggregation inhibitor (designated HTB1M) of two familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–linked SOD1 mutants, SOD1G93A and SOD1G85R. We utilized a computational algorithm for mapping protein surfaces predisposed to HTB1 intermolecular interactions to construct a focused HTB1 library, complemented with an experimental platform based on yeast surface display for affinity and specificity screening. HTB1M displayed high binding specificity toward SOD1 mutants, inhibited their amyloid aggregation in vitro, prevented the accumulation of misfolded proteins in living cells, and reduced the cytotoxicity of SOD1G93A expressed in motor neuron–like cells. Competition assays and molecular docking simulations suggested that HTB1M binds to SOD1 via both its α-helical and β-sheet domains at the native dimer interface that becomes exposed upon mutated SOD1 misfolding and monomerization. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational mapping of the protein–protein interaction potential for designing focused protein libraries to be used in directed evolution. They also provide new insight into the mechanism of conversion of broad-spectrum immunoglobulin-binding proteins, such as HTB1, into target-specific proteins, thereby paving the way for the development of new selective drugs targeting the amyloidogenic proteins implicated in a variety of human diseases.

HTB1M displayed high binding specificity toward SOD1 mutants, inhibited their amyloid aggregation in vitro, prevented the accumulation of misfolded proteins in living cells, and reduced the cytotoxicity of SOD1G93A expressed in motor neuron–like cells. Competition assays and molecular docking simulations suggested that HTB1M binds to SOD1 via both its α-helical and β-sheet domains at the native dimer interface that becomes exposed upon mutated SOD1 misfolding and monomerization. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational mapping of the protein–protein interaction potential for designing focused protein libraries to be used in directed evolution. They also provide new insight into the mechanism of conversion of broad-spectrum immunoglobulin-binding proteins, such as HTB1, into target-specific proteins, thereby paving the way for the development of new selective drugs targeting the amyloidogenic proteins implicated in a variety of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2739868843,"Paraoxonase-2 (PON-2) is a membrane-bound lactonase with unique anti-oxidative and anti-atherosclerotic properties. PON-2 shares key structural elements with MEC-6, an endoplasmic reticulum–resident molecular chaperone in Caenorhabditis elegans. MEC-6 modulates the expression of a mechanotransductive ion channel comprising MEC-4 and MEC-10 in touch-receptor neurons. Because pon-2 mRNA resides in multiple rat nephron segments, including the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron where the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is expressed, we hypothesized that PON-2 would similarly regulate ENaC expression. We observed PON-2 expression in aquaporin 2–positive principal cells of the distal nephron of adult human kidney. PON-2 also co-immunoprecipitated with ENaC when co-expressed in HEK293 cells. When PON-2 was co-expressed with ENaC in Xenopus oocytes, ENaC activity was reduced, reflecting a reduction in ENaC surface expression. MEC-6 also reduced ENaC activity when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The PON-2 inhibitory effect was ENaC-specific, as PON-2 had no effect on functional expression of the renal outer medullary potassium channel. PON-2 did not alter the response of ENaC to extracellular Na+, mechanical shear stress, or α-chymotrypsin–mediated proteolysis, suggesting that PON-2 did not alter the regulation of ENaC by these factors. Together, our data suggest that PON-2 regulates ENaC activity by modulating its intracellular trafficking and surface expression.

The ENaC/degenerin family encodes a group of structurally related ion channels that participate in a large variety of fundamental physiological processes, such as mechanosensation, locomotion, nociception, fear-related behavior, seizure termination, detection of pheromones, airway fluid clearance, salt sensation, and extracellular Na+ homeostasis (18Kellenberger S.

ENaC mediates the rate-limiting step of Na+ uptake across the apical membrane of specific epithelia. ENaC-dependent Na+ absorption in the kidney plays important roles in regulating extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure as well as serum [K+] by facilitating renal K+ secretion. ENaC-dependent Na+ absorption in the airway also plays an important role in regulating airway surface liquid volume and mucociliary clearance (22Warnock D.G. Kusche-Vihrog K. Tarjus A. Sheng S.

Like many other membrane-spanning proteins, this trimeric channel complex inefficiently assembles and folds in the ER, and thus only a small fraction of newly synthesized ENaC subunits exit the ER as assembled channels and traffic to the plasma membrane (27Valentijn J.A.

Together, this multistage machinery impacts the total number of channels (N) at the cell surface. To date, it is unknown whether mammalian PON proteins regulate ion channel function. As MEC-6 functions as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the biogenesis of MEC-4/MEC-10 channels, we asked whether PON-2 regulates ENaC expression. We found that PON-2 is expressed in aquaporin 2 (AQP2)-positive principal cells of the distal nephron, where ENaC resides. PON-2 co-immunoprecipitated with ENaC subunits when expressed in HEK293 cells, and PON-2 reduces ENaC activity when expressed in oocytes. The PON-2–dependent reduction in ENaC activity is associated with a reduction in the number of Na+ channels at the cell surface. Our data suggest that a conserved molecular chaperone has co-evolved with specific members of the ENaC/degenerin family to modulate ion channel expression. Deep RNA sequencing revealed that pon-2 transcripts are present in most nephron segments of rat kidney, including collecting ducts (38Lee J.W. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Deep sequencing in microdissected renal tubules identifies nephron segment-specific transcriptomes.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2015; 26: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The presence of PON-2 protein has been reported in renal proximal tubules (10Yang Y. Zhang Y. Cuevas S. Villar V.A. Escano C. Asico L.D. Yu P. Grandy D.K. Felder R.A. Armando I. Jose P.A. Paraoxonase 2 decreases renal reactive oxygen species production, lowers blood pressure, and mediates dopamine D2 receptor-induced inhibition of NADPH oxidase.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2012; 53: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but its presence in other nephron segments is less well-determined. We evaluated the expression of PON-2 in human renal tubules by staining paraformaldehyde-fixed and cryopreserved human kidney sections with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human PON-2 antibody (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the antibody recognizes two specific bands (∼40 kDa) of the endogenous PON-2 in human whole kidney lysate as well as in mouse cortical collecting duct (mCCDc1) cells overexpressing human PON-2. The antibody did not recognize endogenous mouse PON-2 in either the mCCDc1 cells or mouse whole-kidney lysate (Fig. 1B), suggesting a high degree of species specificity. The human kidney sections were co-stained for AQP2, a marker for principal cells of the latter aspects of the distal nephron (39Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Cloning and expression of apical membrane water channel of rat kidney collecting tubule.Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We detected tubule-specific staining of PON-2 in human kidneys. PON-2 is detected in multiple nephron segments, including the AQP2-positive tubules (Fig. 1A). Notably, PON-2 (red) co-localized with AQP2 (green) in principal cells within the vicinity of the apical membrane (Fig. 1A). In addition, PON-2 was also detected in intercalated cells (which were negative for AQP2 staining) of the CCD (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that PON-2 is expressed in the distal nephron, where ENaC resides. AS PON-2 is expressed in principal cells of the distal nephron, we examined whether PON-2 is in a complex with ENaC subunits. Mouse PON-2 and V5 epitope–tagged mouse ENaC subunits were expressed in HEK293 cells. Each ENaC subunit (α, β, or γ) was individually expressed. Alternatively, the three subunits were co-expressed, with only one subunit bearing an epitope tag. Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody, and immunoblots were analyzed for the presence of PON-2 and ENaC subunits. As shown in Fig. 2, three ∼40-kDa species of mouse PON-2 were detected in V5 precipitates as well as in whole-cell lysates (top). No co-immunoprecipitating proteins were observed in mock-transfected controls or when HEK293 cells were transfected with PON-2 alone. Mouse PON-2 co-immunoprecipitated with each of the three ENaC subunits when all three ENaC subunits were present in the channel complex. In contrast, when PON-2 was co-expressed with individual ENaC subunits, the interaction between PON-2 and the β subunit was much weaker than with the α or γ subunit of ENaC (top), although the immunoprecipitation of β subunit was as efficient as that of the other two subunits (bottom). The expression of mouse PON-2 and ENaC subunits was detected in whole-cell lysates as expected (Fig. 2). We did not observe cleavage products of α and γ subunits, as the experiments were performed under non-reducing conditions, and the cleaved products are linked by a disulfide bond and will migrate with non-cleaved α and γ subunits (24Stockand J.D. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Booth R.E. Silverthorn D.U.

ENaC structure and function in the wake of a resolved structure of a family member.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2011; 301: F684-F696Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MEC-6 dramatically increased the activity of MEC-4/MEC-10 channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, probably by increasing channel surface expression (11Chelur D.S. Ernstrom G.G. Goodman M.B. Yao C.A. Chen L. O'Hagan R. Chalfie M. The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans touch-cell degenerin channel.Nature. 2002; 420: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y. Bharill S. Altun Z. O'Hagan R. Coblitz B. Isacoff E.Y. Chalfie M. Caenorhabditis elegans paraoxonase-like proteins control the functional expression of DEG/ENaC mechanosensory proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 1272-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If PON-2 is functionally related to MEC-6, we predicted that PON-2 expression would modify ENaC activity, perhaps via conserved mechanisms. To this end, we examined the effect of mouse PON-2 on mouse ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were readily detected in oocytes expressing ENaC (−1.5 ± 1.2 μA (mean ± S.D.), n = 45; Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, co-expression of mouse PON-2 inhibited ENaC currents by 57 ± 30% (−0.7 ± 0.3 μA, n = 51, p < 0.001; Fig. 3, A and B), in contrast to the augmenting effect of MEC-6 on MEC-4/MEC-10 activity (11Chelur D.S. Ernstrom G.G. Goodman M.B. Yao C.A. Chen L. O'Hagan R. Chalfie M. The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans touch-cell degenerin channel.Nature. 2002; 420: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Human PON-2 also elicited a similar effect on mouse ENaC activity (41 ± 46% reduction in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, p < 0.001; Fig. 3C), suggesting that the function of PON-2 on ENaC activity is conserved between mammalian species. The inhibitory effect of PON-2 is specific to ENaC, as PON-2 co-expression did not alter the activity of the renal outer medullary K+ channel (ROMK) in oocytes (Fig. 3D). Co-injecting oocytes with cRNAs encoding mouse ENaC (2 ng cRNA/subunit) with increasing amounts of human PON-2 cRNA (0, 0.4, 2, and 10 ng) was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (Fig. 3E). We observed minimal whole-cell amiloride-insensitive currents in oocytes injected with 10 ng of PON-2 cRNA alone (−0.02 ± 0.04 μA, n = 17). In contrast, injection of large amounts (>10 ng) of MEC-6 cRNA alone produced large amiloride-insensitive currents in oocytes (11Chelur D.S. Ernstrom G.G. Goodman M.B. Yao C.A. Chen L. O'Hagan R.

PON-2 has a short cytoplasmic N terminus followed by a single transmembrane domain and a large C-terminal enzymatic domain that resides within the lumen of intracellular secretory organelles or in the extracellular space (6Hagmann H.

Previous studies have shown that the conserved calcium-binding sites within PON-2 (His114, His133, and Asp268) are essential for its lactonase activity (40Altenhöfer S. Witte I. Teiber J.F.

In addition, there are two N-glycosylation sites (Asn254 and Asn323) that are required for PON-2 maturation and activity (40Altenhöfer S. Witte I. Teiber J.F. Wilgenbus P. Pautz A. Li H. Daiber A.

To identify key sites within PON-2 that mediate its inhibitory effect on ENaC activity, we introduced single mutations at specific sites: H114Q, H133Q, D268A, N254A, and N323A (see Fig. 4A). In our experiments, we also introduced a Cys at Ser311, which represents the most common PON-2 polymorphism (42Mochizuki H. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Nickle D.C. Majer M. Huizenga J.J. Tsui L.C.

Whole-cell Na+ currents were measured in oocytes expressing mouse ENaC alone or mouse ENaC plus either wild-type mouse PON-2 or an individual PON-2 mutant. The inhibitory effect of PON-2 on ENaC activity was retained with the H133Q, N254A, and S311C mutants (Fig. 4B). ENaC currents in oocytes expressing the H114Q and N323A mutants also appeared to be reduced, although the reductions in current did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, the PON-2 D268A mutant did not inhibit ENaC activity. We next examined whether the lack of an inhibitory effect of the D268A mutant was due to impaired interaction between ENaC subunits and the PON-2 mutant. ENaC containing a V5-tagged α subunit was expressed in HEK293 cells with either wild-type mouse PON-2 or the D268A mutant. Both wild-type and D268A PON-2 co-immunoprecipitated ENaC (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the interaction between the channel complex and PON-2 was unaffected by the D268A mutation. We noticed tha"

Three dimensional genome organisation is an important factor linking chromatin architecture with stage specific gene expression patterns. Little is known about the role of chromosome organisation in gene expression regulation of lineage specific factors in mammalian embryos. Using bovine embryos as a model we have described these interactions at key developmental stages. Three bovine chromosomes (BTA) that differ in size, number of carried genes, and contain loci for key lineage regulators OCT4, NANOG and CDX2, were investigated. The results suggest that large chromosomes regardless of their gene density (BTA12 gene-poor, BTA5 gene-rich) do not significantly change their radial position within the nucleus. Gene loci however, may change its position within the chromosome territory (CT) and relocate its periphery, when stage specific process of gene activation is required. Trophectoderm specific CDX2 and epiblast precursor NANOG loci tend to locate on the surface or outside of the CTs, at stages related with their high expression. We postulate that the observed changes in CT shape reflect global alternations in gene expression related to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2740983971,"Tobacco consumption contributes significantly to the global burden of disease. The prevalence of smoking is estimated to be increasing in many low-income countries, including Tanzania, especially among women and youth. Even so, the implementation of tobacco control measures has been discouraging in the country. Efforts to foster investment in tobacco control are hindered by lack of evidence on what works and at what cost.We aim to estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of population-based tobacco control strategies in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Tanzania.A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using an Excel-based Markov model, from a governmental perspective. We employed an ingredient approach and step-down methodologies in the costing exercise following a government perspective. Epidemiological data and efficacy inputs were derived from the literature. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as the outcome measure. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out with Ersatz to incorporate uncertainties in the model parameters.Our model results showed that all five tobacco control strategies were very cost-effective since they fell below the ceiling ratio of one GDP per capita suggested by the WHO. Increase in tobacco taxes was the most cost-effective strategy, while a workplace smoking ban was the least cost-effective option, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$5 and US$267, respectively.Even though all five interventions are deemed very cost-effective in the prevention of CVD in Tanzania, more research on budget impact analysis is required to further assess the government's ability to implement these interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2742045918,"Background Declines in HIV prevalence and increases in antiretroviral treatment coverage have been documented in Kenya, but population-level mortality associated with HIV has not been directly measured. In urban areas where a majority of deaths pass through mortuaries, mortuary-based studies have the potential to contribute to our understanding of excess mortality among HIV-infected persons. We used results from a cross-sectional mortuary-based HIV surveillance study to estimate the association between HIV and mortality for Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. Methods and findings HIV seropositivity in cadavers measured at the two largest mortuaries in Nairobi was used to estimate HIV prevalence in adult deaths. Model-based estimates of the HIV-infected and uninfected population for Nairobi were used to calculate a standardized mortality ratio and population-attributable fraction for mortality among the infected versus uninfected population. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess sensitivity to epidemiological assumptions. When standardized to the age and sex distribution of expected deaths, the estimated HIV positivity among adult deaths aged 15 years and above in Nairobi was 20.9% (95% CI 17.7–24.6%). The standardized mortality ratio of deaths among HIV-infected versus uninfected adults was 4.35 (95% CI 3.67–5.15), while the risk difference was 0.016 (95% CI 0.013–0.019). The HIV population attributable mortality fraction was 0.161 (95% CI 0.131–0.190). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of results. Conclusions Although 73.6% of adult PLHIV receive antiretrovirals in Nairobi, their risk of death is four-fold greater than in the uninfected, while 16.1% of all adult deaths in the city can be attributed to HIV infection. In order to further reduce HIV-associated mortality, high-burden countries may need to reach very high levels of diagnosis, treatment coverage, retention in care, and viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2739564880,"The Zambia Ministry of Health (MOH) recruited and trained a new cadre of Community Health Assistants (CHAs) as part of its National Community Health Strategy. The inaugural class of 307 CHAs completed one year of training in July 2012 and deployed to their communities.The impact of the CHA program on the volume and type of health services provided at health posts and their respective referral health centers was measured with a non-randomized difference-in-differences design. Monthly health service provision data was collected for 12 months before and after CHA deployment at 8 health posts along with 8 referral health centers. The analysis controlled for seasonality, changes in non-CHA staffing, and periodic regional child health campaigns, and used facility-level fixed effects.Deploying two CHAs to a health post did not lead to a statistically-discernible increase in services at the intervention facilities. Health services provided at referral health centers increased by 697.9 services per month (95% CI: 131.4 to 1,264.3, p = .016), and combined services (at health posts and referral health centers) increased by 848.6 services per month (95% CI: 178.2 to 1,519.1, p = .013).In this pilot, the addition of CHAs in rural areas increased health service provision at referral health facilities and at facilities overall, shifting the burden of basic health services away from more highly trained health workers. Shifting tasks to lesser-trained, less-expensive cadres like the CHAs, policymakers can rapidly improve access to care with constrained budgets. Evaluations measuring the direct impact of lower level cadres without accounting for task-shifting may underestimate their contribution to the health workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2740348879,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a key proinflammatory mediator that we have previously shown to be associated with an aggressive clinical phenotype in cystic fibrosis. It possesses unique tautomerase enzymatic activity. However, to date, no human-derived substrate has been identified that has the capacity to interact with this cytokine's unique tautomerase activity. This led us to hypothesize that MIF may have the capacity to interact with external substrates. We describe for the first time how Pseudomonas aeruginosa can utilize human recombinant MIF (rMIF) to significantly (P < 0.01) enhance its endogenous biofilm formation. Our in vivo studies demonstrate that utilizing a small-molecular-weight inhibitor targeting MIF's tautomerase activity (SCD-19) significantly reduces the inflammatory response in a murine pulmonary chronic P. aeruginosa model. In addition, we show that in in vitro experiments, pretreatment of P. aeruginosa with rMIF is associated with reduced bacterial killing by tobramycin. Our novel findings support the concept of an anti-MIF strategy that targets this enzymatic activity as a potential future antibacterial therapeutic approach.-Tynan, A., Mawhinney, L., Armstrong, M.

https://openalex.org/W2741728879,"A deeper understanding of the conserved molecular mechanisms in different taxa have been made possible only because of the evolutionary conservation of crucial signaling pathways. In the present study, we explored the molecular evolutionary pattern of selection signatures in 51 species for 10 genes which are important components of NAD+/Sirtuin pathway and have already been directly linked to lifespan extension in worms and mice. Selection pressure analysis using PAML program revealed that MRPS5 and PPARGC1A were under significant constraints because of their functional significance. FOXO3a also displayed strong purifying selection. All three sirtuins, which were SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT6, displayed a great degree of conservation between taxa, which is consistent with the previous report. A significant evolutionary constraint is seen on the anti-oxidant gene, SOD3. As expected, TP53 gene was under significant selection pressure in mammals, owing to its major role in tumor progression. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) genes displayed the most sites under positive selection. Further 3D structural analysis of PARP1 and PARP2 protein revealed that some of these positively selected sites caused a change in the electrostatic potential of the protein structure, which may allow a change in its interaction with other proteins and molecules ultimately leading to difference in the function. Although the functional significance of the positively selected sites could not be established in the variants databases, yet it will be interesting to see if these sites actually affect the function of PARP1 and PARP2."
https://openalex.org/W2740564864,"Objectives Increased expression of adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6) has beneficial effects on the heart through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways. We previously generated a catalytically inactive mutant of AC6 (AC6mut) that has an attenuated response to β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and, consequently, exhibits reduced myocardial cAMP generation. In the current study we test the hypothesis that cardiac-directed expression of AC6mut would protect the heart from sustained β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, a condition frequently encountered in patients with heart failure. Methods and results AC6mut mice and transgene negative siblings received osmotic mini-pumps to provide continuous isoproterenol infusion for seven days. Isoproterenol infusion caused deleterious effects that were attenuated by cardiac-directed AC6mut expression. Both groups showed reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, but the reduction was less in AC6mut mice (p = 0.047). In addition, AC6mut mice showed superior left ventricular function, manifested by higher values for LV peak +dP/dt (p = 0.03), LV peak -dP/dt (p = 0.008), end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (p = 0.003) and cardiac output (p<0.03). LV samples of AC6mut mice had more sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) protein (p<0.01), which likely contributed to better LV function. AC6mut mice had lower rates of cardiac myocyte apoptosis (p = 0.016), reduced caspase 3/7 activity (p = 0.012) and increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression (p = 0.0001). Conclusion Mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression weathered the deleterious effects of continuous isoproterenol infusion better than control mice, indicating cardiac protection."
https://openalex.org/W2741378633,"Glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, complex and influenced by many factors. This study aimed to identify patient characteristics that were predictive of satisfactory glycaemic control in the paediatric population using a logistic regression mixed-effects (population) modelling approach.The data were obtained from 288 patients aged between 1 and 22 years old recorded retrospectively over 3 years (1852 HbA1c observations). HbA1c status was categorised as 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory' glycaemic control, using an a priori cut-off value of HbA1c ≥ 9% (75 mmol/mol), as used routinely by the hospital's endocrine paediatricians. Patients' characteristics were tested as covariates in the model as potential predictors of glycaemic control.There were three patient characteristics identified as having a significant influence on glycaemic control: HbA1c measurement at the beginning of the observation period (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.30 per 1% HbA1c increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20-0.41); Age (OR = 0.88 per year increase, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94), and fractional disease duration (disease duration/age, OR = 0.80 per 0.10 increase, 95% CI = 0.66-0.93) were collectively identified as factors contributing significantly to lower the probability of satisfactory glycaemic control.The study outcomes may prove useful for identifying paediatric patients at risk of having unsatisfactory glycaemic control, and who could require more extensive monitoring, support, or targeted interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2741822043,"Qa-1 is a non-classical Major Histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecule that generally presents hydrophobic peptides including Qdm derived from the leader sequence of classical MHC I molecules for immune surveillance by NK cells. Qa-1 bound peptides derived from the TCR Vβ8.2 of activated T cells also activates CD8+ regulatory T cells to control autoimmunity and maintain self-tolerance. Four allotypes of Qa-1 (Qa-1a-d) are expressed that are highly conserved in sequence but have several variations that could affect peptide binding to Qa-1 or TCR recognition. Here, we determined the structure of Qa-1a with bound Qdm peptide. While the overall structure is very similar to that of Qa-1b, there are several amino acid differences around the peptide binding platform that could affect TCR recognition. Most notably, two amino acid substitutions are found in the pocket P2, which binds the anchor residue Met2 of the Qdm peptide. These residues affect both the size and shape of the binding pocket, as well as affect the charge at physiologic pH, suggesting Qa-1a and Qa-1b could present slightly distinct peptide reservoirs, which could presumably be recognized by different populations of CD8+ T cells."
