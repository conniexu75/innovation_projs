https://openalex.org/W2962424236,"Solar cells based on metal halide perovskites are one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies1–4. Over the past few years, the long-term operational stability of such devices has been greatly improved by tuning the composition of the perovskites5–9, optimizing the interfaces within the device structures10–13, and using new encapsulation techniques14,15. However, further improvements are required in order to deliver a longer-lasting technology. Ion migration in the perovskite active layer—especially under illumination and heat—is arguably the most difficult aspect to mitigate16–18. Here we incorporate ionic liquids into the perovskite film and thence into positive–intrinsic–negative photovoltaic devices, increasing the device efficiency and markedly improving the long-term device stability. Specifically, we observe a degradation in performance of only around five per cent for the most stable encapsulated device under continuous simulated full-spectrum sunlight for more than 1,800 hours at 70 to 75 degrees Celsius, and estimate that the time required for the device to drop to eighty per cent of its peak performance is about 5,200 hours. Our demonstration of long-term operational, stable solar cells under intense conditions is a key step towards a reliable perovskite photovoltaic technology. Addition of an ionic liquid, BMIMBF4, to metal halide perovskite solar cells improves their efficiency and long-term operation under accelerated aging conditions of high temperature and full-spectrum sunlight."

However, the cellular composition of the liver remains poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of about 10,000 cells from normal liver tissue from nine human donors to construct a human liver cell atlas. Our analysis identified previously unknown subtypes of endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes, with transcriptome-wide zonation of some of these populations. We show that the EPCAM+ population is heterogeneous, comprising hepatocyte-biased and cholangiocyte populations as well as a TROP2int progenitor population with strong potential to form bipotent liver organoids. As a proof-of-principle, we used our atlas to unravel the phenotypic changes that occur in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in human hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells engrafted into a mouse liver. Our human liver cell atlas provides a powerful resource to enable the discovery of previously unknown cell types in normal and diseased livers."
https://openalex.org/W2960264922,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modified nucleotide in mRNA1,2, with around 25% of mRNAs containing at least one m6A. Methylation of mRNA to form m6A is required for diverse cellular and physiological processes3. Although the presence of m6A in an mRNA can affect its fate in different ways, it is unclear how m6A directs this process and why the effects of m6A can vary in different cellular contexts. Here we show that the cytosolic m6A-binding proteins-YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3-undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in cells. This phase separation is markedly enhanced by mRNAs that contain multiple, but not single, m6A residues. Polymethylated mRNAs act as a multivalent scaffold for the binding of YTHDF proteins, juxtaposing their low-complexity domains and thereby leading to phase separation. The resulting mRNA-YTHDF complexes then partition into different endogenous phase-separated compartments, such as P-bodies, stress granules or neuronal RNA granules. m6A-mRNA is subject to compartment-specific regulation, including a reduction in the stability and translation of mRNA. These studies reveal that the number and distribution of m6A sites in cellular mRNAs can regulate and influence the composition of the phase-separated transcriptome, and suggest that the cellular properties of m6A-modified mRNAs are governed by liquid-liquid phase separation principles."
https://openalex.org/W2958222816,"Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose individuals to certain cancers1-3, and disease-specific screening and preventative strategies have reduced cancer mortality in affected patients4,5. These classical tumour-suppressor genes have tumorigenic effects associated with somatic biallelic inactivation, although haploinsufficiency may also promote the formation and progression of tumours6,7. Moreover, BRCA1/2-mutant tumours are often deficient in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination8-13, and consequently exhibit increased therapeutic sensitivity to platinum-containing therapy and inhibitors of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP)14,15. However, the phenotypic and therapeutic relevance of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 remains poorly defined in most cancer types. Here we show that in the 2.7% and 1.8% of patients with advanced-stage cancer and germline pathogenic or somatic loss-of-function alterations in BRCA1/2, respectively, selective pressure for biallelic inactivation, zygosity-dependent phenotype penetrance, and sensitivity to PARP inhibition were observed only in tumour types associated with increased heritable cancer risk in BRCA1/2 carriers (BRCA-associated cancer types). Conversely, among patients with non-BRCA-associated cancer types, most carriers of these BRCA1/2 mutation types had evidence for tumour pathogenesis that was independent of mutant BRCA1/2. Overall, mutant BRCA is an indispensable founding event for some tumours, but in a considerable proportion of other cancers, it appears to be biologically neutral-a difference predominantly conditioned by tumour lineage-with implications for disease pathogenesis, screening, design of clinical trials and therapeutic decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2960737093,"Two fossilized human crania (Apidima 1 and Apidima 2) from Apidima Cave, southern Greece, were discovered in the late 1970s but have remained enigmatic owing to their incomplete nature, taphonomic distortion and lack of archaeological context and chronology. Here we virtually reconstruct both crania, provide detailed comparative descriptions and analyses, and date them using U-series radiometric methods. Apidima 2 dates to more than 170 thousand years ago and has a Neanderthal-like morphological pattern. By contrast, Apidima 1 dates to more than 210 thousand years ago and presents a mixture of modern human and primitive features. These results suggest that two late Middle Pleistocene human groups were present at this site-an early Homo sapiens population, followed by a Neanderthal population. Our findings support multiple dispersals of early modern humans out of Africa, and highlight the complex demographic processes that characterized Pleistocene human evolution and modern human presence in southeast Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2960719563,"Receptor kinases of the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) family have emerged as important regulators of plant reproduction, growth and responses to the environment1. Endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides2 have previously been proposed as ligands for several members of the CrRLK1L family1. However, the mechanistic basis of this perception is unknown. Here we report that RALF23 induces a complex between the CrRLK1L FERONIA (FER) and LORELEI (LRE)-LIKE GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL (GPI)-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) to regulate immune signalling. Structural and biochemical data indicate that LLG1 (which is genetically important for RALF23 responses) and the related LLG2 directly bind RALF23 to nucleate the assembly of RALF23–LLG1–FER and RALF23–LLG2–FER heterocomplexes, respectively. A conserved N-terminal region of RALF23 is sufficient for the biochemical recognition of RALF23 by LLG1, LLG2 or LLG3, and binding assays suggest that other RALF peptides that share this conserved N-terminal region may be perceived by LLG proteins in a similar manner. Structural data also show that RALF23 recognition is governed by the conformationally flexible C-terminal sides of LLG1, LLG2 and LLG3. Our work reveals a mechanism of peptide perception in plants by GPI-anchored proteins that act together with a phylogenetically unrelated receptor kinase. This provides a molecular framework for understanding how diverse RALF peptides may regulate multiple processes, through perception by distinct heterocomplexes of CrRLK1L receptor kinases and GPI-anchored proteins of the LRE and LLG family. Uncovering a mechanism of peptide perception by the receptor kinase FER and the LLG1 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana suggests a role for diverse RALF peptides in regulating multiple growth and reproductive processes in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2956327509,"Ascidian embryos highlight the importance of cell lineages in animal development. As simple proto-vertebrates, they also provide insights into the evolutionary origins of cell types such as cranial placodes and neural crest cells. Here we have determined single-cell transcriptomes for more than 90,000 cells that span the entirety of development-from the onset of gastrulation to swimming tadpoles-in Ciona intestinalis. Owing to the small numbers of cells in ascidian embryos, this represents an average of over 12-fold coverage for every cell at every stage of development. We used single-cell transcriptome trajectories to construct virtual cell-lineage maps and provisional gene networks for 41 neural subtypes that comprise the larval nervous system. We summarize several applications of these datasets, including annotating the synaptome of swimming tadpoles and tracing the evolutionary origin of cell types such as the vertebrate telencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W2957935821,"A decline in stem cell function impairs tissue regeneration during ageing, but the role of the stem-cell-supporting niche in ageing is not well understood. The small intestine is maintained by actively cycling intestinal stem cells that are regulated by the Paneth cell niche1,2. Here we show that the regenerative potential of human and mouse intestinal epithelium diminishes with age owing to defects in both stem cells and their niche. The functional decline was caused by a decrease in stemness-maintaining Wnt signalling due to production of Notum, an extracellular Wnt inhibitor, in aged Paneth cells. Mechanistically, high activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in aged Paneth cells inhibits activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α)3, and lowered PPAR-α activity increased Notum expression. Genetic targeting of Notum or Wnt supplementation restored function of aged intestinal organoids. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Notum in mice enhanced the regenerative capacity of aged stem cells and promoted recovery from chemotherapy-induced damage. Our results reveal a role of the stem cell niche in ageing and demonstrate that targeting of Notum can promote regeneration of aged tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2957836762,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has highlighted the important role of intercellular heterogeneity in phenotype variability in both health and disease1. However, current scRNA-seq approaches provide only a snapshot of gene expression and convey little information on the true temporal dynamics and stochastic nature of transcription. A further key limitation of scRNA-seq analysis is that the RNA profile of each individual cell can be analysed only once. Here we introduce single-cell, thiol-(SH)-linked alkylation of RNA for metabolic labelling sequencing (scSLAM-seq), which integrates metabolic RNA labelling2, biochemical nucleoside conversion3 and scRNA-seq to record transcriptional activity directly by differentiating between new and old RNA for thousands of genes per single cell. We use scSLAM-seq to study the onset of infection with lytic cytomegalovirus in single mouse fibroblasts. The cell-cycle state and dose of infection deduced from old RNA enable dose–response analysis based on new RNA. scSLAM-seq thereby both visualizes and explains differences in transcriptional activity at the single-cell level. Furthermore, it depicts ‘on–off’ switches and transcriptional burst kinetics in host gene expression with extensive gene-specific differences that correlate with promoter-intrinsic features (TBP–TATA-box interactions and DNA methylation). Thus, gene-specific, and not cell-specific, features explain the heterogeneity in transcriptomes between individual cells and the transcriptional response to perturbations. A technique known as scSLAM-seq that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with metabolic RNA labelling and nucleoside conversion is used to study the onset of cytomegalovirus infection in single mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2962028570,"Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used antineoplastic agent that can cause heart failure. Dox cardiotoxicity is closely associated with mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial fission and mitophagy are quality control mechanisms that normally help maintain a pool of healthy mitochondria. However, unchecked mitochondrial fission and mitophagy may compromise the viability of cardiomyocytes, predisposing them to cell death. Here, we tested this possibility by using Dox-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells expressing either the mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein MitoDsRed or the novel dual-fluorescent mitophagy reporter mt-Rosella. Dox induced mitochondrial fragmentation as shown by reduced form factor, aspect ratio, and mean mitochondrial size. This effect was abolished by short interference RNA-mediated knockdown of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a major regulator of fission. Importantly, DRP1 knockdown decreased cell death as indicated by the reduced number of propidium iodide-positive cells and the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, DRP1-deficient mice were protected from Dox-induced cardiac damage, strongly supporting a role for DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation in Dox cardiotoxicity. In addition, Dox accelerated mitophagy flux, which was attenuated by DRP1 knockdown, as assessed by the mitophagy reporter mt-Rosella, suggesting the necessity of mitochondrial fragmentation in Dox-induced mitophagy. Knockdown of parkin, a positive regulator of mitophagy, dramatically diminished Dox-induced cell death, whereas overexpression of parkin had the opposite effect. Together, these results suggested that Dox cardiotoxicity was mediated, at least in part, by the increased mitochondrial fragmentation and accelerated mitochondrial degradation by the lysosome. Strategies that limit mitochondrial fission and mitophagy in the physiologic range may help reduce Dox cardiotoxicity.-Catanzaro, M. P., Weiner, A., Kaminaris, A., Li, C., Cai, F., Zhao, F., Kobayashi, S., Kobayashi, T., Huang, Y., Sesaki, H., Liang, Q. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte death is mediated by unchecked mitochondrial fission and mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2956904126,"Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in both chemistry and biology1-4, but there is currently no chemical method of achieving α-peptide ligation in water that tolerates all of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids at the peptide ligation site. The universal genetic code establishes that the biological role of peptides predates life's last universal common ancestor and that peptides played an essential part in the origins of life5-9. The essential role of sulfur in the citric acid cycle, non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and polyketide biosynthesis point towards thioester-dependent peptide ligations preceding RNA-dependent protein synthesis during the evolution of life5,9-13. However, a robust mechanism for aminoacyl thioester formation has not been demonstrated13. Here we report a chemoselective, high-yielding α-aminonitrile ligation that exploits only prebiotically plausible molecules-hydrogen sulfide, thioacetate12,14 and ferricyanide12,14-17 or cyanoacetylene8,14-to yield α-peptides in water. The ligation is extremely selective for α-aminonitrile coupling and tolerates all of the 20 proteinogenic amino acid residues. Two essential features enable peptide ligation in water: the reactivity and pKaH of α-aminonitriles makes them compatible with ligation at neutral pH and N-acylation stabilizes the peptide product and activates the peptide precursor to (biomimetic) N-to-C peptide ligation. Our model unites prebiotic aminonitrile synthesis and biological α-peptides, suggesting that short N-acyl peptide nitriles were plausible substrates during early evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2959050453,"Slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (or paradoxical) sleep have been found in mammals, birds and lizards, but it is unclear whether these neuronal signatures are found in non-amniotic vertebrates. Here we develop non-invasive fluorescence-based polysomnography for zebrafish, and show-using unbiased, brain-wide activity recording coupled with assessment of eye movement, muscle dynamics and heart rate-that there are at least two major sleep signatures in zebrafish. These signatures, which we term slow bursting sleep and propagating wave sleep, share commonalities with those of slow-wave sleep and paradoxical or rapid eye movement sleep, respectively. Further, we find that melanin-concentrating hormone signalling (which is involved in mammalian sleep) also regulates propagating wave sleep signatures and the overall amount of sleep in zebrafish, probably via activation of ependymal cells. These observations suggest that common neural signatures of sleep may have emerged in the vertebrate brain over 450 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2956266291,"Endometriosis is a common incurable inflammatory disorder that is associated with debilitating pelvic pain in women. Macrophages are central to the pathophysiology of endometriosis: they dictate the growth and vascularization of endometriosis lesions and more recently have been shown to promote lesion innervation. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanistic role of macrophages in producing pain associated with endometriosis. Herein, we show that macrophage depletion in a mouse model of endometriosis can reverse abnormal changes in pain behavior. We identified that disease-modified macrophages exhibit increased expression of IGF-1 in an in vitro model of endometriosis-associated macrophages and confirmed expression by lesion-resident macrophages in mice and women. Concentrations of IGF-1 were elevated in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis and positively correlate with their pain scores. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that macrophage-derived IGF-1 promotes sprouting neurogenesis and nerve sensitization in vitro. Finally, we show that the Igf-1 receptor inhibitor linsitinib reverses the pain behavior observed in mice with endometriosis. Our data support a role for macrophage-derived IGF-1 as a key neurotrophic and sensitizing factor in endometriosis, and we propose that therapies that modify macrophage phenotype may be attractive therapeutic options for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain.-Forster, R., Sarginson, A., Velichkova, A., Hogg, C., Dorning, A., Horne, A.

https://openalex.org/W2957476558,"The ability of proteins and other macromolecules to interact with inorganic surfaces is essential to biological function. The proteins involved in these interactions are highly charged and often rich in carboxylic acid side chains1-5, but the structures of most protein-inorganic interfaces are unknown. We explored the possibility of systematically designing structured protein-mineral interfaces, guided by the example of ice-binding proteins, which present arrays of threonine residues (matched to the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54 carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration, individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed orientations, whereas at high K+ concentration, the designs form two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce protein arrays ordered over tens of millimetres. Incorporation of designed protein-protein interactions preserving the match between the proteins and the K+ lattice led to extended self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end interactions produced micrometre-long single-protein-diameter wires and a designed trimeric interface yielded extensive honeycomb arrays. The nearest-neighbour distances in these hexagonal arrays could be set digitally between 7.5 and 15.9 nanometres with 2.1-nanometre selectivity by changing the number of repeat units in the monomer. These results demonstrate that protein-inorganic lattice interactions can be systematically programmed and set the stage for designing protein-inorganic hybrid materials."
https://openalex.org/W2960011603,"Balanced fusion and fission are key for the proper function and physiology of mitochondria1,2. Remodelling of the mitochondrial inner membrane is mediated by the dynamin-like protein mitochondrial genome maintenance 1 (Mgm1) in fungi or the related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) in animals3-5. Mgm1 is required for the preservation of mitochondrial DNA in yeast6, whereas mutations in the OPA1 gene in humans are a common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy-a genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve7,8. Mgm1 and OPA1 are present in mitochondria as a membrane-integral long form and a short form that is soluble in the intermembrane space. Yeast strains that express temperature-sensitive mutants of Mgm19,10 or mammalian cells that lack OPA1 display fragmented mitochondria11,12, which suggests that Mgm1 and OPA1 have an important role in inner-membrane fusion. Consistently, only the mitochondrial outer membrane-not the inner membrane-fuses in the absence of functional Mgm113. Mgm1 and OPA1 have also been shown to maintain proper cristae architecture10,14; for example, OPA1 prevents the release of pro-apoptotic factors by tightening crista junctions15. Finally, the short form of OPA1 localizes to mitochondrial constriction sites, where it presumably promotes mitochondrial fission16. How Mgm1 and OPA1 perform their diverse functions in membrane fusion, scission and cristae organization is at present unknown. Here we present crystal and electron cryo-tomography structures of Mgm1 from Chaetomium thermophilum. Mgm1 consists of a GTPase (G) domain, a bundle signalling element domain, a stalk, and a paddle domain that contains a membrane-binding site. Biochemical and cell-based experiments demonstrate that the Mgm1 stalk mediates the assembly of bent tetramers into helical filaments. Electron cryo-tomography studies of Mgm1-decorated lipid tubes and fluorescence microscopy experiments on reconstituted membrane tubes indicate how the tetramers assemble on positively or negatively curved membranes. Our findings convey how Mgm1 and OPA1 filaments dynamically remodel the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2956625886,"It was recently proposed that healthy orthorexia (HeOr) and orthorexia nervosa (OrNe) should be differentiated. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether the two dimensions of orthorexia can be considered new eating styles or basically equivalent to restrained eating behavior. Two samples of university students (sample 1, n = 460; sample 2, n = 509) completed the Teruel Orthorexia Scale (TOS), the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Factor analysis with the TOS and DEBQ items together revealed an adequate fit for the preexisting five-factor solution (TOS: OrNe and HeOr; DEBQ: Restrained Eating, Emotional Eating, and External Eating). This result points out that these factors are conceptually distinguishable. Moreover, we tested whether the different eating styles presented different patterns of correlations with gender, body mass index (BMI), and age, and whether OrNe and HeOr predicted Positive and Negative Affect after controlling for Restrained, Emotional, and External Eating. Whereas Restrained and Emotional Eating were higher for women and increased with BMI in both samples, HeOr and OrNe presented much lower associations with these variables. OrNe was positively related to Negative Affect and negatively to Positive Affect, whereas HeOr was positively related to Positive Affect. Again, this result supports the assumption that OrNe is a new variant of disordered eating, whereas HeOr could possibly be seen as a protective behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2962570732,"The biophysical relationships between sensors and actuators1–5 have been fundamental to the development of complex life forms. Swimming organisms generate abundant flows that persist in aquatic environments6–13, and responding promptly to external stimuli is key to survival14–19. Here we present the discovery of ‘hydrodynamic trigger waves’ in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum that propagate—in a manner similar to a chain reaction20–22—hundreds of times faster than their swimming speed. By coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 60% within milliseconds23, experiencing accelerations that can reach forces of 14g. We show that a single cellular contraction (the transmitter) generates long-ranged vortex flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers that can, in turn, trigger neighbouring cells (the receivers). To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals in these receiver cells, we present a high-throughput suction–flow device for probing mechanosensitive ion channels24 by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell membrane. We analyse and quantitatively model the ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory25,26, and reveal a phase transition that requires a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help to organize cohabiting communities over large distances and influence long-term behaviour through gene expression (comparable to quorum sensing16). In more immediate terms, because contractions release toxins27, synchronized discharges could facilitate the repulsion of large predators or immobilize large prey. We postulate that numerous aquatic organisms other than protists could coordinate their behaviour using variations of hydrodynamic trigger waves. Ultra-fast hydrodynamic communication between cells emerges in colonies of Spirostomum ambiguum through the generation of long-ranged vortex flows that are sensed by neighbouring cells, leading to propagating trigger waves that coordinate the release of toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2962619068,"The importance of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) to track planetary late accretion has long been recognized. However, the precise nature of the Moon's accretional history remains enigmatic. There exists a significant mismatch of HSE budgets between the Earth and Moon, with the Earth disproportionally accreted far more HSEs than the Moon did. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain this conundrum, including the delivery of HSEs to Earth by a few big impactors, the accretion of pebble-sized objects on dynamically cold orbits that enhanced the Earth's gravitational focusing factor, and the ""sawtooth model"" with much reduced impact flux before ~4.10 Gyr. However, most of these models assume a high impactor retention ratio f (fraction of impactor mass retained on the target) for the Moon. Here, we performed a series of impact simulations to quantify the f-value, followed by a Monte Carlo procedure enacting a monotonically decaying impact flux, to compute the mass accreted into lunar crust and mantle over their histories. We found that the average f-value for the Moon's entire impact history is about 3 times lower than previously estimated. Our results indicate that, to match the HSE budget of lunar crust and mantle, the retention of HSEs should have started ~ 4.35 Gyr ago, when most of lunar magma ocean was solidified. Mass accreted prior to 4.35 Gyr must have lost its HSE to the lunar core, presumably during the lunar mantle crystallization. The combination of a low impactor retention ratio and a late retention of HSEs in the lunar mantle provide a realistic explanation for the apparent deficit of Moon's late accreted mass relative to the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2958223128,"Despite the rapid increase in the number and applications of plankton imaging systems in marine science, processing large numbers of images remains a major challenge due to large variations in image content and quality in different marine environments. We constructed an automatic plankton image recognition and enumeration system using an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and examined the performance of different network structures on automatic plankton image classification. The procedure started with an adaptive thresholding approach to extract Region of Interest (ROIs) from in situ plankton images, followed by a procedure to suppress the background noise and enhance target features for each extracted ROI. The enhanced ROIs were classified into seven categories by a pre-trained classifier which was a combination of a CNN and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The CNN was selected to improve feature description and the SVM was utilized to improve classification accuracy. A series of comparison experiments were then conducted to test the effectiveness of the pre-trained classifier including the combination of CNN and SVM versus CNN alone, and the performance of different CNN models. Compared to CNN model alone, the combination of CNN and SVM increased classification accuracy and recall rate by 7.13% and 6.41%, respectively. Among the selected CNN models, the ResNet50 performed the best with accuracy and recall at 94.52% and 94.13% respectively. The present study demonstrates that deep learning technique can improve plankton image recognition and that the results can provide useful information on the selection of different CNN models for plankton recognition. The proposed algorithm could be generally applied to images acquired from different imaging systems."
https://openalex.org/W2962304951,"Somatic mutations in cancer are a potential source of cancer specific neoantigens. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has common recurrent mutations shared between patients in addition to private mutations specific to individuals. We hypothesized that neoantigens derived from recurrent shared mutations would be attractive targets for future immunotherapeutic approaches. Here we sought to study the HLA Class I and II immunopeptidome of thirteen primary AML tumor samples and two AML cell lines (OCI-AML3 and MV4-11) using mass spectrometry to evaluate for endogenous mutation-bearing HLA ligands from common shared AML mutations. We identified two endogenous, mutation-bearing HLA Class I ligands from nucleophosmin (NPM1). The ligands, AVEEVSLRK from two patient samples and C(cys)LAVEEVSL from OCI-AML3, are predicted to bind the common HLA haplotypes, HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*02:01 respectively. Since NPM1 is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with AML, the finding of endogenous HLA ligands from mutated NPM1 supports future studies evaluating immunotherapeutic approaches against this shared target, for this subset of patients with AML."
https://openalex.org/W2960561523,"Introduction Enterococcus faecalis is a key pathogen recovered from root canals when conventional treatment fails. Phage therapy has generated new interest in combating pathogens. A sustained-release formulation using specific phages against E. faecalis may offer an alternative approach. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of anti-E. faecalis phages formulated in a thermo- sustained-release system against E. faecalis in vitro and in vivo. Methods EFDG1 and EFLK1 phages were formulated with poloxamer P407. Gelation time, phage survival, activity and toxicity were evaluated. Lytic activity was evaluated in vitro against E. faecalis at various growth phases, including anti-biofilm activity. Methods included viable bacterial count (CFU/mL), biofilm biomass determination and electron microscopy (live/dead staining). Further evaluation included infected incisors in an in vivo rat model. Anti-E. faecalis phage-cocktail suspension and sustained-release phage formulation were evaluated by viable bacterial count (CFU/mL), histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 16S genome sequencing of the microbiota of the root canal. Results Gelation time for clinical use was established. Low toxicity and a high phage survival rate were recorded. Sustained-release phages reduced E. faecalis in logarithmic (4 logs), stationary (3 logs) and biofilm (4 logs) growth phases. Prolonged anti-biofilm activity of 88% and 95% reduction in biomass and viable counts, respectively, was recorded. Reduction of intracanal viable bacterial counts was observed (99% of enterococci) also seen in SEM. Phage treatment increased Proteobacteria and decreased Firmicutes. Histology showed reduced periapical inflammation and improved healing following phage treatment. Conclusion Poloxamer P407 formulated with phages has an effective and long-lasting effect in vitro and in vivo targeting E. faecalis."

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is known to play a fundamental role in regulating feeding and reward-related behaviors. However, the contributions of neuronal subpopulations in the LH have not been thoroughly identified. Here we examine how lateral hypothalamic leptin receptor-expressing (LHLEPR) neurons, a subset of GABAergic cells, regulate motivation in mice. We find that LHLEPR neuronal activation significantly increases progressive ratio (PR) performance, while inhibition decreases responding. Moreover, we mapped LHLEPR axonal projections and demonstrated that they target the ventral tegmental area (VTA), form functional inhibitory synapses with non-dopaminergic VTA neurons, and their activation promotes motivation for food. Finally, we find that LHLEPR neurons also regulate motivation to obtain water, suggesting that they may play a generalized role in motivation. Together, these results identify LHLEPR neurons as modulators within a hypothalamic-ventral tegmental circuit that gates motivation."

The purpose of this study was to elicit Mozambican patients with drug sensitive TB (DS-TB), TB/HIV and Multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) understanding and assessment of the quality of care for DS-TB, HIV/TB and MDR-TB services in Mozambique, along with challenges to effectively preventing, diagnosing and treating TB. Materials and methods Qualitative data was collected via separate focus group discussions consisting of patients with DS-TB, TB/HIV and MDR-TB at four health centers in Sofala and Manica Province, Mozambique, to describe knowledge on TB, HIV and MDR-TB, and identify barriers to access and adherence to services and their recommendations for improvement. A total of 51 patients participated in 11 discussions. Content analysis was done and main themes were identified. Results Focus groups shared a number of prominent themes. Respondents identified numerous challenges including delays in diagnosis, stigma related with diagnosis and treatment, long waits at health facilities, the absence of nutritional support for patients with TB, the absence of a comprehensive psychosocial support program, and the lack of overall knowledge about TB or multi drug resistant TB in the community. Discussion TB patients in central Mozambique identified many challenges to effectively preventing, diagnosing and treating tuberculosis. Awareness strengthening in the community, continuous quality monitoring and in-service training is needed to increase screening, diagnosis and treatment for TB, HIV/TB and MDR-TB."

Therefore these proteins have received increased attention for their potential applications in medicine, biomaterials, and biotechnology. The Asian green mussel Perna viridis secretes several byssal plaque proteins, molecules that help anchoring the mussel to surfaces. Among these proteins, protein-5β (Pvfp-5β) initiates interactions with the substrate, displacing interfacial water molecules before binding to the surface. Here, we established the first recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of Pvfp-5β. We characterized recombinant Pvfp-5β, finding that despite displaying a CD spectrum consistent with features of a random coil, the protein is correctly folded as indicated by MS and NMR analyses. Pvfp-5β folds as a β-sheet–rich protein as expected for an epidermal growth factor-like module. We examined the effects of Pvfp-5β on cell viability and adhesion capacity in NIH-3T3 and HeLa cell lines, revealing that Pvfp-5β has no cytotoxic effects at the protein concentrations used and provides good cell-adhesion strength on both glass and plastic plates. Our findings suggest that the adhesive properties of recombinant Pvfp-5β make it an efficient surface-coating material, potentially suitable for biomedical applications including regeneration of damaged tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2961710064,"Being able to assess the phenotypic effects of mutations is a much required capability in precision medicine. However, most of the currently available structure-based methods actually predict stability changes caused by mutations rather than their pathogenic potential. There are also no dedicated methods to predict damaging mutations specifically in transmembrane proteins. In this study we developed and applied a machine-learning approach to discriminate between disease-associated and benign point mutations in the transmembrane regions of proteins with known 3D structure. The method, called BorodaTM (BOosted RegressiOn trees for Disease-Associated mutations in TransMembrane proteins), was trained on sequence-, structure-, and energy-derived descriptors. When compared with the state-of-the-art methods, BorodaTM is superior in classifying point mutations in transmembrane regions. Using BorodaTM we have conducted a large-scale mutation analysis in the transmembrane regions of human proteins with known 3D structures. For each protein we generated structural models for all point mutations by replacing each residue to 19 possible residue types. We classified ~1.8 millions point mutations as benign or diseased-associated and made all predictions available as a Web-server at https://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/MutHTP/boroda.php."
https://openalex.org/W2959155181,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a central regulator of integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration and has recently been shown to co-localize with endosomal proteins. The early endocytic protein Rab5 controls integrin trafficking, focal adhesion disassembly, and cell migration and has been shown to be activated upon integrin engagement by mechanisms that remain unclear. Because FAK is a critical regulator of integrin-dependent signaling and Rab5 recapitulates FAK-mediated effects, we evaluated the possibility that FAK activates Rab5 and contributes to cell migration. Pulldown assays revealed that Rab5-GTP levels are decreased upon treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of FAK, PF562,271, in resting A549 cells. These events were associated with decreased peripheral Rab5 puncta and a reduced number of early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)–positive early endosomes. Accordingly, as indicated by FAK inhibition experiments and in FAK-null fibroblasts, adhesion-induced FAK activity increased Rab5-GTP levels. In fact, expression of WT FAK and FAK/Y180A/M183A (open conformation), but not FAK/Arg454 (kinase-dead), augmented Rab5-GTP levels in FAK-null fibroblasts and A549 cells. Moreover, expression of a GDP-bound Rab5 mutant (Rab5/S34N) or shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Rab5 prevented FAK-induced A549 cell migration, whereas expression of WT or GTP-bound Rab5 (Rab5/Q79L), but not Rab5/S34N, promoted cell migration in FAK-null fibroblasts. Mechanistically, FAK co-immunoprecipitated with the GTPase-activating protein p85α in a phosphorylation (Tyr397)–dependent manner, preventing Rab5-GTP loading, as shown by knockdown and transfection recovery experiments. Taken together, these results reveal that FAK activates Rab5, leading to cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2961100183,"Parvoviruses are a diverse group of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. In recent years, advances in molecular techniques have resulted in the identification of several novel parvoviruses in swine. In this study, porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7) isolates from clinical samples collected in Guangxi, China, were examined to understand their molecular epidemiology and co-infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). In this study, among the 385 pig serum samples, 105 were positive for PPV7, representing a 27.3% positive detection rate. The co-infection rate of PPV7 and PCV2 was 17.4% (67/385). Compared with the reference strains, we noted 93.9%-97.9% similarity in the NS1 gene and 87.4%-95.0% similarity in the cap gene. Interestingly, compared with the reference strains, sixteen of the PPV7 strains in this study contained an additional 3 to 15 nucleotides in the middle of the cap gene. Therefore, the Cap protein of fourteen strains encoded 474 amino acids, and the Cap protein of the other two strains encoded 470 amino acids. However, the Cap protein of the reference strain PPV7 isolate 42 encodes 469 amino acids. This is the first report of sequence variation within the cap gene, confirming an increase in the number of amino acids in the Cap protein of PPV7. Our findings provide new insight into the prevalence of PPV7 in swine in Guangxi, China, as well as sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of these novel PPV7 isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2961376710,"Objectives To examine 1) the publication rate of registered otology trials in ClinicalTrials.gov, 2) the public availability of the results, 3) the study characteristics associated with publication, and 4) the time to publication after trial completion. Background Publication bias, the publication or non-publication of research findings, depending on the nature and direction of results, is accountable for wrong treatment decisions. The extent of publication bias in otology trials has not been evaluated. Methods All registered otology trials were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov with completion date up to December 2015. A search strategy was used to identify corresponding publications up to June 2017, providing at least 18 months to publish the results after trial completion. Characteristics were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov and corresponding publications. Regression models were used to examine study characteristics associated with publication or non-publication. Results From the 419 trials identified on ClinicalTrials.gov, 225 (53.7%) corresponding publications were found in PubMed. Among these, 109 (48.4%) publications were cited on ClinicalTrials.gov and 124 (55.1%) articles reported the National Clinical Trial registry number. For 36 (8.6%) trials, results were only reported in ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials with a biological intervention were more likely to be published than studies involving drugs (odds ratio (OR) 10.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–86.22, P = 0.030). Trials funded by industry were less likely to be published (OR 0.46, CI 0.25–0.84, P = 0.011). The median trial duration was 20 months (interquartile range (IQR) 26 months), and median time from trial completion to publication was 24 months (IQR 22 months). Conclusion In 37.7% of the registered otology trials the results remained unpublished, even several years after trial completion. With little citations on ClinicalTrials.gov and low reporting of the Clinical Trial registry number, the accessibility is limited. Our findings show that there is room for improvement in accuracy of trial registration and publication of results, in order to diminish publication bias in otology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2956379168,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from osteoclasts are important regulators in intercellular communication. Here, we investigated the proteome of EVs from clastic cells plated on plastic (clasts), bone (osteoclasts) and dentin (odontoclasts) by two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry seeking differences attributable to distinct mineralized matrices. A total of 1,952 proteins were identified. Of the 500 most abundant proteins in EVs, osteoclast and odontoclast EVs were 83.3% identical, while clasts shared 70.7% of the proteins with osteoclasts and 74.2% of proteins with odontoclasts. For each protein, the differences between the total ion count values were mapped to an expression ratio histogram (Z-score) in order to detect proteins differentially expressed. Stabilin-1 and macrophage mannose receptor-1 were significantly-enriched in EVs from odontoclasts compared with osteoclasts (Z = 2.45, Z = 3.34) and clasts (Z = 13.86, Z = 1.81) and were abundant in odontoclast EVs. Numerous less abundant proteins were differentially-enriched. Subunits of known protein complexes were abundant in clastic EVs, and were present at levels consistent with them being in assembled protein complexes. These included the proteasome, COP1, COP9, the T complex and a novel sub-complex of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which included the (pro) renin receptor. The (pro) renin receptor was immunoprecipitated using an anti-E-subunit antibody from detergent-solubilized EVs, supporting the idea that the V-ATPase subunits present were in the same protein complex. We conclude that the protein composition of EVs released by clastic cells changes based on the substrate. Clastic EVs are enriched in various protein complexes including a previously undescribed V-ATPase sub-complex."
https://openalex.org/W2958663235,"Identification of anti-osteoclastogenic agents is important for the treatment of bone loss diseases that feature excessive osteoclast (OC) activity and bone resorption. Tranylcypromine (TCP), an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), has been used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. TCP has been discovered to exert anabolic effect on osteoblasts, and MAO-A has also been verified as an important mediator in prostate cancer cells to accelerate osteoclastogenesis. In current study, we were focused on TCP and MAO-A effects on osteoclastogenesis. As illustrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, TCP was capable of inhibiting osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activators of the NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in bone marrow-derived macrophage cells without any cytotoxicity. It was also shown to effectively suppress bone resorption of OCs. The subsequent study revealed that TCP inhibited osteoclastogenesis-related genes in a time-dependent manner through protein kinase B (AKT)–mediated mechanism followed by the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1)-c-fos pathway. And TCP could overcome the osteoclastogenic effects of AKT activator SC79. In addition, our results indicated that the expression and catalytic activity of MAO-A were up-regulated by RANKL stimulation and down-regulated by TCP in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the effects of MAO-A knockdown on OC differentiation indicated that MAO-A played an important role in osteoclastogenesis in vitro and might contribute to the inhibitory effects of TCP. And AKT, NFATc1, and c-fos were involved in the MAO-A pathway. Notably, our in vivo study reflected that TCPs were capable of restoring the bone loss in LPS-induced calvaria osteolysis and estrogen deficiency–induced osteoporosis models. Thus, our current work provided a potential option for the treatment of bone loss diseases and highlighted the important role of MAO-A in osteoclastogenesis as well.—Liu, Z., Yang, K., Yan, X., Wang, T., Jiang, T., Zhou, Q., Qi, J., Qian, N., Zhou, H., Chen, B., Huang, P., Guo, L., Zhang, X., Xu, X., Jiang, M., Deng, L.

https://openalex.org/W2959080472,"A growing body of literature shows that neighborhood characteristics influence older adults’ mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the association between structural and social characteristics of the neighborhood, and depression in Mexican older adults. A longitudinal study was conducted based on waves 1 (2009–2010) and 2 (2014) of the Mexican sample from the Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). A street-network buffer around each participant’s household was used to define neighborhood, so that built environment and social characteristics were assessed within it. Depression was ascertained by using an algorithm based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. In the analysis, multilevel logistic regression models were constructed separately for each built and social environments measurement, adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related covariates, and stratified by area of residence (urban versus rural). The results showed that a length of space between 15–45 meters restricted to vehicles was significantly associated with a lower risk of depression in older adults from the urban area (OR: 0.44; IC 95% 0.23–0.83) and the protective association appeared to be larger with increasing space with this restriction, although it lacked significance. Contrarily, the built environment measures were not predictive of depression in the rural setting. On the other hand, none of the variables from the social environment had a significant association, although safety appeared to behave as a risk factor in the overall (OR: 1.48; CI 95% 0.96–2.30; p = 0.08) and rural (OR: 3.44; CI 95% 0.95–12.45; p = 0.06) samples, as it reached marginal significance. Research about neighborhood effects on older adults’ mental health is an emergent field that has shown that depression might be treated not only from the individual-level, but also from the neighborhood-level. Additionally, further research is needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to help guide neighborhood policies."
https://openalex.org/W2962087643,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and has a high mortality rate due to limited treatment options. Hence, the response of HCC to different cancer immunotherapies is being intensively investigated in clinical trials. Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) show promising results, albeit for a minority of HCC patients. Mouse models are commonly used to evaluate new therapeutic agents or regimens. However, to make clinical translation more successful, better characterized preclinical models are required. We therefore extensively investigated two immune-competent orthotopic HCC mouse models, namely transplanted Hep-55.1c and transgenic iAST, with respect to morphological, immunological and genetic traits and evaluated both models’ responsiveness to immunotherapies. Hep-55.1c tumors were characterized by rich fibrous stroma, high mutational load and pronounced immune cell infiltrates, all of which are features of immune-responsive tumors. These characteristics were less distinct in iAST tumors, though these were highly vascularized. Cell depletion revealed that CD8+ T cells from iAST mice do not affect tumor growth and are tumor tolerant. This corresponds to the failure of single and combined ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. In contrast, combining anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 showed significant antitumor efficacy in the Hep-55.1c mouse model. Collectively, our data comprehensively characterize two immune-competent HCC mouse models representing ICB responsive and refractory characteristics. Our characterization confirms these models to be suitable for preclinical investigation of novel cancer immunotherapy approaches that aim to either deepen preexisting immune responses or generate de novo immunity against the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2961587631,"Lignostilbene-α,β-dioxygenase A (LsdA) from the bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis TMY1009 is a nonheme iron oxygenase that catalyzes the cleavage of lignostilbene, a compound arising in lignin transformation, to two vanillin molecules. To examine LsdA's substrate specificity, we heterologously produced the dimeric enzyme with the help of chaperones. When tested on several substituted stilbenes, LsdA exhibited the greatest specificity for lignostilbene (kcatapp = 1.00 ± 0.04 × 106 m−1 s−1). These experiments further indicated that the substrate's 4-hydroxy moiety is required for catalysis and that this moiety cannot be replaced with a methoxy group. Phenylazophenol inhibited the LsdA-catalyzed cleavage of lignostilbene in a reversible, mixed fashion (Kic = 6 ± 1 μm, Kiu = 24 ± 4 μm). An X-ray crystal structure of LsdA at 2.3 A resolution revealed a seven-bladed β-propeller fold with an iron cofactor coordinated by four histidines, in agreement with previous observations on related carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. We noted that residues at the dimer interface are also present in LsdB, another lignostilbene dioxygenase in S. paucimobilis TMY1009, rationalizing LsdA and LsdB homo- and heterodimerization in vivo. A structure of an LsdA·phenylazophenol complex identified Phe59, Tyr101, and Lys134 as contacting the 4-hydroxyphenyl moiety of the inhibitor. Phe59 and Tyr101 substitutions with His and Phe, respectively, reduced LsdA activity (kcatapp) ∼15- and 10-fold. The K134M variant did not detectably cleave lignostilbene, indicating that Lys134 plays a key catalytic role. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of LsdA and related stilbene-cleaving dioxygenases."

It plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and it has been associated with altered telomere length (TL). There is currently no cure for PD, and extracts of antioxidative plant, such as Mucunα pruriens and Withania somnifera, are commonly used in Ayurveda to treat patients with PD. In this study, we evaluated 2 enzymatic markers of oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) system and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and TL in a Drosophila melanogaster model for PD [phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)B9]. This evaluation was also performed after treatment with the phytoextracts. PINK1B9 mutants showed a decrease in GSH amount and SOD activity and unexpected longer telomeres compared with wild-type flies. M. pruriens treatment seemed to have a beneficial effect on the oxidative stress conditions. On the other hand, W. somnifera treatment did not show any improvements in the studied oxidative stress mechanisms and even seemed to favor the selection of flies with longer telomeres. In summary, our study suggests the importance of testing antioxidant phytoextracts in a PINK1B9 model to identify beneficial effects for PD.—Baroli, B., Loi, E., Solari, P., Kasture, A., Moi, L., Muroni, P., Kasture, S., Setzu, M.

https://openalex.org/W2960775483,"Accumulation of amyloid ß (Aß) peptides, the major component of amyloid fibrils in senile plaques, is one of the main causes of Alzheimer’s disease. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a fatty acid abundant in the brain, and is reported to have protective effects against Alzheimer’s disease, although the mechanistic effects of DHA against Alzheimer’s pathophysiology remain unclear. Because dietary supplementation of DHA in Aß precursor protein transgenic mice ameliorates Aß pathology and behavioral deficits, we hypothesize that DHA may affect the fibrillization and deposition of Aß. Here we studied the effect of different types of fatty acids on Aß fibril formation by in vitro Aß fibrillization assay. Formation of amyloid fibrils consists of two steps, i.e., the initial nucleation phase and the following elongation phase. We found that unsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA, accelerated the formation of Aß fibrils with a unique short and curved morphology in its nucleation phase, which did not elongate further into the long and straight, mature Aß fibrils. Addition of DHA afterwards did not modify the morphology of the mature Aß(1–40) fibrils. The short and curved Aß fibrils formed in the presence of DHA did not facilitate the elongation phase of Aß fibril formation, suggesting that DHA promotes the formation of “off-pathway” conformers of Aß. Our study unravels a possible mechanism of how DHA acts protectively against the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease."

A review of clinical case definitions is necessary for early disease detection. This paper aimed to study possible clinical characteristics for earlier pertussis detection in a sporadic setting. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical and laboratory records in a general paediatric ward of a district hospital in a developing country. Inclusion criteria were all children hospitalised with nasopharyngeal swab taken for Bordetella pertussis. We compared sensitivity and specificity of World Health Organization diagnostic criteria with other clinical characteristics. Polymerase chain reaction Bordetella pertussis was the gold standard used. Results Out of 207 eligible admissions, the study retrieved 128 complete records. Approximately half of the children were less than 3 months old. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria had a low sensitivity (15%), but high specificity (92%). In comparison, combinations that included paroxysmal cough, ill contact and facial congestion had higher sensitivity. Increasing cough duration improved specificity while compromising sensitivity. Conclusion Several clinical characteristics such as paroxysmal cough, facial congestion and a history of ill contact have potential for early clinical detection. Conventional emphasis on cough duration may hamper early detection."

The aim of this study is to quantify the hospitalization risk associated with comorbidities in an Italian cohort of HCV-infected patients and to assess which of these comorbidities are associated with high hospitalization resource utilization.Individuals aged 18 years and older with HCV-infection were identified in the Abruzzo's and Campania's hospital discharge abstracts during 2011-2014 with 1-year follow-up. Cardio-and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and renal disease were grouped as HCV-related comorbidities. Negative binomial models were used to compare the hospitalization risk in patients with and without each comorbidity. Logistic regression model was used to identify the characteristics of being in the top 20% of patients with the highest hospitalization costs (high-cost patients).15,985 patients were included; 19.9% had a liver complication and 48.6% had one or more HCV-related comorbidities. During follow-up, 36.0% of patients underwent at least one hospitalization. Liver complications and the presence of two or more HCV-related comorbidities were the major predictors of hospitalization and highest inpatient costs. Among those, patients with cardiovascular disease had the highest risk of hospitalization (Incidence Rate Ratios = 1.42;95%CI:1.33-1.51) and the highest likelihood of becoming high-cost patients (Odd Ratio = 1.37;95%CI:1.20-1.57).Beyond advanced liver disease, HCV-related comorbidities (especially cardiovascular disease) are the strongest predictors of high hospitalization rates and costs. Our findings highlight the potential benefit that early identification and treatment of HCV might have on the reduction of hospitalization costs driven by extrahepatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2961363903,"Virtual three-dimensional (3D) surface models of autopsied human brain hemispheres were constructed by integrating multiple two-dimensional (2D) photographs. To avoid gravity-dependent deformity, formalin-fixed hemispheres were placed on non-refractile, transparent acrylic plates, which allowed us to take 2D photographs from various different angles. Photogrammetric calculations using software (ReCap Pro cloud service, Autodesk, San Rafael, CA, USA) allowed us calculate the 3D surface of each brain hemisphere. Virtual brain models could be moved and rotated freely to allow smooth, seamless views from different angles and different magnifications. When viewing rotating 3D models on 2D screens, 3D aspects of the models were enhanced using motion parallax. Comparison of different brains using this method allowed us to identify disease-specific patterns of macroscopic atrophy, that were not apparent in conventional 2D photographs. For example, we observed frontal lobe atrophy in a progressive supranuclear palsy brain, and even more subtle atrophy in the superior temporal gyrus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Thus, our method facilities recognition of gyral atrophy. In addition, it provides a much more powerful and suitable way of visualizing the overall appearance of the brain as a three-dimensional structure. Comparison of normal and diseased brains will allow us to associate different macroscopic changes in the brain to clinical manifestations of various diseases."

To this purpose, we used gas chromatography mass spectrometry to search for metabolites capable of predicting the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy in hyper IgA (HIGA) mice, an established model mice for IgA nephropathy. We measured the plasma metabolite levels in 12- and 22-week-old mice, prior to the manifestation of IgA nephropathy phenotypes, and statistically investigated the associations between these metabolites and the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy, such as the urine protein levels and histological phenotypes of the kidney at 32 weeks. We observed that in plasma samples collected from 12- and 22-week-old HIGA mice, the urinary protein levels were significantly associated with 8 and 10 metabolites, the glomerular cellular component levels were significantly associated with 8 and 7 metabolites, and the mesangial substrate levels were significantly associated with 8 and 8 metabolites, respectively. Among the candidate metabolites associated with the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy, coniferyl alcohol levels were significantly higher in HIGA mice at all of the 12, 22, and 32 weeks of age. Since this study was an observational study, we could not elucidate the underlying mechanisms; however, we were able to identify new candidate metabolites, such as coniferyl alcohol, as being potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. These results might help to develop novel laboratory tests and therapeutic reagents for IgA nephropathy in the future."

Here, we show that removing JDBD from JBP1 results in a soluble protein (Δ-JDBD) with the N- and C-terminal regions tightly associated together in a well-ordered structure. We found that this Δ-JDBD domain retains TH activity in vitro but displays a 15-fold lower apparent rate of hydroxylation compared with JBP1. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on JBP1 and JDBD in the presence or absence of J-DNA and on Δ-JDBD enabled us to generate low-resolution three-dimensional models. We conclude that Δ-JDBD, and not the N-terminal region of JBP1 alone, is a distinct folding unit. Our SAXS-based model supports the notion that binding of JDBD specifically to J-DNA can facilitate T hydroxylation 12–14 bp downstream on the complementary strand of the J-recognition site.

Here we screened inbred strain DNAs and genome assemblies to describe the distribution patterns of 45 MLV ERVs and Fv1 alleles in 58 classical inbred strains grouped in two ways: by common ancestry to describe ERV inheritance patterns, and by incidence of MLV-associated lymphomagenesis. Each strain carries a unique set of ERVs, and individual ERVs are present in 5–96% of the strains, often showing lineage-specific distributions. Two ERVs are alternatively present as full-length proviruses or solo long terminal repeats. High disease incidence strains carry the permissive Fv1n allele, tested strains have highly expressed E-ERVs and most have the Bxv1 X-ERV; these three features are not present together in any low-moderate disease strain. The P-ERVs previously implicated in P-MLV generation are not preferentially found in high leukemia strains, but the three Fv1 alleles that restrict inbred strain E-MLVs are found only in low-moderate leukemia strains. This dataset helps define the genetic basis of strain differences in spontaneous lymphomagenesis, describes the distribution of MLV ERVs in strains with shared ancestry, and should help annotate sequenced strain genomes for these insertionally polymorphic and functionally important proviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2961699579,"Background The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms is a serious threat to transnational public health. Therefore, it is vital that cross-border outbreak response systems are constantly prepared for fast, rigorous, and efficient response. This research aims to improve transnational collaboration by identifying, visualizing, and exploring two cross-border response networks that are likely to unfold during outbreaks involving the Netherlands and Germany. Methods Quantitative methods were used to explore response networks during a cross-border outbreak of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings. Eighty-six Dutch and German health professionals reflected on a fictive but realistic outbreak scenario (response rate ≈ 70%). Data were collected regarding collaborative relationships between stakeholders during outbreak response, prior working relationships, and trust in the networks. Network analysis techniques were used to analyze the networks on the network level (density, centralization, clique structures, and similarity of tie constellations between two networks) and node level (brokerage measures and degree centrality). Results Although stakeholders mainly collaborate with stakeholders belonging to the same country, transnational collaboration is present in a centralized manner. Integration of the network is reached, since several actors are beneficially positioned to coordinate transnational collaboration. However, levels of trust are moderately low and prior-existing cross-border working relationships are sparse. Conclusion Given the explored network characteristics, we conclude that the system has a promising basis to achieve effective coordination. However, future research has to determine what kind of network governance form might be most effective and efficient in coordinating the necessary cross-border response activity. Furthermore, networks identified in this study are not only crucial in times of outbreak containment, but should also be fostered in times of non-crisis."

However, previous studies using cross-sectional designs have reported variable and sometimes contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to quantify the localized effect of PTH on the structural and densitometric behaviors of mouse tibia and their links with the global mechanical behavior of bone using a novel spatiotemporal image analysis approach and a finite element analysis technique. Twelve female C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups: the control and PTH treated groups. The entire right tibiae were imaged using an in vivo micro-computed tomography (μCT) system eight consecutive times. Next, the in vivo longitudinal tibial μCT images were rigidly registered and divided into 10 compartments across the entire tibial space. The bone volume (BV), bone mineral content (BMC), bone tissue mineral density (TMD), and tibial endosteal and periosteal areas (TEA and TPA) were quantified in each compartment. Additionally, finite element models of all the tibiae were generated to analyze the failure behavior of the tibia. It was found that both the BMC and BV started to increase in the proximal tibial region, and then the increases extended to the entire tibial region after two weeks of treatment (p < 0.05). PTH intervention significantly reduced the TEA in most tibial compartments after two weeks of treatment, and the TPA increased in most tibial regions after four weeks of treatment (p < 0.05). Tibial failure loads significantly increased after three weeks of PTH treatment (p < 0.01). The present study provided the first evidence of the localized effect of PTH on bone structural and densitometric properties, as well as their links with the global mechanical behaviors of bone, which are important pieces of information for unveiling the mechanism of PTH intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2961491375,"The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between parents' past experience as Physical Education (PE) students and the importance they give to PE within the school curriculum. Parents of 1834 teenagers from Spain and Portugal participated in the study (1834 fathers and 1834 mothers). An 11 item questionnaire was used for data collection. The measures studied were: socio-demographic characteristics, parent´s past experience as PE students, and importance that parents gave to PE in the school curriculum. The results suggest that parents’ past experiences as PE student condition their evaluation of the importance that PE should have in the school curriculum. As the past experience as PE student deteriorated and as age increased, there was an increase in the probability that parents evaluate PE as deserving a less important status in their children's curriculum. These findings can contribute to understanding how the parents' past experiences as PE students seem to partially model the value judgements that they make later in life regarding the importance of the subject."
https://openalex.org/W2956177936,"Prion protein (PrPC) is a protease-sensitive and soluble cell surface glycoprotein expressed in almost all mammalian cell types. PrPSc, a protease-resistant and insoluble form of PrPC, is the causative agent of prion diseases, fatal and transmissible neurogenerative diseases of mammals. Prion infection is initiated via either ingestion or inoculation of PrPSc or when host PrPC stochastically refolds into PrPSc. In either instance, the early events that occur during prion infection remain poorly understood. We have used transgenic mice expressing mouse PrPC tagged with a unique antibody epitope to monitor the response of host PrPC to prion inoculation. Following intracranial inoculation of either prion-infected or uninfected brain homogenate, we show that host PrPC can accumulate both intra-axonally and within the myelin membrane of axons suggesting that it may play a role in axonal loss following brain injury. Moreover, in response to the inoculation host PrPC exhibits an increased insolubility and protease resistance similar to that of PrPSc, even in the absence of infectious prions. Thus, our results raise the possibility that damage to the brain may be one trigger by which PrPC stochastically refolds into pathogenic PrPSc leading to productive prion infection."
https://openalex.org/W2956581434,"Is our memory for pairs of items dependent on item characteristics? The present study explores this question using a word learning paradigm; specifically, we examined whether referent characteristics, such as referent type (face/object) and familiarity (known/unknown), may influence word-referent mapping. Moreover, we examined this effect across two test sessions to determine if the influence of referent characteristics might be more pronounced over time, and across two age groups (young vs. older adults) to determine if there might be age-related differences. Participants were presented with pseudoword-referent mappings in four referent conditions (face/object × known/unknown) and then were tested with a recognition task immediately after learning, and again after a short delay. Our findings indicated that names for faces were not learned better than names for objects, despite previous literature suggesting that faces are processed differently. We also found that known referents (defined as having a pre-existing label for a referent) were learned better than unknown items but this familiarity advantage was only observed for faces and not for objects. While there were several age-related findings, these might be due to the longer delay between the immediate and delayed tests among the older adults relative to young adults. Taken together, our results suggest that certain referent characteristics do interact and influence our learning of and memory for such pairings."
https://openalex.org/W2961644234,"Regular physical activity participation is known to promote better mobility and coordination. Although previous research has established that lack of physical activity participation may increase the risk of developing low back pain, the role of physical activity as a predictor of recovery among symptomatic individuals remains unclear.To evaluate whether: (i) the level of physical activity participation before an acute episode of low back pain predicts recovery within 12 months following the acute pain episode (i.e. index episode); and (ii) participants return to their pre-pain level of physical activity participation 12 months from the index episode.This study used longitudinal data from the TRIGGERS case-crossover study.This study was conducted through over-the-phone interviews to participants that presented to 300 primary care clinics with a new episode of acute low back pain.This study included 999 consecutive patients, aged 18 years or older. Follow-up assessment was completed at 12 months following the index episode.This is a cohort study where consecutive patients, aged 18 years or older, that presented with a new episode of acute low back pain were recruited between October 2011 and November 2012.Self-reported level of physical activity participation.A total of 830 participants completed the study. When comparing participants who reported pain at 12 months follow-up with those without pain, all participants reported similar levels of physical activity participation one week before (p = 0.449), one week after (p = 0.812) and 12 months after the index episode (p = 0.233). The level of physical activity participation before the index episode was not a reliable predictor of presence of pain at either 3 or 12 months follow-up (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.993 to 1.003; p = 0.523 and OR 1; 95% CI 0.992 to 1.008; p = 0.923, respectively).Physical activity participation did not predict recovery from the pain episode. Also all participants returned to their pre-pain level of physical activity participation after 12 months."
