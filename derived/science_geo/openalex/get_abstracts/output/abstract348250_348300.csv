https://openalex.org/W2047802539,"Electrons in correlated insulators are prevented from conducting by Coulomb repulsion between them. When an insulator-to-metal transition is induced in a correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in conventional metals. We report on the electronic properties of a prototypical correlated insulator vanadium dioxide in which the metallic state can be induced by increasing temperature. Scanning near-field infrared microscopy allows us to directly image nanoscale metallic puddles that appear at the onset of the insulator-to-metal transition. In combination with far-field infrared spectroscopy, the data reveal the Mott transition with divergent quasi-particle mass in the metallic puddles. The experimental approach used sets the stage for investigations of charge dynamics on the nanoscale in other inhomogeneous correlated electron systems."
https://openalex.org/W2082279765,"The high performance of Au-CeO 2 and Au-TiO 2 catalysts in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (H 2 O + CO→H 2 + CO 2 ) relies heavily on the direct participation of the oxide in the catalytic process. Although clean Au(111) is not catalytically active for the WGS, gold surfaces that are 20 to 30% covered by ceria or titania nanoparticles have activities comparable to those of good WGS catalysts such as Cu(111) or Cu(100). In TiO 2- x /Au(111) and CeO 2- x /Au(111), water dissociates on O vacancies of the oxide nanoparticles, CO adsorbs on Au sites located nearby, and subsequent reaction steps take place at the metal-oxide interface. In these inverse catalysts, the moderate chemical activity of bulk gold is coupled to that of a more reactive oxide."

To identify endogenous factors that affect the efficiency of sexual viral transmission, we screened a complex peptide/protein library derived from human semen. We show that naturally occurring fragments of the abundant semen marker prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP) form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils, termed Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI), capture HIV virions and promote their attachment to target cells, thereby enhancing the infectious virus titer by several orders of magnitude. Physiological concentrations of SEVI amplified HIV infection of T cells, macrophages, ex vivo human tonsillar tissues, and transgenic rats in vivo, as well as trans-HIV infection of T cells by dendritic or epithelial cells. Amyloidogenic PAP fragments are abundant in seminal fluid and boost semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. Thus, they may play an important role in sexual transmission of HIV and could represent new targets for its prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1969307311,"The assimilation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into organic material is quantitatively the most important biosynthetic process. We discovered that an autotrophic member of the archaeal order Sulfolobales, Metallosphaera sedula , fixed CO 2 with acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)/propionyl-CoA carboxylase as the key carboxylating enzyme. In this system, one acetyl-CoA and two bicarbonate molecules were reductively converted via 3-hydroxypropionate to succinyl-CoA. This intermediate was reduced to 4-hydroxybutyrate and converted into two acetyl-CoA molecules via 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase. The key genes of this pathway were found not only in Metallosphaera but also in Sulfolobus, Archaeoglobus , and Cenarchaeum species. Moreover, the Global Ocean Sampling database contains half as many 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase sequences as compared with those found for another key photosynthetic CO 2 -fixing enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase. This indicates the importance of this enzyme in global carbon cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1969292035,"PIK3CA , one of the two most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors, codes for p110α, the catalytic subunit of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, isoform α (PI3Kα, p110α/p85). Here, we report a 3.0 angstrom resolution structure of a complex between p110α and a polypeptide containing the p110α-binding domains of p85α, a protein required for its enzymatic activity. The structure shows that many of the mutations occur at residues lying at the interfaces between p110α and p85α or between the kinase domain of p110α and other domains within the catalytic subunit. Disruptions of these interactions are likely to affect the regulation of kinase activity by p85 or the catalytic activity of the enzyme, respectively. In addition to providing new insights about the structure of PI3Kα, these results suggest specific mechanisms for the effect of oncogenic mutations in p110α and p85α."
https://openalex.org/W2080371836,"The worldwide decline in amphibians has been attributed to several causes, especially habitat loss and disease. We identified a further factor, namely “habitat split”—defined as human-induced disconnection between habitats used by different life history stages of a species—which forces forest-associated amphibians with aquatic larvae to make risky breeding migrations between suitable aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found that habitat split negatively affects the richness of species with aquatic larvae but not the richness of species with terrestrial development (the latter can complete their life cycle inside forest remnants). This mechanism helps to explain why species with aquatic larvae have the highest incidence of population decline. These findings reinforce the need for the conservation and restoration of riparian vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2023348831,"COMPASS, the yeast homolog of the mammalian MLL complex, is a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylase consisting of Set1 (KMT2) and seven other polypeptides, including Cps35, the only essential subunit. Histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 is required for both H3K4 methylation by COMPASS, and H3K79 methylation by Dot1. However, the molecular mechanism for such histone crosstalk is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that histone H2B monoubiquitination controls the binding of Cps35 with COMPASS complex. Cps 35 is required for COMPASS' catalytic activity in vivo, and the addition of exogenous purified Cps35 to COMPASS purified from a Deltarad6 background results in the generation of a methylation competent COMPASS. Cps35 associates with the chromatin of COMPASS-regulated genes in a H2BK123 monoubiquitination-dependent but Set1-independent manner. Cps35 is also required for proper H3K79 trimethylation. These findings offer insight into the molecular role of Cps35 in translating the H2B monoubiquitination signal into H3 methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2056889742,"Animals and fungi assemble a contractile ring of actin filaments and the motor protein myosin to separate into individual daughter cells during cytokinesis. We used fluorescence microscopy of live fission yeast cells to observe that membrane-bound nodes containing myosin were broadly distributed around the cell equator and assembled into a contractile ring through stochastic motions, after a meshwork of dynamic actin filaments appeared. Analysis of node motions and numerical simulations supported a mechanism whereby transient connections are established when myosins in one node capture and exert force on actin filaments growing from other nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2102851297,"Rather than benefiting wild fish, industrial aquaculture may contribute to declines in ocean fisheries and ecosystems. Farm salmon are commonly infected with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which are native ectoparasitic copepods. We show that recurrent louse infestations of wild juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), all associated with salmon farms, have depressed wild pink salmon populations and placed them on a trajectory toward rapid local extinction. The louse-induced mortality of pink salmon is commonly over 80% and exceeds previous fishing mortality. If outbreaks continue, then local extinction is certain, and a 99% collapse in pink salmon population abundance is expected in four salmon generations. These results suggest that salmon farms can cause parasite outbreaks that erode the capacity of a coastal ecosystem to support wild salmon populations."
https://openalex.org/W2016683110,"We describe a method for storing sequences of optical data pulses by converting them into long-lived acoustic excitations in an optical fiber through the process of stimulated Brillouin scattering. These stored pulses can be retrieved later, after a time interval limited by the lifetime of the acoustic excitation. In the experiment reported here, smooth 2-nanosecond-long pulses are stored for up to 12 nanoseconds with good readout efficiency: 29% at 4-nanosecond storage time and 2% at 12 nanoseconds. This method thus can potentially store data packets that are many bits long. It can be implemented at any wavelength where the fiber is transparent and can be incorporated into existing telecommunication networks because it operates using only commercially available components at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2086270531,"A Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a massive weather event consisting of deep convection coupled with atmospheric circulation, moving slowly eastward over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Despite its enormous influence on many weather and climate systems worldwide, it has proven very difficult to simulate an MJO because of assumptions about cumulus clouds in global meteorological models. Using a model that allows direct coupling of the atmospheric circulation and clouds, we successfully simulated the slow eastward migration of an MJO event. Topography, the zonal sea surface temperature gradient, and interplay between eastward- and westward-propagating signals controlled the timing of the eastward transition of the convective center. Our results demonstrate the potential making of month-long MJO predictions when global cloud-resolving models with realistic initial conditions are used."
https://openalex.org/W2072094407,"Mudstones make up the majority of the geological record. However, it is difficult to reconstruct the complex processes of mud deposition in the laboratory, such as the clumping of particles into floccules. Using flume experiments, we have investigated the bedload transport and deposition of clay floccules and find that this occurs at flow velocities that transport and deposit sand. Deposition-prone floccules form over a wide range of experimental conditions, which suggests an underlying universal process. Floccule ripples develop into low-angle foresets and mud beds that appear laminated after postdepositional compaction, but the layers retain signs of floccule ripple bedding that would be detectable in the rock record. Because mudstones were long thought to record low-energy conditions of offshore and deeper water environments, our results call for reevaluation of published interpretations of ancient mudstone successions and derived paleoceanographic conditions."

The parasite divides within an intraerythrocytic parasitophorous vacuole until rupture of the vacuole and host-cell membranes releases merozoites that invade fresh erythrocytes to repeat the cycle. Despite the importance of merozoite egress for disease progression, none of the molecular factors involved are known. We report that, just prior to egress, an essential serine protease called PfSUB1 is discharged from previously unrecognized parasite organelles (termed exonemes) into the parasitophorous vacuole space. There, PfSUB1 mediates the proteolytic maturation of at least two essential members of another enzyme family called SERA. Pharmacological blockade of PfSUB1 inhibits egress and ablates the invasive capacity of released merozoites.

Our findings reveal the presence in the malarial parasitophorous vacuole of a regulated, PfSUB1-mediated proteolytic processing event required for release of viable parasites from the host erythrocyte. Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. The parasite life-cycle is divided between a vertebrate host and a mosquito vector. Clinical manifestations of malaria are caused by the asexual blood stage life cycle. The parasite invades erythrocytes to form a ring which undergoes mitotic replication within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) to become a schizont. This eventually ruptures in a process known as egress, releasing invasive merozoites which invade fresh erythrocytes to repeat the cycle. The molecular events leading to egress are obscure, but studies using broad-spectrum protease inhibitors have strongly implicated parasite protease activity (Delplace et al., 1988Delplace P. Bhatia A. Cagnard M. Camus D. Colombet G. Debrabant A. Dubremetz J.F. Dubreuil N. Prensier G.

Particular interest has focused on members of the serine-rich antigen (SERA) family of malarial papain-like proteins. Disruption of the SERA8 gene prevents release of sporozoites from oocysts in the insect vector (Aly and Matuschewski, 2005Aly A.S. Matuschewski K. A malarial cysteine protease is necessary for Plasmodium sporozoite egress from oocysts.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Also, antibodies against the most abundant blood-stage family member, SERA5, interfere with merozoite egress (Pang et al., 1999Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T.

Delorenzi M. Sanders P.R. Hodder A.N. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S.

However direct evidence for a role for these or any other known malarial proteases in egress of blood-stage merozoites is lacking, and the cellular mechanisms that govern this essential, highly regulated event are unknown. The genome of P. falciparum, the species causing the most virulent form of malaria, encodes three subtilisin-like serine proteases (subtilases). Of these, PfSUB3 is not essential in asexual blood stages (R.O., unpublished data), while PfSUB2 was recently identified as the ‘sheddase’ responsible for the release of merozoite surface proteins during erythrocyte invasion (Harris et al., 2005Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. Molecular identification of a malaria merozoite surface sheddase.PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The third P. falciparum subtilase, PfSUB1, is maximally expressed in the final stages of schizont maturation (Blackman et al., 1998Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. A subtilisin-like protein in secretory organelles of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Production of recombinant PfSUB1 has enabled studies of its substrate specificity and the development of a simple activity assay (Blackman et al., 2002Blackman M.J. Corrie J.E. Croney J.C. Kelly G. Eccleston J.F. Jameson D.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of PfSUB1 has highlighted distinctive structural features as well as similarities to bacterial subtilisins (Withers-Martinez et al., 2002Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. Expression of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum subtilisin-like protease-1 in insect cells: Characterization, comparison with the parasite protease, and homology modelling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PfSUB1 may be a target for the development of selective protease inhibitor-based antimalarial drugs. However, the function of PfSUB1 has remained elusive. Here, we show that that the pfsub1 gene is refractory to disruption in blood stages, indicating that it performs an essential task. We demonstrate that PfSUB1 is stored in a set of parasite organelles that are distinct from those involved in invasion. Using a high-throughput screen, we isolated a selective inhibitor of PfSUB1 and used it in “chemical knockdown” studies. Our results provide the first insights into the role of PfSUB1 and reveal a hitherto unsuspected regulatory pathway in which discharge of PfSUB1 into the PV in the final stages of schizont maturation triggers a series of proteolytic events that culminate in egress of invasive merozoites. To investigate the function of PfSUB1, we first determined whether it is required for blood-stage growth. Parasites were transfected with a construct designed to disrupt the pfsub1 gene by double homologous recombination (Duraisingh et al., 2002Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Negative selection of Plasmodium falciparum reveals targeted gene deletion by double crossover recombination.Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This did not integrate, as determined by Southern blot analysis, but was maintained in episomal form for up to five drug cycles (data not shown). In contrast, in parallel experiments this approach was successfully used to disrupt the pfsub3 gene (R.O., unpublished data). We next attempted to modify the pfsub1 gene by fusion of its 3′ end to green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a single-crossover homologous recombination strategy (Harris et al., 2005Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. Molecular identification of a malaria merozoite surface sheddase.PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Again, repeated transfections resulted only in long-term maintenance of episomes (data not shown). These results suggested either that modifications of the pfsub1 gene that interfere with its function are deleterious, or that the locus is inaccessible to homologous recombination. To test both possibilities, we attempted to more subtly modify the gene. Parasites were independently transfected with four related constructs, each designed to integrate into the genomic pfsub1 locus by single-crossover homologous recombination with the result of reconstituting a complete open reading frame (ORF) while simultaneously introducing a C-terminal triple haemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). Constructs pPfSUB1HA3 and pPfSUB1HA3-UTtrun contained targeting sequence comprising the extreme 3′ 943 bp of the authentic pfsub1 ORF. Constructs pPfSUB1chiHA3 and pPfSUB1chiHA3 mut contained a shorter targeting fragment of the authentic pfsub1 gene, fused in frame to synthetic “recodonised” sequence encoding the C-terminal part of PfSUB1. The synthetic gene shares low identity at the nucleotide level with the authentic pfsub1 sequence, so these two constructs were expected to crossover only upstream of the catalytic Ser codon (Ser608), with the predicted result of creating a chimeric modified pfsub1 locus; in the case of pPfSUB1chiHA3 this would encode wild-type, catalytically active PfSUB1, whereas in the case of pPfSUB1chiHA3 mut the chimeric gene product would possess an Ala substitution of Ser608, and so would lack proteolytic activity (Figure S1A). PfSUB1 coding sequences in constructs pPfSUB1HA3, pPfSUB1chiHA3 and pPfSUB1chiHA3 mut were flanked by the 848 bp-long 3′ UTR of the P. berghei dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene to ensure correct transcription termination and polyadenylation of the modified gene, whereas pPfSUB1HA3-UTtrun contained instead a severely truncated form of the same 3′ UTR. Truncation of 3′ UTR sequences in several eukaryotes including Plasmodium can reduce gene expression, so integration of this plasmid was predicted to downregulate or ablate PfSUB1 expression. After two drug cycles, PCR analysis indicated integration of pPfSUB1HA3 and pPfSUB1chiHA3 into the parasite genome (Figure S1B). In contrast, no integration of the other two constructs could be detected, suggesting that integration was detrimental to parasite growth. Since the chimeric constructs were intended solely to test the requirement for catalytically active PfSUB1, work with the pPfSUB1chiHA3-transfected line was not progressed further. The pPfSUB1HA3-transfected parasite line (called 3D7SUB1HA3) was cloned by limiting dilution. Analysis of two clones, C10 and F7, confirmed that the input plasmid had integrated through the expected single-crossover homologous recombination event, placing the HA3 tag at the 3′ end of the pfsub1 gene (Figures S1C and S1D). Western blot confirmed expression of epitope-tagged PfSUB1 (Figure S2A). Neither clone displayed any defect in growth rate compared to the parental 3D7 line (data not shown), indicating that neither fusion to the HA3 tag nor replacement of the pfsub1 3′ UTR with the full-length P. berghei dhfr 3′ UTR affected parasite growth. These results prove that the pfsub1 locus is accessible to homologous recombination. Collectively, our ability to epitope-tag the pfsub1 gene together with our inability to disrupt it, fuse it to GFP, substitute its catalytic Ser codon, or replace its 3′ UTR with a truncated 3′ UTR, strongly suggests that PfSUB1 activity is essential for maintenance of the asexual erythrocytic life cycle of the parasite. Previous studies suggested that PfSUB1 accumulates in subcellular organelles that are distinct from micronemes and rhoptries (secretory organelles at the apical end of the merozoite involved in invasion) but that resemble a third class of secretory vesicles called dense granules (Blackman et al., 1998Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. A subtilisin-like protein in secretory organelles of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We exploited the epitope-tagged PfSUB1 (PfSUB1HA3) expressed by the 3D7SUB1HA3 clones to re-examine this localization. Double immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) confirmed that PfSUB1HA3 resides in a set of organelles that are neither rhoptries nor micronemes. Unexpectedly, PfSUB1HA3 also did not colocalize with the dense granule marker, RESA (Figure 1A). Identical results were obtained using a specific rabbit antiserum to detect PfSUB1; importantly, the signal obtained with this colocalized with the anti-HA signal in the 3D7SUB1HA3 clones, validating the rabbit antibodies (Figure S2B). Dual-labeling immunoelectron microscopy (Figures 1B–1G and S3) confirmed the presence of PfSUB1 and RESA in different organelles. Although these shared the electron-dense character typical of dense granules, the PfSUB1-containing structures appeared less numerous than the RESA-containing organelles and were typically larger and elongate (mean dimensions from a sample of 10 was 101 × 60 nm, in contrast to the more spheroidal RESA-containing dense granules with mean dimensions of 72 × 63 nm). A characteristic of dense granules in apicomplexan parasites is that they are discharged predominantly following host cell invasion. Thus, RESA is released from merozoites soon after invasion and translocates to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton (Aikawa et al., 1990Aikawa M. Torii M. Sjolander A. Berzins K. Perlmann P. Miller L.H. Pf155/RESA antigen is localized in dense granules of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites.Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Culvenor et al., 1991Culvenor J.G. Day K.P. Anders R.F. Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen is released from merozoite dense granules after erythrocyte invasion.Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of rhoptry proteins are also present in the newly-invaded host cell, including RAP2 (Baldi et al., 2000Baldi D.L. Andrews K.T. Waller R.F. Roos D.S. Howard R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. RAP1 controls rhoptry targeting of RAP2 in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As expected, IFA of newly-invaded ring stage parasites of the 3D7SUB1HA3 clones confirmed the presence of RESA at the host erythrocyte membrane; however, PfSUB1HA3 was not detected (Figure 2A), despite the fact that the IFA signals for both proteins were of similar intensity in schizonts. Western blot confirmed this; whereas both RAP2 and RESA (Figures 2B and 2C) were readily detected in ring-stage extracts, no PfSUB1HA3 signal was evident. In contrast, culture supernatants sampled following schizont rupture contained a strong PfSUB1HA3 signal (Figure 2C), suggesting that PfSUB1 is quantitatively released into culture media at schizont rupture. The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite undergoes nuclear division as a syncytium, until cytokinesis (“segmentation”) and budding of individual merozoites in the final stages of schizogony. To establish more precisely the point at which PfSUB1 release takes place, we examined highly mature, segmented 3D7SUB1HA3 schizonts by IFA. This revealed that late in schizogony the PfSUB1HA3 IFA signal became less dot-like, more diffuse and largely located to the periphery of intracellular merozoites. Dual labeling with an antibody to the merozoite plasma membrane marker MSP1 supported this, suggesting that near the end of schizogony PfSUB1 can translocate from its previous organellar location into the PV (Figure 2D). Additionally, where bursting schizonts were visible, the free merozoites were surrounded by a “cloud” of anti-HA signal, suggesting that at the point of egress PfSUB1 discharge had already begun (Figure 2E). Our results show that PfSUB1 defines a set of subcellular vesicles that are distinct from the three previously described types of Plasmodium secretory organelle. The fact that PfSUB1 is released from these vesicles, which we term “exonemes,” just prior to schizont rupture suggested that the role of PfSUB1 is related not to invasion, but to some pre-invasion proteolytic event. We previously described an assay for PfSUB1 activity using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Blackman et al., 2002Blackman M.J. Corrie J.E. Croney J.C. Kelly G. Eccleston J.F. Jameson D.M. Structural and biochemical characterization of a fluorogenic rhodamine-labeled malarial protease substrate.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12244-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To identify small molecule inhibitors of PfSUB1 suitable for investigation of its function, we adapted this assay to an automated, 384-well microplate format and used it to screen over 170,000 low molecular weight compounds from a number of commercial and proprietary sources (see Supplemental Data for details of the screen). This resulted in identification of a potent PfSUB1 inhibitor called MRT12113 (Figure 3A). Secondary assays confirmed that MRT12113 was a fast-acting inhibitor of PfSUB1 with an IC50 of 0.3 μM (Figure 3B). In contrast, at concentrations of up to 50 μM MRT12113 displayed no inhibition of any other protease tested, including the related bacterial subtilisins BPN' and Carlsberg, the mammalian serine proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, the cysteine protease papain, human caspase-3, the P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain 2, the P. falciparum aspartic protease plasmepsin II, and the P. falciparum sheddase PfSUB2 (data not shown; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for protocols). These data indicated that MRT12113 is a highly selective inhibitor of PfSUB1. Consistent with this, MRT12113 showed no toxicity against mammalian COS-7 cells or against an organism related to the malaria parasite, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, even when present in cultures for extended periods (up to 7 days) at a concentration of 125 μM (data not shown). On the basis of its high selectivity for PfSUB1, MRT12113 was deemed suitable for studies of PfSUB1 function in the parasite. Addition of MRT12113 to synchronous P. falciparum cultures at up to 250 μM had no effect on intracellular parasite growth over the majority of the erythrocytic life cycle (data not shown). However at the end of the cycle partial inhibition of schizont rupture was observed and invasion by those merozoites that were released was reduced, as evidenced by an accumulation of unruptured schizonts, a decrease in ring formation and the presence of numerous free extracellular merozoites (Figure 3C). These dual effects of MRT12113 were dose-dependent, with an ED50 against schizont rupture of ∼180 μM (Figure 3D), and a much lower ED50 against invasion of ∼25 μM (Figure 3E). To dissect the mechanistic basis of these effects, schizonts were cultured in the presence of high concentrations of MRT12113 and culture supernatants analyzed by SDS PAGE. MRT12113 produced an overall decrease in protein content compared to control supernatants, due to the inhibition of schizont rupture. However, close examination of the gels revealed changes in the relative abundance of two prominent species; a ∼120 kDa protein, levels of which were increased, and a ∼50 kDa protein, which almost disappeared in the presence of MRT12113 (Figure 4A). Tryptic peptide mapping (Tables S1 and S2) identified both polypeptides as being derived from the P. falciparum protein SERA5. SERA5 is an abundant, soluble protein of the P. falciparum PV. Expressed as a precursor of ∼126 kDa (SERA5 P126), it undergoes extensive proteolytic processing (Figure 4B) (Debrabant et al., 1992Debrabant A. Maes P. Delplace P. Dubremetz J.F. Tartar A. Camus D. Intramolecular mapping of Plasmodium falciparum P126 proteolytic fragments by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.Mol. Biochem.

Characterization of proteases involved in the processing of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA).Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SERA5 P126 is initially converted to a ∼47 kDa N-terminal and an ∼73 kDa C-terminal fragment (P47 and P73). P73 is further cleaved to produce P56, which derives from the central region of the precursor, plus P18. P47 can also undergo further cleavage, although this only occurs in some allelic forms of SERA5 (Li et al., 2002bLi J. Mitamura T. Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Differential localization of processed fragments of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen and further processing of its N-terminal 47 kDa fragment.Parasitol. Int. 2002; 51: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). P56 is finally truncated at its C terminus to produce P50. Importantly, P50 is abundant in culture supernatants following schizont rupture, but processed forms of SERA5 are not prominent in schizonts, suggesting that processing occurs rapidly just prior to or at the point of egress. Previous studies have indicated that a parasite serine protease plus at least one other enzyme are involved in SERA5 processing, but their identities are unknown (Debrabant and Delplace, 1989Debrabant A. Delplace P. Leupeptin alters the proteolytic processing of P126, the major parasitophorous vacuole antigen of Plasmodium falciparum.Mol. Biochem.

Characterization of proteases involved in the processing of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA).Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interest has focused on SERA5 for a number of reasons, including the presence of a papain-like central domain containing a Ser residue in place of the putative catalytic Cys. SERA5 therefore resembles a protease, and indeed a recombinant form of SERA5 displays chymotrypsin-like activity (Hodder et al., 2003Hodder A.N. Drew D.R. Epa V.C. Delorenzi M. Bourgon R. Miller S.K. Moritz R.L. Frecklington D.F. Simpson R.J. Speed T.P. et al.Enzymic, phylogenetic, and structural characterization of the unusual papain-like protease domain of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48169-48177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Attempts to disrupt the SERA5 gene have been unsuccessful, suggesting it is important for blood-stage growth (Miller et al., 2002Miller S.K. Good R.T. Drew D.R. Delorenzi M. Sanders P.R. Hodder A.N. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S. A subset of Plasmodium falciparum SERA genes are expressed and appear to play an important role in the erythrocytic cycle.J. Biol.

Immun. 2007; (in press Published online September 24, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00405.07Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations indicated that blockade of PfSUB1 activity with MRT12113 inhibits SERA5 processing. We confirmed this using a SERA5-specific mAb to probe extracts and culture supernatants from schizonts cultured with MRT12113 (Figure 4C); the compound blocked the small amount of SERA5 processing detectable in the parasite, and resulted in accumulation of SERA5 P126 in culture supernatants. These results suggested that PfSUB1 plays a role in SERA5 processing. They also implied that PfSUB1 can access SERA5 intracellularly (presumably in the PV) just prior to its release into culture supernatants at egress. Furthermore, given the inhibitory effects of MRT12113 on schizont rupture and merozoite invasion, they suggested that SERA5 processing by PfSUB1 is important for release of invasive merozoites. To test directly whether SERA5 can be correctly processed by PfSUB1, SERA5 P126 was purified from schizont extracts (Figure S4) and incubated with recombinant PfSUB1 (rPfSUB1). This resulted in rapid conversion to the P56 form via the P73 intermediate (Figure 5A). No conversion to P50 occurred, consistent with previous reports that this last step of SERA5 processing is mediated by a distinct, leupeptin-sensitive activity (Debrabant and Delplace, 1989Debrabant A. Delplace P. Leupeptin alters the proteolytic processing of P126, the major parasitophorous vacuole antigen of Plasmodium falciparum.Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2002; 120: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that PfSUB1 is insensitive to leupeptin (Withers-Martinez et al., 2002Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. Expression of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum subtilisin-like protease-1 in insect cells: Characterization, comparison with the parasite protease, and homology modelling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An identical profile of processing was seen using SERA5 P126 that had been treated during purification with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Figure 5A). Also, processing was completely sensitive to MRT12113 even if added after processing had commenced (Figure 5B), demonstrating that all the observed processing was mediated directly by PfSUB1 and was not the result of autocatalytic maturation of SERA5 triggered by the presence of PfSUB1. To establish whether the cleavage mimicked authentic SERA5 processing, we examined larger amounts of rPfSUB1-processed SERA5 P126 by silver-staining. This allowed us to detect all the products of cleavage (Figure 5C). N-terminal sequencing confirmed correct cleavage at the known sites 1 and 2, and mapped a third, allele-specific processing site (site 3) described by Li et al., 2002bLi J. Mitamura T. Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Differential localization of processed fragments of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen and further processing of its N-terminal 47 kDa fragment.Parasitol. Int. 2002; 51: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar but not previously precisely defined. These results suggested that SERA5 is an authentic physiological substrate for PfSUB1. By analogy with other processing proteases we predicted that peptides based on the SERA5 processing sites would be substrates for PfSUB1. To explore this, peptides incorporating SERA5 processing sites 1, 2, and 3 were assessed for susceptibility to PfSUB1 cleavage. Synthetic decapeptides Ac-TVRGDTEPIS, Ac-EIKAETEDDD and Ac-IIFGQDTAGS—but not similar peptides with a P1 or P2 Leu substitution—were rapidly and specifically cleaved by rPfSUB1 at the expected Asp-Thr, Glu-Thr and Gln-Asp bonds respectively (data not shown). To quantify this, two fluorogenic derivatives were produced by labeling the site 1 and site 2-related peptides Ac-CIKAETEDDC and Ac-CIFGQDTAGC with 6 iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine (6-IATR). These peptides, named SERAst1F-6R and SERAst2F-6R respectively, were also cleaved"

Differential phosphorylation of serine-2 and serine-5 at the 5' and 3' regions of genes appears to coordinate the localization of transcription and RNA processing factors to the elongating polymerase complex. Using monoclonal antibodies, we reveal serine-7 phosphorylation on transcribed genes. This position does not appear to be phosphorylated in CTDs of less than 20 consensus repeats. The position of repeats where serine-7 is substituted influenced the appearance of distinct phosphorylated forms, suggesting functional differences between CTD regions. Our results indicate that restriction of serine-7 epitopes to the Linker-proximal region limits CTD phosphorylation patterns and is a requirement for optimal gene expression."

Results from these studies have been very perplexing. Specifically, it is unknown why PGC-1α null mice are not prone to becoming insulin-resistant (14Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J.

These observations are completely contrary to the PGC-1α-induced insulin-sensitizing effects observed in C2C12 and L6 cells (3Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the available evidence, in vivo, it is unclear whether PGC-1α has an insulin-sensitizing effect in mammalian muscle. There is now some question as to whether PGC-1α-overexpressing or null animals are appropriate models (19Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), given the unexpected phenotypes that occur. For example, some PGC-1α null mice are hyperactive (18Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T.

These anomalies may interfere with muscle function and metabolism, either when PGC-1α is massively overexpressed or when it is ablated.

This remains to be determined. Transfecting PGC-1α into a single rodent muscle in vivo, such as we have done for other genes (21Clarke D.C. Miskovic D. Han X.X. Calles-Escandon J. Glatz J.F.

Therefore, in this study, we have examined the following: the relationship between the endogenous PGC-1α protein expression and the oxidative capacity and selected metabolic proteins in six metabolically heterogeneous rat skeletal muscles. In addition, we have also determined whether the overexpression of PGC-1α in muscle increased the following: (a) glucose (GLUT4) and fatty acid (FAT/CD36, FABPpm) transport proteins; (b) selected proteins in SS and IMF mitochondria; (c) selected insulin-signaling proteins; (d) intramuscular content of triacylglycerol; (e) rates of fatty acid oxidation in isolated SS and IMF mitochondria; and (f) rates of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Our study reveals for the first time that a modest overexpression of PGC-1α is sufficient to observe improvements in the following: (i) SS but not IMF mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and (ii) in insulin sensitivity in mammalian skeletal muscle. [1-14C]Palmitate and [3H]3-O-methyl glucose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Insulin (Humulin-R) was purchased from Lilly. Proteins were determined with commercially available antibodies from the following sources: PGC-1α from Calbiochem; anti-Akt2, anti-IRS-1, anti-AMPKα2, and anti-PI 3-kinase from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Akt2 (phosphoserine 474) from Abcam (Cambridge MA); anti-GLUT4 from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); anti-CoxIV from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody from Amersham Biosciences.

(Hull, UK). Isoflurane was obtained from Baxter Corp. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼350 g) were used in all experiments. All animals were bred on site and housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12:12 h reversed light/dark cycle. Rats were fed water and standard rat chow ad libitum. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Guelph.

Metabolically heterogeneous skeletal muscles (extensor digitorum longus (EDL), RTA, white tibialis anterior (WTA), plantaris (PL), soleus, red gastrocnemius (RG), and white gastrocnemius (WG)) were excised, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C for future analysis.

Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were subsequently quantified by densitometry by Gene Tool as per the manufacturer's instructions (SynGene, ChemiGenius2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and to enable normalization for purposes of densitometry. Muscle Fiber Composition–The muscle fiber compositions of metabolically heterogeneous rat hindlimb muscles (EDL, RTA, WTA, soleus, PL, RG, and WG) were also determined in a separate group of animals. For all muscles, serial cross-sections (10 μm) were stained for myofibrillar ATPase and succinate dehydrogenase from which we determined their physiologic and metabolic characteristics (26Armstrong R.B.

Spiegelman, Harvard University, Boston) was produced by subcloning the PGC-1α coding sequence into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA 1.0) (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3.0 vector was used for control experiments (Invitrogen). PGC-1α-pcDNA and pcDNA3.0 plasmid stocks for electroporation were produced by large scale plasmid isolation from transformed Escherichia coli cells (One-Shot® Invitrogen) using commercially available kits (GIGA-prep kits, Invitrogen).

Although many mechanisms for the anticancer activities of EGCG have been proposed based mainly on studies in cell lines (4Yang C.S. Sang S. Lambert J.D. Hou Z. Ju J. Lu G. Mol. Nutr.

Recently, we have identified 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) as a cell surface EGCG receptor that mediates the anticancer action of EGCG (8Tachibana H. Koga K. Fujimura Y. Yamada K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Castronovo V. Tagliabue E. Sobel M.E. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 67: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The expression level of this protein strongly correlates with the risk of tumor invasion and metastasis (10Menard S. Castronovo V. Tagliabue E. Sobel M.E. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 67: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Martignone S. Menard S. Bufalino R. Cascinelli N. Pellegrini R. Tagliabue E. Andreola S. Rilke F. Colnaghi M.I. J. Natl.

Treat. 1998; 52: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, it was postulated that 67LR plays a significant role in the tumor progression and speculated that studies conducted to define the function of 67LR could provide a new approach to cancer prevention. In this study, we tried to illuminate the cell signaling pathway mediated after the binding of EGCG to 67LR and its biologic and physiologic significance for the cancer-preventive activity of EGCG in vivo. In an attempt to elucidate the pathways involved in the anticancer action of EGCG, we applied genetic suppressor element (GSE) methodology. GSEs are short cDNA fragments encoding peptides acting as dominant inhibitors of protein function or antisense RNAs inhibiting gene expression (13Roninson I.B. Gudkov A.V. Holzmayer T.A. Kirschling D.J. Kazarov A.R. Zelnick C.R. Mazo I.A. Axenovich S. Thimmapaya R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4023-4028PubMed Google Scholar). GSEs behave as dominant selectable markers for the phenotype associated with the repression of the gene from which they derived, thus allowing identification of this gene. For example, this strategy previously allowed the demonstration that kinesin heavy chain is involved in the control of cell response to various DNA-damaging agents (14Gudkov A.V. Kazarov A.R. Thimmapaya R. Axenovich S.A. Mazo I.A. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To identify genes mediating cell sensitivity to EGCG, we selected GSEs conferring resistance to EGCG. Among genetic elements protecting cells from EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition, we isolated a GSE that encoded the N terminus of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). eEF1A is an important component of the eukaryotic translation apparatus and is also known as a multifunctional protein that is involved in a large number of cellular processes (15Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Proc. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here we show that eEF1A is indispensable for mediating anticancer activity of EGCG, and its protein expression level is up-regulated by EGCG through 67LR. We previously reported that EGCG induces reduction of the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) at Thr-18/Ser-19, and 67LR is essential for the activity of EGCG (16Umeda D. Tachibana H. Yamada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Fujimura Y. Umeda D. Kiyohara Y. Sunada Y. Yamada K. Tachibana H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MRLC phosphorylation controls the activity of myosin II, a major motor protein in animal cells, which is involved in a wide range of processes, including muscle contraction, cell locomotion, cell division, and receptor capping (18Maciver S.K. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MRLC is regulated by two classes of enzymes: MLC kinases and myosin phosphatase (19Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase and Rho-kinase seem to be the two major kinases that phosphorylate MRLC in vitro as well as in vivo (19Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Myosin phosphatase is composed with three subunits: a 37-kDa catalytic subunit, a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function, and a 110–130-kDa myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit (MYPT1) (20Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The activity of myosin phosphatase is known to be regulated by phosphorylation of MYPT1, and two major sites, Thr-696 and Thr-853, have been extensively investigated and identified as an inhibitory site (20Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that EGCG induces reduction of the MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696, resulting in activation of myosin phosphatase, and both 67LR and eEF1A are responsible for the activity of EGCG. Moreover, we show that each of 67LR, eEF1A, and MYPT1 is indispensable for mediating EGCG signaling for cancer prevention in vivo. These results suggest that both eEF1A and MYPT1 are implicated in the EGCG signaling pathway through 67LR. Materials and AntibodiesEGCG, catalase, laminin, and anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Y-27632 was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-67LR (F-18), anti-phospho-MRLC (Thr-18/Ser-19), anti-MLC2 (FL-172), anti-eEF1A (CBP-KK1), and anti-MYPT1 (H-130) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-MYPT1 (Thr-696) and anti-phospho-MYPT1 (Thr-853) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture and DNA TransfectionB16 (a mouse melanoma), HepG2 (a human hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (a human breast carcinoma), HeLa (a human cervical carcinoma), and A431 (a human epidermoid carcinoma) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% (for B16 cells) or 10% (for the other cells) FBS. To assess cell proliferation, cells were treated with EGCG at the indicated concentrations for the indicated time periods in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (for B16 cells) or 2% (for the other cells) FBS, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 200 units/ml catalase. FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transient and stable transfection of cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol. For selecting stable clones, transfected cells were grown in medium containing G418 for neomycin resistance or hygromycin B for hygromycin resistance. Preparation of a GSE cDNA LibraryA GSE cDNA library was prepared from mouse embryo cDNA library (ML8000BB) (Clontech). The adaptors that contain ATG translation initiation codon-EcoRI/SphI site-TAG stop codon or SphI/EcoRI site were introduced into BglII/ClaI-digested pLPCX retroviral vector (Clontech), and EcoRI/SphI-digested mouse embryo cDNAs were subcloned into the modified pLPCX vectors. The ligation products were transformed into XL-10-blue, and a portion of the transformation was serially diluted and plated to estimate library complexity. The final GSE cDNA library had a complexity of 1 × 106 independent colonies or greater, with over 83% containing an insert. Library Transduction and EGCG SelectionEcoPack2-293 cells and AmphoPack-293 cells (Clontech) were transfected with library DNA using FuGene6. The retrovirus-containing culture medium was collected 24, 36, 48, and 60 h later and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Target B16 cells were incubated with viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and 5% FBS. Infection was repeated four times at 12-h intervals. Then the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μm EGCG, 1% FBS, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 200 units/ml catalase and fed every fourth day with the same medium for 3 weeks. Colonies were picked that arose at the concentration of EGCG that markedly reduced the growth of noninfected B16 cells. Total RNA from 107 cells of each clone was reverse transcribed with Moloney mouse leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences) using oligo(dT)20 primer. The product was then amplified by PCR using Ex-Taq polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with primers flanking the multicloning site of pLPCX, pLPCX-S (5′-GATCCGCTAGCGCTACCGGACTCAGAT-3′) and pLPCX-A (5′-CTTTCATTCCCCCCTTTTTCTGGAGAC-3′). PCR fragments were subcloned into the expression vector pTARGET (Promega, Madison, WI) and identified by DNA sequencing, using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). For identification of GSEs conferring EGCG resistance, B16 cells transfected with each of the pTARGET vectors subcloned with individual PCR-amplified cDNAs were treated with EGCG in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 200 units/ml catalase for 96 h. RNA Interference by Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)Target sequences for short hairpin RNAs for 67LR, eEF1A, and MYPT1 are as follows: shRNA for human 67LR, 5′-GGAGGAATTTCAGGGTGAA-3′; shRNA for mouse 67LR, 5′-CCTTCACTAACCAGATCCA-3′; shRNA for human and mouse eEF1A, 5′-TGCACCATGAAGCTTTGAG-3′; shRNA for human and mouse MYPT1, 5′-CTGTTGTAAATGCTGCAGC-3′; shRNA for control, 5′-GCATATGTGCGTACCTAGCAT-3′. The annealed shRNA inserts were cloned into the psiRNA-hH1neo shRNA expression vector (for 67LR shRNA) or the psiRNA-hH1hygro shRNA expression vector (for eEF1A and MYPT1 shRNA) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot AnalysisAfter stimulation, the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm pervanadate. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in 2.5% BSA and incubated with the antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by using the ECL Advance kit (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image-J software. F-actin StainingAfter stimulation, cells on the glass slide were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature. These fixed cells were made permeable by incubating with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking with 1% BSA, Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was applied directly onto the glass slide and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted onto a glass side with a drop of mounting medium. Imaging was performed with a Nikon E600 microscope (Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan). All images were acquired with a digital CCD camera (Nikon Digital Sight DS-5M-L1) and processed with custom software. Tumor Growth in VivoB16 cells were detached and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. 5 × 105 cells in a single cell suspension were injected subcutaneously into the back of C57BL/6N mice (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Yokohama, Japan). They were kept at the Biotron Institute of Kyushu University in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (light on at 8 a.m.) in an air-conditioned room (20 °C and 60% humidity under specific pathogen-free conditions). EGCG was dissolved in vehicle (0.01% ascorbic acid solutions (pH 5.5) adjusted by NaOH). One day before inoculation, drinking water bottles were replaced by 0.1% EGCG or vehicle solutions, and administered solutions were replaced every other day. Tumor sizes were determined every other day via caliper measurements. The tumor volume was measured in two dimensions and calculated as follows: length/2 × width2. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of tumor volumes from 6–7 animals. This experiment was carried out according to the guidelines for animal experiments at the Faculty of Agriculture and the Graduate Course, Kyushu University, and the law (number 105) and notification (number 6) of the Japanese government. Statistical AnalysisData for tumor growth in vivo were analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. The other data were analyzed by Student's t test. A level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Identification of eEF1A as a Component Responsible for Anticancer Activity of EGCGTo search for the mediators of EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition in B16 mouse melanoma cells, we utilized a targeted genetic screen with a GSE complementary DNA library, which was prepared from a mouse embryo (Fig. 1A). Under certain cell culture conditions, EGCG has been shown to produce hydrogen peroxide, which may exert various biological effects on cells (21Hong J. Lu H. Meng X. Ryu J.H. Hara Y. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7241-7246PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between the direct effects of EGCG- and hydrogen peroxide-mediated effects, we examined whether catalase altered the inhibitory effect of EGCG on the cell growth of B16 cells. However, 50–800 units/ml catalase only partially inhibited the EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition; catalase did not completely prevent the effect of EGCG (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest that EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition in B16 cells mainly results not from hydrogen peroxide but from EGCG itself. We expected that the inactivation of genes essential for EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition by GSE sequences would allow cells to escape growth inhibition, continue cell growth, and eventually form cell colonies even in the presence of EGCG. By using this screen, we isolated multiple GSE sequences and individually tested their ability to confer EGCG resistance to B16 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the GSE numbered 3 was the most effective at evading EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition. The sequence for this GSE corresponded to the N terminus of eEF1A, a multifunctional protein that was originally identified as a cofactor for polypeptide elongation (15Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Proc. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of eEF1A in EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition, we used stable RNAi (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) to silence eEF1A expression in B16 cells (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, silencing of eEF1A attenuated the inhibitory effect of 1 μm EGCG on cell growth (Fig. 1D). In contrast, overexpression of eEF1A enhanced the inhibitory effects of 1 μm EGCG on cell growth (supplemental Fig. 2). This concentration is similar to the amount of EGCG found in human plasma after drinking more than two or three cups of green tea (23Yang C.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 134-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). EGCG is the only known polyphenol present in plasma in large proportion (77–90%) in a free form, although the other catechins are highly conjugated with glucuronic acid and/or sulfate group (24Manach C. Williamson G. Morand C. Scalbert A. Rémésy C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 230S-242SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, the activities observed at 1 μm EGCG are relevant to the in vivo situations. Given this, we investigated the effect of oral administration of EGCG on subcutaneous tumor growth in C57BL/6N mice challenged with eEF1A-ablated B16 cells. Tumor growth was significantly retarded in EGCG-administered mice implanted with the B16 cells harboring a control shRNA, whereas tumor growth was not affected by EGCG in the mice implanted with eEF1A-ablated B16 cells (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating that eEF1A is involved in EGCG-induced cancer prevention. EGCG induces growth inhibition in many cell lines; however, the efficacy of inhibition varied, depending on the cell lines used (25Yang C.S. Chung J.Y. Yang G. Chhabra S.K. Lee M.J. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 472S-478SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the expression level of eEF1A in a cell line correlates to the efficacy of EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition in that cell line. We investigated the expression levels of eEF1A in B16 cells and the following human cancer cell lines: hepatoma HepG2, breast carcinoma MCF-7, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and squamous cell carcinoma A431. The levels of eEF1A expression in B16 cells, HepG2 cells, and MCF-7 cells were relatively higher than those in HeLa cells and A431 cells (Fig. 1G). EGCG appeared to display different efficacies of growth inhibition in these cell lines, with estimated IC50 values of 9.7 μm for MCF-7 cells, 22.7 μm for HepG2 cells, 51.6 μm for HeLa cells, and 52.8 μm for A431 cells, respectively (Fig. 1H). The expression level of eEF1A is elevated in cell lines that are more sensitive to the effect of EGCG. These results support our conclusion that eEF1A serves as a mediator for EGCG-induced cancer prevention. EGCG Reduces the Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Induces a Dynamic Remodeling of Actin CytoskeletonPreviously, we reported that EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition may result from the reduction of the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) at Thr-18/Ser-19 through 67LR in HeLa cells (16Umeda D. Tachibana H. Yamada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activity of myosin phosphatase is known to be inhibited by phosphorylation of its targeting subunit MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 (20Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of EGCG on the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853. Intriguingly, although the phosphorylation level at Thr-853 was unaffected by EGCG, EGCG induced the dephosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 in a dose-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, D and E). Further, this effect correlated with EGCG-induced reduction of the MRLC phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A, C, D, and F), suggesting that EGCG activates myosin phosphatase by reducing the MYPT1 phosphorylation level at Thr-696. In addition, we tested the effect of Y-27632, a specific inhibitor for Rho-kinase that phosphorylates MRLC (26Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 27Ueda K. Murata-Hori M. Tatsuka M. Hosoya H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although Y-27632 induced the reduction of the MRLC phosphorylation similarly as EGCG, the MYPT1 phosphorylation level at Thr-696 was not reduced by Y-27632 (Fig. 2G). It has been reported that MYPT1 directs the action of myosin phosphatase to not only MRLC but also other F-actin-binding proteins that influence cell contractility, morphology, and proliferation (28Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Kimura K. Fukata Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that EGCG induces a dynamic remodeling of actin cytoskeleton. The cells treated with EGCG exhibited a filopodial-like structure (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 2H and supplemental Fig. 3, A and B), and then after 3 h, the cell body retracted and left intracellular gaps (supplemental Fig. 3C), suggesting that the EGCG-induced filopodial-like projections are simple residual contact sites that have not yet been released from the substrate. We also found that cells treated with Y-27632 exhibited evident peripheral extensions that were clearly distinct from those of the cells treated with EGCG (indicated by arrows) (Fig. 2H). Together with the results in Fig. 2G, it is suggested that EGCG-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling results from not only the reduction of the MRLC phosphorylation but also the activation of myosin phosphatase. MYPT1 Is Involved in Downstream EGCG Signaling from both 67LR and eEF1AFurther, to establish whether MYPT1 is indeed involved in the suppressive effect of EGCG on MRLC phosphorylation and cell growth, we used stable RNAi to silence MYPT1 expression in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis indicated that stable RNAi for MYPT1 specifically silenced MYPT1 protein expression in HeLa cells with no effect on the expression of 67LR and eEF1A (Fig. 3A). Silencing of MYPT1 prevented both EGCG-induced reduction of the MRLC phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) and cell growth inhibition (Fig. 3C), suggesting that EGCG-induced dephosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 results in the activation of myosin phosphatase and inhibition of cell growth. It has been reported that eEF1A binds to the ankyrin repeat of MYPT1 (31Izawa T. Fukata Y. Kimura T. Iwamatsu A. Dohi K. Kaibuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that both 67LR and eEF1A are upstream signaling components responsible for EGCG-induced dephosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696. To test this hypothesis, we used stable RNAi to silence the expression of 67LR or eEF1A in HeLa cells. We confirmed specific silencing of each target protein by stable RNAi in HeLa cells (Fig. 3D) and attenuation of the inhibitory effect of EGCG on cell growth in these cells (supplemental Fig. 4). In both 67LR-ablated HeLa cells and eEF1A-ablated HeLa cells, the inhibitory effect of EGCG on both the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 and the phosphorylation of MRLC was attenuated (Fig. 3E). In addition, EGCG-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was no longer observed in MYPT1-, eEF1A-, or 67LR-ablated HeLa cells (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that MYPT1 is involved in downstream EGCG signaling from both 67LR and eEF1A. MYPT1 Is Indispensable for Cancer-preventive Activity of EGCG in VivoNext, we investigated whether MYPT1 is involved in anticancer action of EGCG in vivo. In B16 cells, physiological concentrations of EGCG reduced the MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 and the MRLC phosphorylation as shown in Fig. 4A. We confirmed both silencing of MYPT1 by stable RNAi in B16 cells (Fig. 4B) and attenuation of the inhibitory effect of 1 μm EGCG on cell growth in MYPT1-ablated B16 cells in vitro (Fig. 4C). We tested the effect of oral administration of EGCG on subcutaneous tumor growth in C57BL/6N mice challenged with MYPT1-ablated B16 cells. Tumor growth was significantly retarded in EGCG-administered mice implanted with the B16 cells harboring a control shRNA, whereas tumor growth was not affected by EGCG in the mice implanted with MYPT-1-ablated B16 cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that MYPT1 is indispensable for EGCG-induced cancer prevention. Silencing of 67LR Blocks Cancer-preventive Activity of EGCG in VivoAlthough we have identified 67LR as a cell surface receptor for EGCG that mediates EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition (8Tachibana H. Koga K. Fujimura Y. Yamada K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), there is no validation of its implication in EGCG-induced cancer prevention in vivo. We investigated the effect of oral administration of EGCG on subcutaneous tumor growth in C57BL/6N mice challenged with 67LR-ablated B16 cells. We confirmed both silencing of 67LR by stable RNAi in B16 cells (Fig. 5A) and attenuation of the inhibitory effect of 1 μm EGCG on cell growth in 67LR-ablated B16 cells in vitro (Fig. 5B). Tumor growth was significantly retarded in EGCG-administered mice implanted with the B16 cells harboring a control shRNA, whereas tumor growth was not affected by EGCG in the mice implanted with 67LR-ablated B16 cells (Fig. 5, C and D), suggesting that 67LR functions as an EGCG receptor not only in vitro but also in vivo. EGCG Up-regulates eEF1A Protein Expression through 67LRIntriguingly, we found that the protein levels of eEF1A in tumor tissues from mice injected with control shRNA B16 cells were up-regulated by EGCG administration (Fig. 5E, top), whereas the eEF1A protein levels in tumor tissues from mice injected with 67LR-ablated B16 cells were not affected (Fig. 5E, bottom). eEF1A showed a subtle mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Various post-translational modifications of eEF1A have been reported, including phosphorylation (31Izawa T. Fukata Y. Kimura T. Iwamatsu A. Dohi K. Kaibuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2129318435,"In this work the photoprotective role of all xanthophylls in LHCII, Lhcb4, and Lhcb5 is investigated by laser-induced Triplet-minus-Singlet (TmS) spectroscopy. The comparison of native LHCII trimeric complexes with different carotenoid composition shows that the xanthophylls in sites V1 and N1 do not directly contribute to the chlorophyll triplet quenching. The largest part of the triplets is quenched by the lutein bound in site L1, which is located in close proximity to the chlorophylls responsible for the low energy state of the complex. The lutein in the L2 site is also active in triplet quenching, and it shows a longer triplet lifetime than the lutein in the L1 site. This lifetime difference depends on the occupancy of the N1 binding site, where neoxanthin acts as an oxygen barrier, limiting the access of O2 to the inner domain of the Lhc complex, thereby strongly contributing to the photostability. The carotenoid triplet decay of monomeric Lhcb1, Lhcb4, and Lhcb5 is mono-exponential, with shorter lifetimes than observed for trimeric LHCII, suggesting that their inner domains are more accessible for O2. As for trimeric LHCII, only the xanthophylls in sites L1 and L2 are active in triplet quenching. Although the chlorophyll to carotenoid triplet transfer is efficient (95%) in all complexes, it is not perfect, leaving 5% of the chlorophyll triplets unquenched. This effect appears to be intrinsically related to the molecular organization of the Lhcb proteins.

Under normal light conditions, the photosynthetic apparatus is very efficient in harvesting light energy and transferring excitation energy to the reaction center, where it is used to induce charge separation. In high light, when the amount of energy harvested by the system exceeds the capacity for electron transport to available sinks, other de-excitation mechanisms become important (1Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar).

Light-harvesting complexes are protected against singlet-oxygen formation by carotenoids (7Koyama Y. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1991; 9: 265-280Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These isoprenoids can act in two ways: (i) by quenching of Chl triplets (τ = 500 ps (8Schödel R. Irrgang K.D. Voigt J. Renger G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2238-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) and (ii) by directly scavenging singlet oxygen (τ = 0.7 ns in benzene (9Farmilo A. Wilkinson F. Photochem.

Sykes A. Truscott P.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1971; 13: 311-320Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). For these processes to occur, Chls and carotenoids need to be in close contact because triplets are transferred from Chls to carotenoids via the Dexter exchange mechanism (11Siefermann-Harms D.

The close distances are maintained by the proteins, which coordinate the pigments, thereby allowing fast energy transfer and efficient photoprotection.The carotenoid composition of higher plants is highly conserved; the chloroplast-encoded subunits of Photosystem I and Photosystem II core complexes bind β-carotene, whereas the outer antennae, composed of nucleus-encoded light-harvesting complexes (Lhc), accommodate lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin in moderate light, whereas zeaxanthin is produced (12Demmig-Adams B. Winter K. Kruger A. Czygan F.-C. Briggs W.R. Photosynthesis. Plant Biology. 8. Alan R. Liss, New York1989Google Scholar) via de-epoxidation of violaxanthin under light stress conditions.

Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), the major antenna complex of photosystem II, shows the location of four carotenoids. Two xanthophylls are bound in the center of the molecule in sites L1 and L2 which accommodate mainly lutein (14Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A third carotenoid binding site (N1), highly specific for neoxanthin, is located near helix C (15Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The fourth site (V1) is at the periphery of the monomeric subunits, and it accommodates violaxanthin, lutein, or zeaxanthin depending on light conditions (16Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M.

As in LHCII, site L1 binds lutein, N1 neoxanthin, and L2 violaxanthin (in Lhcb4) or lutein (in Lhcb5) (16Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol.

Although there is general agreement on the lifetime values under anaerobic conditions, differences exist with respect to the values measured in the presence of oxygen. Peterman et al. (18Peterman E.J.G. Gradinaru C.C. Calkoen F. Borst J.C. Grondelle van R. Amerongen van H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12208-12215Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) found a biexponential decay of the carotenoid triplets with components of 2 and 4 μs, associated, respectively, to the TmS spectra peaking at 505 and 525 nm; Schödel et al. (30Schödel R. Irrgang K.D. Voigt J. Renger G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3143-3153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) described the decay kinetics with a monoexponential decay of 2 μs, whereas a longer lifetime, around 7 μs, was found by Siefermann-Harms and Angerhofer (27Siefermann-Harms D. Angerhofer A. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 83-94Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the presence of oxygen enhances the intersystem crossing (34Mathis P. Galmiche J.M. Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Seances de l'Academie des Sciences Serie D 264. 1967; 15: 1903-1967Google Scholar), it was suggested that this difference is due to the sample preparation procedure; it was assumed that the faster lifetimes are associated to LHCII complexes that have partly lost their structural integrity, which is required to prevent oxygen from diffusing into the complexes (27Siefermann-Harms D. Angerhofer A. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 83-94Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because most of the xanthophylls have similar absorption spectra, it has not been possible to unequivocally determine how many and which carotenoids contribute to the TmS spectrum. However, due to the very fast energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a (35Visser H.M. Kleima F.J. Stokkum van I.H.M. Grondelle van R. Grondelle van R. Chem. Phys. 1996; 210: 297-312Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is expected that triplets are mainly formed on Chls a, and thus, carotenoids should be located in their close proximity (36Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). At that time the available structure of LHCII (36Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar) showed only the location of the two central xanthophylls, and carotenoid to Chl singlet energy transfer measurements have shown that these xanthophylls transfer their excitation energy primarily to Chl a molecules, supporting the hypothesis that Chls a are in close proximity of luteins L1 and L2 (18Peterman E.J.G.

J. 2001; 80: 901-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Later, Lampoura et al. (32Lampoura S.S. Barzda V. Owen G.M. Hoff A.J. Grondelle van R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) speculated that the violaxanthin in the V1 site could not be involved in triplet quenching since it was not active in singlet energy transfer (17Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and that also the neoxanthin was not involved since it was surrounded by Chl b molecules (15Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, from the 2.72-Å resolution structure of LHCII (13Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) it is now known that at least one Chl a molecule is in close proximity of each xanthophyll; L1 is the carotenoid closest to Chls 610, 612, 613, and 614 (all Chl a according to the structure). L2 is the nearest neighbor of Chls 602 (a), 603 (a), 607 (b), and 609 (b), N1 of Chls 604 (a), 605 (b), 606 (b), and 608 (b), and V1 of Chls 601 (b) and 611 (a). Moreover, in the equilibrated system part of the energy, although small, is still located on Chls b (37Novoderezhkin V.I. Palacios M.A. Grondelle van R. Grondelle van R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 10493-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which thus, might also require triplet quenching. In this work we have investigated the role of all individual xanthophylls in photoprotection by analyzing native LHCII preparations with different carotenoid composition. We also report for the first time on the carotenoid triplet properties of the minor antenna complexes Lhcb4 (CP29) and Lhcb5 (CP26). By combining spectroscopic measurements with structural data on the LHCII holocomplex, we derive detailed information about the functional role of the individual carotenoids in the Lhc antenna complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material—The wild type (WT) and mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) npq2 (38Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and chy1chy2lut5 (39Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were grown under controlled light conditions (photoperiod of 8 h of light and 16 h of dark; 100 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 for WT and npq2; 30 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 for chy1chy2lut5 plants, because of their higher photosensitivity), temperature (23 °C/20 °C, day/night) m and relative air humidity (60–70%).Thylakoid Preparation; Solubilization and Sample Preparation—Unstacked thylakoids were isolated from leaves, as described previously (40Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LHCII trimers from WT and mutants were purified by sucrose gradient as reported (17Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Trimeric WT LHCII was further fractionated by flatbed isoelectrofocusing at 4 °C as described previously (41Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Green bands were harvested and eluted from a small column with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.06%, n-dodecyl-α-d-maltoside (α-DM) and further fractionated on a 0.1–1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.06% α-DM and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 280,000 × g at 4 °C.Reconstituted Complexes—The apoproteins of Lhcb1, Lhcb4 from Zea mays (14Croce R.

Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and Lhcb5 from A. thaliana (38Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were overexpressed in the SG13009 Escherichia coli strain transformed with constructs following a protocol described previously (43Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 44Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kühlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reconstitution and purification of pigment-protein complexes were performed as described in Giuffra et al. (42Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using a Chl a/b mixture with ratio 2.4 for Lhcb1 and 3.0 for Lhcb4 and Lhcb5.Pigment Analysis—The pigments were extracted with acetone (80%) and separated and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography, as described in Gilmore and Yamamoto (45Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and by fitting the spectra of the acetone extracts with the spectra of individual pigments (46Croce R. Cinque G. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Spectroscopy—The absorption spectra at room temperature in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sucrose, and 0.06% d-maltoside were recorded using a SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer. The wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm, the scan rate was 100 nm/min, and the optical path length was 1 cm. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Fluorolog (Jobin Yvon) spectrofluorimeter and were corrected for the instrument response. The samples were excited at 440 and 475 nm. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). The chlorophyll concentration was about 0.02 μg/ml in 10 mm HEPES and 0.03% d-maltoside.Light-induced absorbance changes were recorded with a home-built high sensitivity laser-based spectrophotometer as described in Croce et al. (47Croce R. Mozzo M. Morosinotto T. Romeo A. Hienerwadel R. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3846-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of oxygen. The anaerobic conditions were obtained incubating the sample with 20 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 μg/ml catalase, and 0.02 mm/ml of glucose for 15 min.During the measurements under aerobic conditions, the signal intensity at 510 nm was checked at regular time intervals to detect possible loss of intensity due to bleaching of the sample. This value was used to build a curve of the intensity variation as a function of time to correct the data. The correction was particularly important for LHCII-L and LHCII-LZ, which showed amplitude reduction during the experiment.For a given wavelength the kinetics of the absorbance change were recorded with variable delay times between the actinic and the detection light pulses, ranging from 5 ns to 9 ms. The delay time was obtained by setting the electronic trigger for each laser light pulse. The delay of the light pulses was determined with fast silicon detectors (Thorlabs-Det210). For each kinetic trace, a set of measurements with increasing delay times was performed. The time between excitations was 300 ms. For aerobic conditions, 29 different delay times were taken and 48 delay times for anaerobic conditions. The kinetics were measured 5–10 times and averaged. The GraphPad PRISM program (GraphPad Software) was used for globally analyzing the kinetics between 70 ns and 9 ms over the 420–580-nm wavelength range.RESULTSLHCII trimers were purified from WT plants and mutant plants affected in the carotenoid biosynthesis; that is, npq2, which is blocked at the level of the zeaxanthin epoxidase and accumulates only lutein and zeaxanthin (LHCII-LZ), and chy1chl2lut5, which lacks all the xantophylls in the β-β branch and contains only lutein (LHCII-L). The trimers from WT plants were purified under mild and more aggressive conditions, which led to complexes that differ in the carotenoid/protein ratio (17Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Monomeric LHCII (Lhcb1), Lhcb4, and Lhcb5 were obtained by refolding in vitro.Pigment ContentThe pigment composition of the complexes is reported in Table 1. The two different preparations of LHCII WT, WT4 and WT3, bind 4 and 3 carotenoids, respectively. They differ in the amount of lutein and violaxanthin, in agreement with the absence of the xanthophyll in the V1 site in the complex purified by flatbed isoelectrofocusing (LHCII-WT3), as was shown previously (17Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). LHCII-LZ binds 3.5 carotenoids. The absence of neoxanthin and violaxanthin is partially compensated by the accumulation of zeaxanthin, whereas the amount of lutein is unchanged. The presence of zeaxanthin in LHCII trimers obtained by flatbed isoelectrofocusing (48Connelly J.P. Müller M.G. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) indicates that this xanthophyll also binds to the internal sites (L1 and L2), although it is not possible to discriminate between them. LHCII-L coordinates 2.7 luteins (39Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which are likely to be accommodated in sites L1, L2, and V1, whereas site N1 is empty (49Dall'Osto L. Cazzaniga S. North H. Marion-Poll A. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1048-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Monomeric Lhcb1 coordinates three carotenoids lacking the xanthophylls in the V1 site (50Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Lhcb4 coordinates lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin, which are accommodated in sites L1, L2, and N1, respectively (Table 1). The L1 and N1 sites of Lhcb5 have similar occupancy as those of Lhcb4, whereas the L2 site binds lutein (16Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Caffarri S. Passarini F. Bassi R. Croce R.

The WT minus LHCII-L absorption difference spectrum (Fig. 1B) is identical both in the carotenoid and in the Chl absorption region to the difference spectrum (WT minus Lhcb1-L) obtained for Lhcb1 monomers reconstituted in vitro in which the N1 site is empty (14Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Note the decrease in the absorption of Chl b at 650 nm, which is typical for complexes lacking neoxanthin, and the lack of a 488 nm band, which is the lowest energy absorption maximum of the neoxanthin (15Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It can be concluded that the environment of the neoxanthin does not change upon trimerization.In the difference spectrum WT minus LHCII-LZ (Fig. 1A) a positive band around 490 nm and a negative around 504 nm were detected, corresponding, respectively, to the neoxanthin, which is absent in LHCII-LZ, and the zeaxanthin, which absorbs mainly around 504 nm, in agreement with previous results on recombinant complexes (15Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This difference spectrum is very similar to that of LHCII-WT minus LHCII-L (the sample without neoxanthin), suggesting that the N1 site is at least partially empty, also in LHCII-LZ. No decrease in the absorption at 510 nm is observed, thus suggesting that site L2 still accommodates lutein. Moreover, the main absorption band of zeaxanthin was found at around 504 nm, 18-nm red-shifted as compared with the absorption in solution. This shift is compatible with the binding of zeaxanthin in sites L1 and N1, which induces a similar shift in lutein and neoxanthin absorption in the WT complex (15Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).The WT4-WT3 difference spectrum (not shown) is identical to the one reported by Caffarri et al. (17Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showing the loss of a xanthophyll band around 486 nm.Triplet Minus Singlet SpectraTriplet formation in native and recombinant Lhcb complexes was studied by flash-induced transient absorption under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; 5-ns flashes excited Chl b at 640 nm, and absorption changes were detected in the 420–580-nm range.LHCII Trimers—The decay of the carotenoid triplets in LHCII-WT4 under aerobic conditions could be best fitted by a biexponential decay, the first component having a lifetime of 2.30 μs, a maximum at 507 nm, and a bleaching at 490 nm, and the second component having a lifetime of 3.6 μs, maximum at 522.5 nm, and bleaching at 505 nm (Fig. 2A, Table 2). This indicates that one or more carotenoids absorbing around 490 nm is responsible for the fast decay, whereas a red-shifted xanthophyll (absorption around 505 nm) is responsible for the slower decay. These results are in agreement with those of Peterman et al. (28Peterman E.J.G. Dukker F.M. Grondelle van R. Amerongen van H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2670-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but in disagreement with other TmS experiments which showed a single decay component (8Schödel R. Irrgang K.D. Voigt J. Renger G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2238-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Siefermann-Harms D. Angerhofer A. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 83-94Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The amplitudes of the two components differ; 68% of the total spectrum is associated to the fast decay and 32% to the slow decay, as shown in Fig. 2A. Under anaerobic conditions, the triplet decay is also best fitted with two exponentials. The fast component has a lifetime of 9 μs, maximum at 510 nm, and a shoulder at 522 nm, and it corresponds to Car triplet decay (Fig. 2B, Table 2). The difference in the carotenoid triplet lifetime for aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been observed before (28Peterman E.J.G. Dukker F.M. Grondelle van R. Amerongen van H. Biophys.

The tight packing of DNA into chromatin creates a need for mechanisms to relax chromatin and expose DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair (1Ito T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms used by the cell to access DNA is the post-translational modification of histone tails. Specifically, methylation of histone tails generates a docking site for effector proteins, which aid in the recruitment of other enzymes necessary for the function at hand. In general, methylation of histone residues lysines 4 and 36 on H3 are correlated with active gene regions, whereas methylation of lysines 9 and 27 on H3 is correlated with repressed gene regions, although exceptions exist (2Berger S.L.

The structures further showed important aromatic residues in the PHD that cage the methylated lysine but also revealed critical contacts made between the arginine at the second position of the H3 tail and the PHD (8Pena P.V.

During this same time, the WD40 domain of WDR5 was reported to complex with the H3 tail (10Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The structure of the WD40 repeats of WDR5 revealed arginine 2 of H3, and not lysine 4, buried within the donut hole of the large domain (11Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Specifically, four amino acids in WDR5 critically interact with arginine 2 (11Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, the tudor domains of JMJD2A also bind in an H3K4me3-dependent manner, and again, the H3R2 residue forms critical interactions with an Asp residue of one of the tudor domains (13Huang Y. Fang J. Bedford M.T. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Science. 2006; 312: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The analysis of the structures of these three different domain types bound to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 led us to ask whether methylation of this arginine, reportedly by CARM1 (14Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), could block binding of these domain types to the histone. If true, methylation of arginine 2 would be a critical epigenetic mark that will antagonize lysine 4 methylation by blocking effector protein binding. Currently, little is known about H3R2 methylation, including the in vivo enzyme acting on this site, whether it can exist in combination with H3K4 methylation, and how broad an effect H3R2 methylation has on H3 effector binding. To answer these questions, we screened a collection of PRMTs to identify the H3R2-methylating enzyme. Here we show that PRMT6, an enzyme with restricted nuclear localization (15Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and not CARM1, methylates H3R2 in vitro, and H3R2 methylation is still present in CARM1-null embryos. We also screened a panel of histone binding domains for sensitivity to H3R2 methylation. We found that a large number of H3 binding domains are sensitive to H3R2 methylation and add additional domains to the list of methyl-specific chromatin binders. In vitro methylation experiments show that R2me2 and K4me3 can exist on the same histone molecule. In addition, finally, the transcriptional activity of select genes, known to be affected by the transcriptional regulatory complexes containing the H3R2me2a-sensitive effectors, is altered when PRMT6 levels are reduced or increased. In Vitro Methylation Reactions–The GST-PRMT1, GST-CARM1, and GST-PRMT6 were expressed and purified as described previously (18Cheng D. Cote J. Shaaban S. Bedford M.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In vitro methylation reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH = 7.4). The reaction contained 0.5–1.0 μg of substrate and 1 μg of recombinant GST-PRMT. All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.42 μm [3H]S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (79 Ci/mmol from a 7.5 μm stock solution; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then subjected to fluorography by separation on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, treated with En3Hance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to film for 1–3 days at –80 °C. Acid Extraction of Histones–HEK293 and U2OS cells were grown to 80% confluency. Cells were suspended in reticulocyte standard buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 mm NaCl; 3 mm MgCl2) and then centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, placed on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged again (2500 × g). Nuclei were resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2, an equal volume of 0.8 m HCl was added, and histones were extracted for 20 min on ice. Histones (in supernatant) were precipitated with 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 8,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone and then resuspended in deionized water and 2 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Histological Analysis and Antibodies–E18.5 embryos with their abdomens perforated were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Embryos were sectioned at 3 μm and subjected to immunohistochemical localization ofαCARM1 (Upstate Biotechnology), αH3R2me2a (Abcam), and αH3R17me2a (Upstate Biotechnology). Staining was performed using the En-Vision system (DAKO), and the counterstain was hematoxylin. The H3R2me1 antibody is from Abcam, and the PRMT6 antibody is from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Peptide Pulldowns–Biotinylated histone tail peptides (15 μg) were immobilized on 8 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) in 500 μl of pulldown buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 μm ZnSO4) for 2 h at room temperature. Immobilized peptide bead complexes were washed three times with pulldown buffer. 1 μg of GST fusion protein and 400 μl of pulldown buffer were added to beads and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with pulldown buffer, boiled in protein loading buffer, fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-GST antibody. Stable shRNA Line Generation–Plasmids designed to express shRNAs targeting nucleotides 995–1014 of human PRMT6 (GenBank™ accession number AY043278) were constructed by using pSUPER RNA interference system from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

U2OS cells were then transfected with pSUPERretro vector encoding the PRMT6-shRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A polyclonal population was selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin, and ring cloning was performed. Expression of PRMT6 in each clone was analyzed by Western blots in triplicate. RNA Isolation and Quantitative real-time-PCR–Cells at 80% confluency were trypsinized and collected. The pellet was washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and 10% was used to make a whole cell extract for Western analysis on PRMT6 protein levels. The remaining cells were spun down and then RNA-isolated following the Qiagen RNeasy mini prep manufacturer's protocol. An on-column DNA digestion was performed in each RNA sample preparation. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Applied Biosystems high capacity cDNA archive kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time prevalidated gene primer sets were purchased from the Applied Biosystems “Assays-on-Demand” and analyzed with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT real-time PCR instrument using the TaqMan universal master mix. 18 S RNA was used as the internal control. ChIP Analysis–U2OS cells at 80% confluency were transfected with 20 μg of 3×FLAG-ING2 vector (6Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R.

Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, ChIP analysis was performed following the Upstate Biotechnology ChIP assay kit protocol (catalog number 17-295). For the immunoprecipitation, 2 μgofthe αFLAG antibody (Sigma, catalog number F-3165) was used for each condition and incubated with the cross-linked complexes overnight at 4°C. PCR of the cyclin D1 promoter on the input and isolated DNA was performed using Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech 639201). The cyclin D1 promoter primer sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-GATTTTCTTTCAAACAACGTGGTTAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTTGGTGACCATTTGGAGACA-3′. PRMT6 Is the H3R2 Arginine Methyltransferase–CARM1 is reported to methylate H3R2, based on peptide mapping of in vitro methylated H3 (14Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We decided to further study this using recombinant PRMTs and CARM1 knock-out mice. Based on the previous reports, we hypothesized that CARM1-null embryos would lose immune reactivity with an H3R2me2a-specific antibody. Surprisingly, immunostaining of wild-type and CARM1-null E18.5 embryos reveals a loss of H3R17 methylation, but not of H2R2 methylation, upon CARM1 loss (Fig. 1A). We then performed in vitro methylation experiments on calf thymus core histones using a set of recombinant PRMTs. Both CARM1 and PRMT6 robustly methylated H3 (Fig. 1B). PRMT1 methylates histone H4 and H2A. Next, calf thymus H3 was again methylated in vitro with this same set of PRMTs. The methylated H3 was then used for fluorography and Western analysis, using antibodies specific for histones methylated at different sites. The specificity of the antibodies was tested and only recognizes H3 when modified at the indicated site (data not shown). Surprisingly, although CARM1 dramatically increased the amount of R17 methylation, it did not increase the levels of arginine 2 methylation. PRMT6, and to a lesser degree PRMT1, catalyzed the methylation of H3R2 in vitro (Fig. 1C). Therefore we conclude that PRMT6 is the primary enzyme responsible for H3R2 methylation. Knockdown of PRMT6 Decreases H3R2me2a, whereas Overexpression Increases H3R2me2a–To further validate the data obtained from the in vitro methylation experiments, we overexpressed PRMT6 in HEK293 cells (and HeLa cells, data not shown), which clearly led to an increase in H3R2me2a on bulk histones (Fig. 2A). If overexpression of PRMT6 results in increased H3R2me2a levels, one would expect that by knocking down endogenous PRMT6 levels, we would see a decrease in H3R2me2a methylation levels on bulk histones. Indeed, this is what was observed when we generated a stable PRMT6 knockdown cell line in U2OS cells (Fig. 2B). These data further support the finding that PRMT6 is the H3R2 methyltransferase. H3 Binding Domains Are Sensitive to H3R2 Methylation–The published structures of the ING2 PHD finger, the WDR5 WD40 domain, and the JMJD2A tudor domains all show important contacts between domain residues and arginine 2 of H3. Thus, we were interested in looking at the effects of H3R2 methylation on the binding of these domain types. To address this, we synthesized biotinylated peptide and tested the ability of recombinant PHD, tudor, and WD40 domains to bind unmodified (H3K4me0), H3K4me, and the H3R2me2aK4me3 “dual” modified peptide using a peptide pulldown approach. The selected domains tested included the tudors of JMJD2A, the WD40 domains of WDR5, and several PHD domains that have been reported to bind H3K4me3 (ING2 and BPTF) and others tested here for the first time (PHF2, DATF1, and RAG2). Clearly, the majority of domains tested in this assay are sensitive to H3R2 methylation, as seen by reduced binding to the dual peptide as compared with the H3K4me3 peptide (Fig. 3A). Importantly, not all domains (RAG2-PHD) are sensitive, implying that certain H3-binding proteins are not regulated by this mechanism (19Matthews A.G. Kuo A.J. Ramon-Maiques S. Han S. Champagne K.S. Ivanov D. Gallardo M. Carney D. Cheung P. Ciccone D.N. Walter K.L. Utz P.J. Shi Y. Kutateladze T.G. Yang W. Gozani O.

S. A. 2007; 104: 18993-18998Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). WDR5 binds the unmodified H3 N-terminal tail peptide well, regardless of H3K4 methylation. However, again, we see that H3R2 methylation reduces this binding. PRMT6 Can Methylate H3 Peptides Regardless of Lysine 4 Methylation Levels–Up to this point, it is unknown whether the combination of H3K4me3 and H3R2me2 exists on the same histone molecule in vivo. To address this question, we performed an in vitro methylation experiment using histone peptides. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 1–18 of H3 containing varying degrees of methylation were subjected to in vitro methylation by PRMT6. Fluorography of the peptides revealed that PRMT6 has the ability to methylate all the H3 peptides regardless of the lysine 4 methylation status (Fig. 3B), although methylation of the H3K4me3 substrate is less robust than the other lysine-methylated peptides tested. Thus, PRMT6 can lay down the R2me2 mark, whereas H3K4 is methylated in vitro. The endogenous baseline levels of the dual mark and the stability of the dual mark are currently unknown. However, ChIP-on-chip analysis of these two marks indicate that they do not co-segregate and are in fact mutually exclusive (21Guccione E. Martinato F. Finocchiaro G. Luzi L. Tizzoni L. Dall' Olio V. Zardo G. Nervi C. Bernard L. Amati B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The ability of PRMT6 to in vitro methylate a peptide that is already methylated at H3K4 suggests that this dual modification can exist in vivo and raises the possibility that it is not very stable. Perhaps, after the dual mark is generated, efficient lysine demethylation causes the rapid loss of the H3K4me3 mark. We have not tested the ability of SET domain-containing proteins to methylate an H3R2me2a peptide. A large number of enzymes have been reported to methylate the H3K4 site (22Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). PRMT6 Activity Affects HOXA5 and Cyclin D1 Gene Expression–As H3R2 methylation reduces binding of WDR5 and ING2 chromatin binding domains to H3 N-terminal tail peptides, we hypothesized that the recruitment of these complexes to gene promoters may be hindered when PRMT6 is overexpressed, or conversely, overactive when PRMT6 is knocked down. We collected RNA from mock stably transfected U2OS cells, U2OS cells that were transiently transfected with a PRMT6 expression vector (+PRMT6), and shPRMT6 U2OS cells for real-time PCR analysis on HOXA5 and cyclin D1 genes. The expression of these genes is regulated by the WDR5-MLL and ING2-HDAC1-mSin3a protein complexes (6Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 23Dou Y.

Specifically, the WDR5-MLL complex positively regulates HOXA5 transcription, whereas the ING2-HDAC1 complex negatively regulates cyclin D1 transcription after DNA damage. In agreement with our hypothesis, overexpression of PRMT6 decreased HOXA5 expression, whereas PRMT6 knockdown increased expression more than 2-fold (Fig. 3C). In addition, repression of cyclin D1 after doxorubicin treatment, by the ING2-HDAC1 complex, was very robust in the PRMT6 knockdown cells and weakened in the PRMT6-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D). The robust repression of cyclin D1 after doxorubicin treatment in the shPRMT6 cells is likely due to the increased binding of the ING2 repressive complex; H3R2 methylation antagonizes ING2 binding, and PRMT6 knockdown reduces bulk H3R2 methylation levels. Indeed, ChIP analysis of FLAG-ING2 demonstrates the increased physical association of ING2 at the cyclin D1 locus when PRMT6 is knocked down (Fig. 3, E and F). Here we identified a number of H3-binding proteins sensitive to arginine 2 dimethylation (Fig. 3A). We also showed that the H3R2 can be methylated by PRMT6 when lysine 4 is previously methylated. One can imagine, perhaps during cellular differentiation, PRMT6 being recruited to active genes to start a shutdown procedure. H3R2 methylation by PRMT6 would knock off K4me3-binding proteins and their associated transcriptional coactivators. Following this event, H3K4 demethylases may be recruited to remove this activating mark to permanently silence the region. Supporting this hypothesis, Guccione et al. (21Guccione E. Martinato F. Finocchiaro G. Luzi L. Tizzoni L. Dall' Olio V. Zardo G. Nervi C. Bernard L. Amati B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) show a counter-correlation between R2me2 and K4me3 on genomic regions bound by the transcription factor Myc. Their result implies that the dual mark is transient and/or present at very low amounts. H3K4 demethylase recruitment is one possible mechanism resulting in a transient dual R2K4 modified state on H3. This study highlights the importance of a combinatorial histone code and will open the door to many future studies on the effects adjacent histone modifications have on each other and effector protein binding. Already described is the interplay between H3K9 methylation and H3S10 phosphorylation. Namely, HP1 binding to H3K9me3 is antagonized by H3S10 phosphorylation during mitosis (24Dormann H.L. Tseng B.S. Allis C.D. Funabiki H. Fischle W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We performed a limited screen for genes affected by PRMT6 activity and found that HOXA5 and cyclin D1 expression/repression is responsive to PRMT6 levels, presumably through methylation of H3R2me2.

Some of these enzymes are almost exclusively reactive toward NO (such as E. coli FlRd, Refs. 2Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, a few years ago, genes coding for FDPs were identified also in the genome of a few eukaryotes, namely some amitochondriate microaerobic protozoan parasites including Giardia intestinalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Spironucleus barkhanus, Mastigamoeba balamuthi, and several Entamoeba strains (19Andersson J.O.

Despite their potential pathophysiological relevance, structural and functional information on eukaryotic FDPs is still marginal. G. intestinalis is the causative agent of giardiasis, a widespread intestinal infectious disease in humans (23Roxstrom-Lindquist K. Palm D. Reiner D. Ringqvist E. Svard S.G. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Very recently, its genome has been completely sequenced (24Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Gillin F.D. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Olsen G.J. Best A.A. Cande W.Z. Chen F. Cipriano M.J. Davids B.J. Dawson S.C. Elmendorf H.G. Hehl A.B. Holder M.E. Huse S.M. Kim U.U. Lasek-Nesselquist E. Manning G.

Science. 2007; 317: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), leading to conclude that Giardia is an early diverging protozoon with very simplified metabolic pathways. Although Giardia has a relatively poor tolerance to O2, it preferentially colonizes the fairly aerobic upper part of the small intestine (duodenum and jejunum). The parasite has an essentially fermentative energy metabolism (25Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It lacks the conventional respiratory oxidases as well as the systems (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase) responsible for the scavenging of radical oxygen species (ROS) (26Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the FDP from Giardia solved by x-ray crystallography, and provide evidence that in addition to the H2O-producing NADH-oxidase previously characterized (27Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Giardia employs the FDP system to efficiently cope with O2. To the best of our knowledge this is the first eukaryotic FDP characterized, to date. Materials–Stock solutions of ∼2 mm NO (Air Liquide, France) were prepared by equilibrating degassed water with the pure gas at 1 atm and room temperature. The concentration of E. coli FlRd-red and of the genetically truncated rubredoxin domain of E. coli flavorubredoxin (Rd) in the oxidized state was determined using ϵ455 nm = 12 mm-1 cm-1 and ϵ484 nm = 7 mm-1 cm-1, respectively. Cloning, Expression, and Purification–The gene coding for the G. intestinalis FDP (FDPGi) 5GenBank™ accession code 27981644., synthesized by GENEART GmbH (Regensubrg, Germany), was cloned in pET28b(+) vector (Novagene). Expression of the His-tagged protein in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) cells was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl α-d-thiogalactoside after supplementing the medium with 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate (NH4Fe(SO4)2·6H2O); cells were grown at 25 °C in M9 medium. The recombinant protein was purified by Nickel affinity chromatography, followed by gel filtration chromatography to remove excess imidazole. After His tag cleavage with thrombin, the protein was subjected to a second step of nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Protein Characterization–The protein concentration was determined by the Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA) (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3617) Google Scholar) (see supplemental materials for details). The quaternary structure of FDPGi in solution was determined using a Tricorn™ Superdex 200–10/300 HPLC column (Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare). Stopped-flow experiments were carried out with a thermostated instrument (DX.17MV, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a diode-array (light path, 1 cm). Time-resolved absorption spectra were recorded with an acquisition time of 2.5 ms per spectrum. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis using the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, NA). Nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen consumption measurements were carried out using Clark-type selective electrodes (Apollo 4000 from World Precision Instruments or Oxygraph-2k from Orobors Instruments). In these measurements, turnover numbers were estimated based on the amount of the enzyme incorporating FMN. Protein Crystallization–Best crystals of FDPGi were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion method using the following reservoir solution: 0.1 m sodium acetate pH 4.6, 14–16% PEG 3350, and 0.2 m potassium nitrate. Drops were prepared by mixing 1.0 μl of reservoir solution and 1.0 μl of protein (12 mg/ml) and allowed to equilibrate against 0.5 ml of the reservoir. Crystals were cryoprotected in 0.1 m sodium acetate pH 4.6, 20% PEG 3350, 0.4 m potassium nitrate and 20% PEG 200. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the ID29 beamline of the ESRF Synchrotron (Grenoble, France). Data were indexed and integrated with DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997Google Scholar). The best quality crystal diffracted up to 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). Two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit corresponding to a solvent content of 45.4% and a VM coefficient of 2.3.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP21212Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 111.97; b = 115.06; c = 67.73Wavelength (Å)1.0Resolution range (Å)80–1.9 (1.97–1.9)Total reflections507,268Unique reflections69,660Completeness (%)aNumber in parentheses is for the last shell98.3 (92.3)Redundancy7.3 (6.4)Average I/σaNumber in parentheses is for the last shell21.7 (3.7)Rmerge %aNumber in parentheses is for the last shell8.7 (43.0)Wilson B value (Å2)17.7RefinementResolution range (Å)50.0–1.9Rcryst %16.6Rfree %bRfree was calculated on 5% of data excluded before refinement20.4Number of atomsProtein6430Waters776FMN, Fe, MUO, nitrate62, 4, 2, 20Mean B factors (Å)2Protein15.8Waters20.3FMN, Fe, MUO, Nitrate20.3, 13.2, 11.4, 27.5R.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.014R.m.s.d. angle (°)1.393a Number in parentheses is for the last shellb Rfree was calculated on 5% of data excluded before refinement Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure Determination and Refinement–The crystal structure of FDPGi was determined by Molecular Replacement with MOLREP (32Vagin A.

The model was built with COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), iteratively refined using REFMAC5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), visually inspected, and manually rebuilt. Solvent molecules were added into the FO-FC density map. The iron atoms, the oxo (hydroxo or aquo) bridges and the nitrate ions were introduced only in the late stages of the refinement to prevent model bias. The final model was refined to Rfactor and Rfree equal to 16.6 and 20.4%, respectively, at 1.9-Å resolution (Table 1). The FDPGi crystal structure consists of a total of 814 residues (residues 4–412 for monomer A and residues 6–412 for monomer B), two FMN, four Fe atoms, two oxo (hydroxo or aquo) bridges, five nitrate ions, and a total of 781 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Residues 4, 124, 376, 387, 408, 412 of monomer A and residues 124, 216, 376, and 412 for monomer B were fitted as alanine because of the lack of density for the side chain. The refined model was checked for geometrical quality by using PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.R. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ramachandran statistics show that 99.5% of the residues lie in allowed regions, while four residues (Asp-55 and Phe-382 in both monomers) lie in disallowed regions. Asp-55 is in the proximity of the Fe-Fe center, while Phe-382 contacts FMN. The residues topologically corresponding to Asp-55 and Phe-382 lie in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot also in FDPMt and in generously allowed regions in FDPMm. Structural superposition was performed using SSM Superposition as implemented in COOT (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Analysis of ligand-protein contacts was performed with SPACE (37Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Figures were generated using PyMol (DeLano, W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). The accessible surface area was calculated with AREAIMOL (38Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org; PDB ID code 2Q9U). The recombinant FDP from Giardia (FDPGi) was purified to homogeneity with a typical yield of ∼3 mg of protein per gram of E. coli cells. SDS-PAGE shows that the protein is a single polypeptide with molecular mass ∼45 kDa, consistent with the value of 46,904 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence. HPLC analysis (not shown) indicates that in solution the protein is a tetramer with an apparent molecular mass of 169 ± 17 kDa. As purified, each monomer of FDPGi contains ∼1.5 Fe and ∼0.5 FMN (see supplemental materials), instead of 2 Fe and 1 FMN, which implies partial loss of the cofactors during purification or incomplete incorporation during expression. The oxidized protein displays a UV/visible absorption spectrum dominated by the flavin cofactor, with bands at 358 and 461 nm. In the presence of NADH, only upon addition of catalytic concentrations of the E. coli proteins FlRd-red and Rd, FDPGi is reduced and absorption in the visible region almost completely bleached (see dashed spectra in Fig. 1). Kinetics of Oxidation by O2 and NO–The reactivity of reduced FDPGi with O2 and NO was tested at 20 °C by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 (top panel) the reduced protein is very rapidly oxidized even by a 2-fold excess of O2, suggestive of a high affinity; ∼80% of the protein is oxidized with a t½ ∼3 ms, the remained being oxidized on a much longer time scale (a few seconds). As the stopped-flow instrument collects spectra every 2.5 ms, the fast oxidation of the large majority of the protein is at the limits of the time resolution of the technique, proceeding at an estimated second order rate constant k > 107 m-1 s-1. The protein is instead oxidized by H2O2 much more slowly (k = 1.7 s-1 at [H2O2] = 60 μm, not shown), ruling out a peroxidatic activity for FDPGi. Compared with O2, the protein is much less reactive toward NO, being oxidized only within seconds even at very high NO concentrations. For instance, at [NO] = 650 μm, the oxidation of FDPGi, followed under strictly anaerobic conditions, proceeds at k = 2.7 s-1 (Fig. 1, bottom panel), the reaction being even slower at lower NO concentrations. Under anaerobic conditions, low molecular weight nitrosothiols, such as nitroso-cysteine, can also oxidize FDPGi, although at very low rate (k = 0.1 s-1 at 50 μm nitroso-cysteine, not shown). O2 and NO Amperometric Measurements–The ability of FDPGi to catalyze the consumption of O2 or NO was tested by using selective electrodes. In these assays, a large excess of NADH (1 mm) was used as the primary electron donor, and the E. coli proteins FlRd-red and Rd were added to shuttle electrons to FDPGi. As shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), the protein displays a remarkable O2-reductase activity with a turnover number linearly dependent on [Rd] (at least up to 20 μm) and equal to 37.7 ± 8.3 s-1 at [Rd] = 20 μm (inset to Fig. 2, top panel); as expected, the activity vanishes upon FDPGi denaturation, as well as if the reducing substrate, Rd, is omitted (not shown). Addition of catalase has no effect on the apparent rate of O2 consumption, pointing to H2O (and not H2O2) as the reaction product: consistently, by monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm in control experiments, we measured a NADH/O2 stoichiometry equal to 2 (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), O2 consumption follows zero order kinetics down to at least 10 μm O2. Below this concentration, the time course of O2 consumption deviates from linearity due to O2 limitation: analysis of this non-linear part of the time course yields an apparent Km ≤ 2 μm. Contrary to other members of the FDP family (12Silaghi-Dumitrescu R. Ng K.Y. Viswanathan R. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3572-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Silaghi-Dumitrescu R. Coulter E.D. Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. Jameson G.N. Huynh B.H. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), no irreversible inactivation of the Giardia enzyme is observed during turnover with O2, unless catalase is omitted in the assay; in the latter case, H2O2 produced by the reaction of FlRd-red with O2 slowly, but progressively inhibits the enzyme (not shown). Similar experiments have been carried out to test also the NO-reductase activity of FDPGi under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2, bottom panel). In the absence of FDPGi, a significantly enhanced consumption of NO is observed after addition of Rd in the presence of NADH and FlRd-red; however, if NO is readded to the solution, following the addition of FDPGi, consumption of NO proceeds at a turnover rate of only ∼0.2 s-1. Moreover, this low rate of NO consumption was found to be essentially independent of the concentration of Rd. In conclusion, FDPGi displays high O2-reductase activity, but very low NO-reductase activity, in agreement with the stopped-flow data described above. The crystal structure of FDPGi was solved at 1.9-Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers forming a non-physiological dimer that yields a tetramer by applying crystallographic symmetry. Such a tetramer consists of a dimer of dimers (Fig. 3A) and possibly represents the assembly of the protein in solution, as indicated by the HPLC data (see above). Upon formation of the physiological dimer ∼10.9% of the ASA of each monomer becomes buried, whereas the ASA of each dimer decreases by ∼12.9% in the tetrameric assembly. Interestingly, a similar homotetrameric arrangement has been reported for FDPMm (16Seedorf H. Hagemeie C.H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Warkentin E. Ermler U.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6492-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whose structures were also solved; the latter two proteins were indeed reported to be dimers. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are completely superimposable (with a r.m.s.d. value calculated on the equivalent Cα atoms of 0.13 Å). Each monomer is composed of two domains: a N-terminal β-lactamase-like domain containing the Fe-Fe center and a C-terminal flavodoxin-like domain containing the FMN cofactor (Fig. 3B): inspection of the Fo-Fc electron density maps reveals that the cofactor content is compatible with 0.8–1.0 FMN and 1.9–2.0 Fe per monomer. The β-lactamase-like domain (residues 4–252 for chain A and 6–252 for chain B) contains a sandwich of two β-sheets, each flanked on its outer face by three α-helices, and a two-stranded β-sheet that protrudes out from the central sandwich covering the Fe-Fe site. The flavodoxin-like domain (residues 253–412) contains five parallel β-strands, forming a central β-sheet surrounded on both sides by a total of five α-helices. Overall, the structure of FDPGi and those available for bacterial flavodiiron proteins are similar (rmsd calculated on Cα equivalent atoms of the dimers equal to 1.71, 1.7, and 1.84 Å for FDPDg, FDPMt, and FDPMm, respectively). Within each monomer the distance between the FMN and the Fe-Fe center is much too long (about 40 Å) to allow fast electron transfer between the two redox centers. In the physiological dimer, however, the monomers are in a head to tail arrangement that brings the Fe-Fe cluster of one monomer close to the FMN of the other one, thus allowing efficient electron transfer (Fig. 3A). Three regions of the protein sequence account for most of the FMN contacts, namely the residues 265SMYGTT270, 316PTLNN320, 349AFGWS353, and F382. The aromatic ring of Trp-352 is co-planar with the FMN isoalloxazine ring. This residue, almost conserved in FDPs, is lik"

Here we report the identification of two Francisella lipoproteins, TUL4 and FTT1103, which activate TLR2. We demonstrate that TUL4 and FTT1103 stimulate chemokine production in human and mouse cells in a TLR2-dependent way. Using an assay that relies on chimeric TLR proteins, we show that TUL4 and FTT1103 stimulate exclusively the TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer. Our results also show that yet unidentified Francisella proteins, possibly unlipi-dated, have the ability to stimulate the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer. Through domain-exchange analysis, we determined that an extended region that comprises LRR 9–17 in the extra-cellular portion of TLR1 mediates response to Francisella lipoproteins and triacylated lipopeptide. Substitution of the corresponding LRR of TLR6 with the LRR derived from TLR1 enables TLR6 to recognize TUL4, FTT1103, and triacylated lipopeptide. This study identifies for the first time specific Fran-cisella products capable of stimulating a proinflammatory response and the cellular receptors they trigger.

Because Ft is highly infective, easy to propagate and disseminate by aerosol, and because treatment of infection often requires intensive medical care, it is a prime candidate for use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. Ft infects various eukaryotic cell types including professional phagocytes and non-phagocytic cells and is able to escape the phagosome/lysosome and replicate within the host cell cytoplasm. Very little is known at the molecular level about how Ft causes disease, and only a few potential virulence factors have been identified. The interaction of Ft with the innate immune system (reviewed in Ref. 1Elkins K.L. Cowley S.C. Bosio C.M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) likely plays a major role in the pathogenesis of tularemia, yet it remains an area that has received little attention.

Host cells use several types of pattern recognition receptors to detect microbial products. Toll-like receptors are expressed on the host cell surface or in endosomal compartments where they detect products derived from bacteria, viruses, yeast, and protozoans (reviewed in Ref. 2Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). For example, the TLR4/MD-2 complex recognizes the lipopolysaccharide derived from Gram-negative bacteria while TLR2 mediates response to a large variety of microbial products, and most prominently to bacterial lipoproteins. The signature motif that characterizes lipoproteins is the lipobox, a short sequence of amino acids at the C-terminal end of their leader peptide that contains an invariant cysteine residue (3Braun V. Wu H.C. Ghuysen J.M. Hakenback R. Comprehensive Biochemistry, Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V. Amsterdam1993: 319-342Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl group of this cysteine is post-translationally modified by addition of an N-acyldiacyl-glyceryl group. The leader peptide of the lipoprotein is then cleaved and the free N-terminal group of the cysteine can be further modified by addition of a third acyl chain, resulting in a triacylated lipoprotein. This type of protein lipidation is unique to bacteria and allows these proteins to be anchored to the membrane. Lipidation is essential for lipoprotein function and ability to activate TLR2. Several other microbial products can act as TLR2 agonists including lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan, Neisserial porins, yeast cell wall products, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins from the protozoa Tripanosoma cruzi, Gram-positive peptidoglycan, and atypical LPS such as that of P. gingivalis. It has been demonstrated that TLR2 activation by some of these products (e.g. PGN or P. gingivalis LPS) is due to contaminating lipoproteins (4Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Aoyama K. Tamura T. Suda Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G.

Immun. 2005; 73: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ability of TLR2 to mediate responses to such a varied group of molecules is in part due to the fact that this receptor must form heterodimers with either TLR6 or TLR1 to signal (7Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer recognizes triacylated lipopeptides (8Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J.

Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Infection with Ft is associated with a pronounced inflammatory response characterized by production of several cytokines (1Elkins K.L. Cowley S.C. Bosio C.M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the components of the bacterium that induce inflammation remain unknown. We have recently reported that the inflammatory response resulting from infection of dendritic cells or PBMC is mediated by TLR2 and caspase-1 (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that caspase-1 activation (and concomitant IL-1β secretion) was dependent on infection and escape of bacteria from the phagosome. In contrast, killed Ft retained the ability to activate TLR2 inducing a variety of cytokines and chemokines. The nature of the Ft-derived products that act as TLR2 ligands is unknown. In contrast to the LPS of most Gram-negative bacteria, Ft LPS does not possess proinflammatory activities (12Ancuta P. Pedron T. Girard R. Sandstrom G. Chaby R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dreisbach V.C. Cowley S. Elkins K.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is unable to act like other atypical LPS that stimulate (or antagonize) TLR4/TLR2. The inability of Ft LPS to induce inflammatory responses suggests that other Ft-derived products are responsible for triggering the innate immune response. Lipoproteins are among the most likely candidates as TLR2 agonists, though until now no Ft-derived lipoproteins that possess this ability have been identified. In this article, we report the identification of two Ft lipoproteins that can activate TLR2-mediated signaling. Reagents–Triacylated Pam3-CSK4 (Pam) and diacylated synthetic lipopeptides FSL-1 and MALP2 were purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Escherichia coli LPS (K12 LCD25) was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA) and was purified from contaminant lipoproteins normally found in commercially available LPS preparations by double phenol extraction. Proteinase K was from Fisher Biotech. Lipoprotein lipase and PMA were from Sigma. Bacterial Strains, Growth Condition, and Plasmids–E. coli BL21 lpxM strain (14Cognet I. de Coignac A.B.

F. tularensis LVS was grown in modified Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (BHI supplemented with 50 mg/ml hemin and 1% IsoVitalex; BBL, Cockeysville, MD) or on BHI-chocolate agar (BHI agar supplemented with 1% hemoglobin and 1% IsoVitalex). For expression in E. coli, Ft genes were PCR-amplified from Ft Schu4 genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase and cloned into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pET-28a (Novagen) resulting in addition of a C-terminal His6 tag. Primer sequences are available upon request. For expression of His6-tagged TUL4 and FTT1103 in Ft we used the suicide vector M720 (a derivative of pXB136). This vector lacks the Ft origin of replication and contains the gene for kanamycin resistance under the control of the orf5 promoter. A 2,368-bp genomic fragment terminating at the 3′-end of Tul4 was PCR-amplified from Ft Schu4 genomic DNA using the following primers: F-SacI, GGGAGCTCACCATCTTTTGAGGGTGGTAGG and the primer R-6H-BamHI, GGGGATCCTTAATGATGGTGATGATGATGAATATTTATTGAATCAGAAGCGATTA, which adds the His6 tag at the C terminus of TUL4. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and SacI and cloned into the M720 vector. For Ftt1103 expression, the plasmid pET 28a-Ftt1103 was digested with SmaI-XbaI, and the 2,310-bp fragment containing the Ftt1103 sequence was cloned into M720. The resulting vectors were electroporated into Ft and cointegrants selected on BHI chocolate agar containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin. One clone from each transformation was selected and expression of the His6-tagged protein was confirmed by Western immunoblotting using anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen). For expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli BL21 lpxM, overnight cultures were diluted ten times in warm LB broth and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of 100 mm IPTG for 3 h. Ft clones expressing His6-tagged TUL4 or FTT1103 were grown overnight in BHI broth. Lipoprotein-enriched Fractions and Protein Purification–The lipid-associated membrane proteins were prepared using the Triton X-114 phase separation procedure (15Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by T. Shimizu et al. (16Shimizu T. Kida Y. Kuwano K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4641-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ft or E. coli overnight cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with cold PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in cold PTX (PBS supplemented with 350 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-114, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to induce detergent phase separation. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, the upper aqueous phase was discarded and replaced with a similar volume of PBS supplemented with 350 mm NaCl. The procedure of phase separation was repeated twice, and the final detergent phase was resuspended in PBS to the original volume. To obtain the crude membrane/lipoprotein fraction, the detergent was removed by precipitation with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and incubated at –20 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed with ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in PBS. Protein concentration of the suspension was measured with the Bradford assay. For purification of the recombinant lipoproteins, E. coli IPTG-induced cultures or Ft overnight cultures were centrifuged and washed in cold PBS. The pellets were resuspended in PTX, and the lipoprotein-enriched fractions were obtained as described above. After two rounds of detergent phase partitioning, 10 mm imidazole, and 400 μl of Probond Ni-Sepharose resin (Invitrogen) were added. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the resin was washed with 20 ml of PTX containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound lipoproteins were eluted with 2 ml of PTX containing 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The eluted fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to induce detergent phase partitioning. After centrifugation at room temperature for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, the upper phase was discarded, and the detergent fraction was diluted with 2.5 ml of PBS supplemented with 350 mm NaCl and subjected to a second affinity chromatography with 200 μl of Ni2+ resin. The beads were washed with 20 ml of PTX pH 5.5. The bound lipoproteins were eluted in PTX by stepwise decreasing the pH to 4.0. Each fraction was precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol, and the pellets resuspended in sterile PBS. The cysteine mutant lipoproteins and the chaperones were purified from bacterial pellets by freeze-thawing four times and sonication in lysis buffer (1× PBS, 350 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole, protease inhibitor mixture) and were further purified by affinity chromatography with Probond Ni-Sepharose. The resin was washed twice with lysis buffer and elution was accomplished by stepwise decreasing the pH to 4.0. The purity of each fraction of recombinant proteins was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Recombinant proteins were digested with proteinase K (1 μg/ml, 2 h, 42 °C), lipoprotein lipase (10 μg/ml, 18 h 37 °C,) or NaOH 0.2 n, 2 h at room temperature. Mammalian Expression Vectors and Cell Lines–The chimeric pCMV-Flag-TLR[2-1], pCMV-Flag-TLR[1-2], and pEF-Flag-TLR[6-2] constructs have been described previously (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sandor F. Latz E. Re F. Mandell L. Repik G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. Kurt-Jones E.A. Finberg R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The chimeric constructs LRR1–4, LRR5–8, LRR9–12, LRR13–17, and LRR18-C were constructed by overlapping PCR using human TLR1 or TLR6 cDNA templates and cloning back into the CMV-Flag-TLR[1-2]. Primer sequences are available upon request. A subclone of HeLa cell line, previously isolated in our laboratory, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. The HeLa-TLR2, or HeLa-TLR4/MD2 stable cell lines have been described previously (18Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To obtain the HeLa-TLR[2-1] stable cell line, the parental HeLa cells were co-transfected with the pCMV-Flag-TLR[2-1] and the pCMV-puro vectors. Stable transfectants were selected in presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml) and tested for responsiveness to Pam or MALP2 stimulation after transient transfection with the pCMV-Flag-TLR[1-2] or pEF-Flag-TLR[6-2] vectors. Luciferase Assay–The HeLa cell lines were transiently transfected in 24- or 48-well plates using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) with 0.4 μg of ELAM-luciferase and 0.2 μg of pcDNA-CD14, 0.1 μg of CMV-β-Gal, and 0.7 μg of empty vector or other chimeric constructs (see figure legends). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h with different agonists. Lucif-erase assay was performed using Promega (Madison, WI) reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Efficiency of transfection was normalized by measuring β-Gal in cell lysates. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Results from three independent experiments were combined and expressed as lucifer-ase fold induction (compared with the unstimulated cells). Values are mean ± S.D. Primary Cell Isolation–Human PBMC were isolated from Leuko-packs by Ficoll-Hystopaque density gradient centrifugation. To obtain mouse dendritic cells from wt or TLR2-deficient mice, the femur/tibiae were removed and freed of muscles and tendons. Bone ends were cut with scissors and bone marrow cells were flushed out of the bone cavity with D-PBS using a syringe with a no. 25-gauge needle. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, washed once, and resuspended in RPMI 1640-10% fetal calf serum supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and rmGM-CSF (20 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The cell suspension was plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 100-mm Petri dishes. The medium was replaced on day 4, and suspension cells collected and stimulated on day 8. This procedure routinely results in >80% CD11c+ cells. The use of animals for these experiments was approved by the University of Tennessee Animal Care and Use Committee. RNase Protection Assay–Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNase protection assay was performed using 4 μg of total RNA using BD-PharMingen (San Diego, CA) Riboquant kit as described previously (18Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The hCK-1 and hCK-5, multi-probe template sets were used. Western Blot Analysis–Purified lipoproteins or lipoprotein fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted using serum of Ft-immunized mice (1:500). Ft Lipoprotein Fraction Activates Both TLR2 Heterodimers–We have previously shown that the innate immune response to Ft infection is mediated by TLR2 (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To identify the nature of the Ft-derived factors that activate TLR2, we obtained a Ft lipoprotein-enriched fraction using Triton X-114 detergent extraction and partition procedure (15Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu T. Kida Y. Kuwano K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4641-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This procedure selectively enriches for integral membrane proteins and lipoproteins. A similar fraction was obtained for comparison from E. coli BL21 lpxM, a strain that produces a modified form of lipid A that is unable to stimulate TLR4 (14Cognet I. de Coignac A.B. Magistrelli G. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Maisnier-Patin K. Caron G. Chevalier S. Humbert F. Nguyen T. Beck A. Velin D. Delneste Y. Malissard M. Gauchat J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 272: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ability of these membrane protein fractions to stimulate TLR2 or other TLR was tested using HeLa cell lines expressing different TLR. As shown in Fig. 1A, both fractions were able to activate cells expressing TLR2. In contrast, neither fraction activated cells expressing TLR4/MD-2 (Fig. 1B), TLR5 (Fig. 1C), or TLR7/TLR8 (Fig. 1D). TLR2 activation by both lipoprotein fractions was abolished by alkaline treatment. This treatment hydrolyzes the acyl groups of lipoproteins destroying their ability to stimulate TLR2. The ability of lipoproteins to activate TLR2 is known to be resistant to proteinase K treatment (4Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Aoyama K. Tamura T. Suda Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and as expected, the TLR2 agonist activity of the E. coli fraction was not affected by this treatment. In contrast, digestion of the Ft fraction with proteinase K reduced TLR2 activation suggesting that the Ft fraction may contain two types of TLR2 agonists, one type that is resistant to protease digestion and that may represent a lipopeptide and a second type that is susceptible to protease treatment and that may represent an integral membrane protein. TLR2 is known to recognize its ligands by forming heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6. The TLR1/TLR2 heterodimer mediates response to triacylated bacterial lipopeptide while cell activation by diacylated lipopeptide typically occurs through the TLR6/TLR2 heterodimer (8Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 9Alexopoulou L. Thomas V. Schnare M. Lobet Y.

Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) (activation of the TLR1/TLR2 heterodimer has also been reported in response to some diacylated lipopeptides (19Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)). Because our HeLa or HEK293 cell lines express endogenous TLR1 and TLR6, to determine which TLR2 heterodimer is activated by the Ft lipoprotein fraction we employed an assay that relies on chimeric constructs that swap the extracellular and intracellular domains between TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6. As we previously demonstrated (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sandor F. Latz E. Re F. Mandell L. Repik G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. Kurt-Jones E.A. Finberg R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and illustrate in Fig. 2B, these chimeric receptors cannot function in isolation and restore responsiveness to TLR2 agonists only when used in complementing pairs that simultaneously provide both the cytoplasmic and the extracellular domain of TLR1 and TLR2 (or TLR6 and TLR2). As expected (Fig. 2A), the chimeric pair TLR[1-2] plus TLR[2-1] was activated by the triacylated lipopeptide Pam but not by the diacylated lipopeptide MALP-2. In contrast, the chimeric pair TLR[6-2] plus TLR[2-1] was activated exclusively by diacylated synthetic lipopeptide MALP-2. In this assay, the Ft lipoprotein fraction stimulated both heterodimers, in agreement with our previous results using the whole bacterium (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, digestion with proteinase K severely diminished the ability of the Ft lipoprotein fraction to stimulate the TLR[6-2] plus TLR[2-1] heterodimer while it affected the TLR[1-2] plus TLR[2-1] agonism to a much lower extent. This effect was not observed with the E. coli lipoprotein fraction whose ability to stimulate both TLR2 heterodimers was not affected by proteinase K treatment. These results are in agreement with the notion that Ft may produce triacylated lipoproteins that activate preferentially the TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer, and other proteins, possibly unlipidated ones, that stimulate the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer. Identification of Ft Lipoproteins That Stimulate the TLR2/TLR1 Heterodimer–A search of the DOLOP and the NCBI databases identified several Ft genes predicted to encode putative lipoproteins. We decided to produce in recombinant form a number of these proteins (see Table 1). Because several bacterial chaperones have been reported to activate TLR (20Takenaka R. Yokota K. Ayada K. Mizuno M.

In addition, an E. coli lipoprotein, Lip19, which is known to activate TLR2 (23Lee H.K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), was produced and used as positive control. C-terminal histidine-tagged version of these proteins were constructed and expressed in E. coli BL21 lpxM by IPTG induction. Several of the selected Ft proteins were expressed at levels too low to attempt purification (lipoproteins are notoriously difficult to express in high amount) and, therefore, were excluded from further analysis (see Table 1). The remaining proteins were purified using an established procedure that relies on Triton X-114 detergent phase partitioning and nickel resin chromatography. Each purified protein was tested on HeLa-TLR2 cells for the ability to activate NF-κB-luciferase. Among the proteins tested (Table 1), only two (encoded by the genes Ftt0901 and Ftt1103) were able to stimulate TLR2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). Ftt0901 encodes TUL4, a 17-kDa protein also known as LpnA, which is one of the few known Ft targets for T cell-mediated immune responses in humans (24Sjostedt A. Sandstrom G. Tarnvik A. Jaurin B. Microb. Pathog. 1989; 6: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TUL4 was previously shown to be a lipoprotein (25Sjostedt A. Tarnvik A. Sandstrom G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3163-3168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein encoded by Ftt1103 has not been previously characterized. TUL4 and FTT1103 failed to stimulate TLR4, TLR5, or TLR7 (data not shown). Other predicted lipoproteins such as FTT0165c, or the three Ft chaperones GroES, GroEL, GrpE, did not show TLR2 agonism regardless of the dose used (Fig. 3B). Because the same procedure was used to purify the three lipoproteins, it is unlikely that the TLR2 agonism of FTT1103 and TUL4 was due to contaminating E. coli lipoproteins, though this remains a possibility. As expected, mutation of the lipobox cysteine residue (the amino acid to which N-acyl diacyl glyceryl group is attached) abolished detergent phase partitioning of FTT1103-Cys and TUL4-Cys and their ability to stimulate TLR-2. Moreover, delipidation of FTT1103 and TUL4 using alkaline hydrolysis or lipoprotein lipase digestion abolished their stimulation of TLR2 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, digestion with proteinase K, which completely destroyed the proteins (Fig. 3C), did not reduce (but in fact, increased) their ability to serve as TLR2 agonists.TABLE 1Ft geneAccession no.Expression level in E. coliTLR2 stimulationFtt0165cYP_169231+++NoFtt0482YP_169520-N/AFtt0742YP_169753+NoFtt0901 (Tul4)YP_169898+++YesFtt1103YP_170079++YesFtt1540YP_170468-N/AFtt1676YP_170582+NoFtt1057YP_170038-N/AFtt1591YP_170509-N/AFtt0842YP_169847+NoFtt1696 (GroEL)YP_170601+++NoFtt1695 (GroES)YP_170600+NoFtt1270 (GrpE)YP_170226+++No Open table in a new tab The chimeric TLR assay was used to determine the composition of the TLR2 heterodimer stimulated by TUL4 and FTT1103. As shown in Fig. 4, both proteins stimulated exclusively the TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer suggesting that these proteins may be triacylated. Together, these findings demonstrate conclusively that TUL4 and FTT1103 are lipoproteins that are capable of TLR2 stimulation. TUL4 and FTT1103 Induce TLR2-dependent Proinflamma-tory Chemokine Expression–We next analyzed the ability of TUL4 and FTT1103 to induce a panel of chemokines in human PBMC or mouse bone marrow-derived DC. As shown in Fig. 5, both proteins, but not the cysteine mutants, were powerful inducers of several chemokines. Importantly, chemokine induction by the purified proteins or the Ft lipoprotein fraction was abrogated in BMDC from TLR2-deficient mice confirming our previous demonstration that the inflammatory response to Ft is primarily mediated by TLR2 (11Li H. Nookala S. Bina X.R. Bina J.E. Re F. J. Leukoc Biol. 2006; 80: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the chemokine profile induced by purified TUL4 and FTT1103 closely resembled that induced by the crude Ft lipoprotein fraction or the live bacterium, suggesting that these proteins play a predominant role in the innate immune response to Ft infection. TUL4 and FTT1103 Expressed in Either Ft or E. coli Display Similar TLR2/TLR1 Agonist Activity–Although previous work has demonstrated that Ft and E. coli use similar mechanisms to process lipoproteins (25Sjostedt A. Tarnvik A. Sandstrom G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3163-3168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was important to demonstrate that TUL4 and FTT1103 expressed in Ft behave similarly to the E. coli-expressed proteins. We first atte"

We observed that LPS challenge of human lung microvascular endothelial cells induced concentration- and time-dependent increases in expression of Cav-1 mRNA and protein. The NEMO (NF-κB essential modifier binding domain)-binding domain peptide (IkB kinase (IKK)-NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide), which prevents NF-κB activation by inhibiting the interaction of IKKγ with the IKK complex, blocked LPS-induced Cav-1 mRNA and protein expression. Knockdown of NF-κB subunit p65/RelA expression with small interfering RNA also prevented LPS-induced Cav-1 expression. Caveolae open to the apical and basal plasmalemma of endothelial cells increased 2-4-fold within 4 h of LPS exposure. IKK-NBD peptide markedly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the number of caveolae as well as transendothelial albumin permeability. These observations were recapitulated in mouse studies in which IKK-NBD peptide prevented Cav-1 expression and interfered with the increase in lung microvessel permeability induced by LPS. Thus, LPS mediates NF-κB-dependent Cav-1 expression that results in increased caveolae number and thereby contributes to the mechanism of increased transendothelial albumin permeability.

Cav-1, the structural protein of caveolae in endothelial cells and other cell types, regulates the formation of caveolae, the vesicle carriers involved in the transcytosis of albumin across the endothelial barrier (7Mehta D. Malik A.B. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 279-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Studies showed that caveolae-mediated transcytosis contributes to the regulation of microvascular permeability (7Mehta D. Malik A.B. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 279-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) secondary to the activation of Src kinase (8Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W.D. Gilchrist A. Hamm H.E. Malik A.B. J.

In an experimental model of diabetes, increased Cav-1 expression in endothelial cells was associated with increased transcytosis of albumin (11Pascariu M. Bendayan M. Ghitescu L. J. Histochem Cytochem. 2004; 52: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). LPS was shown to induce the expression of Cav-1 in endothelial cells (12Zhao B. Bowden R.A. Stavchansky S.A. Bowman P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1587-C1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and murine macrophages (13Lei M.G. Morrison D.C. Infect Immun. 2000; 68: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Lei M.G. Tan X. Qureshi N. Morrison D.C. Infect Immun. 2005; 73: 8136-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms of the response and its consequences in regulating endothelial barrier function are not clear. NF-κB is composed of dimers of five different proteins (p50, p52, p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel) (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). These dimers exist in the cytoplasm in inactive forms bound to the inhibitory protein I-κB (IκB) (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). A variety of agonists activate IκB kinases α and β (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylate serines 32 and 36 of IκBα and serines 19 and 23 of IκBβ, respectively (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκBα and IκBβ leads to the proteolytic degradation of IκB and dissociation of NF-κB, and NF-κB translocates to the nucleus to induce gene transcription (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). The IκB kinase complex consists of two catalytic IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)) (16May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). NEMO interaction with IKKα and IKKβ is required for IκB kinase catalytic activity. Based on our observation that the intronic region of Cav-1 contains NF-κB consensus sites, we addressed the possibility that LPS mediates Cav-1 expression by an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. We surmised that this pathway thereby contributes to the mechanism of increased transendothelial albumin permeability seen with LPS. We demonstrate here that LPS activation of endothelial cells increased Cav-1 protein expression as well as caveolae number and that both were dependent on activation of NF-κB. Moreover, inhibiting NF-κB activation pharmacologically, knockdown of p65/RelA expression and knockdown of Cav-1 expression each interfered with the increase in transendothelial albumin permeability induced by LPS. Thus, these findings suggest a critical role of increased caveolar trafficking of albumin in promoting the LPS-mediated albumin leakiness of the endothelial barrier. Materials–Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) and microvascular endothelial growth medium (EGM-2 MV) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was obtained from Calbiochem. Cell-permeable NEMO binding domain (NBD) synthetic peptides (wild type, drqikiwfqnrrmkwkkTALDWSWLQTE (IKK-NBD); mutant, drqikiwfqnrrmkwkkTALDASALQTE (mutant-IKK-NBD)) were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-Cav-1 polyclonal antibody (pAb) and anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody (mAb) were from BD Biosciences. Anti-tubulin mAb was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Human p65/RelA small interference RNA (siRNA; Validated siRNA, catalog #SI00301672) and scrambled siRNA were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). NF-κB protein (p65/RelA)-specific antibody and siRNA transfection reagent (catalog #sc-29528) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Cav-1-specific NF-κB oligonucleotides and PCR primers were custom-synthesized from IDT (Coralville, IA). Cell Culture–HLMVECs grown in EGM-2 MV supplemented with 15% FBS were used between passages 2 and 4. To study LPS effect, HLMVECs were exposed to LPS in the presence of 2% FBS-containing medium. Immunoblot Analysis–HLMVECs exposed to LPS were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, continuing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1%Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Cav-1 pAb (17Shajahan A.N.

For loading control, membranes were re-probed with anti-tubulin mAb. Real-time Quantitative-PCR–Total RNA, extracted according to manufacturer's recommendations with RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA), was used to generate first-strand complementary DNA by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA (10 ng), mixed with SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, CA), was used for real-time quantitative-PCR with the ABI prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Cav-1 mRNA was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Primer sequences were: Cav-1, forward 5′-GAGCTGAGCGAGAAGCAAGT-3′, and reverse 5′-TCCCTTCTGGTTCTGCAATC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′, and reverse 5′-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTC-3′. Nuclear Protein Extraction–Nuclear extracts were prepared from HLMVECs after LPS treatment as described (18Rahman A. Kefer J. Bando M. Niles W.D. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L533-L544PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, scraped, and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was homogenized with 10 strokes using Glass Dounce homogenizer and centrifuging at 3000 × g for 30 s. Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of solution B (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 20 min. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants containing nuclear proteins were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)–EMSAs were performed as described (18Rahman A. Kefer J. Bando M. Niles W.D. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L533-L544PubMed Google Scholar). Using the TFSEARCH program, we identified two putative NF-κB binding sites within intron 1, +435 to +460 relative to the translation start site in the human Cav-1 gene (Fig. 3A). The 26-bp sequence of the Cav-1 gene encompassing the predicted NF-κB binding sites was used for the wild type Cav-1 NF-κB sequence, 5′-GGGGACAGTCCCCGGGACTCTCCGCC-3′, and mutant Cav-1 NF-κB-sequence, 5′-GGGGACAGTATCCGATACTCTCCGCC-3′ (Fig. 3A). Wild type Cav-1 sequence contains two putative NF-κB sites which scores 88.5 and 87 points. Altering two bases in each site reduced the scores to 67.7 and 66.2 and abolished the NF-κB binding to DNA (see Fig. 3B, middle panel). As a positive control, the ICAM-1 promoter-specific NF-κB sequence (5′-AGCTTGGAAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3′) was used. End labeling was performed by T4 kinase in the presence of [α-32P]ATP. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified on a Sephadex G-50 column. An aliquot of 10 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated with the labeled double-stranded probe (∼80,000 cpm) in the presence of 2.5 μl of binding buffer (Promega). The binding reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. After adding non-denaturing sample buffer, the DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 6% native PAGE in low ionic strength buffer (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA). To study the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were first incubated with NF-κB protein-specific antibodies (2 μg/assay) for 15 min at 25 °C, and then labeled double-stranded probe was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. After this incubation, non-denaturing sample buffer added, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated as described above. p65/RelA-siRNA Transfection–HLMVECs grown to ∼80% confluence were washed with transfection medium before transfection. The cells were then transfected with indicated concentrations of human p65/RelA siRNA or scrambled siRNA using siRNA transfection reagents from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. At 48 h after transfection the cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated with 2% FBS-containing medium for 2 h. After this period, the cells were used for either immunoblotting with anti-p65 Ab or treated with LPS for different time intervals and immunoblotted anti-Cav-1 Ab. Electron Microscopy and Morphometric Analysis–HLMVECs were washed 3× at 2 min each with phosphate-buffered saline, 1× with washing buffer (0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5% sucrose), fixed (1.5% glutaraldehyde in washing buffer) for 30 min at room temperature, washed 3 × 15 min each, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, pH 6.0 (45 min in the dark on ice), and then in 7.5% uranyl magnesium acetate (1 h in the dark at room temperature). Specimens dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in Epon were sectioned (60 mm thick) and viewed using a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope (19Miyawaki-Shimizu K.

Randomly chosen Epon blocks (2 or 3) were used to obtain 6-8 grids/block and 15-20 sections/grid for 95 micrographs per condition at 84,000× final magnification. Vesicle number was determined using the Morphometrix program, and counts were expressed as the average number of vesicle per experimental condition. Vesicles associated with the apical or basolateral surface of an endothelial cell were considered open, and those >100 nm away from the plasma membrane were considered inside the cell (19Miyawaki-Shimizu K.

Confocal Microscopy–Confocal imaging was performed to identify Cav-1-positive vesicles in HLMVECs as described (8Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W.D. Gilchrist A. Hamm H.E. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). HLMVECs grown on glass coverslips were incubated with 2% FBS containing medium for 2 h, and then cells were exposed to LPS for up to 4 h. Cells were washed 3 times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 30 min at 22 °C, and blocked with 5% goat serum in HBSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer) for 30 min at 22 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with either anti-Cav-1 pAb diluted (1:3000) or anti-VE-cadherin mAb diluted (1:200) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing 2 times, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Ab in blocking buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. Confocal images were acquired with the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (8Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W.D. Gilchrist A. Hamm H.E. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement–The real-time change in endothelial monolayer electrical resistance was measured as described by us (20Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In brief, HLMVECs were grown to confluence on small gold electrode (4.9 × 10-4 cm2). The small electrode and the larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. An approximate constant current 1 μA was supplied by a 1-V, 4000-Hz AC signal connected serially to 1-megaohm resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between small electrode and large electrode was monitored by lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer. The same computer controlled the output of the amplifier and switched the measurement to different electrodes in the course of an experiment. Before the experiment a confluent endothelial monolayer was kept in 2% FBS containing medium for 2 h, and then cells were challenged with LPS, IKK-NBD, or mutant IKK-NBD. The change in monolayer resistance was monitored up to 4 h. As a positive control, HMLVECs were challenged with thrombin. The data are presented in resistance normalized to its value at time 0 as described (20Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transendothelial 125I-Labeled Albumin Permeability in Monolayers–Permeability of 125I-labeled albumin in confluent HLMVECs on polycarbonate Transwell membranes was determined (21John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Single-stranded siRNA (90 pmol/well) corresponding to human Cav-1 (5′-GAGAAGCAAGUGUACGACG-3′) and control siRNA (4 bases altered, 5′-GAGAAGCAGUGAUACGACG-3′) together with FuGENE 6 reagent at a ratio of siRNA:lipid (1:3, w/v) were transfected into monolayers. After 72 h, monolayers were treated with LPS alone and either IKK-NBD (100 μm) plus LPS or mutant IKK-NBD (100 μm) peptides in Me2SO. IKK-NBD or mutant IKK-NBD peptides were preincubated with the monolayers for 1 h before the addition of LPS. Data were analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance (Bonferroni) with values p < 0.05 considered as significant. Determination of Lung Microvessel Permeability of 125I-Labeled Albumin in Mice–C57BL6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory, housed in the University of Illinois Animal Care Facility, and used according to approved animal protocols. Female mice weighing 25-30 g were anesthetized (2.5% sevoflurane in room air) for insertion of an indwelling jugular catheter and then were permitted to recover for 30 min. At 30 min before LPS challenge, mice received the vehicle (100 μl/mouse, 20% Me2SO), IKK-mutant peptide (100 μl/mouse, 2.0 mm in 20% Me2SO), or IKK-NBD peptide (100 μl/mouse, 2.0 mm in 20% Me2SO) via the jugular catheter. Mice were challenged with LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p) at zero time. Control animals received the same volume of vehicle. After LPS challenge or sham injection, at time points of 1, 3, and 5 h mice received repeat injections of vehicle, IKK-mutant peptide, or IKK-NBD peptide. At 340 min after LPS, mice received ∼1 μCi of 125I-labeled albumin via the jugular catheter. At 360 min animals were again anesthetized (2.5% sevoflurane in air), and a blood sample of 100 μl was withdrawn by puncture of the inferior vena cava to determine vascular tracer counts. Lungs were flushed with RPMI solution containing 3% unlabeled albumin to remove the vascular albumin tracer. The lung tissue was removed, weighed, and counted for γ radioactivity. Albumin permeability-surface area product was calculated as described from vascular counts, tissue counts, and tracer exposure time (22Vogel S.M. Gao X. Mehta D. Ye R.D. John T.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another set of experiments lungs were harvested for immunoblotting to determine Cav-1 expression. LPS Induces Cav-1 Protein Expression–We exposed HLMVECs to varying concentrations of LPS to for up to 4 h and determined Cav-1 protein expression. Fig. 1A shows that LPS induced Cav-1 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Cav-1 protein expression reached a maximum between 2 and 4 μg/ml LPS concentration, and levels decreased significantly at 8 μg/ml. To assess the time course, HLMVECs were exposed to fixed LPS concentration for up to 6 h. Cav-1 expression reached a maximum with LPS concentration at 4 μg/ml after 4 h of exposure (Fig. 1B). To address whether the LPS-induced Cav-1 expression is dependent on transcriptional activation of Cav-1, we determined the effect of transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Actinomycin D treatment prevented LPS-induced Cav-1 protein expression (Fig. 1C). The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide also prevented LPS-induced Cav-1 expression in HLMVECs (data not shown). As a positive control we studied the effect of LPS on ICAM-1 expression in HLMVECs. LPS stimulation also increased ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 1D). Likewise, TNF-α exposure also increased Cav-1 expression (Fig. 1E). IKK-NBD Peptide Inhibits LPS-induced Cav-1 mRNA and Protein Expression–Expression of Cav-1 mRNA after LPS stimulation was elevated within 2 h after LPS stimulation and was maximal at 4 h (Fig. 2A). The membrane-permeant IKK-NBD peptide, which blocks the interaction of NEMO with the IKK, complex preventing its phosphorylation of IκB and degradation of IκB and activation of NF-κB (16May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), was used to assess the role of NF-κB in the mechanism of Cav-1 expression in cell and in vivo studies (described below). We treated HLMVECs with 100 μm IKK-NBD or mutant IKK-NBD peptide 1 h before LPS challenge. IKK-NBD blocked LPS induction of Cav-1 mRNA, whereas mutant IKK-NBD had no significant effect (Fig. 2B). IKK-NBD treatment also markedly reduced LPS-induced Cav-1 protein expression (Fig. 2C). LPS Promotes NF-κB Binding to Intronic NF-κB Consensus Sites–We identified two putative NF-κB binding sites within intron 1, +435 to +460 relative to the translation start site in the human Cav-1 gene (Fig. 3A). To test whether LPS induces NF-κB binding to the introinc NF-κB consensus sequence, we incubated nuclear extracts from control and LPS-stimulated cells with 32P-labeled double-stranded Cav-1 gene intronic NF-κB oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A) and performed EMSA (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). Binding of nucleoproteins to DNA fragments generated two labeled complexes at slower (Band 1) and faster (Band 2) mobilities (Fig. 3B, left panel). DNA binding activity was absent when LPS-stimulated nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded mutant Cav-1 NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, middle panel). Using the ICAM-1 promoter-specific NF-κB oligonucleotide as a positive control for EMSA, we observed that LPS increased the NF-κB-DNA complex formation (Fig. 3B, right panel). Competition studies (70-fold excess unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (cold probe) with labeled oligonucleotide (hot probe) in nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with LPS (Fig. 3C)) demonstrated specificity of NF-κB interaction with Cav-1 gene intronic NF-κB DNA sequence. To identify NF-κB subunits binding to the DNA, nuclear extracts were immunodepleted by preincubation with anti-p65 Ab or anti-p50 Ab. Band 1 was markedly reduced by anti-p65 Ab (Fig. 3D), indicating that LPS mediates p65/RelA binding to Cav-1 gene to transcription. p65/RelA Knockdown Prevents LPS-induced to Cav-1 Expression–We transfected HLMVECs with siRNA specific to p65/RelA. At 48 h after siRNA transfection, HLMVECs were immunoblotted with anti-p65 Ab (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). p65/RelA expression was markedly reduced in p65-siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3E), whereas the scrambled (Control)-siRNA had no effect (Fig. 3F). LPS-induced Cav-1 protein expression was also prevented in p65-siRNA transfected cells compared with control (Fig. 3F), indicating that p65/RelA signaling plays an important role in the mechanism of LPS-induced Cav-1 expression in HLMVECs. LPS Induces NF-κB-dependent Increase in Caveolae Number–Next we addressed whether the increased Cav-1 protein expression in response to LPS challenge was coupled to the formation of caveolae by electron microscopy. The mean number of vesicles per cell increased 2.6-fold compared with control after 4 h of LPS challenge (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). LPS resulted in greater number of membrane-associated vesicles communicating with the media and vesicles within the cytosol itself (Table 1). Treatment with IKK-NBD or IKK-NBD mutant failed to alter significantly the number of vesicles in HLMVECs under basal conditions, whereas IKK-NBD, but not mutant IKK-NBD, prevented the LPS-induced increase in vesicle number (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). Confocal microscopy also showed that Cav-1-positive vesicles were significantly increased after LPS challenge compared with control cells (Fig. 4B).TABLE 1NF-κB-dependent increase in vesicle number in endothelial cells induced by LPS challenge The number of vesicles in cultured HLMVECs was quantified from electron micrographs; 215 micrographs were used for each of the first three experimental conditions, and 117 micrographs were used for each of the last three conditions. In column 1, the mean number refers to the number of endothelial cells with complete profiles quantified per micrograph. In columns 2 and 3, the mean numbers refer to the number of vesicles counted per micrograph. Column 4 refers to the total vesicle number normalized to number of cells counted.

https://openalex.org/W1984434130,"The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is hypothesized to play an important role in Huntington disease, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the protein huntingtin. Neurotoxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, generated in microglia and macrophages, are present at increased levels in the brains of patients and mouse models during early stages of disease, but the mechanism by which kynurenine pathway up-regulation occurs in Huntington disease is unknown. Here we report that expression of a mutant huntingtin fragment was sufficient to induce transcription of the kynurenine pathway in yeast and that this induction was abrogated by impairing the activity of the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Moreover, numerous genetic suppressors of mutant huntingtin toxicity that are functionally unrelated converged unexpectedly on the kynurenine pathway, supporting a critical role for the kynurenine pathway in mediating mutant huntingtin toxicity in yeast. Histone deacetylase-dependent regulation of the kynurenine pathway was also observed in a mouse model of Huntington disease, in which treatment with a neuroprotective histone deacetylase inhibitor blocked activation of the kynurenine pathway in microglia expressing a mutant huntingtin fragment in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that a mutant huntingtin fragment can perturb transcriptional programs in microglia, and thus implicate these cells as potential modulators of neurodegeneration in Huntington disease that are worthy of further investigation."

LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) regulates actin dynamics by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein. LIMK1 activity increases during mitosis. Here we show that mitotic LIMK1 activation is critical for accurate spindle orientation in mammalian cells. Knockdown of LIMK1 suppressed a mitosis-specific increase in cofilin phosphorylation and caused unusual cofilin localization in the cell cortex in metaphase, instability of cortical actin organization and astral microtubules, irregular rotation and misorientation of the spindle, and a delay in anaphase onset. Similar results were obtained by treating the cells with a LIMK1 in hibitor peptide or latrunculin A or by overexpressing a non-phosphorylatable cofilin(S3A) mutant. Furthermore, localization of LGN (a protein containing the repetitive Leu-Gly-Asn tripeptide motifs), an important regulator of spindle orientation, in the crescent-shaped cortical regions was perturbed in LIMK1 knockdown cells.

Our results suggest that LIMK1-mediated cofilin phosphorylation is required for accurate spindle orientation by stabilizing cortical actin networks during mitosis. The accurate establishment of the positioning and orientation of the mitotic spindle is essential for cells to determine the axis and plane of cell division and, consequently, to specify the sizes, positions, and fates of daughter cells after mitosis. Proper spindle positioning and orientation are fundamental for both asymmetric and symmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division produces two unequal daughter cells and is crucial for a number of biological processes including embryogenesis, neurogenesis, tissue remodeling, and stem cell differentiation (1Ahringer J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Betschinger J. Knoblich J.A. Curr.

On the other hand, most cells undergo symmetric cell division that is important to give rise to two equal daughter cells. Positioning of the mitotic spindle is regulated by the interaction of astral microtubules that emanate from two spindle poles with specific regions of the cell cortex. A number of proteins have been proposed to mediate this interaction, including microtubule plus-end-associated proteins (such as EB1 and APC), the dynein-dynactin motor protein complex, and other bridging proteins that bind to the actin cytoskeleton or other components in the cell cortex (4Dujardin D.L.

Recent studies have shown that during symmetric cell division of cultured mammalian cells, integrin-mediated cell adhesion guides the proper spindle orientation parallel to the substrate plane through the regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (8Toyoshima F. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and disruption of the actin organization causes spindle misorientation (8Toyoshima F. Nishida E.

These findings suggest that the proper regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in the cell cortex plays an important role in the spindle positioning.

Cofilin is a key regulator of actin filament dynamics and reorganization by stimulating depolymerization and severance of actin filaments (10Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol.

The activity of cofilin is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser-3, with the phosphorylated form being inactive. LIM kinase (LIMK) phosphorylates cofilin specifically at Ser-3 and thereby inhibits the actin filament-disrupting activity of cofilin (13Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A.

Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Because cofilin contributes to maintain the actin monomer pool in the cell, LIMK activation increases the F-actin ratio and results in the stabilization or accumulation of cellular actin filaments (13Arber S.

The inactive Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin (P-cofilin) is dephosphorylated and reactivated by Slingshot (SSH) family protein phosphatases (23Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the level of P-cofilin periodically changes during the cell cycle in HeLa cells; it increases in the early stage of mitosis, reaches a maximum level in metaphase, and then gradually decreases to the basal level as cells enter into anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis (24Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LIMK1 and SSH1 activities also change during the cell cycle in a pattern that correlates with the periodical change in P-cofilin; LIMK1 activity increases, and SSH1 phosphatase activity decreases in metaphase, and then LIMK1 activity decreases, and SSH1 activity increases gradually in later stages of mitosis until cytokinesis (24Amano T.

Inhibition of cofilin dephosphorylation at later stages of mitosis by the overexpression of LIMK1 or a phosphatase-dead SSH1 mutant results in the formation of multinucleated cells; this indicates that cofilin dephosphorylation and reactivation in the later stages of the cell cycle are important for completing cytokinesis (24Amano T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33450-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of cofilin phosphorylation in metaphase remains to be determined. In this study we examined the role of LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation during mitosis in human cells. We show that suppression of LIMK1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibition of LIMK1 activity causes an unusual localization of cofilin in the cell cortex, instability of cortical actin organization and astral microtubules, irregular rotation and mispositioning of the mitotic spindle, and a delay in the onset of anaphase. Furthermore, a knockdown of LIMK1 perturbs the cortical localization of LGN (named after the repetitive Leu-Gly-Asn tripeptide motifs in the protein), a mammalian orthologue of Drosophila Pins, which is known to be an essential regulator of spindle positioning during asymmetric division in both Drosophila and mammalian cells (26Schaefer M.

To analyze endogenous LIMK1, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the anti-LIMK1 antibody (24Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cell Staining–HeLa cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and permeabilized with absolute methanol for 10 min at 20 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, cells were stained with the anti-P-cofilin antibody or anti-cofilin antibody (MAB-22) followed by a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon). For microtubule staining, cells were stained with the anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody followed by the rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes) was used for staining DNA. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, images were obtained using fluorescence microscope (model DMLB, Leica). Time-lapse Fluorescence Analysis–For time-lapse imaging, HeLa cells were plated on a 35-mm glass-bottom dish and transfected with plasmids encoding the YFP- and CFP-fused proteins and/or the siRNA plasmid. Fluorescent images were collected every 3 min for 60 min using a confocal imaging system (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a plan Apo NA 1.4 63× oil immersion objective lens (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Spindle Positioning Assay–The position of the mitotic spindle was evaluated by measuring the distance between the spindle center and the cell center and the angle between the spindle axis and the horizontal axis. To do this, HeLa cells expressing YFP-tubulin and CFP-H2B were fixed, and metaphase cells were photographed every 0.7 μm of z-section from the bottom to the top of the cell. The images were constructed into a three-dimensional image using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). The distance and angle were analyzed by IP Lab image analysis software using the obtained x-y image and z image, respectively (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Cofilin Localization Changes during the Cell Cycle–We have previously shown that the level of P-cofilin increases during mitosis (24Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because cofilin loses its actin binding ability by phosphorylation, an increase in the P-cofilin level during mitosis appears to affect its subcellular localization. To examine the role of cofilin phosphorylation during mitosis, we analyzed the localization of total cofilin and P-cofilin in HeLa cells during the cell cycle by immunostaining with an anti-cofilin antibody (which recognizes both phospho- and non-phospho-cofilin) and an anti-P-cofilin antibody (which specifically recognizes P-cofilin), respectively (Fig. 1A). Cell cycle progression was monitored by staining with DAPI. In interphase cells, total cofilin signals accumulated intensely in the cell periphery, whereas weak P-cofilin signals were detected diffusely throughout the cytoplasm; this indicates that non-phospho-cofilin is the major component of cofilin signals accumulated in the cell periphery. In contrast, in metaphase, P-cofilin signals markedly increased in the cytoplasm, and total cofilin signals were also diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm; this indicates that a large portion of cofilin molecules is phosphorylated and translocated from the cell cortex to the cytoplasm in metaphase. In early and late telophase, P-cofilin signals in the cytoplasm gradually decreased, and total cofilin signals accumulated in the contractile ring. When the cells were stained with the anti-cofilin antibody pre-adsorbed with antigenic cofilin or the second antibody alone for anti-P-cofilin antibody, no intense signal for cofilin or P-cofilin was detected (supplemental Fig. S1), which indicates that the signals observed in Fig. 1A represent the localization of endogenous cofilin and P-cofilin. These results demonstrate that cofilin dynamically changes its localization during the cell cycle, and the localization largely depends on the level of its phosphorylation. Similar to the observations in HeLa cells, the mitosis-specific cofilin phosphorylation and translocation from the cell periphery to the cytoplasm were observed in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells (supplemental Fig. S2), which indicates that the increase in cofilin phosphorylation and its diffuse distribution during metaphase are not particular to HeLa cells. To define the role of the phosphorylation of cofilin in its cytoplasmic localization in metaphase, we analyzed the localization of YFP-tagged wild-type (WT) cofilin and its S3A (a non-phosphorylatable mutant with a mutation of Ser-3 to Ala) and S3E (a phosphorylation-mimic mutant with a mutation of Ser-3 to Glu) mutants during mitosis (Fig. 1B). HeLa cells that were transfected with YFP-tagged cofilin mutants and CFP-H2B were synchronized and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Cofilin(WT)-YFP localized diffusely in the cytoplasm in metaphase and concentrated in the contractile ring in telophase (Fig. 1B, left panels), similar to the pattern of localization observed for total cofilin (see Fig. 1A). In contrast, cofilin(S3A)-YFP aberrantly accumulated in the cell cortex in metaphase (arrowheads in Fig. 1B, middle panels) and also accumulated in the contractile ring in telophase. The cells overexpressing cofilin(S3A) often showed the distorted cell morphology with the rugged cell surface in metaphase compared with the round shape of control cells. Cofilin(S3E)-YFP localized diffusely in the cytoplasm in both metaphase and telophase (Fig. 1B, right panels). Similar results were obtained for the localization of YFP-tagged cofilin mutants in U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of cofilin in metaphase contributes to its dissociation from the cell cortex and diffuse cytoplasmic localization in this phase. Knockdown of LIMK1 Suppresses Cofilin Phosphorylation and Causes Cortical Accumulation of Cofilin in Metaphase–We have previously shown that the kinase activity of LIMK1 increases during mitosis (24Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To examine the role of LIMK1 activation in metaphase, we suppressed LIMK1 expression in HeLa cells using siRNA. Transfection of an siRNA plasmid targeting LIMK1 reduced the expression of endogenous LIMK1 to nearly half that seen in control cells transfected with a vector or a control siRNA plasmid in which two bases in the target sequence were mutated (Fig. 2A). Based on the transfection efficiency of the HeLa cells (∼50%) under our experimental conditions, LIMK1 expression appeared to be almost completely suppressed in cells that were transfected with LIMK1 siRNA. When HeLa cells were cotransfected with LIMK1 siRNA and CFP (as a marker for transfection), synchronized at prometaphase, and stained with an anti-P-cofilin antibody, the P-cofilin signals were markedly reduced in LIMK1 siRNA cells compared with neighboring non-transfected cells (Fig. 2B, bottom panels). Transfection of control siRNA had no apparent effect on the P-cofilin staining in prometaphase (Fig. 2B, top panels). To further examine whether LIMK1 is involved in mitotic cofilin phosphorylation, HeLa cells were cotransfected with cofilin-YFP and LIMK1 siRNA, and the levels of cofilin-YFP phosphorylation in lysates from cells in interphase and mitosis were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-P-cofilin antibody (Fig. 2C). Cells that were transfected with the vector or the control siRNA exhibited higher cofilin-YFP phosphorylation in mitotic cells than those in interphase. In contrast, the mitosis-specific increase in the P-cofilin level was not evident in LIMK1 siRNA cells. These results indicate that LIMK1 is primarily involved in the elevation of P-cofilin in mitotic cells. We also examined the effect of LIMK1 knockdown on cofilin localization in metaphase. HeLa cells cotransfected with CFP-H2B, cofilin-YFP, and LIMK1 or control siRNA in the molar ratio of 1:4:15 were synchronized, and the localization of cofilin-YFP in metaphase was analyzed. The cells that expressed both CFP and YFP fluorescence were regarded to be the siRNA-transfected cells. In control siRNA cells, cofilin-YFP was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D, top panels). In contrast, in LIMK1 siRNA cells, cofilin-YFP was partially mislocalized in the cell cortex, and the cell morphology was irregular (arrowheads in Fig. 2D, bottom panels), in a pattern similar to the one observed when cofilin(S3A)-YFP accumulated in the cortex of metaphase cells (see Fig. 1B, middle panels). Similar results were obtained for cofilin-YFP localization in LIMK1-knockdown HEK293T cells (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together these findings suggest that LIMK1 plays a crucial role in cofilin phosphorylation and its diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm during metaphase. Knockdown of LIMK1 Causes a Delay in Mitotic Progression and Irregular Spindle Orientation–We next examined whether LIMK1 knockdown would affect the mitotic progression and spindle positioning in HeLa cells using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The mitotic spindle was visualized by the expression of CFP-H2B and YFP-tubulin. HeLa cells that had been cotransfected with CFP-H2B, YFP-tubulin, and siRNA plasmids in the ratio of 1:4:15 were cultured in thymidine-containing medium for 36 h and released for 12–15 h, before cells in metaphase were subjected to time-lapse observations. In cells that were transfected with control siRNA, the mitotic spindle was stably positioned near the geometric center of the cell with the spindle axis lying horizontal and almost parallel to the basement plane (Fig. 3A, top panels). In contrast, in LIMK1 siRNA cells the spindle rotated and moved irregularly in the cytoplasm. The spindle was positioned away from the center of the cell and was tilted with one pole of the bipolar spindle frequently out of focus in the horizontal view (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Although control cells usually divided parallel to the substrate plane, LIMK1 siRNA cells often divided along the non-horizontal axis, resulting in one of the two daughter cells not adhering to the substrate (data not shown). Furthermore, whereas most of the control cells entered anaphase within 30 min after the beginning of the observation and promptly divided into two daughter cells, about half of the LIMK1 siRNA cells arrested in metaphase and did not enter anaphase, even after 60 min of observation (Fig. 3B). To quantitatively show the effect of LIMK1 knockdown on the spindle positioning and orientation, HeLa cells that had been transfected with CFP-H2B, YFP-tubulin, and siRNA plasmids were synchronized and fixed, and then three-dimensional images were obtained using confocal microscopy. Both the distance between the midpoint of the spindle and the cell center in the horizontal view and the angle between the spindle axis and the basal surface were measured as shown in Fig. 3C. In LIMK1 siRNA cells the distance between the spindle center and the cell center was longer, and the angle of spindle axis was larger than those in the cells transfected with empty vector or control siRNA (Fig. 3D). Thus, LIMK1 seems to play a crucial role in ensuring the accurate positioning and orientation of the spindle. Inhibition of LIMK1 Activity Suppresses Mitotic Cofilin Phosphorylation and Causes a Delay in Mitotic Progression and Irregular Spindle Orientation–To examine the role of the kinase activity of LIMK1 during mitosis, we used a cell-permeable LIMK1 inhibitor (S3 peptide), which contains the phosphorylation site of cofilin and the cell-permeable sequence motif of penetratin. As a control, the RV peptide containing the reverse sequence of cofilin and the p"

The molecular signaling mechanisms downstream of cGMP are not well understood, however. We have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) approaches to specifically knock down a series of signaling proteins in bovine aortic endothelial cells, and we have combined biochemical analyses with physiological assays to investigate cGMP-mediated signal transduction pathways.

In contrast, stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO yields only a weak and transient increase in cGMP. ANP-induced cGMP production is selectively suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GC-A. ANP greatly enhances the phosphorylation at Ser-239 of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a major substrate of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that significantly influences actin dynamics. Moreover, the ANP-induced phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239 is accompanied by increased actin stress fiber formation and enhanced endothelial tube formation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GC-A, VASP, or PKG abolishes ANP-induced VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation, stress fiber formation, and endothelial tube formation. We have demonstrated similar findings in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, where ANP substantially enhances intracellular cGMP content, phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239, and endothelial tube formation.

The principal effectors of cGMP in the cardiovascular system include cGMP-gated monovalent cation channels, phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) (16Kishi Y. Ashikaga T.

Although the functions of PKG have been probed both with PKG knock-out mice and with analyses of cellular substrates phosphorylated by PKG, much remains to be understood about the molecular and cellular significance of PKG signaling in endothelial homeostasis. PKG knock-out mice display decreased life span, impaired vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation, diminished ischemia-induced angiogenesis, and disturbed platelet activation, highlighting the importance of this enzyme in the cardiovascular system (18Yamahara K.

This study uses duplex small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting constructs to specifically knock down a series of key signaling proteins in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and to explore the resulting changes in receptor-mediated cGMP and downstream signaling pathways. In both BAEC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we observe that ANP-activated GC-A generates a strong and sustained cGMP response, whereas NO-activated sGC elicits only a weak and transient cGMP signal. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GC-A selectively suppresses the ANP-induced cGMP response, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) enhancement of intracellular NO content has little effect on the cGMP response. ANP greatly enhances the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239 and augments endothelial tube formation and actin stress fiber formation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GC-A, PKG, or VASP differentially modulates endothelial tube formation. Moreover, knockdown of GC-A or PKG abolishes VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation as well as ANP-induced endothelial tube formation and actin stress fiber formation. Our results suggest that ANP-mediated cGMP signal transduction in the vascular endothelium is an important regulator of cytoskeletal organization and angiogenesis.

The siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The nonspecific control siRNA was from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO), 5′-AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGAC-dTdT-3′. BAEC were transfected with siRNA as described (37Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol.

Cyclic Nucleotide and Western Blot Analyses–cGMP level was determined using the cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with isobutylmethylxanthine (200 μm) for 10 min prior to agonist stimulation. Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method, using parallel wells of cells. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (37Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses for biochemical assays were performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Endothelial Tube Formation Assay–250 μl of Matrigel or growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was deposited into each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to coagulate for 30 min at 37 °C. For studies of BAEC without ANP treatment, cells were resuspended in 10% FBS-supplemented media, and 5 × 104 cells were added to each Matrigel-coated well. For studies of BAEC with ANP treatment, cells were resuspended in serum-free media, and 3 × 104 cells were added to each GFR Matrigel-coated well in the presence or absence of 10 nm ANP. For studies of HUVEC with ANP treatment, cells were resuspended in HUVEC culture medium with 5% FBS and added to Matrigel-coated wells in the presence or absence of 10 nm ANP. These cells were then incubated on Matrigel for 9-12 h at 37 °C and imaged by phase contrast microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TS100, 5x objective). Six random fields of view (FOV) per well were examined. For quantification purposes, a node was defined as an aggregation of cells from which three or more tube-like structures originated, and a tube referred to a continuous stretch of at least two cells containing no more than two nodes. For each FOV, ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to measure the total tube length and the length per tube in units of pixels. The number of tubes per FOV was also counted. Each experiment was repeated in 9-12 wells. Data were pooled and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Student's t test for paired comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. To prevent the variability among different lots of Matrigel or GFR Matrigel from affecting the results, each series of experiments used Matrigel from the same lot. Laser Confocal Microscopy of the Actin Cytoskeleton–BAEC grown on coverslips were transfected with control or target protein-specific siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated, fixed, stained, and optically analyzed by laser confocal microscopy, as described previously (37Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Comparison of ANP- and NO-stimulated cGMP Responses–cGMP is generated through the activation of both ANP/GC-A and NO/sGC, and the relative contribution of each pathway was measured in BAEC after stimulation by ANP, VEGF, or S1P. ANP elicited an immediate and substantial increase in intracellular cGMP content, reaching a maximum within 2 min and declining slightly to a steady high level over the next 60 min (Fig. 1A). To identify the contributions of the two distinct GC isoforms in this response, we selectively knocked down the expression of GC-A or sGC in BAEC by transfecting a custom-designed siRNA duplex targeted to the bovine GC-A mRNA or the bovine sGC mRNA, respectively. Consistent with the known activation of GC-A by ANP, the ANP-stimulated cGMP response was suppressed by knockdown of GC-A but not by knockdown of sGC (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of VASP had no significant effect on the ANP-stimulated cGMP response (data not shown). In contrast to the rapid and robust ANP-induced response, VEGF- or S1P-stimulated NO production generated only a delayed and very weak cGMP response (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, treatment of cells with the direct NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) had little effect on intracellular cGMP levels (Fig. 1B). Analysis of a concentration-response curve revealed that cGMP production reached half-maximum at an EC50 of 2.3 ± 0.4 nm ANP (n = 3) (Fig. 1C). We next investigated the phosphorylation of various proteins downstream of cGMP to characterize the roles of ANP/GC-A and NO/sGC in cGMP signaling. Phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239 (pS239-VASP) was greatly enhanced by ANP but only modestly enhanced by VEGF or S1P (Fig. 1D). VASP Ser-239 is known to be preferentially phosphorylated by PKG, whereas Ser-157 is preferentially phosphorylated by PKA (24Krause M. Dent E.W. Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Gertler F.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 541-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 25Harbeck B. Huttelmaier S. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We assessed cAMP levels in BAEC at different time points up to 30 min after treatment with 10 nm ANP. We found that ANP had little effect on cAMP levels (data not shown), and ANP-induced VASP phosphorylation at Ser-157 was much less than that at Ser-239 (Fig. 1D). Together, these findings indicate that ANP-induced signaling is primarily modulated through PKG. We also examined the effects of ANP, VEGF, and S1P on other key endothelial signaling proteins, and we used phospho-specific antibodies to probe immunoblots of agonist-treated endothelial cells. We analyzed phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 and protein kinase Akt at Ser-473, two key targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, which reflects activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Fig. 1D shows a small increase in eNOS phosphorylation in response to ANP, VEGF, and S1P. In multiple experiments, and found that the ANP effect on eNOS phosphorylation was subtle, variable, and statistically insignificant, whereas we and others (37Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J.

Additionally, Fig. 1D shows significant phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in response to VEGF and S1P. In all cases, ANP induced little or no change in the phosphorylation of these important constituents of the nitric oxide signaling pathway. Immunoblot analyses established that the abundance of VASP, Akt, and eNOS proteins remained constant during these treatments (Fig. 1D). ANP Modulates Phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239–We next measured the time course and concentration-response of VASP phosphorylation in ANP-stimulated BAEC. ANP-induced enhancement in pS239-VASP reached a maximum at 10 min and then remained at this level for up to an hour (Fig. 2A). The time course of VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation was similar to that of ANP-stimulated cGMP production, with a several-minute delay. The EC50 for VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation, ∼0.4 ± 0.1 nm ANP, was also similar to that for cGMP production (Fig. 2B). The ANP-induced phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-157 (pS157-VASP), a preferred site for phosphorylation by PKA, was much less marked than that at the PKG site Ser-239 (Fig. 2). In addition, the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 and of Akt was only nominally affected by ANP, suggesting that ANP plays a minimal role in the activation of eNOS (Fig. 2). The total protein expression of VASP, eNOS, and Akt remained constant in these experiments. ANP Induces a Long Term cGMP Signaling Response–Short term time courses showed that ANP-modulated responses were maintained at an enhanced level for up to1hin BAEC, suggesting a persistent effect. Therefore, we probed ANP-induced cGMP signaling for longer time periods to determine the duration of these responses. We found that the ANP-induced elevation in pS239-VASP persisted for up to 8 h and required up to 24 h to return to basal levels (Fig. 2C). We also examined the accumulation of cGMP in BAEC after extended exposure to ANP, and we found that cGMP content displayed a temporal response similar to that of pS239-VASP. Shortly after the addition of ANP, cGMP content climbed sharply to a peak value. The increase in cGMP accumulation was maintained for up to 8 h and declined back to basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 2C). Targeted Knockdown of GC-A or PKG by Duplex siRNA Constructs Abrogates ANP-induced Enhancement of cGMP Responses in BAEC–We selectively knocked down the expression of GC-A in BAEC using the siRNA duplex targeted to the bovine GC-A mRNA. Although the efficiency of GC-A knockdown could not be assessed because of the lack of suitable antibodies, immunoblot analyses showed that VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation was comp"

Here, we hypothesized that the MaxiK α-subunit (Slo1) and caveolin-1 may interact with each other. Slo1 and caveolin-1 physiological association in native vascular tissue is strongly supported by (i) detergent-free purification of caveolin-1-rich domains demonstrating a pool of aortic Slo1 co-migrating with caveolin-1 to light density sucrose fractions, (ii) reverse co-immunoprecipitation, and (iii) double immunolabeling of freshly isolated myocytes revealing caveolin-1 and Slo1 proximity at the plasmalemma. In HEK293T cells, Slo1-caveolin-1 association was unaffected by the smooth muscle MaxiK β1-subunit. Sequence analysis revealed two potential caveolin-binding motifs along the Slo1 C terminus, one equivalent, 1007YNMLCFGIY1015, and another mirror image, 537YTEYLSSAF545, to the consensus sequence, φXXXXφXXφ. Deletion of 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 caused ∼80% loss of Slo1-caveolin-1 association while preserving channel normal folding and overall Slo1 and caveolin-1 intracellular distribution patterns. 537YTEYLSSAF545 deletion had an insignificant dissociative effect. Interestingly, caveolin-1 coexpression reduced Slo1 surface and functional expression near 70% without affecting channel voltage sensitivity, and deletion of 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 motif obliterated channel surface expression. The results suggest 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 possible participation in Slo1 plasmalemmal targeting and demonstrate its role as a main mechanism for caveolin-1 association with Slo1 potentially serving a dual role: (i) maintaining channels in intracellular compartments downsizing their surface expression and/or (ii) serving as anchor of plasma membrane resident channels to caveolin-1-rich membranes.

In vascular smooth muscle, MaxiK channel appears to be a unique signaling protein because of its ability to mediate the effects of several vasoconstricting as well as vasodilating agents. The ability of MaxiK protein to complete with high fidelity these opposite tasks calls for specific associations and subcellular compartmentalization with corresponding signaling partners (1Lu R. Alioua A. Kumar Y. Eghbali M. Stefani E. Toro L. J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been appreciated that many signaling molecules are segregated primarily in specialized microdomains like caveolae (plasma membrane invaginations enriched with cholesterol and caveolin protein), thereby, optimizing signal transduction between agonists and specific effectors (2Cohen A.W. Hnasko R. Schubert W. Lisanti M.P. Physiol.

Three caveolin proteins have been identified, caveolin-1, -2, and -3. All of them seem to be expressed in smooth muscle (3Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, gene ablation experiments have shown that caveolin-1 plays a major role in the vasculature and pulmonary function. In this animal model, the disappearance of caveolae (and caveolin-1) uncouples MaxiK channel activity to Ca2+ sparks (3Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), and there is an increased channel current density at the surface membrane (5Cheng X. Jaggar J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H2309-H2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet, mechanisms favoring the interaction of MaxiK pore-forming α subunit (Slo1) with caveolin-1 or explaining an increased expression in the absence of caveolin-1 are missing. Mammalian Slo1 possesses two potential motifs for caveolin-1 binding: one consensus (1007YNMLCFGIY1015) and another mirror image (537YTEYLSSAF545) to the consensus motif, φXXXXφXXφ (where φ is an aromatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) (6Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The presence of these two sites makes Slo1 an excellent target for interaction with caveolin-1. We found for the first time that native Slo1 from rat aorta tightly associates with caveolin-1 sharing similar microdomains and displaying a close proximity at the surface of isolated vascular myocytes. We also found that the caveolin-1-binding motif 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 in Slo1 is the main mechanism underlying Slo1-caveolin-1 interaction and represents a new venue for channel surface expression control. Materials–Affinity-purified Abs were polyclonal anti-Slo1 (anti-KCa1.1 (1098–1196) Alomone Labs, lot AN05), polyclonal (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal (BD Transduction Laboratories) anti-caveolin-1, monoclonal anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10, Sigma), and polyclonal anti-β1 subunit (anti-Maxi Potassium channel beta, Novus Biologicals). Secondary Abs (goat) for cells were Alexa Fluor 568 or 594 anti-mouse and Alexa 488 anti-rabbit; for Western blot (WB) were Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) and IRDye 800 anti-mouse (Rockland Immunochemicals).

Mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Purified caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (SD) peptide was custom-made (Tufts University Core Facility). Animals–Sprague-Dawley male rats (∼200 g) were used. Protocols received institutional approval. Antibody Properties–Anti-Slo1 recognized a single strong band of ∼125 kDa in WB of transfected cells (Figs. 3 and 4; signals of dimers may also be detected); in native aorta, WB shows a strong signal of the expected molecular mass (∼125 kDa; weak signals that may correspond to dimers may also be detected) and a weaker ∼75-kDa band. WB and immunocytochemistry signals were all absent by preadsorbing the Ab with the antigenic fusion protein (1 μg of Ab:10 μg of antigen/ml). Anti-caveolin-1 Abs (poly and monoclonal) recognized a single strong band of the expected size (∼21 kDa) in transfected cells (Figs. 3 and 4) and in aortic lysates and do not cross-react with expressed caveolin-2 or caveolin-3 (not shown). No signal was detected when polyclonal caveolin-1 Ab was preadsorbed with the antigenic peptide (0.25 μg of Ab:2.5 μg of peptide/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-β1 subunit polyclonal Ab recognized a single strong band of ∼26 kDa (corresponding to the partially glycosylated form; without glycosylation the β1 molecular size is ∼22 kDa) in transfected cells (8Jiang Z. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Genomics. 1999; 55: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), and the signal practically vanished when the Ab was preadsorbed with the antigenic peptide (2 μg of Ab:10 μg of peptide/ml, Novus Biologicals). Secondary Abs gave practically no signals in immunocytochemistry and WB.FIGURE 4Deletion of the hSlo1 caveolin-1-binding motif 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 (hSlo1Δ1) greatly reduces hSlo1 capacity to associate with caveolin-1.

All WBs were with polyclonal anti-Slo1 and monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 Abs. IPs were with anti-Cav-1 polyclonal Ab (C and E) and with anti-hSlo1 polyclonal Ab (D).

Myocytes were dissociated with 40 units/ml papain, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (10 min, 37 °C) and with 200 units/ml collagenase Type II (10 min, 37 °C). Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (20 min), pH 7.4, and blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline (NGS, 30 min, room temperature). Double labeling was with polyclonal anti-Slo1 (10 μg/ml) and monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (5 μg/ml) Abs (overnight, 4 °C) in 1% NGS. Cells were washed, incubated (1 h, room temperature) with secondary Abs (2 μg/ml) and mounted using Prolong (Molecular Probes). Cell Transfection and Non-permeabilized and Permeabilized Labeling–HEK293T cells transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were used 2–4 days post-transfection. Live cells (non-permeabilized) were treated (1 h on ice; under 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere) with 8 μg/ml anti-c-Myc Ab (recognizing the hSlo1 c-Myc extracellular epitope), washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature) followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were double labeled with anti-Slo1 Ab (recognizing the C terminus, 3–10 μg/ml, overnight, 4 °C), treated with secondary Abs (2 μg/ml), and mounted. Co-IP–Aortas were lysed in (mm): 150 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl, 100 NaF, 5 EDTA, 1 Na3VO4, 0.5 Iodoacetamide, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, plus protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged (3,300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was precleared with 50 μl of protein-G-Sepharose beads (1 h, 4 °C) and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Precleared lysates (∼1.5 mg of protein) were incubated with anti-Slo1 or anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal Abs (2 μg, 3 h), then with 25 μl of protein-G-Sepharose beads (overnight), washed (10% glycerol/lysis buffer), eluted with loading buffer (plus 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol), boiled, and subjected to WB. A similar procedure was used for HEK293T cells, but Abs were pre-bound to protein-G-Sepharose beads (2 μg of Ab/50 μl of beads, 1 h, 4 °C). WB signals (infrared fluorescence, LI-COR Biosciences) were measured as integrated pixel intensities with ImagePro or Metamorph. Digital Image Processing–Confocal sections were acquired every 0.1–0.2 μm (z-axis) at 0.115 μm/pixel (x-y plane) for aortic myocytes and every 0.25 μm at 0.0575 μm/pixel for transfected cells. Images were three-dimensionally blind deconvolved using AutoQuant, and pixel intensities were measured with Metamorph. Analysis for protein proximity index (PPI) was carried out with custom-made software (11Lu G. Kang Y.J. Han J. Herschman H.R. Stefani E. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6087-6095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All conditions, including optical sectioning and exposures, were identical for a given experiment. Patch Clamp–Macroscopic currents were measured in inside-out patches. To compare current densities, we used pipettes of similar resistances (∼2 MΩ) that should have similar diameters and normalized the currents to the resistance of each patch pipette. Voltage-dependent activation (fractional open probability (FPo) - voltage) curves were obtained by fitting the experimental data to a Boltzmann distribution: (FPo = G/Gmax = 1/(1 + exp[(V½ - V)zδF/RT]), where; G = conductance, Gmax = limiting maximum conductance, V½ = half-activation potential, zδ = effective valence, and F, R, and T have their usual thermodynamic meanings. Pipette and bath solutions were (mm): 105 potassium methanesulfonate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES (free Ca2+ = 6.6 μm), pH 7.0. Caveolin-1 SD peptide was reconstituted in 70% ethanol (stock 10 mm). Its effect was tested by first acquiring control currents in the presence of vehicle alone (0.07% ethanol and 0.01% bovine serum albumin). Statistical Analysis–Data are mean ± S.E. Tests for significance were with Student's t test (p) except in Fig. 2, where the normal approximation of the sign test (psign test) was used. p < 0.05 was considered significant; n, denotes the number of preparations. A minimum of three different animals was used in all experiments. Association of Slo1 and Caveolin-1 in Native Vascular Tissue–We first examined the possible association of Slo1 with caveolin-1 in native rat aorta by three independent methods: (i) co-migration in sucrose density fractions after detergent-free extraction; (ii) reverse co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and (iii) co-localization in freshly dissociated myocytes. Co-migration of Slo1 and Caveolin-1 in Sucrose Density Fractions–We investigated whether Slo1 can share with caveolin-1 similar membranous structures that could be identified by their sedimentation properties. In particular, caveolin-1-enriched membrane domains (i.e. caveolae) are typically detergent-resistant and segregate into lighter sucrose density fractions (12Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). We found that, opposite to myometrium and cultured aortic endothelial cells (Refs. 13Brainard A.M. Miller A.J. Martens J.R. England S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C49-C57Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Wang X.L. Ye D. Peterson T.E. Cao S. Shah V.H. Katusic Z.S. Sieck G.C. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Duszyk M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1667: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), aortic tissue extraction with 1% Triton X-100 resulted in complete solubilization of Slo1 and caveolin-1 with their partitioning to heavy sucrose density fractions (not shown). These variations in Triton X-100 solubilization profile could be the result of the lipid composition of each tissue (16Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) making caveolin-1 domains detergent-resistant in myometrium but not in aorta. To find proper solubilization-extraction conditions that could preserve aortic caveolin-1-enriched membranes (17Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 18Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we performed solubility tests. With the exception of Na2CO3 (insoluble/soluble ratio = 10 ± 3.5, n = 3), 1% Triton X-100 and other detergents (see “Experimental Procedures”) readily solubilized caveolin-1 (mean insoluble/soluble ratio = 1.8 ± 0.2, n = 2–3 for each detergent) preventing the isolation of caveolin-enriched aortic membranes of light buoyancy. Thus, we used Na2CO3 to avoid disruption of caveolin-1-enriched membranes of this blood vessel. Western blots (Fig. 1A) demonstrate that a population of Slo1 (upper panel, ∼125 kDa) co-migrates with caveolin-1 (middle panel, Cav-1, ∼21 kDa) to light sucrose-density fractions (12–27% sucrose) (n = 9), whereas the non-caveolar marker, clathrin heavy chain (20Liu L. Abramowitz J. Askari A. Allen J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2173-H2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is predominant in the heavy fractions (n = 7). Reverse Co-IP Supports Slo1 and Caveolin-1 Close Association in Native Vascular Tissue–The co-migration profile in Fig. 1A suggests the possible association of aortic Slo1 and caveolin-1 in a macromolecular complex. Indeed, reverse Co-IP experiments using aortic lysates support this idea. To maximize the specificity of associations, Co-IP was performed under high stringency in the presence of detergents (0.1% Non-idet P-40 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate). To differentiate caveolin-1 signals (∼21 kDa) from huge signals of the IgG light chain (∼25 kDa), IP and WB analyses were performed with anti-caveolin-1 Abs generated in two different hosts. Typical WB analysis (Fig. 1B) shows the signals of Slo1 and caveolin-1 in tissue lysates (lane 1), and the products after IP without (blank, lane 2) and with Abs against Slo1 (lane 3) and caveolin-1 (lane 4). Regardless of the Ab used for IP, Slo1 and caveolin-1 were pulled down together. The specificity of the co-IP results was attested by the lack of signals in the blank. The mean values for co-immunoprecipitated caveolin-1 using anti-Slo1 Ab indicate that about 13 ± 6% (n = 3) of caveolin-1 was tightly associated with Slo1 in aorta (Fig. 1C). Likewise, 15% of Slo1 could be co-immunoprecipitated using anti-caveolin-1 Ab (n = 2). Co-localization of Slo1 and Caveolin-1 in Freshly Dissociated Aortic Myocytes–Because Slo1 is known to be abundant in smooth muscle, we directly analyzed the cellular distribution of Slo1 and caveolin-1 proteins in pre-cross-linked freshly dissociated aortic myocytes. These procedures were used to avoid any possible cellular remodeling due to enzymatic treatment or tissue culture (21Thyberg J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Single confocal images of doubly immunolabeled myocytes for Slo1 (green) and caveolin-1 (red) showed a high degree of overlap at the cell surface (Fig. 2, A–C). To evaluate the degree of co-localization, we used a recently developed method to measure the correlation coefficient (CC) in discrete 2-μm2 areas of three-dimensional deconvolved images. The ratio of the number of areas with significant (psign test < 0.05) positive correlation to the total number of areas examined is defined as the protein proximity index (PPI) (11Lu G. Kang Y.J. Han J. Herschman H.R. Stefani E. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6087-6095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A representative example of the analysis (D–G) is shown for the cell in (A and B). Fig. 2D is the CC distribution histogram of 40 confocal planes (every 0.1 μm, z-axis); in this case, the PPI for Slo1 to caveolin-1 was 0.6. Panel E shows the psign test versus CC plot marking the data points with positive CC and psign test < 0.05 (gray box). The PPI was practically the same at all cell depths (Fig. 2F). The localization precision of the method in the x-y plane was evaluated by shifting one of the planes every 115 nm in the x-axis, which demonstrated that the PPI decays to about half of its initial value by a shift of only ∼400 nm (Fig. 2G). Image analysis of several preparations demonstrated a high degree of protein proximity at the plasma membrane with a mean PPI value of 0.58 ± 0.07 (n = 16, 5 preparations). Apparently there may be at least two cell populations as half of cells had a PPI > 0.5 (n = 8, with 5 cells PPI ≥ 0.9), whereas the other half had PPI ≤ 0.5 (n = 8). To validate our measurements, Fig. 2 (H–J) illustrates the labeling (H) and quantitative analysis (I and J) of a cell labeled for the same protein (caveolin-1) but with two different Abs. Four planes at the middle of the cell were analyzed. As expected, PPI was ∼1, and the majority of data points had a positive CC value with psign test < 0.05 (J, gray area). The mean PPI value was 0.98 ± 0.01 (n = 27 cells, two preparations). Together the co-migration profile, the co-IP, and the significant degree of caveolin-1 and Slo1 co-localization in native aorta strongly support the idea that Slo1 can share similar plasma membrane domains with caveolin-1 and support the hypothesis that these two proteins may interact with each other. Thus, we designed experiments to test a potential protein-protein interaction and biological consequences. Role of Smooth Muscle β1 Subunit in Slo1-Caveolin-1 Association in HEK293T Cells–Because in native vascular myocytes Slo1 is associated with its modulatory β1 subunit (22Tanaka Y. Meera P. Song M. Knaus H.-G. Toro L. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we tested if Slo1 and caveolin-1 association is affected by coexpression of β1 subunit. Fig. 3A exemplifies the expression by WB of hSlo1, caveolin-1, and β1 subunit in samples used for IP with anti-caveolin-1 Ab; Fig. 3B illustrates that anti-caveolin-1 Ab is able to effectively co-IP hSlo1 independent of the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of β1 subunit. Although there was a small tendency of β1 to reduce Slo1-caveolin-1 association, this effect was not statistically significant (<7% reduction; n = 4; p = 0.7). The Caveolin-Binding Motif 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 in Slo1 Is the Main Mediator of Slo1-Caveolin-1 Association–We first examined the amino acid sequence of hSlo1 for consensus sequences for caveolin-binding: φXXXXφXXφ and φXφXXXXφ, whereφ is aromatic amino acid (6Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that Slo1 has a classic motif for caveolin-1 binding, 1007YNMLCFGIY1015, and a potential caveolin-1-like binding motif, 537YTEYLSSAF545, both within its C terminus. Thus, we proceeded to delete these motifs from hSlo1 and tested the impact of these modifications on hSlo1 and caveolin-1 association in co-IP experiments using co-transfected HEK293T cells. Fig. 4 (A and B) exemplifies the expression pattern of hSlo1 wild-type (WT), hSlo1 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 deletion mutant (hSlo1Δ1, Δ1), and caveolin-1 expressed alone or in combination with WT or Δ1 in cell lysates after WB analysis. All proteins were well expressed after transfection and were under the detection limit in lysates from untransfected cells. The arrows indicate the monomeric proteins of hSlo1 (∼125 kDa, A) and caveolin-1 (∼21 kDa, B). Fig. 4 (C and D) shows reverse co-IP of hSlo1-WT and hSlo1Δ1 cotransfected with caveolin-1. hSlo1-WT (Fig. 4C, top, lane 1) but not hSlo1Δ1 (Fig. 4C, top, lane 2) could efficiently co-IP with caveolin-1 when anti-caveolin-1 Ab was used for IP; the %hSlo1Δ1 that remained associated with caveolin-1 was 21 ± 4% (n = 4) (plot, Fig. 4C). Likewise, when anti-Slo1 Ab was used, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated caveolin-1 was greatly reduced to only 13 ± 3% (n = 3) when cells were co-transfected with hSloΔ1 in comparison to hSlo1-WT (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained using anti-c-Myc Ab (recognizing hSlo1 N terminus) for IP (not shown). Negative controls (IP with no Ab) did not show any signals supporting the specificity of the interactions. To explore the role of the conserved aromatic amino acids (underlined) within 1007YNMLCFGIY1015 in hSlo1-caveolin-1 association, we mutated these residues to alanines. Interestingly, the point mutant hSlo1-Y1007A increased caveolin-1-hSlo1 association by ∼40% (n = 7), whereas either mutant hSlo1-F1012A or hSlo1-Y1015A significantly decreased caveolin-1-hSlo1 interactions by ∼15% each (n = 5). Their effects seemed to be additive as mutating the three aromatic residues to generate a triple-alanine mutant (hSlo1-"

Gram-positive bacteria lack a classic periplasm but nonetheless encode Dsb-like proteins. Staphylococcus aureus encodes just one Dsb protein, a DsbA, and no DsbB. Here we report the crystal structure of S. aureus DsbA (SaDsbA), which incorporates a thioredoxin fold with an inserted helical domain, like its Escherichia coli counterpart EcDsbA, but it lacks the characteristic hydrophobic patch and has a truncated binding groove near the active site. These findings suggest that SaDsbA has a different substrate specificity than EcDsbA. Thermodynamic studies indicate that the oxidized and reduced forms of SaDsbA are energetically equivalent, in contrast to the energetically unstable disulfide form of EcDsbA. Further, the partial complementation of EcDsbA by SaDsbA is independent of EcDsbB and biochemical assays show that SaDsbA does not interact with EcDsbB. The identical stabilities of oxidized and reduced SaDsbA may facilitate direct re-oxidation of the protein by extracellular oxidants, without the need for DsbB.

The formation of native disulfide bonds through air oxidation of cysteine pairs is a slow reaction and organisms ranging from bacteria to humans encode enzymatic systems to catalyze the process.

This promiscuously oxidizing protein is a 21-kDa monomer containing a CPHC active site in a thioredoxin (TRX) fold with an inserted helical domain of ∼80 residues. Upon catalyzing disulfide bond formation in substrate proteins, reduced EcDsbA relies on EcDsbB, a quinone reductase, to recover its catalytically active, and higher energy, oxidized form (5Bardwell J.C.A.

Instead, SaDsbA has residues in these two motifs that are more typical of the Gram-negative disulfide isomerases DsbC and DsbG (CXYC, TcP).

Dorenbos R. Winter T. Antelmann H. Plaisier M.C. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Dubois J.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 984-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite some ability to complement DsbA function in these organisms, its low sequence identity suggests that SaDsbA has a different purpose, most likely to act on different, as yet unidentified target protein(s). Notably, the activity of SaDsbA in both E. coli and B. subtilis does not depend on re-oxidation by a DsbB-like disulfide oxidoreductase (15Kouwen T.R. van der Goot A. Dorenbos R. Winter T. Antelmann H. Plaisier M.C. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Dubois J.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 984-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Dumoulin A. Grauschopf U. Bischoff M. Thony-Meyer L. Berger-Bachi B. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 184: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, S. aureus does not encode a DsbB nor any other Dsb-like proteins.To investigate how SaDsbA catalyzes disulfide bond formation without the need for a partner disulfide shuttle protein, we determined the crystal structure of SaDsbA, representing the first such Gram-positive DsbA structure, and analyzed its biochemical and functional properties. Our findings show that the physicochemical basis for oxidative folding in S. aureus is very different to that underpinning Gram-negative oxidative folding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Protein Production–Native SaDsbA was prepared as previously described (27Heras B. Kurz M. Jarrott R. Byriel K.A. Jones A. Thöny-Meyer L. Martin J.L. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2007; 63: 953-956Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, SaDsbA containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was purified using cobalt-chelate chromatography, followed by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography (Superdex S-200 and Mono S 5/50, GL column, GE Healthcare). SaDsbA was oxidized before crystallization by addition of 1.7 mm copper(II) 1,10-phenanthroline.Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled SaDsbA was expressed from BL21(DE3) pLysS strain in minimal medium containing SeMet (L/D mixture) using methods similar to those described previously (28Heras B. Edeling M.A. Byriel K.A. Jones A. Raina S. Martin J.L. Structure. 2003; 11: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SaDsbA variants were generated using a Stratagene Quikchange kit (Stratagene, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing. SeMet SaDsbA and all SaDsbA variants were expressed and purified following the same procedures described for native SaDsbA.Crystallization and Diffraction Data Measurement–Native and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled SaDsbA crystals were obtained from 28-30% PEG 3350. MAD data were collected at the 8.3.1 beam line at the Advance Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Native, SaDsbA E96Q, and SaDsbA T153V data were measured using a Rigaku FR-E copper rotating anode generator operating at 45 kV, 45 mA with Osmic Confocal Max-Flu™ optics (either HiRes2 or Maxscreen). Reflections were measured with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate area detector (Rigaku Americas). A Cryo Industries CryoCool LN2 was used for cooling the crystals during data measurement. Data were processed using Crystal Clear (Rigaku).Structure Determination–The structure of SaDsbA was solved by MAD phasing of the SaDsbA-SeMet derivative. The two possible selenium positions were located in the asymmetric unit with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The resulting phases were used in the program ARP/WARP for automated building of the protein structure (31Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The structure was completed by manual building using the programs O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar).Refinement was performed using maximum likelihood in CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) on the native 1.81-Å resolution dataset. The final model corresponds to residues 14-177 of the deduced mature protein. Some surface residues with weak electron density were modeled with reduced occupancies for the side chain atoms (Glu104, Lys133, Glu170, Lys174).The structure of SaDsbA variants were solved by difference Fourier or molecular replacement (Phaser (35Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar)) methods by using the structure of native SaDsbA. Superposition of molecules was carried out using the LSQ options from the programs O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar).Molecular figures were generated using MolScript (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and PyMOL (37DeLano, W. L. (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CAGoogle Scholar) and figures of the electrostatic potential were generated using GRASP (38Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar).GdmCl-induced Unfolding Equilibria–For the chemical unfolding experiments, proteins were diluted to 1.5 μm in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 170 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 buffer containing increasing concentrations of GdmCl and incubated at room temperature for 24 h. The reduced proteins were unfolded under identical conditions but in the presence of 0.75 mm DTT. For the refolding experiments oxidized and reduced protein stock solutions (37.5 μm) were unfolded in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 170 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), 6 m GdmCl, (containing 20 mm DTT in the case of reduced proteins) for 16 h at room temperature. Then 20 μl of these solutions were mixed with 480 μl of buffers containing different concentrations of GdmCl and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. Transitions were measured fluorimetrically by the change in the fluorescence at 330 nm using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Data were evaluated according to the two-state model of folding using a six parameter fit (39Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar).Thermal Unfolding–Temperature-induced unfolding curves of native SaDsbA and variants were monitored by the change in the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) signal. Far-UV CD spectra (from 250 to 190 nm) of 10 μm protein solutions were recorded at 25 and 95 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength with the largest change in signal was determined from the differential spectrum at 25 and 95 °C. Thermal unfolding was monitored at 223 nm from 25-90 °C with a heating-rate of 1 °C/min. All measurements were carried out in 100 mm phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA pH 7.0 (in the presence of 0.75 mm DTT for reduced proteins) using a 1-mm quartz cuvette. Transitions were normalized by assuming a linear dependence of the spectroscopic signal of the native and unfolded states on temperature.Determination of the Equilibrium Constants with Glutathione–The redox equilibrium of SaDsbA and SaDsbA variants was determined as described previously (40Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μm protein was incubated for 16 h at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm GSSG and increasing concentrations of GSH. The redox state of the SaDsbA was followed by fluorescence emission at 335 nm. The equilibrium constant Keq and redox potential were determined according to standard thermodynamic equations (41Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Glockshuber R. Aslund F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25254-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Determination of pKa Values–The pH-dependent ionization of the nucleophilic cysteine thiol was followed by the specific absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm (42Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As a reference, the pH-dependent absorbance for the oxidized form of the protein was monitored. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in pKa buffer consisting of 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm boric acid, 10 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl, pH 7.5 and an average initial protein concentration of 20 μm. The oxidized and reduced protein samples were prepared by incubating the proteins with 1.7 mm copper(II)[1,10-phenanthroline] and 10 mm DTT, respectively. The oxidizing and reducing agents were eliminated by gel filtration using a PD10 column equilibrated in pKa buffer. The pH of the protein solution was lowered to 2.2 stepwise by the addition of aliquots of 0.2 m HCl. The absorbance at 240 and 280 nm was recorded on a Cary 50BIO UV-visible spectrophotometer and corrected for the volume increase. The pH dependence of the thiolate-specific absorbance signal (S = (A240/A280)reduced/(A240/A280)oxidized) was fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.Insulin Reduction Assay–The ability of SaDsbA and SaDsbA variants to catalyze insulin reduction in the presence of DTT was determined as previously described (43Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures were prepared in cuvettes containing 131 μm insulin, and various concentrations of oxidized protein catalyst (5-10 μm) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA. Reactions were started by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.35 mm. After thorough mixing, the optical density at 650 nm was recorded every 30 s. The non-catalyzed reduction of insulin by DTT was monitored in a control reaction without catalyst.Ubiquinone Reduction Assay–To determine the EcDsbB-catalyzed oxidation of SaDsbA by ubiquinone Q1 in vitro, 15 μm reduced SaDsbA in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-d-maltoside, pH 6.0, were incubated at 30 °C with 15 μm ubiquinone-1 (Q1; Sigma) (44Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of DsbB to a final concentration of 0.1 μm and the reduction of Q1 was monitored through the decrease in absorbance at 275 nm. EcDsbA was used as a positive control.Refolding of Scrambled RNase A–The in vitro assay of refolding of scrambled RNase was used to monitor the isomerase activity of SaDsbA (45Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). scRNase was prepared from reduced denatured RNase by incubating the enzyme (0.5 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 6 m GdmCl for at least 3 days at room temperature and in the dark. After acidifying the solution as previously described, the fully oxidized state of RNase A was confirmed by Ellman's assay. Reshuffling of scRNase (40 μm) was carried out by incubation in 100 mm phosphoric acid-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, with 10 μm oxidized DsbC or oxidized SaDsbA. The reactions were started by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10 μm. As positive and negative controls we carried out two additional reactions using folded RNase and scRNase, respectively, and without any Dsb protein. The assay was performed at 25 °C and at several time points samples were withdrawn and assayed for RNase A activity by monitoring cCMP hydrolysis.Coordinates and structure factors for SaDsbA, SaDsbA E96Q, and SaDsbA T153V have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID codes 3BCI, 3BD2, and 3BCK, respectively).RESULTSStructure of SaDsbA–The crystal structure of soluble SaDsbA (Fig. 1A), the deduced mature protein, was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods (46Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 47Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) and refined at 1.81-Å resolution to R-factor and R-free values of 19.8 and 21.9%, respectively (Table 1). The structure of SaDsbA reveals a fold similar to that of EcDsbA comprising a thioredoxin (TRX) domain and an embedded helical domain (Fig. 1A). The classic TRX fold is composed of residues 17-58 forming the βαβ motif and residues 155-181 forming the ββα motif with the connecting helix formed by residues 142-154. The 82-residue insertion in the TRX fold of SaDsbA (residues 59-141) forms an antiparallel three-helical bundle (α2-α4), an additional helix (α5) and an extension to helix α6. As in all redox-active TRX-like proteins, the TRX fold of SaDsbA includes a CXXC motif (Cys26-Pro27-Tyr28-Cys29) located at the N terminus of the first helix in the TRX fold (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSaDsbA MAD (SeMet)SaDsbA NativeSaDsbA E96QSaDsbA T153VData collectionWavelength (Å)0.97960.97970.953731.541.541.54Resolution range (Å)50-1.99 (2.06-1.99)50-1.99 (2.06-1.99)50-2.10 (2.18-2.10)37.1-1.81 (1.86-1.81)50.0-1.81 (1.87-1.81)62.4-1.95 (2.02-1.95)a, b, c, (Å, Å, Å)72.6, 72.6, 92.672.10, 72.10, 92.1072.42, 72.42, 92.6872.09, 72.09, 92.57Space groupP65P65P65P65P65P65Observed reflections156,671156,464134,695236,650108,64997,543Unique reflections19,033aFriedel pairs kept separate.19,036aFriedel pairs kept separate.16,161aFriedel pairs kept separate.24,92124,24919,271RmergebRmerge = ∑|I - <I>|/∑<I> where I is the intensity of individual reflections.,cValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.0.08 (0.32)0.07 (0.33)0.07 (0.21)0.05 (0.38)0.04 (0.26)0.07 (0.52)Completeness (%)cValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.100 (99.7)99.9 (99.5)100 (100)99.1 (91.6)96.0 (84.8)96.8 (92.0)<I>/<σ(I)>cValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.22.1 (3.9)24.0 (3.9)28.1 (6.7)21.9 (3.3)33.5 (4.1)9.3 (2.1)Phasing statisticsResolution (Å)50-2.1No. of selenium sites2Mean figure of merit0.34Refinement statisticsNumber of reflections in working set/test set24,569/2,43223,741/3,06019,156/2,880RfacdRfac = ∑h|Fo - Fc|/∑h|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes for each reflection “h”./RfreeeRfree was calculated with 10% of the diffraction data selected randomly and excluded from refinement.

Open table in a new tab Comparison with E. coli DsbA–The overall fold of SaDsbA resembles that of EcDsbA; the Cα atoms of 110 residues can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å, and the sequence identity is 15%. Despite the structural similarity, the two proteins have critical differences in regions surrounding the catalytic CXXC motif that could impact on substrate specificity and activity. These regions include the β3β4α7 (ββα) motif of the TRX fold (Fig. 1B) and loops connecting helices in the inserted helical domain, primarily the loop between α3 and α4 (Fig. 1C). The β3β4α7 motif at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain produces a dramatic difference between SaDsbA and EcDsbA (Fig. 1B). This region forms one edge of a hydrophobic peptide-binding groove in EcDsbA (48Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) that binds to DsbB (49Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and is proposed to interact with unfolded protein substrates. In both proteins this region is hydrophobic, however in SaDsbA it is 9 residues shorter, resulting in a shorter loop connecting β4 and α7 and a shorter α7 helix (by two turns) (Fig. 1B). Based on sequence alignment, this deletion appears to be conserved in DsbAs from Gram-positive organisms and, to a lesser extent in some Gram-negative DsbA proteins such as TcpG from Vibrio cholerae (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A, multiple sequence alignment of DsbA homologs from Gram-positive organisms, V. cholerae and E. coli DsbA.

Underlined residues indicate regions of EcDsbA that can be structurally aligned with SaDsbA. (Identical residues are shown in green, negatively charged residues in α3-α4 loop are shown in red.) B, close-up view of the SaDsbAwt, SaDsbA E96Q, and SaDsbA T153V active sites showing the CPYC motif (modeled as a mixture of both redox forms), the residues adjacent to the catalytic motif and the hydrogen bond interactions stabilizing the reduced form. T153V mutation results in the removal of water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the Cys26 thiolate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another notable difference between SaDsbA and EcDsbA occurs in the loop connecting helices α3 and α4. Compared with EcDsbA, this loop has an extra residue in SaDsbA and is oriented toward the CXXC active site, positioning the acidic side chain of Glu96 near to the nucleophilic Cys26 (6.9 Å) (Fig. 1C). Sequence alignment shows that acidic residues are highly abundant in this loop in Gram-positive DsbAs but absent in E. coli DsbA (Fig. 2A). The proximity of Glu96 to the redox active site of SaDsbA (Fig. 2B) suggests a possible role in substrate specificity or in modulating the redox characteristics.A cis-Pro loop is conserved among redox-active TRX-fold containing proteins and has been shown to be involved in substrate recognition (50Qin J.

https://openalex.org/W2066976690,"The striatum (caudate nucleus, CN, and putamen, Put) is a group of subcortical nuclei involved in planning and executing voluntary movements as well as in cognitive processes. Its neuronal composition includes projection neurons, which connect the striatum with other structures, and interneurons, whose main roles are maintaining the striatal organization and the regulation of the projection neurons. The unique electrophysiological and functional properties of the cholinergic interneurons give them a crucial modulating function on the overall striatal response.This study was carried out using stereological methods to examine the volume and density (cells/mm(3)) of these interneurons, as visualized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity, in the following territories of the CN and Put of nine normal human brains: 1) precommissural head; 2) postcommissural head; 3) body; 4) gyrus and 5) tail of the CN; 6) precommissural and 7) postcommissural Put. The distribution of ChAT interneurons was analyzed with respect to the topographical, functional and chemical territories of the dorsal striatum. The CN was more densely populated by cholinergic neurons than the Put, and their density increased along the anteroposterior axis of the striatum with the CN body having the highest neuronal density. The associative territory of the dorsal striatum was by far the most densely populated. The striosomes of the CN precommissural head and the postcommissural Put contained the greatest number of ChAT-ir interneurons. The intrastriosomal ChAT-ir neurons were abundant on the periphery of the striosomes throughout the striatum.All these data reveal that cholinergic interneurons are differentially distributed in the distinct topographical and functional territories of the human dorsal striatum, as well as in its chemical compartments. This heterogeneity may indicate that the posterior aspects of the CN require a special integration of information by interneurons. Interestingly, these striatal regions have been very much left out in functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1964216244,"The mRNA expression of lipogenic genes Scd-1 and Fas is regulated partly by the insulin-sensitive transcription factor SREBP-1c and liver X receptor α (LXRα). Compared with normal mice, the increase in the mRNA expression of hepatic Scd-1, Fas, and Srebp-1c was severely attenuated in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-deficient mice during the transition from the starved to the re-fed states. The concentration of the membrane-bound form of SREBP-1c was also lower in the livers of the PPARα-deficient mice during re-feeding but there was little difference in the concentration of the active, nuclear form, or in the abundance of Insig-2a mRNA. The response of plasma insulin to starvation and re-feeding was normal in the PPARα-deficient mice. Rat hepatocytes transfected with an adenovirus encoding a dominant negative form of PPARα were resistant to the stimulatory effects of insulin on Fas and Scd-1 mRNA expression in vitro. When LXRα was activated in vivo by inclusion of a non-steroidal ligand in the diet, the expression of the mRNA for hepatic Srebp-1c, Fas, and Scd-1 was increased severalfold in mice of both genotypes and resistance associated with PPARα deficiency was abolished during re-feeding. However, although re-feeding the LXRα ligand induced the immature form of SREBP-1c equally in the livers of both genotypes, the concentration of the nuclear form remained relatively low in the livers of the PPARα-deficient mice. We conclude that intact PPARα is required to mediate the response of Scd-1 and Fas gene expression to insulin and that this is normally achieved directly by activation of LXRα.

Insulin-mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism is central to the efficient control of plasma lipid concentration and the avoidance of excessive lipemia. Insulin resistance and its associated hyperinsulinemia are of common occurrence in metabolic diseases such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes (1McGarry J.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 500S-504SCrossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), both of which are also associated with excessive hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerol (2Ginsberg H.N. Zhang Y.L.

Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c thus forms an integral part of the mechanism by which insulin co-ordinates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Evidence is also emerging that implicates another transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), in the regulation of SREBP-1c and its target genes. During starvation, fatty acids, rather than carbohydrates, are the major sources of fuel for body tissues, and PPARα plays a major role in the up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid oxidation in the starved state (7Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 8Ferre P. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S43-S50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It has been shown that activation of PPARα induces transcription of Scd-1 (9Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and other lipogenic genes (10Knight B.L. Hebbachi A. Hauton D. Brown A.M. Wiggins D. Patel D.D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PPARα deficiency also abolishes the natural diurnal periodicity of Fas mRNA and de novo lipogenesis (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the fed state. These processes are normally insulin-dependent and the diurnal changes result from the periodicity of plasma insulin concentrations, which reflect the daily pattern of food intake. Although SREBP-1c forms part of the signaling mechanism by which insulin stimulates lipogenesis (12Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 13Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), details of the signaling pathway remain unclear. It appears, however, that insulin may act by enhancing the production of a natural ligand for another transcription factor, LXRα, which then activates transcription of Srebp-1c, one of its target genes (14Chen G. Liang G. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11245-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, LXRα ligands activate lipogenic genes such as Fas and Scd-1 in mice lacking SREBP-1c, suggestive of direct LXRα-mediated activation in a non-SREBP-1c dependent manner (5Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). LXRα has also been shown to interact directly with the Fas promoter (15Joseph S.B. Laffitte B.A. Patel P.H. Watson M.A. Matsukuma K.E. Walczak R. Collins J.L. Osborne T.F. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and to directly activate the transcription of Chrebp (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein), another lipogenic transcription factor, in a non-SREBP-1c manner (16Cha J.Y. Repa J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 743-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have sought to provide answers to three important questions regarding the role of PPARα in the insulin regulation of lipogenic gene expression. First, does PPARα deficiency interfere with the normal insulin-mediated up-regulation of lipogenic genes during the starved to re-fed transition? Second, if so, does this abnormality reflect defective insulin action resulting directly from the abolition of PPARα at the level of the hepatocyte? Finally, is PPARα involved in insulin signaling through LXRα and, if so, does this occur via SREBP-1c-dependent or non-SREBP-1c-dependent pathways?EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals–PPARα-null mice bred onto a SV/129 genetic background were kindly provided by Dr. J. Peters and Dr. F. J. Gonzalez (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Wild-type SV/129 mice were used as controls. All mice were male, and were used between the ages of 16 and 25 weeks. Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled cabinet (22–24 °C) on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on: 15.00 h) and were fed a commercial diet (Special Diet Services, Witham, Essex, UK) containing (by weight), 4.3% fat (0.02% cholesterol), 51.2% carbohydrate (mainly starch), 22.3% protein, and 7.7% ash. When required, the diet was supplemented with TO-901317 (0.01% w/w) obtained from Sigma. In some experiments, mice of both genotypes were starved for 24 h (food removed at 09.00 h) and were then either killed or re-fed with the normal diet or with the TO-901317-supplemented diet for periods of 6, 12, or 24 h. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation at the end of each re-feeding period. PPARα deficiency had no effect on food intake during either the dark phase or the light phase of the diurnal cycle (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor did dietary supplementation with TO-901317. Mean (± S.E.) values for food intake for 4 mice (g/24 h) were 16.8 ± 2.1 (wild-type fed chow), 14.9 ± 1.7 (wild-type fed TO-901317), 15.2 ± 2.0 (PPARα-deficient fed chow), and 17.0 ± 3.6 (PPARα-deficient fed TO-901317). All procedures performed in this study were approved by the Local Ethics Review Committee of the University of Oxford and were carried out under the appropriate Home Office (UK) personal and project licenses in accordance with the Home Office (UK) Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.mRNA Expression–Livers were freeze-clamped immediately after killing the mice and ground to a powder under liquid nitrogen. mRNA concentrations were determined by reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR (10Knight B.L. Hebbachi A. Hauton D. Brown A.M. Wiggins D. Patel D.D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem.

Primers and probes for mouse Srebp-1c, Scd-1, Fas, Aco, Lxrα, β-actin, and Insig-2a were prepared as described previously (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J.

Reactions were carried out in triplicate in 30 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with β-actin as internal standard. All values were related to a curve generated by a standard liver preparation and were corrected for β-actin mRNA content.Preparation of Liver Fractions Containing Nuclei and Microsomes–Liver microsomes were obtained using a modification of the method of Pawar et al. (19Pawar A. Botolin D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40736-40743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were excised and most of the blood was removed by rapidly perfusing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin, 5 μg/ml; leupeptin, 5 μg/ml; aprotinin, 2 μg/ml) via the vena cava. The perfused livers were placed in ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose solution containing protease inhibitors (18Dentin R. Pegorier J.-P. Benhamed F. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Faveau V. Magnuson M.A. Girard J.

The minced livers were homogenized in the same buffer (6 ml per 0.5 g) using a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to obtain a crude pellet containing nuclei and a supernatant fraction. A fraction containing microsomal membranes was obtained by re-centrifuging the 500 × g supernatant at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was re-suspended in Hepes buffer pH 7.6 (20Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from the 500 × g pellet obtained after the first centrifugation using the method of Gorski et al. (21Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet was suspended in 2 m sucrose containing protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 2 μg/ml; leupeptin, 2 μg/ml; benzamide 1 mm; dithiothreitol, 1 mm; and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm) and layered over a 2 m sucrose cushion. The nuclear fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. A nuclear extract containing mature SREBP-1c was obtained following lysis of the nuclear fraction and ammonium sulfate precipitation (21Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar).Western Blotting–Samples containing 20 μg of protein from either the nuclear extract or the microsomal fraction were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose paper, the resulting blots were probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-SREBP-1c antibody (IgG 2A4, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). The second antibody was sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). SREBP-1c-containing bands were detected by ECL and visualized by radioautography. Band densities were determined by scanning with a Bio-Rad “Gel-Doc” scanner.Hepatocyte Transfection–Rat hepatocytes were prepared and cultured as described previously (22Bartlett S.M. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After 3 h in culture, during which time the cells formed a monolayer, the medium was removed and the hepatocyes were transfected with adenovirus expressing either green fluorescent protein (Adv-GFP) or a dominant negative form of PPARα (Adv-null) (23Semple R.K. Meirhaeghe A. Vidal-Puig A.J. Schwabe J.W. Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Gurnell M. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Control dishes contained the adenoviral storage buffer only. After 3 h, the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with virus-free medium containing either 100 nm of the PPARα agonist GW7647 (23Semple R.K. Meirhaeghe A. Vidal-Puig A.J. Schwabe J.W. Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Gurnell M. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or 78 nm insulin. In view of the extremely rapid degradation of insulin by hepatocytes, high initial concentrations were required to ensure that insulin levels approximated to physiological values during most of the incubation period (24Bourgeois C.S. Wiggins D. Hems R. Gibbons G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E208-E215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control culture dishes and those containing the PPARα agonist alone received a much lower concentration of insulin (0.1 nm). Dishes were incubated for 18 h, the cells were harvested, and the RNA was extracted using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). mRNA concentrations were determined using reverse transcriptase-PCR in an identical manner to that described above for whole liver samples.Other Methods–Plasma and tissue lipid concentrations were assayed as described previously (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver microsomal SCD-1 activity was assayed as described by Kim et al. (25Kim H.J. Miyazaki M. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1750-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tissue and subcellular fraction protein contents were measured by the method of Lowry and colleagues (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma glucose was determined enzymically in duplicate in neutralized perchloric acid extracts (27Bulow J. Simonsen L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Frayn K.N. Powell D. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2034-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured in duplicate using a commercial mouse insulin ELISA enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden).RESULTSRe-feeding following Starvation Fails to Restore Srebp-lc, Fas, and Scd-1 mRNA Expression in PPARα-deficient Mice–When normal mice were deprived of food for 24 h, the mRNA expression of hepatic Srebp-lc declined, as expected (6Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar) to about 25% of that observed in the fully fed state (Fig. 1A). Re-feeding the starved animals for 6 h reversed this decline and expression was restored to that observed in the fully fed state after re-feeding for 24 h. The response of Srebp-lc mRNA expression to starvation and re-feeding in the livers of the PPARα-deficient mice differed markedly from that observed in the wild-type. First, in the PPARα-deficient mice fed ad libitum, the expression of Srebp-lc was somewhat lower than that in the wild-type (Fig. 1A) as observed previously (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This differential expression was retained after 24 h starvation (Fig. 1A). The most striking feature, however, was the almost complete lack of response of Srebp-lc mRNA expression to re-feeding in the livers of the PPARα-null mice. The expression of Fas mRNA in each genotype also showed a pattern similar to that of Srebp-1c in response to starvation and re-feeding. Thus, in the PPARα-deficient mice the response of Fas mRNA to re-feeding was blunted compared with that in the wild-type (Fig. 1B). The response of Scd-1 mRNA was somewhat more complex (Fig. 1C) and, in the wild-type, showed an increase in expression after starvation followed by a decline after re-feeding for 6 h. Expression was restored to that observed in the fully fed state after a total of 24 h re-feeding. Nevertheless, similar to that observed for Srebp-1c and Fas mRNAs, Scd-1 mRNA expression was also highly resistant in the PPARα-deficient mice to the normal stimulatory effects of re-feeding for 24 h. Thus, after 24 h, hepatic Scd-1 mRNA concentration in this genotype was less than 20% of that observed in the animals fed ad libitum. There were no significant abnormalities in the insulin response to starvation and re-feeding in the PPARα-deficient mice (Fig. 1D).Adenovirus-mediated Attenuation of PPARα Expression in Vitro Blunts the Response of Fas and Scd-1 mRNA to Insulin and to a PPARα Ligand–Rat hepatocytes in primary culture were transfected with adenoviral constructs encoding either a dominant negative form of PPARα, a constitutive transcriptional co-repressor (Adv-PPARα-null), or GFP (Adv-GFP) (23Semple R.K. Meirhaeghe A. Vidal-Puig A.J. Schwabe J.W. Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Gurnell M. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When compared with control hepatocytes that received the adenovirus storage buffer only, transfection with the Adv-GFP construct had no significant effect on the mRNA expression of any of the genes studied (see legend to Fig. 2). To establish if introduction of the dominant negative mutant was effective in attenuating PPARα activity, hepatocytes were treated with a potent PPARα ligand, GW7647, and induction of the mRNA for a known PPARα target gene, acyl-CoA oxidase, was determined. Fig. 2A shows that, although GW7647 increased the expression of Aco mRNA about 10-fold in hepatocytes transfected with the construct encoding GFP, this increase was almost totally abolished in the hepatocytes transfected with the construct containing the dominant negative form of PPARα. Treatment of the Adv-GFP hepatocytes with the PPARα ligand also led to a substantial induction of the mRNA encoding Fas, Scd-1, and Srebp-1c (Fig. 2), thus providing direct support in vitro for our observation that activation of PPARα enhances hepatic de novo lipogenesis and lipogenic gene expression in vivo (10Knight B.L. Hebbachi A. Hauton D. Brown A.M. Wiggins D. Patel D.D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Induction of Scd-1, and Fas mRNAs by GW7647 was significantly attenuated in the Adv-PPARα-null hepatocytes (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, insulin enhanced the mRNA expression of all the lipogenic genes in the hepatocytes treated with the Adv-GFP construct. However, the stimulatory effect of insulin on the expression of Fas and Scd-1 mRNA was greatly reduced in the Adv-PPARα-null hepatocytes (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast the response of SREBP-1c to insulin was not significantly attenuated by repression of the Pparα gene (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Inactivation of PPARα in vitro attenuates the stimulatory effects of a PPARα ligand and insulin on lipogenic gene expression. Hepatocytes from rats fed ad libitum were established in primary culture. Cells in some dishes were transfected with an adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative mutant of PPARα (Advnull) and others were transfected with an identical virus encoding GFP (Adv-GFP). After 3 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 100 nm GW 7647 (black bars) or 78 nm insulin (gray bars). Other dishes received medium containing 0.1 nm insulin only (no additions). Cells were cultured for a further 18 h and mRNA concentrations were determined. Data are expressed as the change resulting from the addition of GW 7647 or of insulin asa%of that observed with 0.1 nm insulin alone (no additions). The basal levels (in the presence of 0.1 nm insulin only with no other additions) of Aco expression in the Adv-GFP and Adv-null hepatocytes were 1.10 ± 0.16 and 0.69 ± 0.12, respectively. Corresponding values for Fas were 1.38 ± 0.45 and 1.11 ± 0.31, for SCD-1 were 1.02 ± 0.07 and 1.17 ± 0.09, and for SREBP-1c were 0.85 ± 0.15 and 1.56 ± 0.26. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of 3 independent hepatocyte preparations. Values in the columns marked with *, **, and *** are significantly different (p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively) from those obtained in dishes with no additions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PPARα Deficiency Affects Neither the Expression nor the Exogenous Activation of LXRα–Because the transcription of Srebp-lc, Fas, and Scd-1 is enhanced by activated LXRα (28Kalaany N.Y.

Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) it was of interest to determine whether the effects of genotype, starvation, and re-feeding on the expression of these genes were accompanied by changes in the expression of Lxrα mRNA. In the livers of mice fed ad libitum, PPARα deficiency did not affect Lxrα mRNA expression (Fig. 3). Starvation for 24 h increased expression significantly in the livers of the wild-type mice as noted previously and attributed to a fatty acid-mediated increase in LXRα transcription and mRNA stability (29Tobin K.A. Ulven S.M. Schuster G.U. Steineger H.H. Andresen S.M. Gustafsson J.A. Nebb H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10691-10697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Expression also increased, to a similar extent, in the livers of the PPARα-deficient mice, suggesting that the effect of fatty acids on Lxrα was not mediated by PPARα. Re-feeding for a period as short as 6 h was sufficient to reduce the expression of Lxrα mRNA to concentrations similar to those observed in the livers of mice fed ad libitum. Once again, PPARα deficiency had no effect on the extent of this decrease during the re-feeding period (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3PPARα deficiency does not affect the response of Lxrα expression to starvation and re-feeding.

The effects of this treatment on the mRNA expression of the LXRα target genes Fas, Scd-1, and Srebp-1c were determined (Fig. 4). These results show that the patterns of recoveries of mRNA expression during re-feeding under these conditions were indistinguishable in the livers of both the wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, in marked contrast to those observed following re-feeding of the un-supplemented chow diet (Fig. 1).FIGURE 4Re-feeding with an LXRα-ligand restores the response of lipogenic gene expression in PPARα-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W2063190884,"The degradation of connexin43 (Cx43) has been reported to involve both lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; however, very little is known about the mechanisms regulating these Cx43 degradation pathways. Using yeast two-hybrid, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we have identified a novel Cx43-interacting protein of approximately 75 kDa, CIP75. Laser confocal microscopy showed that CIP75 is located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum, as indicated by the calnexin marker, with Cx43 co-localization in this perinuclear region. CIP75 belongs to the UbL (ubiquitin-like)-UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain-containing protein family with a N-terminal UbL domain and a C-terminal UBA domain. The UBA domain of CIP75 is the main element mediating the interaction with Cx43, whereas the CIP75-interacting region in Cx43 resides in the PY motif and multiphosphorylation sites located between Lys 264 and Asn 302. Interestingly, the UbL domain interacts with the S2/RPN1 and S5a/RPN10 protein subunits of the regulatory 19 S proteasome cap subunit of the 26 S proteasome complex. Overexpression experiments suggested that CIP75 is involved in the turnover of Cx43 as measured by a significant stimulation of Cx43 degradation and reduction in its half-life with the opposite effects on Cx43 degradation observed in small interference RNA knockdown experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1965866604,"The performance of many semiconductor quantum-based structures is governed by the dynamics of charge carriers between a localized state and a band of electronic states. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we studied the transport of inelastic tunneling electrons through a prototypical localized state: an isolated dangling-bond state on a Si(111) surface. From the saturation of the current at an energy resonant with this state, the hole capture rate by the dangling bond was determined. By further mapping the spatial extension of its wave function, the localized nature of the level was found to be consistent with the small magnitude of its cross section. This approach illustrates how the microscopic environment of a single defect critically affects its carrier dynamics."

The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans, and Oliver Smithies for developing specific gene modification techniques and mouse embryonic stem cell technology that, when combined, enable the creation of “knockout” mice. Analyses of these mutant animals have revolutionized the elucidation of gene functions, and these mice have proved to be valuable models of numerous human diseases. Exactly a century ago, Clarence Cook Little, a graduate student in William Ernest Castle's laboratory at Harvard University, clung to the belief that the lowly mouse could one day become a model in which to study human physiology and disease. Little and Castle realized that, to achieve this goal, they had to develop mouse strains that were more genetically homogeneous. Backed by Castle's expertise as a respected authority on mammalian Mendelian genetics, Little commenced interbreeding wild mice in 1909. He hoped to obtain animals with a better defined genetic background that would simplify laboratory studies of mammalian traits. The success of this program marked the beginning of inbred mouse genetics. This year, we celebrate a century of advances in a subject that has permeated every field of physiology and medicine: animal genetics. We rejoice that the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to three individuals who pioneered techniques of gene targeting in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The work of these researchers revolutionized the study of mouse genetics and has made it possible for scientists around the world to generate genetically defined mouse mutants for the study of functions of individual genes. The 2007 Nobel Prize winners are Mario Capecchi of the University of Utah, Martin Evans of Britain's Cardiff University, and Oliver Smithies of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The citation reads: “For their discoveries of principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells.” This year's Nobel Prize nicely complements last year's award to Andrew Fire of Stanford University and Craig Mello of the University of Massachusetts at Worcester, who jointly received the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of microRNAs. The principles by which microRNAs function have been exploited to develop interference RNAs that permit the silencing of gene functions at will and with relative ease. Scientists study biology to learn about physiology and investigate mammals to learn about human behavior, development, and pathophysiology. At the cellular and molecular levels, there are significant similarities between human cells and those of other multicellular or even unicellular organisms. However, at the organismal level, humans share extensive physiological characteristics only with other primates. Nevertheless, many features of human development and biology are closely analogous to those of fast-breeding and easily maintained rodents. Embryonic development, organogenesis, hematopoiesis, and immune responses are all strikingly comparable at the physiological level in humans and mice. Perhaps this should not be surprising, as 99% of the genes in these two species are shared. Thus, the use of the mouse as a model for studying human development and disease is an approach that can be readily justified. The early pioneers of mouse genetics were well aware of the possibilities of using rodents to learn more about human biology and genetics. Little, Leonell Strong, E. Carlton MacDowell, and others spent almost two decades systematically intercrossing mice captured from the wild and generating scores of inbred strains. A dozen of these lines are still commonly used in laboratories around the globe, including the Balb/c, B6, B10, C3H, CBA, and DBA strains. Comparative investigations of these multiple lines of mice derived from a mixture of forebears from relatively diverse geographic locations have allowed scientists to probe the extent of mammalian genetic diversity. Many of the mouse strains created by these researchers, as well as other rodent mutants, were eventually consolidated at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, which Little founded in 1929. The Jackson Laboratory became and remains to this day one of the meccas of rodent genetics, devoted to the unearthing and housing of interesting substrains and mutants. Back in the 1930s, investigations of the Jackson Laboratory's collection of mutants yielded major advances in our understanding of many aspects of mammalian bodily processes. For example, Peter Gorer and George Davis Snell, another student of Castle, joined the Jackson Laboratory and devoted 25 years almost exclusively to studies of mouse histocompatibility genes. In the course of these studies, Snell discovered the H-2 complex (containing the MHC genes) that governs transplant rejection and immune responses. For this work, Snell shared the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Jean Dausset and Baruj Benacerraf. Little's trailblazing efforts were followed by the heroic labors of many who undertook the arduous task of creating and characterizing mouse models of human diseases. Although the initial objective was to study tumorigenesis in mice, the intercrossing of millions of animals over several decades also produced rare examples of mice exhibiting symptoms of anemia, immunodeficiency, fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, or obesity (among others). The work of many dedicated individuals contributed to this cause, including the pioneering research of Elizabeth Russell, Sheldon Bernstein, and Jane Baker on mouse anemia; the landmark experiments of Douglas Coleman on obesity; and Donald Bailey's ground-breaking development of recombinant inbred strains that facilitate gene mapping. William and Lee Russell of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, as well as Mary Lyon and Bruce Cattanach of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Hartwell in England, led research teams that formalized irradiation and other mutagenesis techniques that made it easier to study basic questions in mouse genetics. However, despite these prodigious efforts, elucidation of the genetic causes of physiological phenomena such as cancer and obesity proved to be exceedingly strenuous. One impediment to more rapid progress in these studies was the discovery that the mice in question were genetically more closely related than was ideal. Underneath their ostensible diversity, these rodents actually arose from a relatively small number of ancestors derived from a limited number of original sources. Even with the benefit of modern techniques of irradiation and chemical mutagenesis, the process of obtaining genetic variants via breeding programs remains lengthy, costly, and labor intensive. With the dawn of the molecular biology era in the mid-1970s, it became possible to identify the molecular bases of the physiological and pathophysiological variations observed in different mouse strains and their mutants. However, early attempts to delineate these mutations at the molecular level required an enormous struggle and consumed years of demanding experimentation. Even with today's technology, this type of “forward genetics” approach requires considerable effort to pinpoint the molecular changes occurring in randomly generated mutants. We now know, as a result of two massive DNA sequencing projects carried out by Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena at the University of North Carolina and his collaborators at the Jackson Laboratory, as well as by David Cox of Perlegen Sciences Inc., that the genomes of the commonly used laboratory strains and several lines of wild mice differ by only a few million base pairs (Callaway, 2007Callaway E. Nature. 2007; 448: 516-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This amount of variation, which is unevenly distributed in the mouse genome, is considerably less than expected. The creation of additional rodent strains from stocks of a more diverse genetic background are currently in progress. While the enterprise of mouse genetics was steadily advancing from the 1930s to the 1980s, the study of the genes themselves was undergoing a revolution. By the late 1970s, the techniques of molecular biology were starting to deliver significant numbers of genes to biologists for study, and the need for a quick and easy means of generating defined mouse mutants became a priority. Solving this difficulty was never as dire in other species as it was in mammalian cells, for obvious reasons. Unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, and even multicellular species like the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, reproduce at a much faster rate than mammals and are much more amenable to mutagenesis. Mammalian geneticists dreamt of refining the techniques of “forward genetics” used to generate mutations in flies and worms and applying them to mammalian cells. A technology that went a long way to satisfying the desire of biologists to study the functions of specific genes in whole animals was the independent development of transgenic mice in the early 1980s by Rudolf Jaenisch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Frank Ruddle of Yale University, and Ralph Brinster of the University of Pennsylvania and Richard Palmiter of the University of Washington (among others) (Palmiter and Brinster, 1985Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 343-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These mutant animals allowed researchers to assess a gene's function by examining the effects of its overexpression in either a whole animal or a specific tissue. Thousands of such mice were produced and studied and the application of this technology is still prevalent today. Nevertheless, despite the usefulness of transgenic mice, mammalian geneticists still sought a means of mutating a gene and observing the results of its loss of function in a whole animal. Thus, the goal was to generate somatic cell mutants or, better still, gene-targeted mice bearing specific alterations. The trick was to find a way to incorporate a defined mutation into the genome of a mammalian embryo that could then develop into a whole animal displaying the effects of that mutation. The development of a whole animal from an embryo requires that the earliest embryonic cells be multipotent, that is, have the capacity to generate every cell type needed in the body. The multipotency of mammalian cells has fascinated embryologists and biologists for decades. In 1961, Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto discovered that a single bone marrow precursor cell capable of forming a colony in an irradiated recipient mouse could give rise to multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells (Till and McCulloch, 1961Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Radiat. Res. 1961; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). This result clearly demonstrated that at least some mammalian progenitor cells had the ability to differentiate into cell types of different lineages and suggested that it might be possible to manipulate the course of organogenesis. These experiments set the stage for the very ambitious dream (at the time) of regenerating an entire animal by injecting a small number of multipotent cells into an early embryo. The ability to propagate in culture, or isolate from animals, precursor cells having the capacity to give rise to an entire mammal would allow researchers to manipulate the genetics of a whole animal. The first step in this direction came from the work of Roy Stevens at the Jackson Laboratory, G. Barry Pierce of the University of Colorado, and Beatrice Mintz at the Fox Chase Institute in Philadelphia (among others). These researchers reported on studies in which teratocarcinoma cell lines were induced to differentiate into cells of various tissue types, yielding invaluable insights into the plasticity of multiple lineage commitment (Andrews, 2002Andrews P.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, teratocarcinoma cells could not be used to regenerate an entire animal because these cells are intrinsically tumorigenic. The breakthrough came in 1981 when Evans and his colleagues and Gail Martin's laboratory independently succeeded in developing ES cell lines (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6067) Google Scholar, Martin, 1981Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar). These cells, which were derived from an early murine blastocyst, grew indefinitely in tissue culture and retained their multipotency as long as they were cultured on feeder layers. When injected into a new blastocyst, these ES cells contributed to the developing murine embryo, resulting in the creation of a genetic mosaic. The chimeric embryos were then brought to term by implantation in a pseudopregnant female mouse (see Figure 1). This seminal work provided researchers with the opportunity to manipulate the genetics of a mammal at the embryonic stage. The Evans lab provided further proof of this principle by introducing the DNA of a retroviral provirus into ES cells and documenting the transmission of this foreign DNA through multiple generations of mice (Robertson et al., 1986Robertson E. Bradley A. Kuehn M. Evan M. Nature. 1986; 323: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Despite these triumphs, technical challenges remained in consistently sustaining ES cells in their multipotent state in culture. In 1988, Austin Smith and John Heath at Oxford University and their collaborators at the Genetics Institute in Boston, as well as Nicholas Gough of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, discovered that inclusion in the culture medium of the growth factor leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allowed ES cells to robustly retain their multipotency. With this difficulty conquered, ES cell technology became well defined and reproducible. The ability to reliably maintain ES cells in culture has allowed investigators to work out the principles and mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal and to identify critical regulators of tissue/cell differentiation. However, back in the 1980s, the more important observation was that ES cells offered an unprecedented opportunity to view the physiological consequences of specific genetic changes such as point mutations, insertions, and deletions. The next hurdle to overcome was finding a method of introducing such genetic alterations into a mammalian genome. It had long been known that bacteria and yeast could repair damage to their DNA through a process known as homologous recombination. Homologous recombination is a natural route by which a stretch of mutated DNA can be exchanged with a functional copy of this region of the genome if there is extensive nucleotide similarity between the two DNA sequences. By the early 1980s, studies of the somatic recombination of gene segments of the B and T cell receptor genes had made it clear that mammalian cells could also carry out this mechanism of DNA sequence exchange. However, it was not known whether this type of homologous recombination could be induced in mammalian cells through the introduction of naked foreign DNAs, or whether such introduction would be efficient enough to permit the creation of specific genetic changes. The laboratories of Capecchi and Smithies were the first to show that homologous recombination between plasmid DNAs could be detected when the plasmids were introduced into mammalian cells. These investigators also subsequently demonstrated that specific mutations could be incorporated into mammalian DNA via the introduction of a plasmid-based vector bearing foreign DNA. Surprisingly, a reasonably high degree of recombination was observed even when the vector and the intended genomic target sequence showed only a few kilobases of homology. In 1987, Capecchi's group succeeded in mutating the HPRT gene in ES cells by gene targeting (Thomas and Capecchi, 1987Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Independently, the introduction of a vector bearing the wild-type HPRT gene sequence was used to target and functionally correct a mutated HPRT gene in an ES cell (Doetschman et al., 1987Doetschman T. Gregg R.G. Maeda N. Hooper M.L. Melton D.W. Thompson S. Smithies O. Nature. 1987; 330: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These efforts formally proved that homologous recombination could be used to modify the mammalian genome in a predetermined manner, paving the way for the creation of gene-targeted “knockout” mice. The combination of the technologies of ES cell manipulation and homologous recombination provided the powerful “reverse genetics” approach that had been long sought to generate genetically defined rodents for the study of mammalian physiology and pathophysiology. Dozens of laboratories dived into the arena and discovered that, despite its complexity, the technology was relatively easy to master. Within a decade, over one thousand mutated mice were generated. In addition, the ability to manipulate homologous recombination in mammalian cells energized the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Today, a veritable cottage industry of hundreds of laboratories worldwide has produced an estimated 10,000 different types of genetically engineered mice. Furthermore, an international consortium has recently been formed with an eye to mutating all protein-encoding genes in the mouse genome using this technology. At this point, the bottleneck to progressing faster in defining gene functions lies in analyzing the phenotypes of these animals rather than creating them. As the gene-targeting juggernaut gathered momentum in the mid-1990s, results were accumulating that had far-reaching consequences. It was soon discovered that null gene-targeted mutations, which disrupt gene function in every tissue of an animal, often precluded the study of a gene's function in adult tissues. Thus, other genetic modifications in rodents, including deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, and point mutations, were devised to study the relationship between a gene's structure and its function. A further refinement of this approach was to conditionally delete or mutate genetic loci in an inducible fashion, such that specific genetic alterations could be turned “off” or “on” in a temporal or spatial manner. The technology to create these conditional mutations arose from an ingenious application of the bacteriophage enzyme Cre recombinase by the laboratory of Klaus Rajewsky, then at the University of Koln (Gu et al., 1994Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). By placing Cre recombinase under the control of a tissue-specific or stage-specific promoter and flanking the gene to be targeted with the loxP sites recognized by Cre, researchers could choose the timing and location of deletion of the gene of interest. These and other variations on gene-targeting techniques have led to the establishment of an estimated 500 mouse models of human diseases ranging from cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease to neurological ailments. In addition to the basic research conducted on these mutants, pharmaceutical companies frequently use them to aid in drug discovery and testing. Like all outstanding work, the discovery of mouse ES cells and gene targeting has had an impact much greater than what might have been expected. Many researchers muse that parallel studies of human ES cells could perhaps move us closer to understanding true human traits. Such understanding could some day spur the use of this technology for the purposes of regenerative medicine. However, such research would entail the manipulation of human ES cells, a procedure that is considered unethical in many countries today. It is unlikely that this controversy will evaporate in the near future because gene-targeting techniques currently rely on ES cells, and human ES cells can only be derived from human embryos. However, several groups of investigators made a discovery last year that promises to provide a surrogate approach to studying human embryonic development and physiology without having to directly investigate human ES cells. Working in mice, teams led by Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, Rudolph Jaenisch at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Kathrin Plath of the University of California at Los Angeles and Konrad Hochedlinger of the Massachusetts General Hospital have found that a small percentage of murine skin fibroblasts can be transduced to revert to multipotent stem cells by the introduction of only four transcription factors (Rossant, 2007Rossant J. Nature. 2007; 448: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These “reprogrammed” cells, which are termed “induced pluripotent stem cells,” are quite similar in their properties to ES cells but are less tumorigenic than teratocarcinoma cells. Just three weeks ago, the laboratories of Shinya Yamanaka and James Thomson of the Genome Center of Wisconsin reported using a similar transduction approach to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from human somatic cells (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

These human ES-like cells express ES cell-surface markers, have normal karyotypes, express telomerase, and are capable of differentiating into cell types of all three germ layers. This exciting scientific advance means that it may soon be possible to provide patients with multipotent stem cells tailored for a given therapeutic purpose. Because these ES-like cells would have been generated from the patient's own fibroblasts, the chance of the patient's immune system rejecting them upon transplantation would be minimal. Even more satisfying may be the prospect that, using the homologous recombination procedure established by Capecchi and Smithies, ill effects from aberrations present in the germline of patients might be treated using tissue-specific ES-like cells. These possibilities show that the work of Evans, Capecchi, and Smithies has boundless implications for the scientific, medical, and ethical arenas. As we move into the second century of studying mouse genetics, we eagerly await the next great discoveries in murine and human genetic manipulation that will further advance medical science. By awarding the 2007 Nobel Prize to the discoverers of knockout mice, the international community has vindicated Little's original faith in the power of small creatures to greatly benefit human health. Many believe that the 21st century will be the era in which studies of human genetics lead directly to regenerative medicine. If so, Little's conviction will have been validated beyond his fondest imaginings. I thank B.G. Neel, J. Rossant, and M. Saunders for helpful discussions."

Furthermore, klotho, a protein with glucuronidase activity that has been linked to longevity, was postulated to slow down cell surface removal of TRPV5 via an alteration of the extracellular TRPV5 glycosylation (16Chang Q.

Although these studies have provided new information on the regulation of TRPV5, the molecular mechanisms utilized in the endocytosis of TRPV5 are not known. Similarly, the dynamics of TRPV5 internalization and the fate of internalized TRPV5 are unclear. In this study we show that TRPV5 is constitutively internalized via a dynaminand clathrin-dependent pathway and that internalized TRPV5 enters the Ca2+-sensitive recycling pathway. These findings provide a framework to understand the physiological regulation of TRPV5 trafficking. Furthermore, our data present the first evidence for a role of clathrin-dependent endocytosis and Ca2+-sensitive protein recycling in the regulation of TRP channel cell surface expression. DNA Constructs–Constructs containing FLAG™ or hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged or untagged full-length TRPV5 in pT7Ts, pciNeo-IRES-GFP, or pCB6 were obtained as described previously (18Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TRPV5 constructs with epitope tags at predicted extracellular positions were prepared by mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene), resulting in the replacement of amino acids in TRPV5 by an HA or FLAG™ tag or in the insertion of these tags (Fig. 1A). For the construction of HA-TM-TRPV5, the HA-tagged transmembrane domain of KCNE1 was obtained by PCR (forward, 5′-CGCCGTACGGCCACCATGTACCCATACGACGTGCCAGACTACGCAATCCTGTCTAACACCACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGCGTACGTGGGGAAGGCTTCGTCTCA-3′) and inserted into the BsiWI site that was introduced into TRPV5 by mutagenesis (forward, 5′-CAGTGCCTGCAAGGACGTACGATGGGGGCCTGTCCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGACAGGCCCCCATCGTACGTCCTTGCAGGCACTG-3′). All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation–HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP-TRPV5 and HA-TM-TRPV5 were lysed in sucrose buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 135 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (w/v) sucrose, incubated on ice for 60 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (clone 6E2, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, or clone 12CA5, Sigma) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-HA (Sigma) and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (provided by J. Fransen, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Cell Culture and Transfections–HeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Stably transfected HeLa cells with inducible dynamin K44A expression (generously provided by Dr. S. Schmid, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla CA) were cultured as described (19Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), and dynamin was induced by culturing in the absence of tetracycline for 48 h. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with pCB6-HA-TRPV5 as described previously (20Den Dekker E. Schoeber J. Topala C.N. van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen) following the manufacturers' instructions. TRPV5 was expressed in Xenopus laevis as described previously (18Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For transient knock-down experiments HEK293 cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes and transfected the same day with annealed clathrin heavy chain siRNA duplexes (Ambion, 5′-CCUGCGGUCUGGAGUCAACtt-3′ and 5′-GUUGACUCCAGACCGCAGGtt) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). This transfection was repeated the next day. One day after the second transfection cells were seeded onto coverslips or poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm plates. siRNA transfections in HeLa cells were performed similarly, but the second transfection was performed with both a plasmid encoding HA-TM-TRPV5-IRES-GFP and clathrin siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were processed for further analyses 48 h after the second transfection. All experiments were performed in parallel with non-targeting control siRNA duplexes obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL) instead of the clathrin siRNA. Fluorescence Microscopy–Cells were grown on coverslips and incubated in internalization medium (10 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. To track TRPV5 internalization in pulse-chase experiments, cells were first incubated for 1 h at 4 °Cin internalization medium with mouse (1:100) or rabbit (1:200) anti-HA antibodies. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and subsequently chased for various times in internalization medium at 37 °C, fixed, and internalized anti-HA visualized with Texas Red- or Alexa 594-coupled secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a LSM510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). TRPV5-expressing cells were identified by GFP expression due to the bicistronic vector used. Anti-clathrin heavy chain antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies directed against TfR (H68.4) and Rab11a were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Cell Surface Biotinylation and Internalization Assay–HEK293 cells stably transfected with HA-tagged TRPV5 were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm dishes (7 million cells/plate). After 1–2 days proteins present at the cell surface were biotinylated at 4 °C using sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (only Fig. 6A) or sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in PBS supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) for 30 min. Unreacted biotin was quenched using 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS-CM. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times in culture medium or kept at 4 °C. To measure TRPV5 internalization, biotin that remained at the cell surface was removed by incubation with fresh 100 mm 2-Mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (mesna) in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin 3 times for 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 10 min with 120 mm iodoacetic acid in PBS-CM. Finally, cells were washed with PBS-CM and PBS and then lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated overnight from the supernatant using Neutravidin-coupled beads (Pierce) and analyzed by immunoblot analyses. Pulse-Chase Assay–HEK-TRPV5 cells were first incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and methionine/cysteine (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C and then for 60 min in the same medium supplemented with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label). After 3 washing steps in chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3 g/liter methionine and 3 g/liter cysteine, 1 g/liter NaHCO3, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4), cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, washed twice using PBS-CM, and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 135 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (w/v) sucrose, incubated on ice for 60 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. TRPV5 was precipitated overnight using guinea pig anti-TRPV5 antibodies and visualized by autoradiography. Protein amounts were quantified using Image J. 45Ca2+ Uptake Assay–Radioactive Ca2+ uptake was determined using subconfluent HEK-TRPV5 cells essentially as described before (15Van de Graaf S.F.

Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Concentration Measurements–PciNeo TRPV5-IRES-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips and incubated with 3 μm Fura2-AM for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice, and allowed to equilibrate for another 10 min in HEPES-Tris buffer (132 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) Coverslips were placed in an incubation chamber mounted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 40×, 1.3 NA Plan NeoFluar objective. Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] were measured with Fura2 alternatively excited at 340 and 380 nm using a monochromator (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Fluorescence emission light was directed by a 415DCLP dichroic mirror (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) through a 510WB40 emission filter (Omega Optical Inc.). After background correction for each wavelength, the fluorescence emission ratio after excitation at 340 and 380 nm was calculated. In each experiment the value at t = 0 for non-transfected cells was set at 100%, to which all other values were related. Statistical Analysis–In all experiments the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. p values below 0.05 were considered significant. Internalization of Cell Surface TRPV5–Studies into the mechanisms underlying the regulated endocytosis of TRPV5 had been hampered by the difficulty of detecting TRPV5 at the cell surface. Various attempts to create antibodies against regions of TRPV5 that face the extracellular milieu or to create functional TRPV5 channels with epitope tags in these regions were unsuccessful (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Finally, we successfully employed a different strategy where we added an additional transmembrane domain to the amino terminus to create a topology with an extracellular facing amino terminus tagged with HA (HA-TM-TRPV5, Fig. 1A). This construct yielded a functional TRPV5 channel, as small but distinct TRPV5-specific currents were detected in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown), and significant 45Ca2+ uptake (63 ± 3% of untagged TRPV5) was measured in X. laevis oocytes ectopically expressing the channel construct. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HA-TM-fused TRPV5 is also able to form multimers with GFP-TRPV5, as expected from a channel which functions in a tetrameric configuration (18Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, TRPV2-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) could not be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-TM-TRPV5, in line with the previously described inability of TRPV2 and TRPV5 to form heteromultimers (21Hellwig N. Albrecht N. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To visualize TRPV5 internalization, we incubated live HA-TM-TRPV5-expressing HeLa cells with anti-HA antibodies at 37 °C. Fig. 2A shows that only the transfected cells accumulated significant amounts of anti-HA antibody, indicative of internalized TRPV5. No antibody uptake was observed with anti-VSV antibodies, used as isotype control antibody (data not shown). Incubation with anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C only yielded a signal at the cell surface (Fig. 2B). Subsequent warming of the cells to 37 °C resulted in almost complete internalization of the antibody already within 5 min. The internalized TRPV5 first (5–10 min) appeared in numerous small vesicles in the periphery of the cell and then was found in a number of larger vesicles. Continuous labeling resulted in the signal in larger vesicles with some small peripheral vesicles remaining. Multiple z-sections of cells of this experiment are given in supplemental Fig. 1 showing similar results in all focal planes. This system is applicable to other cell types as anti-HA uptake was also observed in HA-TM-TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells, commonly used for heterologous expression of TRPV5 (Fig. 2C) and in HA-TM-TRPV5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Internalization of Cell Surface TRPV5 Is Dependent on Clathrin and Dynamin–Anti-HA antibody uptake was employed to determine the role of dynamin in the endocytosis of TRPV5 using HeLa cells expressing the dominant negative dynamin K44A mutant in a tetracycline-inducible manner (HeLa K44A) (19Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The anti-HA signal remained at the cell surface in most of the cells when dynamin K44A expression was induced by cell culture in the absence of tetracycline, whereas HA-TM-TRPV5 internalized normally when the cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline, i.e. under non-inducing conditions (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in Tf uptake experiments, with poor Tf internalization when dynamin K44A was overexpressed but significant Tf uptake into non-induced cells (Fig. 3B). To exclude that the dynamin-dependent internalization of TRPV5 was only a consequence of the anti-HA antibody addition, we employed as another model system HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPV5 (without the additional transmembrane domain of HA-TM-TRPV5). These cells show a low expression level of the channel that could still be detected using immunoblot analysis, but the cell surface expression of TRPV5 was too low to be detected by immunocytochemistry. Therefore, to probe for endocytosis of plasma membrane-resident TRPV5, cell surface molecules were labeled with sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin, and cells were then placed at 37 °C to permit constitutive internalization of biotinylated proteins. Biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed using cell-impermeable mesna. Maximum internalization was achieved within 15–30 min (supplemental Fig. 3), although the internalization signal, i.e. mesna-resistant TRPV5, always remained significantly lower than 100% (referred to as the “no mesna” control) even at incubation times up to 2 h. To elucidate the involvement of dynamin in constitutive TRPV5 internalization analyzed by this surface biotinylation assay, we used dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin (22Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). The addition of 80 μm dynasore blocked TRPV5 uptake into a mesna-resistant structure, further confirming a role for dynamin in the endocytosis of TRPV5 (Fig. 3C). We next analyzed the contribution of clathrin-dependent mechanisms to TRPV5 uptake. First, the addition of 450 mm sucrose to the medium (added after the biotinylation) was chosen as an unspecific tool to disrupt the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis (23Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). This led to a complete block of TRPV5 uptake (Fig. 3C). To test the role of clathrin more directly, we depleted cells of clathrin heavy chain by siRNA transfection and first tested the effect on the internalization of TRPV5 by analyzing the uptake of cell surface-biotinylated channels. Although only partial depletion of clathrin was obtained in this transient approach (clathrin heavy chain expression was decreased by ∼60%), TRPV5 internalization was reduced in the clathrin siRNA-transfected cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). TfR internalization in the clathrin siRNA-transfected cells was also partially reduced. That TfR internalization is clathrin-dependent (24Hinrichsen L. Harborth J. Andrees L. Weber K. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45160-45170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) suggests the remaining internalized signal of both TRPV5 and TfR mainly originates from cells in the population showing poor or no depletion of clathrin. Therefore, we also tested the role of clathrin at the single cell level, employing the antibody internalization assay and HA-TM-TRPV5-expressing cells. To this end HeLa cells were transfected with clathrin siRNA and the next day again co-transfected with clathrin siRNA and HA-TM-TRPV5. Immunocytochemistry using anti-clathrin antibodies showed a significant reduction of clathrin heavy chain protein in 40–60% of these cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, Tf uptake (20 min, 37 °C) was clearly inhibited in cells showing the clathrin heavy chain depletion (Fig. 4E). Likewise, HA-TM-TRPV5 internalization was inhibited in the clathrin knock-down cells as revealed by the anti-HA signal remaining at the cell surface as opposed to the control cells showing HA-TM-TRPV5 internalization and accumulation of the signal in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4, F and G). Internalized TRPV5 Is Not Degraded but Targeted to a Recycling Compartment–We next addressed the fate of internalized TRPV5. To avoid effects due to unphysiologically high overexpression, we used our model characterized by a relatively low and stable expression of TRPV5. To determine the stability of surface-expressed TRPV5, biotinylated cells were placed back at 37 °C for 0 or 3 h, and the amount of biotinylated channel protein was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-TRPV5 antibodies. To test for possible targeting of internalized TRPV5 to the degradation machinery, inhibitors of the proteasomal (MG132) or lysosomal (chloroquine) degradation pathway were used. Remarkably, the amount of biotinylated TRPV5 in these cells remained constant even 3 h after the biotinylation and was not affected by 3 h of preincubation of the cell MG132 or chloroquine degradation pathway (Fig. 5A). As controls we also immunoblotted for the receptors for the epidermal growth factor or Tf (TfR), which are either degraded or recycled upon internalization, respectively. We next treated cells with brefeldin A (BFA) to block the insertion of newly synthesized channels into the plasma membrane. In the presence of BFA a slow decrease in channel activity at the cell surface is indicative of internalized channels being degraded and not recycled, as was shown for the epithelial Na+ channel (25Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In contrast, TRPV5 activity, as measured by ruthenium red-sensitive 45Ca2+ uptake, was not affected by prolonged incubation with BFA even up to 4h (Fig. 5B). Based on these results, we postulated that TRPV5 enters a recycling compartment after internalization. To test this hypothesis, we performed colocalization studies of internalized HA-TM-TRPV5 with Rab11 or CD63, markers of a recycling or degradative compartment, respectively. Early after internalization, when HA-TM-TRPV5 localized to numerous small peripheral vesicles, little colocalization was observed between Rab11 and internalized anti-HA (Fig. 5C). However, after incubation of the HA-TM-TRPV5-expressing cells with anti-HA antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h, a significant co-localization of internalized TRPV5 with endogenous Rab11 was observed. Co-localization was most prominent in larger perinuclear structures and less in the small peripheral TRPV5-positive punctae (Fig. 5D). In contrast, no obvious co-localization with CD63 was observed, even after prolonged incubation with anti-HA antibodies, again suggesting a limited targeting of the channel to late endosomes and then to the degradative lysosomal pathway (Fig. 5E). The stability of (internalized) TRPV5 was also determined on a longer time scale by pulse-chase analysis. Immediately after metabolic labeling using [35S]methionine/cysteine (0 h), the TRPV5 signal was detected in SDS-PAGE mainly at ∼75 kDa, most likely reflecting the core-glycosylated state of the channel. A minor background signal at ∼70 kDa was also visible that was already seen in the non-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). After 1 h, most of the signal had shifted into the high molecular mass TRPV5 band, which runs at 85–100 kDa (Fig. 6, A and B). This shift in molecular weight likely reflects processing of the glycosylation moiety of TRPV5 in the Golgi compartment. Analysis of the total TRPV5 and only the upper, fully glycosylated-TRPV5 band revealed that TRPV5 was stable for 8 h but showed a large reduction in the signal at 16 h (Fig. 6, B and C). In comparison to the fully glycosylated form, it seems that the core-glycosylated TRPV5 disappears slightly more rapidly. Recycling of Internalized TRPV5 Is Ca2+-dependent–Using the Ca2+-dye Fura2, we demonstrated that expression of TRPV5 in HEK293 cells resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in the resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Fig. 7C). This difference was due to TRPV5-mediated Ca2+ influx as [Ca2+]i decreased to control levels when extracellular Ca2+ was omitted, and EDTA was added (Fig. 7C). Subsequently, we tested whether the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration affects the endocytic trafficking of TRPV5. However, [Ca2+]i was not significantly altered when we lowered the extracellular [Ca2+] to values as low as 10 μm (not shown). Further reduction of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration using 2 mm EGTA resulted in massive cell detachment during the mesna-based internalization assay. Therefore, we tested whether lowering the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration using the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA would affect the endocytic trafficking of TRPV5. The addition of BAPTA (-AM) to cells has been performed in studies on TRPV5 function, as this treatment decreases the Ca2+-dependent channel inactivation. In vivo this Ca2+-buffering function is mediated by calbindins (26Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G.

The Na+/H+ exchanger consists of two domains, a membrane domain of ∼500 amino acids and a 315 amino acid C-terminal cytosolic domain. The membrane domain carries out ion transport and is regulated by the cytosolic domain in response to phosphorylation and several accessory proteins that bind to this domain. Phosphorylation occurs within the last 178 amino acids (4Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Haematol. Disord. 2005; 5: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Clinical trials are attempting to develop NHE1 inhibitors for treatment of various forms of heart disease (11Avkiran M. Marber M.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), though serious concerns have been raised about the isoform specificity of the inhibitors in some clinical trials (12Mentzer Jr., R.M. Circulation. 2003; 108 (abstract): 2723Google Scholar). This suggests that an improved knowledge of NHE1 structure might be desirable in the design of improved inhibitors. The lack of a natural source of NHE1 protein required the development of an overproduction system to begin structural studies. Though we have had some success in high level expression and structural analysis of isolated transmembrane segments of the mammalian NHE1 protein (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this has remained a difficult undertaking and Escherichia coli seems resistant to expression of larger transmembrane fragments of eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers (14Dibrov P. Young P.G. Fliegel L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 125-132Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The successful use of other microbial expressions systems include x-ray crystallographic structures of a rat brain voltage-dependent potassium channel overproduced in Pichia pastoris (15Long S.B.

Thines D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms have been previously expressed in S. cerevisiae, though only in relatively small amounts with NHE1 expressed either as a functionally inactive or mistargeted protein (19Flegelova H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Sychrova H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Flegelova H. Sychrova H.

These results suggested that S. cerevisiae might be a suitable host for large scale NHE1 overexpression. Herein we describe the expression and characterization of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger in this microbial system, following an approach similar to that used for overproduction of an anion exchanger (AE1 or Band 3) in S. cerevisiae (22Sekler I. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21028-21034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results show that this system can be used to produce milligram quantities of human NHE1 (hNHE1), where the protein is easily purified from membranes, is fully functional in reconstituted vesicles, and is suitable for structural studies. Single particle electron microscopy of the detergent-solubilized, purified hNHE1 protein reveals a compact dimer at 22-Å resolution. These data provide the first structural insight into hNHE1 and its oligomeric state. Materials–Biochemicals were from Sigma unless specified otherwise. TaqDNA polymerase was purchased from Invitrogen. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Products for culture of S. cerevisiae were purchased from DIFCO Media Products. Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), calmodulin-agarose resin, Sephadex G-50, and Superdex 200 HR 10/30 were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). The detergents octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8), n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM), and Fos-choline (FC) 10, 12, and 14 were purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and egg-yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bio-Beads (SM-2) were from Bio-Rad. HisProbe-HRP was from Pierce, anti-NHE1 monoclonal antibody was from Chemicon Int. Inc. (Temecula, CA). The S. cerevisiae W303.1b strain (a, leu2, his3, trp1, ura3, ade2–1, canr, cir+) and the expression plasmid pYeDP60 were generously supplied by Denis Pompon (CGM, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction–The cDNA of hNHE1 was obtained from the pYN4+ plasmid containing the entire coding region (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was initially performed using amplification with PWO DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Sciences) followed by use of the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Mutations were designed to create a new restriction enzyme site for use in screening transformants. The mutant plasmid pYN4-N75D was created with the primers GAGCCGCCCTGTcgAcCATTCCGTCACTG, CAGTGACGGAATGgTcgACAGGGCGGCTC to remove the nonessential glycosylation site at amino acid Asn75. Prior to cloning into the yeast expression plasmid pYeDP60, the unique BglII restriction site present in the coding sequence of hNHE1 in pYN4-N75D was also removed by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 5′-CGCACCCCCTTCGAAATCTCCCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGAGGGAGATTTCGAAGGGGGTGCG-3′. The hNHE1-N75D gene was then amplified by PCR using TaqDNA polymerase with the appropriate primers 5′-GGATAGATCT-ATGGTTCTGCGGTCTGGCATCTGTGGCCTC-3′ (forward), and 5′-CCATGGTACCTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGACCACCCTGCCCCTTGGGGAAGAACGGTTCTC-3′ (reverse), incorporating BglII and KpnI restriction sites respectively (italic) and a C-terminal “Gly2His10” tag (underlined) followed by a stop codon (bold). This amplified fragment was inserted in-frame into the plasmid pYeDP60 after cleavage of the BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. Restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing verified the construct. The resultant construct was under control of the inducible GAL10-CYC1 hybrid promoter and the phosphoglycerate kinase terminator. Yeast Transformation, Expression, and Culture–The yeast strain W303.1b was transformed using a high efficiency lithium acetate procedure (23Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) and selected on glucose minimal medium. For large scale expression, yeast cells were inoculated into selective medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, supplemented with 40 mg/liter Trp) and grown overnight at 30 °C. A 1:50 dilution was made into YPDE-2 medium (2% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 2% bactopeptone, 2.7% ethanol) and cells were grown at 28 °C with shaking until an A600 of 8.0 was obtained (∼24–36 h). The expression of recombinant hNHE1 was induced by addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) for 12–14 h. After induction, cells were harvested yielding ∼25 g wet cells per liter of culture. Preparation of Membrane Fractions–Membrane fractions were prepared immediately from fresh culture (Fig. 1A). All manipulations of membrane fractions and purified protein were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. After 12–14 h induction, cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in cold water and centrifuged again. The pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg pepstatin) at a concentration of 0.6 g wet cells/ml. Cells were disrupted using a microfluidizer (Emulsiflex C3, Avestin Inc.) with 7 passes at 20,000 psi. The crude extract (CE) was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 15 min to give a supernatant (S2.5) and pellet (P2.5). The P2.5 pellet was suspended in an identical volume of lysis buffer and centrifuged again at 2,500 × g for 15 min to give a pellet (P) corresponding to cell debris and a supernatant (S′2.5). The S2.5 supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet (P12) was combined with the S′2.5 supernatant and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min (P2). The resultant S12 and S′12 supernatants were pooled (S2) and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. The final high speed pellet (P3) contained the membrane fractions enriched in hNHE1. The membrane fractions were resuspended in storage buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 20% glycerol) at a protein concentration of ∼15 mg/ml. The yield of membranes was about 300 mg of total protein per liter of culture. Membrane fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Solubilization and Purification of hNHE1–Prior to solubilization and hNHE1 purification, membrane fractions were stripped of peripheral membrane proteins by treating with high ionic strength solution. This step was essential for enhanced purity of the final protein. Membrane fractions (12 mg/ml) were rapidly thawed to 4 °C and diluted 6 times in cold stripping buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12% glycerol, 0.7 m KCl). The suspension was then centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 60 min in a Ti45 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in storage buffer at ∼4 mg/ml. Initial solubilization of the stripped membranes used the detergents LPC, DDM, C12E8 and Fos-choline (FC-10, FC-12, and FC-14) at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and detergent/protein ratios of 1:1 to 5:1. Solubilization was carried out for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The amount of hNHE1 solubilized was estimated from aliquots withdrawn before and after centrifugation by Western blot analysis and detection with HisProbe-HRP. For large scale preparative solubilization of hNHE1, 1 volume of stripped membranes (4 mg/ml) was added to an equal volume of 1.2% FC-14 (w/v) or 1.2% LPC (w/v) in solubilization buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The suspension was incubated for 30 min with constant, gentle stirring. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min. For purification of hNHE1, the supernatant from detergent solubilization was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a Ni-NTA-agarose resin equilibrated in Ni-NTA binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% detergent). The column was washed at 0.5 ml/min first with 4 column volumes of Ni-NTA wash buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.05% detergent), and then with four volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. hNHE1 was then eluted with 250 mm imidazole in Ni-NTA wash buffer with a flow rate at 0.2 ml/min. This purification procedure could be carried out using the detergents LPC, FC-14, or DDM. The hNHE1 resulting from this purification procedure was used for all structure and function described herein, with the exception of the circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies. For CD spectroscopy, the eluted protein was further purified using a calmodulin-Sepharose resin. To reduce the imidazole concentration, the Ni-NTA eluate was dialyzed overnight against binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.05% FC-14). The dialyzed suspension was loaded onto a 1 ml calmodulin Sepharose column equilibrated with binding buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 3 column volumes of binding buffer, the protein was eluted with 2 volumes of elution buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.05% FC-14) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Biophysical and Biochemical Characterization of hNHE1–Size exclusion chromatography was used to examine the hydrodynamic volume of hNHE1. Samples of purified hNHE1 were run on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column in 25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% FC-14. The column was calibrated by measuring the elution volumes of proteins of known apparent molecular mass: thyroglobulin 679,000 (void volume); myosin, 200,000; bovine serum albumin, 66,000; carbonic anhydrase, 29,000; cytochrome c, 12,400. Reconstitution of NHE1 into proteoliposomes followed established protocols (24Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.34 mg of egg yolk PC was dried to a thin film under nitrogen gas, and lyophilized. Dried lipids were mixed with reconstitution buffer (20 mm BTP-MES pH 7.5, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, supplemented with the fluorescent pH indicator 2.5 mm pyranine), 20 μl of 20% n-octyl-d-glucoside and 10 μg of purified hNHE1 to a final volume of 220 μl. The solubilized protein/lipid/detergent mixture was applied to a 2-ml Sephadex G-50 column that was preloaded with reconstitution buffer containing pyranine. The column eluate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 mg of wet SM-2 Bio-Beads to remove excess detergent. The sample was again applied to a 2-ml Sephadex G-50 column that was equilibrated with reconstitution buffer without pyranine. The resultant proteoliposomes containing hNHE1 were monitored for Na+/H+ exchanger activity via pyranine fluorescence using a PTI Deltascan spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 463 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Proteoliposomes containing hNHE1 (100 μl) and control liposomes (100 μl) were incubated at 25 °C, followed by dilution into a 2-ml reaction cuvette containing ammonium-free reconstitution buffer (20 mm BTP-MES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) to generate a pH gradient. NaCl was added to initiate Na+/H+ exchange, which was monitored by the increase in pyranine fluorescence. The relative hNHE1 activities were measured by regression fitting of a 20 s linear region of the fluorescence intensity curves. For instance, the fluorescence curve in Fig. 4A was fit from 40 to 60 s yielding a change in fluorescence intensity of 7400 per second (set to 100% relative hNHE1 activity). For CD spectroscopy, purified hNHE1 protein was exchanged into phosphate buffer (20 mm phosphate pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Fos-14) by overnight dialysis. CD was performed at 20 °C on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) (25Gebreselassie D. Rajarathnam K. Fliegel L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm in quartz cells (path length of 0.05 cm) as the average of 8 scans at 0.1 nm intervals. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (0.85 μm), and the CD spectrum obtained in millidegrees was converted to molar ellipticity and analyzed using CDPro (26Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, protein samples were heated at 65 °C for 3 min and were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (27Rieder C.V. Fliegel L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H273-H283Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, SDS-PAGE gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detection of recombinant hNHE1 was with His-Probe-HRP using the Supersignal West HisProbe Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, a monoclonal anti-NHE1 antibody was used as the primary antibody as described earlier (27Rieder C.V. Fliegel L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H273-H283Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) was used as a secondary antibody. X-ray films were digitized with an Epson (Toronto, ON) Perfection 3200 densitometer and bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Protein concentrations were determined for yeast membrane preparations using a Lowry assay and for purified protein using an Amido Black assay (28Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Single Particle Electron Microscopy–Purified hNHE1 was diluted with 1% trehalose, 3% ammonium molybdate (pH 7.0) from an initial concentration of 0.2 mg/ml to a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. Immediately following dilution, five microliters were pipetted onto a glow-discharged, carbon-coated grid for 30 s. The grid was washed with one drop of 2% uranyl acetate, and then allowed to sit on a drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The excess stain was blotted with filter paper, and the grid was allowed to air dry. Data were collected on a Tecnai F20 (FEI Company) located in the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at the University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada). The microscope was operated at 200 keV and images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film under low-dose conditions at a magnification of 50,000× with a defocus ranging from -2.0 μm to -2.5 μm. Micrographs were digitized with a Nikon Super Coolscan 9000 with a scanning resolution of 6.35 μm/pixel, followed by pixel averaging to achieve a final resolution of 5.08 Å/pixel. Image processing and reconstruction were carried out using both EMAN (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) and SPIDER (31Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) software packages. Using EMAN′s boxer, 7,930 particles were selected semi-automatically from 24 micrographs with a box size of 50 × 50 pixels. The boxed images were corrected for the CTF using ctfit (EMAN). Reference-free classification into 135 groups proceeded using startnrclasses (EMAN) and AP CA (SPIDER). The class averages generated by EMAN and SPIDER were combined into a common set of 44 groups using classesbymra (EMAN). A set of Euler angles was then assigned to these class averages (startAny command in EMAN; OP command in SPIDER), and initial three-dimensional models were built using common lines in Fourier space. These models were low pass filtered to 20 Å resolution, aligned and averaged (align3d and avg3d commands in EMAN). The average was taken as a preliminary model for 5 iterations of refinement in EMAN and SPIDER. A resolution of 22 Å of the final reconstruction was determined by calculating the Fourier shell correlation between two independent half datasets (eotest command in EMAN; 0.5 FSC criterion). Comparison of the final reconstruction with the predicted molecular mass for recombinant hNHE1 (92 kDa) indicated that the structure represented an hNHE1 dimer. 2-Fold symmetry was apparent and was applied to the final reconstruction (align3dsym and proc3d commands in EMAN). Expression of Human NHE1 in S. cerevisiae and Preparation of Membrane Fractions–To obtain suitable amounts of functional protein for structural studies we expressed hNHE1 (amino acids 1–815) in a heterologous expression system (the yeast S. cerevisiae). The N-linked glycosylation of hNHE1 occurs at Asn75 and O-linked glycosylation occurs within the first extracellular loop (32Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As glycosylation represents a potential obstacle to crystallization, we generated a mutant in which the N-linked glycosylation site was abolished (N75D). It has previously been shown that N-linked glycosylation of hNHE1 is not required for either cation exchange activity or biosynthesis of the protein (32Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Haworth R.S. Frohlich O. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to this mutation, a dodecapeptide Gly2His10 was introduced at the C terminus of hNHE1 to facilitate protein purification. Thus, a His-tagged hNHE1 N75D gene was inserted into the expression vector pYeDP60 (34Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a galactose inducible promoter. This expression system has previously been shown to be suitable for the heterologous expression of rabbit SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase (18Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thines D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase (35Jahn T. Dietrich J. Andersen B. Leidvik B. Otter C. Briving C. Kuhlbrandt W. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A differential centrifugation procedure was used to prepare membrane fractions that were enriched in hNHE1 (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Western blot analysis of the fractionated membranes illustrated the profile of hNHE1 yield in the various fractions (Fig. 1B). The expressed recombinant hNHE1 migrated on SDS-PAGE slightly lower than the 100-kDa standard, which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 92 kDa for the unglycosylated protein. The P3 light membranes (corresponding to endoplasmic reticulum and secretion vesicles) contained most of the hNHE1 protein, while the heavy P2 membranes (plasma membranes and mitochondria) contained much less hNHE1. From 1L of yeast culture, 20 ml of P3 membrane fraction were obtained at a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. We used the P3 membrane fraction for all subsequent solubilization and purification steps.TABLE 1Summary of the purification of hNHE1 expressed in S. cerevisiaeFractionaValues are reported for 1 liter of cell cultureTotal proteinhNHE1hNHE1/proteinYield-Fold purificationmgmg%%CE2200S21400P3 (Mb)3000.90.31001KCl-stripped membranes1300.80.6882Ni-NTA purified0.30.27023233a Values are reported for 1 liter of cell culture Open table in a new tab High Ionic Strength Stripping and Solubilization of hNHE1–Prior to solubilization we tested the effect of high KCl treatment to remove peripheral membrane proteins and to enrich the membrane fractions for the hNHE1 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2038740825,"Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin belongs to the family of binary AB type toxins that are structurally organized into distinct enzyme (A, C2I) and binding (B, C2II) components. The proteolytically activated 60-kDa C2II binding component is essential for C2I transport into target cells. It oligomerizes into heptamers and forms channels in lipid bilayer membranes. The C2II channel is cation-selective and can be blocked by chloroquine and related compounds.

In the present study, C2II mutants created by substitution of different negatively charged amino acids by alanine-scanning mutagenesis were analyzed in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. The results suggested that most of the C2II mutants formed SDS-resistant oligomers (heptamers) similar to wild type. The mutated negatively charged amino acids did not influence channel properties with the exception of Glu399 and Asp426, which are probably localized in the vestibule near the channel entrance. These mutants show a dramatic decrease in their affinity for binding of chloroquine and its analogues. Similarly, F428A, which represents the Φ-clamp in anthrax protective antigen, was mutated in C2II in several other amino acids. The C2II mutants F428A, F428D, F428Y, and F428W not only showed altered chloroquine binding but also had drastically changed single channel properties. The results suggest that amino acids Glu399, Asp426, and Phe428 have a major impact on the function of C2II as a binding protein for C2I delivery into target cells.

The C2 toxin consists of two distinct components: component A, which is the enzymatically active subunit C2I, and component B (C2II), which is involved in the transport of the enzymatic component into the cytosol across the target cell membrane. There C2I exerts its catalytic activity (1Considine R.V. Simpson L.L. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 913-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Aktories K. Wille M. Just I. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Biochem. 1989; 179: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Through the action of C2I, the actin cytoskeleton breaks down, leading to cell rounding and cell death (19Reuner K.H. Presek P.

Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 237-245PubMed Google Scholar). C2II (∼80 kDa), the B subunit, needs to be cleaved by trypsin to obtain its biological activity (21Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cleavage generates a ∼60-kDa fragment, which forms a ring-shaped heptamer (22Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W.

The binding of the C2II heptamer depends on presence of asparagine-linked carbohydrates on the surface of target cells (23Eckhardt M. Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. J. Biol.

The complex is endocytosed into the cell. Acidification of the endosome triggers C2I translocation into the cytosol (22Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R.

The addition of activated C2II to artificial lipid bilayer membranes results in the formation of ion-permeable channels that are formed by C2II heptamers (22Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J.

Evidence has been presented that the protective antigen (PA) 2The abbreviations used are: PAprotective antigenMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidpSpicosiemens. of anthrax toxin homologous to C2II provides such a pathway to carry the anthrax enzymatic components (EF, LF) into the cytosol of the target cells (30Zhang S.

J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The C2II channel is cation-selective and voltage-gated (28Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C2II heptamer inserts oriented in the membrane when added to one side of the membrane (29Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gilbert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolones are able to block reconstituted C2II channels in vivo and in vitro (29Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gilbert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The half-saturation constant, KS, of the binding of chloroquine is in the micromolar range (32Bachmeyer C. Orlik F. Barth H. Aktories K. Benz R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of intoxication as well as inhibition of channel function with 4-aminoquinolones is not well understood. protective antigen 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid picosiemens. The C2II heptamer is not known in its membrane-spanning structure; this applies to PA too. However, in the case of the PA, a water-soluble precursor (prepore) has been crystallized (33Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), which was also used to model the C2II prepore (34Schleberger C. Hochmann H. Barth H. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using the structure of the PA prepore and sequence comparisons mentioned above, we identified negatively charged amino acids as putative candidates involved in C2II channel function. Some of these amino acids are presumably located in the vestibule of the channel. Furthermore, residue Phe427 of PA (also known as Φ-clamp) plays a crucial role for translocation of EF or LF into the cytosol and also influences binding of quinacrine (35Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). C2II also has a phenylalanine in a relevant position (Phe428). To check its role in the interaction of C2II with 4-aminoquinolones, Phe428 was mutated to several amino acids with different or similar properties (F428A, F428D, F428Y, and F428W). Here, we show that residues Glu399, Asp426, and Phe428, but not Glu272, Glu280, Asp341, or Glu346, are important for binding of 4-aminoquinolones, which block the C2II channels. Mutation of these residues leads to altered channel properties, such as single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and inhibitor binding, including its ionic strength dependence. Asp426 is also important for assembly of the channel, membrane insertion, and/or channel function. Materials–Diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All salts were analytical grade (Merck). Ultrapure water was obtained by passing deionized water through Milli-Q equipment (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was bought from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma. The pGEX-2T vector was included in the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system from Amersham Biosciences. PCRs were performed with a Mastercycler gradient from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Pfu-polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). All mutated plasmids were controlled by DNA sequencing (SeqLab, Göttingen, Germany). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture medium and all salts were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Thrombin, chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine, trypsin, and trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of C2II Mutants–Several C2II mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table 1 for a list of primers). The plasmid pGEX-2T-C2II was used as a template (36Blöcker D. Barth H. Maier E. Benz R. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutated plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and the constructs were checked by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyMutationOligonucleotideE272ACTATAGTTGGAGTCCAAATGGCAAGATTAGTTGTTTCE280CGTTGTTTCTAAATCATGCACAATTACTGGAGATTCAACTAAGD341ACAAAATACAAGTACAGTTGCTGATACAACTGGAGAAAGD342CCAAAATACAAGTACAGTTGATTGCACAACTGGAGAAAGTTTCE346AGTTGATGATACAACTGGAGCAAGTTTCTCTCAAGGE399ACACTATTAAGGGACAAGCAAGCTTAATTGGGGACD426AGGCTTTAAATACTATGGCTCAATTTAGCAGTCGCTTAATCCCF428ACTATGGATCAAGCTAGCAGTCGCTTAATCCCF428DCTATGGATCAAGATAGCAGTCGCTTAATCCCF428YCTATGGATCAATATAGCAGTCGCTTAATCCCF428WCTATGGATCAATGGAGCAGTCGCTTAATCCC Open table in a new tab C2II and its mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 harboring the separate DNA fragments in plasmid pGEX-2T. Proteins were purified as described previously (36Blöcker D. Barth H. Maier E. Benz R. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) or incubated with thrombin (3.25 National Institutes of Health units/ml of bead suspension) for cleavage of the fusion proteins from glutathione S-transferase. Thereafter, the suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. C2II proteins were activated with 0.2 μg of trypsin/μgof protein for 30 min at 37 °C. Lipid Bilayer Experiments–Black lipid bilayer experiments were performed as described previously (37Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The experimental setup consisted of a Teflon chamber divided into two compartments by a thin wall and connected by a small circular hole with a surface area of about 0.3–0.5 mm2. The aqueous solutions on both sides of the membrane were buffered with 10 mm MES-KOH to pH 6. Membranes were formed by spreading a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine dissolved in n-decane across the hole. After the membranes turned black, activated C2II or activated C2II mutants were added to one side of the membrane, the cis side. The potentials applied to the membranes throughout the study always refer to those applied to the cis side, the side of the addition of C2II and its mutants. Electrical measurements were performed using Ag/AgCl electrodes (with salt bridges) connected in series to a voltage source and a homemade current amplifier made with a Burr Brown operational amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 7633) and recorded on a strip chart recorder (Rikadenki, Freiburg, Germany). Zero-current membrane potential measurements were performed by establishing salt gradients across membranes containing 100–1000 channels as has been described earlier (38Benz R. Janko K. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Titration Experiments with Chloroquine and Related Compounds–Chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolones block the channels formed by the binding component C2II of C2 toxin (29Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gilbert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Bachmeyer C. Orlik F. Barth H. Aktories K. Benz R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate the binding properties of chloroquine and its analogues, titration experiments were carried out similar to those used previously to study the binding of carbohydrates to the LamB channel of E. coli or binding of chloroquine to C2II and PA63 channels (32Bachmeyer C. Orlik F. Barth H. Aktories K. Benz R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 12-29Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Orlik F. Schiffler B. Benz R. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1715-1724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). C2II and mutants were added to black lipid bilayer membranes at concentrations of about 50 ng/ml. About 30 min after the addition of the pore-forming proteins, the rate of their reconstitution in the membranes became very low. At that time, concentrated solutions of chloroquine, primaquine, or quinacrine were added to one or both sides while stirring to allow equilibration. This resulted in the blockage of the C2II channels. The data of the channel block were analyzed in a similar way as performed previously (39Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 12-29Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The conductance, G(c), of a C2II channel in the presence of chloroquine or related compounds with the stability constant, K, and the ligand concentration, c, is given by the maximum conductance (without ligand), Gmax, times the probability that the binding site is free. G(c)=Gmax(1+K·c)(Eq. 1) Equation 1 may also be written as follows, (Gmax-G(c))Gmax=K·c1+K·c(Eq. 2) which means that the conductance as a function of the ligand concentration can be analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots. K is the stability constant for chloroquine, primaquine, or quinacrine binding to the C2II channel. The half-saturation constant, KS, of its binding is given by the inverse stability constant KS = K–1. Generation of C2II Mutants–The C2II channel is cation-selective and is able to bind chloroquine and related compounds in the micromolar concentration range. Binding of chloroquine and its analogues is dependent on ionic strength and leads to blockage of the C2II channels (28Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gilbert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This means presumably that ion-ion interactions are involved in binding of the positively charged chloroquine to negatively charged amino acids at the channel mouth or within the channel interior. To localize the binding site of chloroquine, which is presumably the same as for C2I, sequence comparisons of binding components C2II, PA, iota b, and VIP1 (Ac, B. thuringiensis; Aa, B. cereus) of the binary toxins C2, anthrax, iota, and the vegetative insecticidal proteins, respectively, were performed. The sequences of these binding components are significantly homologous, but they differ in binding affinity for chloroquine and related compounds (12Leuber M. Orlik F. Schiffler B. Sickmann A. Benz R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gilbert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Orlik F. Schiffler B. Benz R. Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6143-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Chloroquine binds to the PA channel with much higher affinity than to C2II, but it has a low affinity for binding to iota b and does not bind to VIP1. To restrict the number of putative amino acids that could be responsible for ion-ion interactions, only some of the many negatively charged residues within the C2II sequence were chosen (see Fig. 1A) and subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The selected amino acids were different in several binding components and localized within the vicinity of the channel forming domain of C2II (amino acids 264–490 of the mature protein) (36Blöcker D. Barth H. Maier E. Benz R. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that is homologous to the corresponding domain of PA (amino acids 259–487 of the mature protein) (33Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). We choose the amino acids Glu272, Glu280, Glu341, Glu346, Glu399, and Asp426. A recent publication demonstrated the important role of Phe427 (the so-called Φ-clamp) in PA for LFN transport (35Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Phe427 in PA corresponds to Phe428 in C2II. Mutants of Phe428 were also constructed: F428A, F428Y, F428W, and F428D. Fig. 1, B and C, shows the localization of all mutated amino acids in the soluble PA-heptamer (33Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Besides single mutations, some double and triple mutants of the different residues were also generated. All mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified as described previously (36Blöcker D. Barth H. Maier E. Benz R. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Heptamerization of the C2II Mutant Proteins–Wild type C2II is able to form SDS-stable oligomers (heptamers) (22Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To check if heptamerization is influenced by the mutations, the majority of the mutant proteins were activated by trypsin and subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE without heating (Fig. 2). Wild type C2II was also run on SDS-PAGE after heating (lane 1). It showed a similar aggregation tendency as shown previously (22Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). C2II wild type and most of the mutants formed SDS-stable oligomers. However, the single mutant E399A, the double mutants E399A/D426A and E399A/F428A (data not shown), and the triple mutant E399A/D426A/F428A (not shown) showed weaker oligomer bands, indicating a smaller stability of the oligomers. This result suggests that residue Glu399 could be involved in oligomerization of the binding component or influences the SDS stability of the heptamer. Channel Formation of the C2II Mutants in Artificial Lipid Bilayer Membranes–A cellular receptor, a hybrid, and/or complex carbohydrate structure is involved in the binding of C2II on the surface of cells (23Eckhardt M. Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2328-2334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A receptor is not required for formation of ion-permeable channels by activated C2II in black lipid bilayer membranes (28Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To check if the mutants also showed membrane activity, experiments were performed in which activated C2II mutants were added at a defined concentration (about 25 ng/ml) to one side of black lipid bilayer membranes made of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/n-decane. The subsequent increase of the membrane current at 20 mV was steep for about 20 min. Only a small further increase (as compared with the initial one) occurred after that time. The membrane conductance measured 60 min after the addition of C2II mutants was taken as a measure of the membrane activity of the proteins. Mutants E399A and D426A had a lower membrane activity than wild type C2II by a factor of about 3–5. The double mutant E399A/D426A and the triple mutant E399A/D426A/F428A showed almost no pore forming activity in the lipid bilayer assay. Proteins with the mutations E272A, E280A, E341A, E346A, and F428A (Y, W, and D) had the same high membrane activity as wild type C2II. This result suggested that pore formation is not affected by the mutations with the exception of E399A and D426A, which both considerably reduced membrane activity of the mutants. Single Channel Conductance of the C2II Mutants–To study the effect of the mutation on the C2II channel, the biophysical properties of the channels were investigated in single channel experiments. Fig. 3 shows current recordings of wild type C2II and different C2II mutants following reconstitution in lipid bilayer membranes. The recordings of both wild type and mutant proteins showed the typical step-like characteristics, which are caused by the superposition of the long-lived C2II channels (28Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Blöcker D. Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Aktories K. Barth H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5368-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each single step represents the reconstitution of a heptamer formed by C2II or by a C2II mutant in the diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes. Some of the mutants had the same single channel conductance as wild type C2II (see Table 2). For others, it differed considerably from wild type C2II (40 pS) and varied from 5 to 140 pS in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MES, pH 6 (20 mV applied voltage). The changes appeared to be dependent on size, property, and position of the amino acid introduced in exchange for the genuine one. This finding suggested that some of the selected amino acids (in particular Glu399, Asp426, and Phe428) are exposed to the water-filled vestibule of the channel and therefore are able to influence the biophysical properties of the C2II heptamer. The single channel distributions of most mutants were fairly homogeneous, suggesting well defined channels. This was not the case for the D426A mutants, where a wide conductance range was observed. Fig. 4 shows histograms of conductance fluctuations observed with mutant D426A and wild type C2II. The conductance of mutant D426A showed considerable variations, indicating that amino acid Asp426 is important for channel stability and size.TABLE 2Average single-channel conductance, G, of channels formed by C2II wild type and different C2II mutants in two different KCI solutionsC2II mutantG0.15 m KCl1.0 m KClpSWild type40130E272A35100E280C45100D341A35NMD342C40100E346A30125D341A/E346A25100E399A13 ± 280 ± 11D426A20 ± 8100 ± 28F428A140 ± 18500F428D110 ± 22600F428Y60210F428W5 ± 1NME399A/D426A14 ± 2NME399A/F428A60NMD426A/F428A40370 ± 44E399A/D426A/F428A30 ± 4330 ± 55 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Histograms of the probability of the occurrence of certain conductivity units observed with membranes formed of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/n-decane in the presence of activated C2II (A) from C. botulinum or the C2II D426A mutant (B).

Muscle contraction involves the sliding of actin filaments relative to myosin filaments (1Huxley A.F. Niedergerke R. Nature. 1954; 173: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 2Huxley H. Hanson J. Nature. 1954; 173: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), which is driven by cyclic interactions of the myosin head domains with the actin filaments, powered by hydrolysis of ATP. During each ATP-hydrolysis cycle chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis is transformed into mechanical work by a multistep power-stroke which drives the actin filaments several nanometers past the myosin filaments. The power-stroke is associated with the release of the ATP hydrolysis products, Pi (inorganic phosphate) and ADP, from the active site (3Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar).

Science. 1985; 228: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and to the transition of the myosin head domain from states of weak and non-stereospecific actin binding to states of strong and stereospecific binding to actin (5Eisenberg E.

Because of the assumed close relation between power stroke and the release of inorganic phosphate from the myosin head domain, studying the effects of inorganic phosphate on contracting muscle fibers became a main element to elucidate the relation between Pi release and force generation. Effects of Pi were examined on isometric force (4Hibberd M.G. Dantzig J.A. Trentham D.R. Goldman Y.E. Science. 1985; 228: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Ruegg J.C. Schadler M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dantzig J.A. Goldman Y.E. Millar N.C. Lacktis J. Homsher E. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1992; 451: 247-278Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As a result of these studies it was proposed that inhibition of active force by inorganic phosphate results from rebinding of Pi to the AM·ADP intermediate that is formed after Pi release (cf. Scheme 1). Thus, the release of phosphate is reversed and a strong binding force generating cross-bridges in the AM·ADP state are reversed to a weak binding non-force generating AM·ADP·Pi state (the AM·ADP·PiI state in Scheme 1) that is in rapid equilibrium with the detached M·ADP·PiI intermediate. To fully account for the observed steady state kinetic data and the force transients recorded upon release of Pi from caged Pi, it was proposed that a strong binding AM·ADP·Pi intermediate (the AM·ADP·PiII state in Scheme I) must exist in the path from non-force-generating M·ADP·PiI/AM·ADP·PiI states to the force generating the AM·ADP state (16Millar N.C.

In recent work using the Pi analog AlF4, evidence for such a strong binding intermediate in the active site has been presented (19Kraft T. Mahlmann E. Mattei T. Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13861-13866Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). myosin actin bovine serum albumin 2′(3′)-O-[[2-[[6-[2-[3-(1-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-3H-indolio]-1-oxohexyl]amino]ethyl]carbamoyl]ATP tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. myosin actin bovine serum albumin 2′(3′)-O-[[2-[[6-[2-[3-(1-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-3H-indolio]-1-oxohexyl]amino]ethyl]carbamoyl]ATP tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Some results, however, appeared unexplained by this concept. First, at low ATP concentrations an increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) to 50 mm caused a significant decrease in unloaded shortening velocity (20Pate E. Cooke R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Second, when fiber stiffness of isometrically contracting fibers was measured at different speeds of stretch, the stiffness-speed relations recorded in the presence of 5–10 mm Pi were shifted to slower stretch velocities (21Brenner B. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1994; 15: 201Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was proposed that, as previously shown in solution studies (22Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 23Tesi C. Barman T. Travers F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 585-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), inorganic phosphate may also bind to the empty nucleotide binding pocket, i.e. to the AM state in Scheme 1, thus competing with ATP for the active site by forming an AM·Pi-complex. Analogous to the effects on unloaded shortening velocity, the sliding velocity of actin filaments driven by muscle myosin in in vitro motility assays was also found slowed down by inorganic phosphate at low MgATP concentrations (25Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24339-24343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As one possible mechanism, these authors also proposed competitive inhibition of ATP-binding to the nucleotide-free myosin head by inorganic phosphate, assuming that Pi may bind to the nucleotide free active site, forming an AM·Pi complex. As an alternative mechanism, these authors proposed that inorganic phosphate, before ADP release, may bind to a secondary site on the myosin head that is not the site from which Pi is released after cleavage of ATP. The thus-formed AM·ADP·Pi′ state was thought to exert a resistive load against the remaining motion generating myosin heads until Pi and ADP are released and binding of ATP changes the myosin head back to a weak binding AM·ATP intermediate. In more recent work (26Hooft A.M. Maki E.J. Cox K.K. Baker J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), however, it was proposed that binding of Pi to the AM·ADP state, just as postulated for the suppression of isometric force by Pi, also causes reduced actin filament sliding velocity. For this to work, Hooft et al. (26Hooft A.M. Maki E.J. Cox K.K. Baker J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) proposed that a fixed resistive load, generated by cross-bridges in “motion-resisting” conformations/states, acts against the driving force generated by heads in “driving” conformations/states. Because sliding velocity at low MgATP also showed a logarithmic dependence on the concentration of Pi, as described for isometric force in fibers (14Pate E. Franks-Skiba K. Cooke R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 369-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Hooft et al. (26Hooft A.M. Maki E.J. Cox K.K. Baker J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) proposed that Pi does not affect the population of cross-bridges that generate the resistive load but that, rather, the population of driving heads is reduced when Pi is raised. Thus, it is still controversial by which mechanism inorganic phosphate inhibits gliding velocity in motility assays and unloaded shortening velocity in fibers, i.e. by binding to the AM·ADP intermediate or by binding to the nucleotide-free AM state forming an AM·Pi intermediate that inhibits gliding of actin filaments along myosin. We, therefore, addressed this question using in vitro gliding and single molecule dwell-time assays. We first reexamined the effect of inorganic phosphate on the gliding velocity of actin filaments on a myosin-coated surface (ensemble assay) to ensure that our experimental conditions reproduce previous results (25Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24339-24343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using Cy3-EDA-ATP as a fluorescently labeled substrate of myosin II (27Conibear P.B. Jeffreys D.S. Seehra C.K. Eaton R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2299-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Tokunaga M. Kitamura K. Saito K. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3048-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we then measured the dwell time of bound nucleotide and the number of fluorescent signals per field of view. This allowed us to test distinct predictions of the different mechanisms proposed for inhibition of actin filament gliding velocity by Pi. In the presence of Pi, actin filament gliding velocity was reduced at low but not at saturating MgATP concentrations, as previously described. The nucleotide dwell time, probed with Cy3-EDA-ATP, remained unchanged upon the addition of 5 mm Pi, whereas the number of Cy3 signals per field of view in the presence of 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP was reduced to 50% in the presence of 1–2 mm phosphate. These data are consistent with concepts in which actin filament gliding velocity is reduced by binding of Pi to the empty nucleotide binding pocket of myosin, thus increasing the resistive load against filament gliding when Pi is increased. Preliminary results have been presented in abstract form (30Amrute, M., and Brenner, B. (2006) Biophys. J. 90, (Suppl.) 434 (Abstr. 1313-Pos)Google Scholar). Buffer–Myosin extraction buffer contained 500 mm NaCl (Merck), 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MgATP, and 30 mm DTT, pH 7. Actin polymerization buffer was composed of 100 mm KCl (Merck) and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7. Assay buffer (AB) contained 25 mm imidazole hydrochloride, 25 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and an oxygen scavenging system of 18 μg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 3 mg/ml d-glucose (Merck), pH 7.4. For experiments in which different MgATP concentrations were used or when inorganic phosphate or AlF4 was added, the basic buffer composition was equivalent to the AB buffer, and the ionic strength was maintained at 55 mm by adjusting NaCl concentration in the AB buffer accordingly. To remove contaminant pyrophosphate (PPi), the pH of the 100 mm NaH2P04 stock solution was set to 9.0, and the stock solution was autoclaved at 120 °C for 15 min. To avoid precipitation, AlF–4-containing solutions were prepared immediately before use by the addition of Al(NO3)3 (Merck) and NaF (Fluka) in a 1:5 ratio. The pH was adjusted to 7.0. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Proteins–Fast skeletal muscle myosin was extracted from skinned fibers of rabbit psoas muscle as described previously (31Thedinga E. Karim N. Kraft T. Brenner B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 85-796Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). First, muscle fiber bundles were isolated from the psoas muscle and prepared for long time storage in liquid nitrogen (32Kraft T. Messerli M. Rothen-Rutishauser B. Perriard J.C. Wallimann T. Brenner B. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1246-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For extraction of myosin, fiber bundles were thawed in skinning solution without sucrose and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Single muscle fibers of 1–1.5 cm in length and about 100 μm in diameter were isolated (33Yu L.C. Brenner B. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 441-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For in vitro motility assays myosin was extracted from a single fiber by incubation in 5 μlof myosin extraction buffer at 1–2 °C for 30 and 10 min for dwell-time assays. To minimize content of denatured myosin, myosin was extracted from fibers isolated from freshly thawed bundles, and the extract was used within 8 h after extraction. Actin was purified from rabbit back muscle as previously described (34Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). TRITC-labeled F-actin was produced by polymerizing G-actin in the presence of TRITC-phalloidin (35Harada Y. Sakurada K. Aoki T. Thomas D.D. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Actin filaments decorated with full-length myosin molecules in the nucleotide-free rigor state were formed by adding 10 mm EDTA to a mixture of F-actin and myosin extract to chelate Mg2+ of the myosin extraction buffer (modified from Ref. 36Toyoshima Y.Y. Toyoshima C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The amount of added F-actin was adjusted to obtain an ∼20:1 molar ratio of actin monomers to myosin molecules. By this procedure myosin not bound to actin was kept to a minimum. After 30 min of incubation at 0 °C, the solution was diluted ∼150-fold with AB buffer to obtain a suitable concentration of decorated actin filaments. This final solution was then applied to the flow cell. The myosin-decorated actin filaments were firmly immobilized on the BSA-coated surface, presumably by nonspecific binding of the full-length myosin (31Thedinga E. Karim N. Kraft T. Brenner B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 85-796Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To locate decorated actin filaments in dwell-time experiments with Cy3-EDA-ATP, F-actin was polymerized in the presence of Alexa-488-phalloidin instead of TRITC-phalloidin. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy–For all experiments an objective type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope was used. This was arranged in an inverted configuration on an optical table using a 60x oil immersion objective lens with high numerical aperture (Plan Apo 60x, NA 1.45, Oil; Olympus, Japan). The beam of a green laser (diode pumped, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser, DPSS 532–50, Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) and of an air-cooled argon ion laser (Type 532-AP-AO1, Melles Griot) were used to excite TRITC-phalloidin, Cy3-labeled nucleotides, and Alexa-488-phalloidin. Emitted light was imaged by a tube lens onto the active area of the photocathode of an image intensifier (VS4–1845; Video Scope International, Sterling, VA). The image intensifier formed an intensified image on the active area of a CCD camera (ORCA-ER digital CCD camera C4742–80-12AG, Hamamatsu Photonics). For camera control and data acquisition, the Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc.) was used. Further details are provided in the supplemental material. In Vitro Gliding Assay–The in vitro gliding assay was modified from the assay previously described (37Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The gliding assay was performed in a flow cell by the following steps (31Thedinga E. Karim N. Kraft T. Brenner B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 85-796Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The glass surface of the flow cell was coated with BSA (AB buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA). This was followed by infusion of 5 μl of the myosin extraction solution. Adsorption of myosin to the surface was allowed for 30 s and stopped by infusion of 2 × 5 μl of AB buffer; subsequently, 5 μl of solution with non-fluorescently labeled F-actin was introduced to block denatured myosin followed by incubation with AB buffer containing 2 mm MgATP to allow dissociation of the unlabeled actin from native myosin heads. A subsequent double wash with 2 × 5 μl of AB buffer served to remove MgATP. Next, the flow cell was filled with a solution containing 5 nm TRITC-phalloidin-labeled F-actin and subsequently washed with 4 × 5 μl of AB buffer to remove free TRITC-phalloidin. Finally, translocation of actin filaments was started by application of AB buffer containing various concentrations of MgATP and 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Inorganic phosphate or AlF–4 was added to the AB buffer, and ionic strength was adjusted to 55 mm. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Further details are provided in the supplemental material. A Dwell-time Assay and Number of Events per Field of View–Cy3-EDA-ATP, a fluorescent ATP analog in which the ribose is labeled at the 2′ or 3′ position was used as a fluorescently labeled substrate for myosin to follow binding and dissociation of nucleotide (27Conibear P.B. Jeffreys D.S. Seehra C.K. Eaton R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2299-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Tokunaga M. Kitamura K. Saito K. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Biochem.

Trentham D.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3048-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Cy3-EDA-ATP used was a mixture of the 2′ and 3′ Cy3-EDA-ATP isoforms. For recording of dwell times of fluorescent nucleotide, flow cells were coated with AB buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Then solutions with decorated actin filaments were injected into the flow cell. After incubation for 1 min, unbound protein was washed out with AB buffer. Finally, 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP in AB buffer, including the oxygen scavenging system, was added. Fluorescent signals of Cy3-EDA-ATP were observed as the appearance of discrete spots in the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope when Cy3-EDA-ATP bound to myosin. Final concentrations of myosin and actin in the flow cell were 100 pm and 2 nm, respectively. Further details of experimental conditions and procedures to optimize selection of specific binding events of individual Cy3-EDA-ATP molecules are described in the supplemental material. Gliding velocity and dwell-time analysis was done using custom-written software based on Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc.). The analysis routines are explained in the supplemental material. Effect of Inorganic Phosphate on Actin Filament Gliding Velocity–First we examined the effect of inorganic phosphate on the velocity of actin filament gliding on a myosin-coated surface to reproduce previous data (25Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24339-24343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gliding velocity of actin filaments was measured at MgATP concentrations ranging from 30 μm to 5 mm both in the absence and presence of 5 mm phosphate. In the absence of Pi, filament gliding velocity increased with MgATP concentration and reached MgATP-independent values around 2 mm MgATP (Fig. 1). In the presence of 5 mm Pi, actin filament gliding velocity was reduced at MgATP concentrations below 200 μm. For MgATP concentrations >0.5–1 mm, effects of 5 mm Pi were no longer statistically significant. Actin Filaments Tend to Fragment in the Presence of Pi but Only at Low MgATP Concentrations–Although the inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on actin gliding velocity was fully reversible, to our surprise actin filaments in the motility assay tended to break in the presence of inorganic phosphate but only at the low MgATP concentrations (Fig. 2). Quantification of this effect (Fig. 2B) shows that 100 s after starting filament gliding by the addition of MgATP, filament length was essentially unchanged at 2 mm MgATP plus 5 mm Pi and at 30 μm ATP but without Pi. At 30 μm ATP plus 5 mm Pi, in contrast, average filament length is reduced to about 50% by progressive fragmentation of actin filaments. This observation may not be unexpected if reduction in gliding velocity by Pi at low MgATP concentrations (Fig. 1) results from an additional resistive load that acts on actin filaments on top of the resistive load present at the low MgATP concentrations without Pi. Effects of Inorganic Phosphate on Dwell-time Histograms of Fluorescent ATP–To distinguish different mechanisms for the inhibition of the actin filament gliding velocity by inorganic phosphate at low substrate concentrations, we employed single molecule detection techniques using fluorescently labeled ATP (Cy3-EDA-ATP). First, we examined the possible effects of inorganic phosphate on the life time of Cy3 signals observed when AB buffer with 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP were infused into a flow cell with myosin-decorated actin filaments immobilized on the BSA-coated assay surface. The assay is illustrated in Fig. 3A. After infusion of the Cy3-EDA-ATP, discrete spots of Cy3 fluorescence appeared and disappeared randomly within the field of view. As proposed by Oiwa et al. (29Oiwa K. Eccleston J.F. Anson M. Kikumoto M. Davis C.T. Reid G.P. Ferenczi M.A. Corrie J.E. Yamada A. Nakayama H. Trentham D.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3048-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we interpreted the appearance of discrete spots as the binding of Cy3-EDA-ATP to immobilized myosin molecules. After cleavage of Cy3-EDA-ATP by myosin II, Pi dissociates from the active site (cf. Scheme 1). This is followed by Cy3-EDA-ADP dissociation, and the spots of Cy3 fluorescence are expected to disappear with the release of Cy3-EDA-ADP. The time during which a spot of Cy3-fluorescence is visible has been termed “dwell time,” and the dwell time was assumed to correspond with the period during which the fluorescently labeled nucleotide remains bound to myosin as Cy3-EDA-ATP or Cy3-EDA-ADP (AM·ATP to AM·ADP in Scheme 1 (29Oiwa K. Eccleston J.F. Anson M. Kikumoto M. Davis C.T. Reid G.P. Ferenczi M.A. Corrie J.E. Yamada A. Nakayama H. Trentham D.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3048-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). We included only those signals of Cy3 fluorescence into our analysis that co-localized with an Alexa-488-phalloidin-labeled actin filament. In addition, data recording was limited to 3–4 min to minimize possible effects from changes in substrate and product concentrations. Fig. 3B shows an example of the intensity time course of a fluorescent spot. The maximum concentration of Cy3-EDA-ATP in the assay buffer was limited to 5 nm. At 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP it is highly unlikely that both myosin heads have Cy3-EDA-ATP or Cy3-EDA-ADP·Pi bound at the same time. Thus, simultaneous dissociation of both heads from actin is highly unlikely. As a consequence, even if a myosin head in the M·Cy3-EDA-ATP- or M·Cy3-EDA-ADP·Pi state detached from actin, it could readily reattach to the actin filament, which is kept in close proximity by the non-dissociated nucleotide-free second head of the myosin molecule. Fig. 4 shows typical dwell-time histograms of fluorescent signals observed in single assay chambers with 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP, both in the absence (Fig. 4A) and in the presence (Fig. 4B) of 5 mm inorganic phosphate. The solid lines are the best possible fits of single exponential functions. The numbers next to each histogram are time constants and errors of the fits to the individual histograms. In several assay chambers the average time constant of the dwell-time distribution for 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP alone was found to be 0.81 ± 0.21s (mean ± S.D.; n = 9 assay chambers) and 0.85 ± 0.28 s (n = 8 assay chambers) for 5 nm Cy3-EDA-ATP plus 5 mm inorganic phosphate; i.e. the dwell-time distribution in the presence of 5 mm Pi was essentially the same as for Cy3-EDA-ATP alone. A small, statistically insignificant increase in dwell time of Cy3 fluorescence, however, cannot be excluded. From the previously proposed concept for reduction in isometric force by inorganic phosphate or for the reduction in the number of driving myosin heads in the gliding assay, one may have expected a significant increase in dwell time as it was expected that after rebinding of inorganic phosphate to the AM·ADP state with formation of a weak binding AM·ADP·Pi intermediate, phosphate first has to be released again before ADP (Cy3-ADP) can finally dissociate from the active site. To test whether dwell times become more clearly extended in the presence of phosphate analogues with higher affinity for the AM·ADP state, we added 5 mm AlF4 as such a phosphate analog (38Maruta S.

https://openalex.org/W2076663459,"The nucleational core of matrix vesicles contains a complex (CPLX) of phosphatidylserine (PS), Ca(2+), and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) that is important to both normal and pathological calcification. Factors required for PS-CPLX formation and nucleational activity were studied using in vitro model systems and molecular dynamic simulations. Ca(2+) levels required for and rates of PS-CPLX formation were monitored by light scattering at 340 nm, assessing changes in amount and particle size. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to explore changes in chemical structure and composition. Washing with pH 5 buffer was used to examine the role of amorphous calcium phosphate in CPLX nucleational activity, which was assessed by incubation in synthetic cartilage lymph with varied pH values. Addition of 4 Ca(2+)/PS was minimally required to form viable complexes. During the critical first 10-min reaction period, rapid reduction in particle size signaled changes in PS-CPLX structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed increasing mineral phosphate that became progressively deprotonated to PO(4)(3-). This Ca(2+)-mediated effect was mimicked in part by increasing the Ca(2+)/PS reaction ratio. Molecular dynamic simulations provided key insight into initial interactions between Ca(2+) and P(i) and the carboxyl, amino, and phosphodiester groups of PS. Deduced interatomic distances agreed closely with previous radial distribution function x-ray-absorption fine structure measurements, except for an elongated Ca(2+)-N distance, suggesting additional changes in atomic structure during the critical 10-min ripening period. These findings clarify the process of PS-CPLX formation, reveal details of its structure, and provide insight into its role as a nucleator of crystalline calcium phosphate mineral formation."
https://openalex.org/W1998083657,"During the process of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, many membrane proteins localize to the polar septum where they participate in morphogenesis and signal transduction. The forespore membrane protein SpoIIQ plays a central role in anchoring several mother-cell membrane proteins in the septal membrane. Here, we report that SpoIIQ is also responsible for anchoring a membrane protein on the forespore side of the sporulation septum. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that SpoIIQ resides in a complex with the polytopic membrane protein SpoIIE. During the early stages of sporulation, SpoIIE participates in the switch from medial to polar division and co-localizes with FtsZ at the polar septum. We show that after cytokinesis, SpoIIE is released from the septum and transiently localizes to all membranes in the forespore compartment. Upon the initiation of engulfment, it specifically re-localizes to the septal membrane on the forespore side. Importantly, the re-localization of SpoIIE to the engulfing septum requires SpoIIQ. These results indicate that SpoIIQ is required to anchor membrane proteins on both sides of the division septum. Moreover, our data suggest that forespore membrane proteins can localize to the septal membrane by diffusion-and-capture as has been described for membrane proteins in the mother cell. Finally, our results raise the intriguing possibility that SpoIIE has an uncharacterized function at a late stage of sporulation."

The three γ subunits each contain four conserved CBS sequence repeats, named after the corresponding regions in cystathionine-β-synthase.

It is presumed ligand binding to the Bateman domains induces conformational changes within the α subunit and provides a mechanism for allosteric activation of the kinase.

However, until recently little was known about the subunit interacting regions. Studies on mammalian AMPK have focused on overexpression of truncated mutants of each subunit and assessment of their ability to form stable, functional AMPK complexes. Using this approach we previously found that the conserved β subunit C-terminal sequence β1-(186–270) was sufficient to form a stable AMP-activated heterotrimer (8Iseli T.J.

We termed this region the αγ subunit binding sequence. We also showed that the β1 C-terminal 25-residue sequence is sufficient to bind γ1, γ2, or γ3 subunits but not α. A conserved 20–25-residue sequence immediately N-terminal to the γ CBS1 domain is essential for the βγ interaction and the formation of an active trimeric complex (18Viana R. Towler M.C. Pan D.A.

A crystal structure of the regulatory fragment of mammalian (rat) AMPK, corresponding to α1-(396–548), β2-(187–272), and γ1 has recently been reported (12Xiao B. Heath R. Saiu P. Leiper F.C. Leone P.

The structure shows a direct βγ interaction mediated almost exclusively by hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions between three β-strands, two provided by the C terminus of the β subunit and the other overlapping the N-terminal region of the γ CBS1 domain. We used a baculovirus-mediated recombinant expression system for human AMPK. We present conclusive evidence for a direct interaction between His-tagged human β1-(186–270) and γ1 using size exclusion chromatography in the absence of any α subunit. With the use of an alanine mutagenesis screen we demonstrate that two critical residues (Thr-263 and Tyr-267) within the rat β1 C terminus (260–270) are especially important for the βγ association.

Preparations were then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (10/300 mm) GL column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine. AMPK was eluted at 0.5 ml/min, with the eluate monitored at 280 nm. The purity of AMPK preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. For expression of recombinant human His6-β1(186–270)γ1 complex, Sf21 cells were dually infected with His6-β1(186–270) (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 9) and γ1 baculovirus (m.o.i. of 1). Cells were harvested, washed, and lysed as described above for the heterotrimer except that 30 mm imidazole and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 were included in the lysis buffer. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap FF 5 ml column (1 ml/min) and washed with 5× column volumes of lysis buffer (excluding protease inhibitors) containing 120 mm imidazole. A purified His6-β1(186–270)γ1 complex was eluted with 500 mm imidazole. His6-β1(186–270)γ1 preparations were concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography as described above for the heterotrimer, with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 included in the equilibration buffer. 0.5-ml fractions were analyzed directly by Western blotting, with immunoreactivity being detected by Alexafluor-680 anti-rabbit 2° antibody. For expression of FLAG-TEV-CaMKKβ, Sf21 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested 72 h post-infection. Cell lysates were prepared as for recombinant AMPK, and protein was purified on FLAG monoclonal antibody-coupled affinity resin. Protein was eluted with 0.25 mg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK). Recombinant AMPK Assay–Recombinant AMPK heterotrimer (α1β1γ1) was maximally phosphorylated using recombinant CaMKKβ in phosphorylation buffer: 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm DTT, 8 mm MgCl2, and 400 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C, then diluted 1/500 in the AMPK activity assay (as described for AMPKK in Chen et al. (22Chen Z.P. Stephens T.J. Murthy S. Canny B.J. Hargreaves M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. McConell G.K. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar)). The AMPK activity was measured by the phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) containing 100 μm SAMS peptide and AMP at various concentrations as indicated in a reaction volume of 40 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots were applied to P81 papers, washed in 75 mm H3PO4, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Sedimentation Velocity–Measurements were conducted on purified recombinant human AMPK preparations (0.5 mg/ml) in a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using an AnTi rotor and double sector 12-mm path length cells containing quartz windows and charcoal-filled Epon center-pieces. In a typical experiment the reference sector was filled with 400 μl of buffer and the sample sector with 390 μl of sample. Centrifugation was carried out at 20 °C using a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm. During centrifugation, the 280 nm absorption of the sample was scanned from 5.8 to 7.3 cm at 0.003-cm increments. Scans were collected at 6-min intervals until the solution boundary had reached the cell bottom (7.22 cm). Scans 5–33 were imported into SEDFIT version 9.4 (23Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) and analyzed in terms of a continuous size-and-shape distribution (c(s,f/f0)) (24Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To obtain a model-independent estimate of the molar mass (i.e. buoyant molar mass), the density of the buffer solution was set to 0 g/ml. During the analysis the sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)) was calculated from 0.1 to 10.5 s using an S-grid increment of 0.25 s. Likewise, the frictional ratio distribution (c(f/f0)) was calculated from 1.00 to 4.50 using an S-grid increment of 0.25. Data were fitted using maximum entropy regularization. The overall p value used for the regularization was 0.95, and the same amount of regularization was applied to the s- and f/f0 directions. In addition, the radial position of the sample meniscus was optimized for best fit, and the data were corrected for both time-invariant and radial-invariant noise. Data were plotted using Sigmaplot Version 10 (SPSS). Quadrupole-time of Flight Mass Spectrometry–Analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6510 quadrupole-time of flight liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1100 LC system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). All data were acquired, and reference mass was corrected via a dual-spray electrospray ionization source. Each scan or data point on the total ion chromatogram is an average of 10,000 transients, producing a scan every second. Spectra were created by averaging the scans across each peak. The mass spectrometer conditions were as follows: ionization mode, electrospray ionization, positive mode; drying gas flow, 7 liter/min; nebulizer, 30 p.s.i.; drying gas temp, 345 °C; Vcap, 4500 V; fragmentor, 250 V; skimmer, 65 V; octapole radio frequency voltage, 750 V; scan range acquired, 100–2000 m/z. Reversed phase chromatographic separation was carried out using a 5-μm Zorbax Poroshell SB300-C8 (2.1 × 75 mm) column using a gradient of 20% to 60% B (95% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid) for 100 min at 0.25 ml/min. Mammalian Cell Culture, Transfection, and Lysis–COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10-cm plates of COS-7 cells at 70% confluence were dually transfected with 1 μg of each DNA construct in FuGENE 6. Combinations of the different rat subunit expression plasmids were used as indicated. Approximately 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in 500 μl per plate of HT lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm Pefabloc (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride)). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant is referred to as the whole cell lysate. Glutathione-Sepharose Precipitation–COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with GST-rat β1 fusion constructs together with pMT2.HA-rat α1. To monitor subunit expression levels, ∼4% of the whole cell lysate was analyzed directly by Western blotting. To assess subunit binding the remaining cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing in lysis buffer (2 × 50 volumes) and phosphate-buffered saline (1 × 50 volumes), the glutathione-Sepharose-bound AMPK was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G using chemiluminescence. Sf21-derived AMPK Possesses Similar Specific Activity and AMP Dependence to Native AMPK–Recombinant human AMPK (α1β1γ1) was expressed in Sf21 cells and isolated using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” The heterotrimeric complex eluted from an S200 gel filtration column at an elution volume of 11.75 ml, corresponding to a molecular mass of 207 kDa compared with molecular mass standards. Final yields of the purified heterotrimer from this source were modest, typically 0.5 mg/liter of culture. Densitometry analysis after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining indicated that recombinant AMPK preparations were ∼95% pure (Fig. 1a). Western blotting using primary antibodies specific to phosphopeptides within the heterotrimer indicated that many of the phosphorylation sites already identified in mammalian and rodent studies, such as α1-Thr-172, α1-Ser-485, β1-Ser-108, and β1-Ser-182 are also phosphorylated in Sf21 cells (data not shown). Maximal phosphorylation on α1-Thr-172 was seen after treatment with CaMKKβ for 30 min (Fig. 1b), resulting in a 140-fold increase in activity as assessed by SAMS peptide assay. AMPK activity could be further stimulated by the addition of AMP up to ≈80 μm to a maximum of 4.4-fold compared with levels without added AMP (Fig. 1b). This is comparable with the 2–3-fold stimulation by AMP previously seen in α1β1γ1 isolated from mammalian COS-7 cells (25Adams J. Chen Z.P. Van Denderen B.J. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Witters L.A.

KA0.5 for the recombinant AMPK was 7.6 ± 1.1 μm, comparable with values reported for COS-7 cell and rat liver AMPK preparations (10 and 15 μm, respectively). Maximum specific activity of fully phosphorylated recombinant AMPK was 6.2 μmol·min-1.mg-1 protein, comparable with values reported for rat liver AMPK (8–25 μmol·min-1.mg-1 protein (26Michell B.J.

Solution Properties of Sf21-derived Recombinant AMPK–Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out to determine the oligomeric state of recombinant human AMPK in solution. The open circles in Fig. 2a, upper panel, represent radial 280-nm absorbance scans of a 0.5 mg/ml AMPK solution taken at regular intervals during centrifugation at 50,000 rpm. The data are characteristically sigmoidal and exhibit a well defined solvent plateau, solution boundary, and solution plateau. The smooth lines in Fig. 2a, upper panel, represent the best fit of the experimental data to a continuous size-and-shape distribution model (23Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). The high quality of the fit is demonstrated by the randomness of the residuals (Fig. 2a, lower panel). The relative abundances of the sedimenting species recovered from the analysis (c(s, f/f0)) are plotted as a function of both sedimentation coefficient (s) and frictional ratio (f/f0) in Fig. 2b. It is evident that the sample sedimented essentially as a single species with a modal sedimentation coefficient of 5.8 s and a modal frictional ratio of 2.15. Based on these values, the protein has a buoyant (reduced) molar mass of 32.3 kDa, consistent with a value of 33.9 kDa predicted for the α1β1γ1 heterotrimer. Given a 1.0038 g/ml buffer density and calculated partial specific volumes of 0.734, 0.732, and 0.747 ml/g for the subunits (α1, β1, γ1 respectively), the heterotrimer has a physical molar mass of 124.4 kDa, which is comparable with 130.6 kDa predicted from the combined amino acid sequences of the α1, β1, and γ1 subunits. Similarly purified AMPK preparations were subjected to electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry after separation of the subunits on a reversed phase column (Fig. 3a). Figs. 3, b–d, shows that each subunit possessed the expected molecular mass: α1(2–550) plus residual Gly-Gly-Ser from TEV protease recognition site: theoretical mass 62,877.7 Da, recorded mass 62,878.7 Da; β1(2–270), theoretical mass 30,251.1 Da, recorded ma"
https://openalex.org/W2082773981,"There are three distinct members of the myosin V family in vertebrates, and each isoform is involved in different membrane trafficking pathways. Both myosin Va and Vb have demonstrated that they are high duty ratio motors that are consistent with the processive nature of these motors. Here we report that the ATPase cycle mechanism of the single-headed construct of myosin Vc is quite different from those of other vertebrate myosin V isoforms. K(ATPase) of the actin-activated ATPase was 62 microm, which is much higher than that of myosin Va ( approximately 1 mum). The rate of ADP release from actomyosin Vc was 12.7 s(-1), which was 2 times greater than the entire ATPase cycle rate, 6.5 s(-1). P(i) burst size was 0.31, indicating that the equilibrium of the ATP hydrolysis step is shifted to the prehydrolysis form. Our kinetic model, based on all kinetic data we determined in this study, suggests that myosin Vc spends the majority of the ATPase cycle time in the weak actin binding state in contrast to myosin Va and Vb. Consistently, the two-headed myosin Vc construct did not show processive movement in total internal reflection fluorescence microscope analysis, demonstrating that myosin Vc is a nonprocessive motor. Our findings suggest that myosin Vc fulfills its function as a cargo transporter by different mechanisms from other myosin V isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2055070363,"Erythromycin and tylosin are 14- and 16-membered lactone ring macrolides, respectively. The current work shows by means of kinetic and chemical footprinting analysis that both antibiotics bind to <i>Escherichia coli</i> ribosomes in a two-step process. The first step established rapidly, involves a low-affinity binding site placed at the entrance of the exit tunnel in the large ribosomal subunit, where macrolides bind primarily through their hydrophobic portions. Subsequently, slow conformational changes mediated by the antibiotic hydrophilic portion push the drugs deeper into the tunnel, in a high-affinity site. Compared with erythromycin, tylosin shifts to the high-affinity site more rapidly, due to the interaction of the mycinose sugar of the drug with the loop of H35 in domain II of 23 S rRNA. Consistently, mutations of nucleosides U2609 and U754 implicated in the high-affinity site reduce the shift of tylosin to this site and destabilize, respectively, the final drug-ribosome complex. The weak interaction between tylosin and the ribosome is Mg<sup>2+</sup> independent, unlike the tight binding. In contrast, both interactions between erythromycin and the ribosome are reduced by increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Polyamines attenuate erythromycin affinity for the ribosome at both sequential steps of binding. In contrast, polyamines facilitate the initial binding of tylosin, but exert a detrimental, more pronounced, effect on the drug accommodation at its final position. Our results emphasize the role of the particular interactions that side chains of tylosin and erythromycin establish with 23 S rRNA, which govern the exact binding process of each drug and its response to the ionic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2094723475,"The X-linked mouse Rhox gene cluster contains more than 30 homeobox genes that are candidates to regulate multiple steps in male and female gametogenesis. The founding member of the Rhox gene cluster, Rhox5, is an androgen-dependent gene expressed in Sertoli cells that promotes the survival and differentiation of the adjacent male germ cells. Here, we report the first identification and characterization of a Rhox5-regulated gene. This gene, Unc5c, encodes a pro-apoptotic receptor with tumor suppressor activity that we found is negatively regulated by Rhox5 in the testis in vivo. Transfection analyses in cell lines of different origin indicated that Rhox5-dependent down-regulation of Unc5c requires another Sertoli cell-specific cofactor. Examination of other mouse Rhox family members revealed that mouse RHOX2 and RHOX3 also have the ability to down-regulate Unc5c expression. The human RHOX protein PEPP2 (RHOXF2) also had this ability, indicating that Unc5c repression is a conserved RHOX-dependent response. Deletion analysis identified a Rhox5-responsive element in the Unc5c 5'-untranslated region. Although 5'-untranslated regions typically house post-transcriptional elements, several lines of evidence indicated that Rhox5 down-regulates Unc5c at the transcriptional level. The repression of Unc5c expression by Rhox5 may, in part, mediate the pro-survival function of Rhox5 in the testis, as we found that Unc5c mutant mice have decreased germ cell apoptosis in the testis. Along with our other data, these findings led us to propose a model in which Rhox5 is a negative regulator upstream of Unc5c in a Sertoli-cell pathway that promotes germ-cell survival."

Lowering oxygen tension induces the formation of intracytoplasmic membrane housing the photosynthetic complexes of R. sphaeroides. Light captured by B800–850 and B875 LH complexes is transferred to reaction center complex, where the redox reactions are initiated to convert light energy into ATP and reducing power. The oxygen-regulated expression of apoproteins of LH and reaction center complexes, which are encoded by puc, puf, and puh operons, was elucidated (for reviews see Refs. 6Mackenzie C. Eraso J.M.

Consistently, COR was found to generate superoxide radical from its reaction at low O2. Suppressor mutations affected the reduction level of BchZ heme, where superoxide radical is generated.

A 1.1-kb PstI-EcoRV DNA extending from 1,004 bp upstream from the initiation codon of bchC to its 28th codon was transcriptionally fused to lacZ (23Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) on IncQ plasmid (24Lee J.K. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1146-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pCZ1004. The resulting plasmid was mobilized from Escherichia coli S17-1 into R. sphaeroides by conjugation as described previously (25Davis J. Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 320-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the β-galactosidase activity (Miller units) was determined as described previously (26Tai T.N. Havelka W.A. Kaplan S. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Construction of sodB Mutant SodB1–The StuI site (Fig. 1) of sodB within a 714-bp PstI-XhoI DNA was interrupted with a 2.0-kb transcription and translation stop Ω (Sm/Sp-resistant (Smr/Spr)) DNA (27Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned into a suicide plasmid pLO1 (Km-resistant (Kmr)) (28Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pDCS100. It was mobilized into R. sphaeroides, and the single crossover exconjugant (Kmr) was isolated and subjected to segregation to double crossover (mutant SodB1: Kms and Smr/Spr) on LB agar plate containing Sm, Sp, and sucrose (15%). Construction of bchZ Mutant–The BamHI site of bchZ within a 3.9-kb BalI-PstI DNA spanning bchXYZ was interrupted with a 2.2-kb Ω (Kmr) DNA, and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned into a suicide plasmid pSUP202 (Tc-resistant (Tcr) (29Simon R. O'Connell M. Labes M. Puhler A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 640-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)) to generate pSUPZ100. It was mobilized into wild type to obtain bchZ mutant (Kmr and Tcs) on Sis minimal agar plate containing Km. Construction of bchZ-sodB Mutant–sodB of bchZ mutant was disrupted. The 2.7-kb DNA of sodB::Ω (Smr/Spr) from pDCS100 was cloned into pSUP202 to generate pSUPB100. It was mobilized into bchZ mutant (Kmr) to obtain bchZ-sodB mutant (Kmr, Smr/Spr, and Tcs) on LB agar plate containing Km, Sm, and Sp. Construction of bchZ-bchF Mutant–A 520-bp DNA upstream from the 24th residue of BchF was PCR-amplified with forward primer (5′-CTGCAGGAAGTGAGAGACGG-3′; the PstI site is in boldface and the mutated sequence is underlined unless noted otherwise) and reverse primer (5′-GCGCGTGATATCGCGTCG-3′; EcoRV site is in boldface). PCR product was cloned into T-vector, followed by digestion with PstI and EcoRV. Likewise, a 455-bp DNA downstream from the 132nd residue of BchF was amplified with forward primer (5′-GATATCGCGGCCTATGCGACC-3′; EcoRV site is in boldface) and reverse primer (5′-GTCGACGTCGAGCTTGATGAC-3′; SalI site is in boldface). PCR product was cloned into T-vector, followed by digestion with EcoRV and SalI. The PstI-EcoRV upstream DNA and EcoRV-SalI downstream DNA were cloned into PstI-SalI sites of a suicide plasmid pLO-tp (Tpr), to yield pLOtp-ΔbchF, in which a 324-bp DNA between 24th and 132nd residues of BchF was deleted. The plasmid was mobilized into bchZ mutant (Kmr) to obtain bchZ-bchF mutant (Kmr and Tps) on Sis minimal agar plate containing sucrose (15%). Construction of bchCXYZ Mutant–A 1,080-bp PstI-EcoRV DNA upstream from the 29th residue of BchC and a 955-bp StuI-PstI DNA downstream from the 73rd residue of BchZ were cloned into a PstI site of pLO1 to generate pLO-ΔbchCXYZ, in which a 3,671-bp DNA from BchC to BchZ was deleted. pLO-ΔbchCXYZ was mobilized into wild type to obtain bchCXYZ mutant (Kms) on Sis minimal agar plate containing sucrose (15%). The genomic structures of mutants were confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis (30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Purification with His Tag–A 308-bp insert DNA, including R. sphaeroides rrnB promoter (31Dryden S.C. Kaplan S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was cloned into pRK415 to yield pRKrrnB. Then a 142-bp XbaI-BamHI DNA encompassing a coding region of His6 tag of pRSET-C (Invitrogen) was cloned at the immediate downstream of R. sphaeroides rrnB promoter to generate pRKrrnB-His. The DNAs of bchX, bchY, and bchZ were PCR-amplified from plasmid pSKXYZ, a recombinant pBluescript SK(–) having a 4.2-kb BalI-HincII insert DNA spanning bchXYZ. Forward primers 5′-CACCGGATCCCGGATGCA-3′ (BamHI site is in boldface), 5′-GGCAGGAGGATCCGCCAGACC-3′ (BamHI site is in boldface), and 5′-GATCTAGATCTCGTGCAG-3′ (BglII site is in boldface) contain BamHI/BglII sites that were changed from the initiation codons of bchX, bchY, and bchZ, respectively. Reverse primers 5′-CGCGCGAAGCTTTCGAGA-3′, 5′-TGTCATAAGCTTGCACGA-3′, and 5′-CGGAAGCTTCGCTCATTG-3′ for the amplification of bchX, bchY, and bchZ, respectively, contain HindIII site (in boldface). PCR fragments were digested with BamHI (or BglII) and HindIII and cloned into BamHI-HindIII site of pRKrrnB-His to yield prrnB-hX, prrnB-hY, and prrnB-hZ (for His6-tagged proteins of BchX, BchY, and BchZ, respectively). Plasmids prrnB-hZS74L, prrnB-hZV90E, and prrnB-hZC310Y (for His6-tagged BchZS74L, BchZV90E, and BchhZC310Y, respectively) were also constructed in the same way as prrnB-hZ. The recombinant plasmids were mobilized into bchCXYZ mutant, and the exconjugants were grown until culture turbidity reached ∼100 Klett units under anaerobic dark conditions (with Me2SO). Air tight-capped centrifuge bottles were filled with cultured cells in an anaerobic chamber (model 10, COY, Grass Lake, MI) containing 5% H2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2. They were removed for centrifugation and returned to the chamber before being opened. All the following procedures for the purification of proteins were performed in an anaerobic chamber. Cells were broken by sonication, followed by purification of His6-tagged proteins by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column chromatography. If necessary, His6 of the expressed proteins was cleaved off with enterokinase (New England Biolabs). Purification with Strep Tag II–The DNAs of bchX and bchYZ were PCR-amplified from plasmid pSKXYZ. Forward primers Fx1 (5′-GAG GGC GAGCTC ATG ACG GAT GC-3′; SacI site is in boldface) and Fy1 (5′-GGC AGG TAC CAT GAG CCA GAC-3′; KpnI site is in boldface) contain SacI and KpnI sites that were changed from the initiation codons of bchX and bchY, respectively. Reverse primers Rx1 (5′-TGG CAG CCC ATG GCC TC-3′) and Rz1 (5′-GGA CCG GCG TGT TGA CG-3′) correspond to the sites downstream from bchX and bchZ, respectively. Primer sets Fx1-Rx1 and Fy1-Rz1 were used to amplify bchX and bchYZ, respectively. bchX DNA was digested with SacI and NcoI, whereas bchYZ DNA was digested with KpnI and HincII (NcoI and HincII are the sites between the amplified genes and reverse primers), and cloned into pASK-IBA7plus (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) to direct them between XbaI and HindIII. The resulting XbaI-HindIII DNAs were cloned into XbaI-HindIII sites of pRKrrnB to generate prrnB-sX and prrnB-sYZ (for Strep-tagged BchX and Strep-tagged BchY co-expressed with BchZ, respectively). Plasmids prrnB-sYZS74L, prrnB-sYZV90E, and prrnB-sYZC310Y (for Strep-tagged BchY co-expressed with BchZS74L, BchZV90E, and BchhZC310Y, respectively) were also constructed in the same way as prrnB-sYZ. Strep-tagged proteins were purified in anaerobic chamber by affinity chromatography on Strep-Tactin-Sepharose columns (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) after the expression of recombinant plasmids in bchCXYZ mutant. bchZ-bchF mutant was cultured in Sis minimal medium under anaerobic dark conditions (with Me2SO) until culture turbidity reached ∼100 Klett units. The pigment in culture supernatant was extracted and dried as described previously (15Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The dried pigment was dissolved in Me2SO and used as a substrate for COR. The concentration of Chlide a was determined after dissolution of the dried pigment in 80% acetone based on the extinction coefficient of 77.1 mm–1 cm–1 as described previously (15Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An equimolar (8.0 nm for each subunit) mixture of BchX and co-purified BchY-BchZ was put in a 10-ml glass vial containing 2-ml reaction mixture (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 300 μm NADH, 5 mm MgCl2, and an ATP-generating system (2 mm Mg2+-ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase)). It was tightly sealed with rubber cap and flushed with N2 for 10 min, followed by incubation at 30 °C in the dark for 30 min to reconstitute the enzyme. Alternatively, an equimolar (8.0 nm) mixture of BchX, BchY, and BchZ was put in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing sodium cholate (2 mm) and incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 30 min to reconstitute the enzyme. After removal of detergent by dialysis against the same buffer for 1–2 h, the enzyme was mixed in reaction mixture, and reaction in glass vial was initiated by adding Chlide a (1–2 μm in Me2SO). An aliquot (200 μl) of assay mixture was taken out after reaction in the dark and mixed with 800 μl of acetone to stop the reaction. The pigment was extracted with hexane as described (15Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and analyzed for absorption spectrum from 550 to 800 nm with UV 2550-PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The reaction product 3-vinyl bacteriochlorophyllide a was determined based on the extinction coefficient 44.7 mm–1cm–1 of its Qy peak (15Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). BchXYZ complex (80 nm) or each subunit (80 nm) was put in 2 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer and sparged at 20 ml/min with a gas mixture of 20% O2 and 80% N2 (DO, 230 ± 8 μm) or the mixture of 2% O2 and 98% N2 (DO, 42 ± 6 μm). An aliquot (8.0 nm) of BchXYZ complex was taken out intermittently and measured for enzyme activity, whereas an aliquot of a subunit was taken out and mixed in equimolar ratio with the other two subunits, which had not been exposed to O2, to reconstitute BchXYZ in the presence of cholate prior to enzyme reaction. The proteins sparged with N2 (20 ml/min) were included as positive controls. Stability was expressed as percentage of activity by the enzyme that had not been exposed to O2. The experiments were repeated three times, yielding similar results; data shown are the representatives of triplicate experiments. EPR Measurement–EPR was measured on a Bruker model EMX spectrometer. COR reaction was performed under the gas phase of 2% O2 and 98% N2 (DO, 29 ± 3 μm) in the presence of 150 mm DMPO (Sigma). Desferoxamine (100 μm) was included to chelate iron impurities. After COR reaction at 30 °C in the dark for 10 min, the mixture was placed in quartz EPR flat cell, and the spectrum was recorded at ambient temperature. The EPR-settings were as follows: modulation amplitude 0.32 G, time constant 0.16 s, scan time 60 s, modulation frequency 100 kHz, microwave power 20 milliwatts, and microwave frequency 9.76 GHz (32Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A standard superoxide-generating mixture of xanthine (100 μm) and xanthine oxidase (0.004 units) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer (33Dikalov S. Skatchkov M. Bassenge E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) under the gas phase of 20% O2 and 80% N2 (DO, 205 ± 11 μm) was included as a positive control. Cyt c Reduction Assay–COR reaction was performed with 20 μm Cyt c under the gas phase of 2% O2 and 98% N2, and aliquots (200 μl) were taken out intermittently to measure the reduced Cyt c (550 nm) in a 1-ml anaerobic cuvette based on the net extinction coefficient (reduced-oxidized) of 21.0 mm–1 cm–1 as described previously (34Massey V.

Superoxide production was examined from the difference in the rates of Cyt c reduction in the absence and presence of E. coli MnSOD (10 units). Protein was digested with trypsin and chemotrypsin, heat-denatured to coagulate undigested protein, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant of cofactor extract as described previously (36Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 865-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the cofactor extract was examined to determine the presence of flavin. A Shimadzu 10AVP series HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini C-18 reversed-phase column was used to distinguish FMN from FAD as described previously (37Latimer M.T. Painter M.H. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24023-24028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FMN was also distinguished from FAD by measuring the ratio of fluorescence at pH 2.6 over pH 7.7 (emission at 535 nm; excitation at 450 nm) with a spectrofluorometer (Quanta master QM-4/2005, PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) as described previously (38Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The concentration of free FMN was calculated with molar extinction coefficient of 12.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 450 nm (39Kimmich N. Das A. Sevrioukova I. Meharenna Y. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L. J. Biol.

Proteins for heme staining were prepared in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS and 10% glycerol and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Heme staining was done after low temperature (4 °C) SDS-PAGE as described previously (40Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7570-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Heme binding to BchZ was assayed by absorption spectrophotometry following equilibrium dialysis. One-ml solution of BchZapo or BchZmapo (10 μm), which had been refolded in the absence of heme, was dialyzed at 4 °C for 12 h against 1.0 liter of 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing the varying amounts of hemin. Unbound heme was removed by dialysis against the same buffer under the same conditions. The heme content of BchZ was measured in an anaerobic cuvette based on 20.9 ± 0.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 558 nm (α-band) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer, which was experimentally determined from the extinction coefficient of 34.4 mm–1 cm–1 for hemin in pyridine hemochrome (42Fuhrhop J.H. Smith K.M. Smith K.M. Laboratory Methods in Porphyrin and Metalloporphyrin Research. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1975: 804-807Google Scholar). BchZ in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol was denatured under anaerobic conditions at 4 °C in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl. Renaturation was carried out under the same conditions through stepwise dialysis (3 h per step) against the same buffer containing decreasing concentrations of GdnHCl. The renaturation of polypeptide was followed by scanning the emitted fluorescence between 300 and 400 nm after excitation at 280 nm (43Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fraction unfolded (FU) was calculated by an equation of FU = (Y – YN)/(YU – YN), where Y is the observed fluorescence emission at 354 nm, and YN and YU are the fluorescence emission at 354 nm for the native and fully unfolded conformations, respectively (44Caldinelli L.

Metal contents of purified BchX, BchY, and BchZ were measured with an ICP mass spectrometer (Elan 6100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and ICP atomic emission spectrometer (138 Ultrace, Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). The contents of Sulfide (S2–) and sulfane sulfur (S0) in each protein were analyzed as described previously (45Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). EPR measurements to determine iron-sulfur clusters of purified proteins were performed on an X-band ESR spectrometer (JES-PX2300, JEOL, Japan) equipped with a liquid helium flow cryostat (ESR900A, Oxford, UK). The EPR settings were as follows: modulation amplitude 0.5 millitesla, time constant 0.03 s, modulation frequency 100 kHz, microwave power 2.0 milliwatt, and microwave frequency 9.05 GHz. R. sphaeroides sodB Mutant Grew in LB Medium but Failed to Grow in Sis Minimal Medium–We were never successful in obtaining sodB mutant of R. sphaeroides on Sis minimal agar plate even under anaerobic dark (with Me2SO) and photoheterotrophic conditions. The sodB mutant SodB1 (Fig. 1A), however, was obtained on LB agar plate with a frequency (number of double-crossover colonies per CFU of the wild-type cells spread on the medium) comparable with that routinely observed for the disruption of other genes such as pucB and pufB (data not shown). The growth of SodB1 in Sis minimal medium was restored with sodB in trans. SodB1 was cultured and maintained in LB unless stated otherwise. CuZn-SOD expression was not changed by the lack of Fe-SOD (Fig. 1B). SodB1 grew slowly under aerobic and photoheterotrophic conditions to show doubling times of 5 and 4 h, respectively, compared with 3-h doubling of wild-type cells. The amount of LH complexes of SodB1, however, was not different from that of wild-type cells (Table 1).TABLE 1Specific Bchl a contents of spectral complexes of SodB1, BsupA, and wild type grown in LB under anaerobic dark (with Me2SO) and photoheterotrophic conditions, calculated as nanomoles of Bchl a specific to spectral complexes per mg of membrane proteinStrainAnaerobic dark (with Me2SO)PhotoheterotrophicaValues are 10 watts/m2.B800-850B875"
https://openalex.org/W1980879865,"Neurotrophic factors promote motoneuron (MN) survival through increased intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) and regulation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway by calmodulin (CaM). Activation of the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway is one of the well established mechanisms involved in MN survival. The Ca(2+)/CaM complex interacts with and modulates the functionality of a large number of proteins, including serine/threonine protein kinases such as Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs). Using a primary culture of embryonic chicken spinal cord MNs, we investigated the role of CaMKIV in mediating this process. We cloned chicken CaMKIV and demonstrated its expression in purified MNs by means of reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Using RNA interference, we show that endogenous CaMKIV mediates cell survival induced by neurotrophic factors or membrane depolarization. The survival effect is independent of CaMKIV kinase activity; however, CaMKIV functionality depends on the presence of Ca(2+)/CaM. Finally, CaMKIV associates to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, suggesting a role in regulating PI 3-kinase/PKB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077249542,"In addition to the well characterized phosphoinositide second messengers derived from the plasma membrane, increasing evidence supports the existence of a nuclear phosphoinositide signaling network. The aim of this investigation was to dissect the role played by nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in cell cycle progression and to determine the cell cycle regulatory component(s) that are involved. A number of cytosolic/nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2-deficient Swiss 3T3 cell lines were established, and their G0/G1/S cell cycle phase transitions induced by defined mitogens were examined. Our results demonstrate that nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 down-regulation caused a delay in phorbol ester-induced S phase entry and that this was at least in part channeled through cyclin A2 at the transcriptional level. In summary, these data identify cyclin A2 as a downstream effector of the nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 signaling network and highlight the importance of nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the regulation of mammalian mitogenesis.

Among the various PI species, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is particularly important because it is the precursor molecule of diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3).

In addition, many of the PtdIns(4,5)P2-metabolizing enzymes such as phospholipase C (PLC), type II PI kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), DAG kinases, and PDK-1 have also been shown to exist in nuclei (5Cocco L.

In Swiss 3T3 cells, stimulation with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) causes a decrease in nuclear PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 accompanied by an increase in nuclear DAG (6Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These data contrasted with those obtained when cells are stimulated with the neuropeptide bombesin, which results in similar PI changes in the plasma membrane while the nuclear PI pool was unaffected (6Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate the distinct regulation of cytosolic and nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2. More recently, the synchrony between cell cycle progression and nuclear PI turnover has been demonstrated (8York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7847-7850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fact that nuclei isolated from Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with IGF-I exhibit a decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 accompanied by an increase in DAG strongly suggests the involvement of PLC activity (6Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was later shown that nuclear PLCβ1 activity is up-regulated 2-fold in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with IGF-I (11Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and down-regulation of PLCβ-1 markedly reduces the sensitivity of Swiss 3T3 cells to IGF-I (12Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2137-2139PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I induces the phosphorylation of PLCβ1, and this phosphorylation can be blocked by MAPK cascade inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126, which target MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)) (13Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Bareggi R. Tabellini G. Rizzoli R. Ghibellini M.D. Narducci P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In support of this observation, Xu et al. (9Xu A. Suh P.G. Marmy-Conus N. Pearson R.B. Seok O.Y. Cocco L. Gilmour R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that PLCβ1 can be phosphorylated/activated by ERK both in vitro and in vivo in its regulatory domain. PLCδ, PLCγ, and PLCζ have also been found in the nucleus of various cell types. Although the different PLC family members share the same enzymatic function, given that these PLCs have distinct regulatory mechanisms and that they translocate to the nucleus at different cell cycle phases (14Okada M. Ishimoto T. Naito Y. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4949-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Neri L.M. Ricci D. Carini C. Marchisio M. Capitani S. Bertagnolo V. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that cells utilize specific PLC isoforms according to specific signaling cues (1Ho K.K. Mann D.J. Signal Transduction. 2006; 6: 92-100Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Collectively, the evidence accumulated over the past decade has firmly established the link between nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 signaling and cell cycle control, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. The aim of this study was to determine cell cycle regulatory component(s) that are under the influence of nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2. As a model system, a number of recombinant Swiss 3T3 cell lines with down-regulated cytosolic/nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 were engineered via cell compartment-specific (nuclear versus cytosolic) expression of SKIP, a PtdIns(4,5)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-specific phosphatase (16Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Fukami K. Funaki M. Asano T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Schmid A.C. Wise H.M. Mitchell C.A. Nussbaum R. Woscholski R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the major precursor molecule for the synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (18Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), SKIP-mediated down-regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 will concurrently limit the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Unlike PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is a housekeeping PI species and present in both resting and stimulated cells, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generation is tightly coupled with the activation of PI 3-kinase and is rapidly hydrolyzed by PI phosphatases such as PTEN and SHIP1/2 (19Backers K. Blero D. Paternotte N. Zhang J. Erneux C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Chen L. Janetopoulos C. Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 9: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Hence, in this study, any phenotypical changes observed in the recombinant cell lines are interpreted as being channeled through PtdIns(4,5)P2 down-regulation. In addition, to dissociate the cytosolic and nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated signaling pathways more systematically, defined mitogens such as bombesin and phorbol esters were utilized to induce G0/G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Here, we report that both cytosolic and nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 down-regulation resulted in a delay in S phase entry; however, this inhibitory effect was achieved via different routes. Our results show that in cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2-deficient cells, the delay in bombesin-induced S phase entry was channeled through cyclin D1, whereas in nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2-deficient cells, the delay in phorbol ester-induced S phase entry was channeled through cyclin A2. Reagents, Antibodies, and Cells—The antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: anti-cyclin D1 (72-13G), anti-p27 (C-19G), anti-Cdk2 (C-163), anti-Cdk4 (C-22), anti-Cdk6 (C-21), anti-p70S6K (C-18), and anti-Erk-1 (C-16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-α-tubulin (TAT-1), anti-cyclin A (E23.1), and anti-cyclin D3 (DCS28) (Cancer Research UK); anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473; 587F11) (Cell Signaling Biotechnology); and anti-pRb (G3-245) (Pharmingen). Swiss 3T3 cells were employed for all experiments. SKIP-expressing cells were constructed by infection of Swiss 3T3 cells with appropriate recombinant retroviruses and isolated by puromycin selection (for details of constructs, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Determination of SKIP Phosphatase Activity by Phosphate Release Assay—PtdIns(4,5)P2 was dissolved in 1% octyl glucoside at 400 μm. To form PtdIns(4,5)P2 micelles that the phosphatase could utilize, the lipid suspension was bath-sonicated (Ultrawave Ltd.) for 10 min. The reaction was carried out with 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4 mm magnesium chloride, and 30 ng of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SKIP in a 30-min incubation at 37 °C; terminated by addition of 100 μl of malachite dye (6 mm malachite green, 3.6 n HCl, and 17 mm ammonium molybdate); and allowed to develop for 30 min prior measuring the absorbance at 625 nm. Swiss 3T3 Fibroblast Stimulation—For experimental purposes, 5 × 105 cells were plated on 9-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% newborn calf serum (NCS). Cells were allowed to quiesce over the following 7-9 days. Dishes of confluent and quiescent cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing various supplements at the following concentrations: NCS (10%), insulin (1 μg/ml), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB; 100 nm), and bombesin (100 nm). Measurement of S Phase Entry by 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation into Cellular DNA—Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded on 35-mm dishes containing 10-mm coverslips. When cells were confluent and quiescent, they were stimulated and supplemented with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). 32 h later, cells on coverslips were fixed and stained for BrdUrd as described previously (25Jarviluoma A. Child E.S. Sarek G. Sirimongkolkasem P. Peters G. Ojala P.M. Mann D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cyclin A2 mRNA Transcript Level by Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). 1 μg of RNA was treated with DNase (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared by using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) for reverse transcription-PCR. Detection of ribosomal L19 and target gene expression was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using the relative standard curve method. L19 was used to normalize for variances in input cDNA. All measurements were performed in duplicate. The sequences of the primers used for cyclin A2 were 5′-GCAGTTTTGAATCACCACATGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTGCCTCTTCATGTAACC-3′, and those used for L19 were 5′-GGAAAAAGAAGGTCTGGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-TGATCTGCTGACGGGAGTTG-3′. PtdIns(4,5)P2 Detection Using Recombinant GST-tagged PLCδ1 Pleckstrin Homology (PH) Domain—Adherent cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, followed by quenching with 50 mm NH4Cl/PBS for 15 min. Next, a permeabilization/blocking step was performed with either 0.25% Triton-X100 (nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 staining) or 120 μg/ml digitonin (cytoplasmic PtdIns(4,5)P2 staining) in 3% fatty acid-free BSA/PBS for 30 min. 100 ng/ml GST-PLCδ1 PH domain in 3% fatty acid-free BSA/PBS was then applied to the cells and incubated for 30 min. (For the competition experiment, the GST-PLCδ1 PH domain/BSA/PBS solution was preincubated with 100 ng of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Sigma) for 30 min.) After the incubation, coverslips were washed (3 × 10 min) with PBS with gentle rocking and then incubated for 60 min with anti-GST antibody (Novagen) in 3% fatty acid-free BSA/PBS (1:10,000 dilution), followed by PBS washes as before. Cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in 3% fatty acid-free BSA/PBS (1:100 dilution) for 60 min. Residual antibody was washed away with PBS, followed by washing once with sterile distilled water before mounting with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were acquired using a Nikon TE2000 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera. Images were analyzed using IPLab software. DAPI was visualized at 460 nm after excitation at 350 nm, TRITC at 572 nm after excitation at 547 nm, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at 508 nm after excitation at 490 nm. All immunofluorescent images shown were acquired with the same sensitivity/exposure settings. Cyclin A2 Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and treated with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min at room temperature to block nonspecific interactions prior to addition of the primary antibody. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody, anti-cyclin A2 (1:200; Abcam), for 2 h at room temperature; washed; and incubated with the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 555-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3000; Molecular Probes), for 45 min at room temperature. Following all fixation, permeabilization, and antibody incubations, cells were washed (3 × 5 min) with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol containing DAPI. Images were captured using an AxioCam camera on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. For quantitation of the immunofluorescence, 150-200 cells in random fields of view across the entire coverslip of each cell line were scored for the presence of cyclin A2 in the nucleus. For the SKIP-expressing cell lines, only GFP-positive cells were scored for the presence of cyclin A2 in the nucleus. All immunofluorescent images shown were acquired with the same exposure settings. G0/G1/S Phase Transition of the Cell Cycle in Response to Bombesin/PDB—We first examined the mitogenic activities of bombesin and PDB in Swiss 3T3 cells. Consistent with previous reports (26Mann D.J. Higgins T. Jones N.C. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Albert D.A. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the supplementation of insulin markedly increased the potency of bombesin/PDB-induced S phase entry (Fig. 1). Quiescent fibroblasts were stimulated with the indicated mitogens for 24 h, and the hyperphosphorylated form of pRb was clearly detectable in cells stimulated with 10% NCS, with bombesin and insulin, and with PDB and insulin (Fig. 1A). Results obtained from BrdUrd incorporation assays showed good agreement with the pRb mobility shift assay, in which the treatment of cells with 10% NCS, bombesin + insulin, and PDB + insulin resulted in the highest levels of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1B). In terms of phospholipid signaling, the major difference between the mitogens bombesin and PDB is that they have a differential dependence on cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2. For instance, bombesin and PDB activate PKC in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent and PtdIns(4,5)P2-independent manner, respectively (29Zachary I. Millar J. Nånberg E. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting SKIP to the Nuclei of Swiss 3T3 Fibroblasts—Accumulating evidence has firmly established that cytosolic and nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 can have distinct influences on cell cycle progression. To investigate this signaling with respect to cell cycle control, SKIP was employed as a molecular tool with which to manipulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in different cellular compartments. Native SKIP is predominantly cytosolic with no apparent nuclear localization (16Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Fukami K. Funaki M. Asano T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Gurung R. Tan A. Ooms L.M. McGrath M.J. Huysmans R.D. Munday A.D. Prescott M. Whisstock J.C.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To target SKIP to the nucleus, a nuclear localizing sequence (NLS) derived from SV40 T-antigen was incorporated into the sequence of SKIP along with a GFP tag to allow identification of SKIP subcellular localization. We constructed an enzymatically inactive version of SKIP as a control through mutation of a key catalytic Asp residue in motif 2 (Asp269 in SKIP) previously identified in other lipid phosphatases (supplemental Fig. S1). By infecting wild-type Swiss 3T3 cells with the retroviral EGFP-SKIP cDNA constructs, recombinant Swiss 3T3 cell lines overexpressing each EGFP-SKIP fusion protein were established. Infected cell pools were used for all experiments presented here. The cellular distribution of EGFP-SKIP, EGFP-NLS-SKIP, and the corresponding SKIP-D269A variants was first analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). EGFP-SKIP and EGFP-SKIP-D269A were distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm with no specific subcellular localization (Fig. 2, C and F). In contrast, enrichment of SKIP in nuclei was observed when the NLS was incorporated into SKIP (Fig. 2, I and L). These results were validated using subcellular fractionation techniques (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that NLS versions of SKIP are substantially elevated in nuclei, whereas other variants are exclusively cytosolic.FIGURE 3Subcellular distribution of EGFP-SKIP and EGFP-NLS-SKIP in Swiss 3T3 cells. Cell lysates derived from EGFP-SKIP- and EGFP-SKIP-D269A-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells (A) and EGFP-NLS-SKIP- and EGFP-NLS-SKIP-D269A-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells (B) were fractionated into cytosolic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions. The fractionated samples were normalized according to protein concentrations and were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against α-tubulin, E2F-1, and GFP. The results shown are typical results from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overexpression of SKIP Down-regulates PtdIns(4,5)P2 Levels in Swiss 3T3 Fibroblasts—To monitor the effect of SKIP overexpression on cytosolic or nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in the recombinant Swiss 3T3 cell lines, we employed the PLCδ1-PH domain as a PtdIns(4,5)P2 probe for staining fixed cells. The integrity of this PtdIns(4,5)P2 detection method was examined, and the results are shown in supplemental Figs. S2 and S3. A decrease in cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2 labeling was observed in the cells that overexpressed EGFP-SKIP (Fig. 4G) or EGFP-NLS-SKIP (Fig. 4O). Notably, among all the cell lines examined, a decrease in nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels was observed exclusively in the cells that overexpressed EGFP-NLS-SKIP (Fig. 5O). Based on the results obtained from the subcellular localization studies (Fig. 3), the observed cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2 down-regulation in the nuclear SKIP cell line was most likely the consequence of the incomplete nuclear targeting of NLS-SKIP. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive forms of SKIP had no discernible effect on cytosolic or nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 staining, indicating that the decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 staining was the direct effect of the overexpressed SKIP activity.FIGURE 5Effect of overexpressing EGFP-SKIP/EGFP-NLS-SKIP on nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in Swiss 3T3 cells. Nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 staining was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pseudo colors assigned for DAPI, EGFP, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 are blue, green, and red, respectively. All images shown are typical results obtained from at least 10 different fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Negative Effects of SKIP Overexpression on PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent Signaling Events—Prior to dissecting the signaling role(s) of cytosolic/nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 in cell cycle regulation, a number of well characterized PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent signaling pathways were analyzed with the recombinant cell lines. Down-regulation of cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels had a pronounced inhibitory effect on insulin-induced Akt activation and bombesin-induced Erk-1 activation (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S4). These results are not unexpected, as the mitogens chosen to activate these signaling components are known to be dependent on the signals derived from PtdIns(4,5)P2 (29Zachary I. Millar J. Nånberg E. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDB elicits its signaling function by activating PKC directly (i.e. PtdIns(4,5)P2-independent) (30Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore employed as a mitogen likely to bypass the inhibitory effect of cytosolic SKIP overexpression. Indeed, the results obtained from the PDB-induced Erk-1 mobility shift experiment (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S4) clearly show that PDB treatment circumvented the inhibitory effect of cytosolic SKIP overexpression. Although PDB-induced Erk-1 phosphorylation is expected to be channeled predominantly through the activity of PKC, the slight delay observed in the SKIP-overexpressing cells (especially at 10 min) indicates that the down-regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in cells might have some unintentional side effects (see “Discussion”). As a complementary readout for the phospho-Erk-1 assay, bombesin/PDB-induced p70S6K phosphorylation was also analyzed with the recombinant cell lines. Treatment of resting cells with bombesin and PDB resulted in the phosphorylation of p70S6K as demonstrated by the appearance of the slower migrating bands (Fig. 6C). A decrease relative to the control cell lines in bombesin-induced p70S6K phosphorylation was observed with the EGFP-SKIP- and EGFP-NLS-SKIP-overexpressing cells, but the relative inhibitory effect was again less pronounced in the PDB treatment. Among all the cytosolic signaling events examined, results comparable with those found for wild-type cells were obtained with all other SKIP-D269A cell lines under all stimulatory conditions, thus suggesting that the observed inhibitory effects on these signaling pathways were the direct effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 down-regulation. Cytosolic/Nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 Down-regulation Results in the Delay of S Phase Entry—The effect of cytosolic/nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion on S phase entry induced by bombesin/PDB + insulin was investigated using two quantitative approaches: flow cytometry and BrdUrd incorporation. In the flow cytometry experiments, quiescent cells were stimulated for 24 h, and a significant decrease in S phase entry was observed in the cells that overexpressed EGFP-SKIP or EGFP-NLS-SKIP after bombesin/PDB + insulin treatment (Fig. 7A). Results similar to those with wild-type Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained with cells expressing catalytically inactive SKIP. Next, to investigate whether the observed S phase entry delay imposed by overexpressed SKIP can be circumvented by a stronger mitogen or prolonged stimulation, 10% NCS was included, and the stimulation time was extended to 32 h in the BrdUrd incorporation assays. Treatments of cells with 10% NCS induced high levels of BrdUrd incorporation in all cell lines tested, indicating that the overexpressed SKIP activity could not counteract this potent mitogen. However, even with the prolonged stimulation time, bombesin/PDB + insulin failed to induce a similar level of BrdUrd incorporation in the EGFP-SKIP- and EGFP-NLS-SKIP-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells in contrast to their SKIP-D269A-expressing counterpart cell lines (Fig. 7B)."
