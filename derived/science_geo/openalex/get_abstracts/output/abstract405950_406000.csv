https://openalex.org/W1983132795,"SERCA2a is an ATPase responsible for calcium reuptake during excitation contraction coupling. Levels and activity of SERCA2a are decreased in heart failure, and a gene-therapy approach to deliver SERCA2a to failing hearts is being tested in clinical trials. Roger Hajjar and colleagues now show that SUMOylation, the attachment of SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) proteins, is essential for preserving the stability and activity of SERCA2a and that levels of SUMO1 are decreased in failing hearts. They also show in a mouse model of heart failure that gene delivery of SUMO1 can restore heart function to the same degree as delivery of SERCA2a, pointing to SUMO1 as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating heart failure. The calcium-transporting ATPase ATP2A2, also known as SERCA2a, is a critical ATPase responsible for Ca2+ re-uptake during excitation–contraction coupling. Impaired Ca2+ uptake resulting from decreased expression and reduced activity of SERCA2a is a hallmark of heart failure1. Accordingly, restoration of SERCA2a expression by gene transfer has proved to be effective in improving cardiac function in heart-failure patients2, as well as in animal models3. The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) can be conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins4, and is involved in many cellular processes5. Here we show that SERCA2a is SUMOylated at lysines 480 and 585 and that this SUMOylation is essential for preserving SERCA2a ATPase activity and stability in mouse and human cells. The levels of SUMO1 and the SUMOylation of SERCA2a itself were greatly reduced in failing hearts. SUMO1 restitution by adeno-associated-virus-mediated gene delivery maintained the protein abundance of SERCA2a and markedly improved cardiac function in mice with heart failure. This effect was comparable to SERCA2A gene delivery. Moreover, SUMO1 overexpression in isolated cardiomyocytes augmented contractility and accelerated Ca2+ decay. Transgene-mediated SUMO1 overexpression rescued cardiac dysfunction induced by pressure overload concomitantly with increased SERCA2a function. By contrast, downregulation of SUMO1 using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) accelerated pressure-overload-induced deterioration of cardiac function and was accompanied by decreased SERCA2a function. However, knockdown of SERCA2a resulted in severe contractile dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo, which was not rescued by overexpression of SUMO1. Taken together, our data show that SUMOylation is a critical post-translational modification that regulates SERCA2a function, and provide a platform for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure."

The diploid genomes of complex organisms limit genetic approaches in biomedical model species such as mice. To overcome this problem, experimental induction of haploidy has been used in fish. Haploid development in zebrafish has been applied for genetic screening. Recently, haploid pluripotent cell lines from medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) have also been established. In contrast, haploidy seems less compatible with development in mammals. Although haploid cells have been observed in egg cylinder stage parthenogenetic mouse embryos, most cells in surviving embryos become diploid. Here we describe haploid mouse embryonic stem cells and show their application in forward genetic screening."

https://openalex.org/W1988340193,"[FeFe]-Hydrogenases are complex metalloproteins that catalyze the reversible reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen utilizing a unique diiron subcluster bridged to a [4Fe4S] subcluster. Extensive studies have concentrated on the nature and catalytic activity of the active site, yet relatively little information is available concerning the mechanism of proton transport that is required for this activity. Previously, structural characterization of [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum indicated a potential proton transport pathway involving four residues (Cys-299, Glu-279, Ser-319, and Glu-282) that connect the active site to the enzyme surface. Here, we demonstrate that substitution of any of these residues resulted in a drastic reduction in hydrogenase activity relative to the native enzyme, supporting the importance of these residues in catalysis. Inhibition studies of native and amino acid-substituted enzymes revealed that Zn(2+) specifically blocked proton transfer by binding to Glu-282, confirming the role of this residue in the identified pathway. In addition, all four of these residues are strictly conserved, suggesting that they may form a proton transport pathway that is common to all [FeFe]-hydrogenases."

https://openalex.org/W2031029779,"The co-translational modification of N-terminal acetylation is ubiquitous among eukaryotes and has been reported to have a wide range of biological effects. The human N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) Naa50p (NAT5/SAN) acetylates the α-amino group of proteins containing an N-terminal methionine residue and is essential for proper sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation. The elevated activity of NATs has also been correlated with cancer, making these enzymes attractive therapeutic targets. We report the x-ray crystal structure of Naa50p bound to a native substrate peptide fragment and CoA. We found that the peptide backbone of the substrate is anchored to the protein through a series of backbone hydrogen bonds with the first methionine residue specified through multiple van der Waals contacts, together creating an α-amino methionine-specific pocket. We also employed structure-based mutagenesis; the results support the importance of the α-amino methionine-specific pocket of Naa50p and are consistent with the proposal that conserved histidine and tyrosine residues play important catalytic roles. Superposition of the ternary Naa50p complex with the peptide-bound Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase revealed that the two enzymes share a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase fold but differ in their respective substrate-binding grooves such that Naa50p can accommodate only an α-amino substrate and not a side chain lysine substrate that is acetylated by lysine acetyltransferase enzymes such as Gcn5. The structure of the ternary Naa50p complex also provides the first molecular scaffold for the design of NAT-specific small molecule inhibitors with possible therapeutic applications.

Protein acetylation is one of the most common covalent modifications found in the proteome (1Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3203) Google Scholar). In this process, an acetyl group is transferred from acetyl-CoA to an α-amino group at the N terminus of a protein or an ϵ-amino group on a lysine side chain. Lysine acetyltransferase enzymes have been more extensively characterized than N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) 2The abbreviations used are: NATN-terminal acetyltransferaseGNATGcn5-related N-acetyltransferaseHAThistone acetyltransferase. enzymes at the biochemical, enzymological, and structural levels (2Hodawadekar S.C.

N-terminal acetyltransferase Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase histone acetyltransferase. In eukaryotes, N-terminal acetylation displays a wide range of functional effects varying on a case-by-case basis (4Arnesen T. PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001074Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, this modification was shown to serve as a degradation signal for individual proteins (5Hwang C.S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and also to prevent proper post-translational translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum (6Forte G.M. Pool M.R. Stirling C.J. PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, multiple protein complexes are capable of performing N-terminal acetylation, the most promiscuous and well characterized of which is the NatA complex (7Starheim K.K. Gromyko D.

Gene. 2006; 371: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This protein complex contains two catalytic subunits, Naa10p (ARD1) and Naa50p, and two auxiliary subunits, Naa15p (NATH (N-acetyltransferase human)) and HYPK, which associate with the ribosome (9Arnesen T.

The human and fruit fly Naa50p enzymes are essential for normal sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation, but the NatA complex was not implicated in this phenotype, suggesting that this is attributed solely by Naa50p-mediated NAT activity independent of the complex (12Hou F.

However, the responsible substrate potentially requiring N-terminal acetylation for proper functioning remains to be identified. Interestingly, NatA subunits have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of cancer cell lines, and NatA knockdown results in a decrease in cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis (15Arnesen T.

NATs have therefore become an attractive chemotherapeutic target, further driving the need for a molecular understanding of how these enzymes carry out their functions. NAT enzymes are differentiated based on their ability to acetylate substrate peptides that are of a specific sequence, with a particular dependence placed on the identity of the first two residues. Naa10p, which is normally active in the presence of Naa15p, is relatively promiscuous and able to acetylate α-amino groups of peptides containing Ser, Ala, Gly, Val, Cys, Thr, Asp, or Glu at the N terminus (19Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The identities of downstream residues are not crucial for activity but can influence catalysis in some cases. Naa50p is only able to process substrate peptides that contain a methionine residue at the N terminus and is able to do so in vitro in the absence of other regulatory protein subunits (20Van Damme P. Evjenth R. Foyn H. Demeyer K. De Bock P.J. Lillehaug J.R. Vandekerckhove J. Arnesen T. Gevaert K. Mol. Cell.

In vivo knockdown of Naa10p and Naa15p indirectly destabilizes human Naa50p, resulting in down-regulation of N-terminal acetylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F, which may represent a true in vivo substrate (19Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of recombinant Naa50p has been carried out using a 24-residue peptide that shares sequence identity with the first seven residues of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F. This study revealed that point mutations of any of the first four residues of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein peptide can have a detrimental effect on Naa50p activity, but only the first methionine residue is strictly required for catalysis. Many proteins known to contain acetylation-susceptible internal lysines have also been screened with Naa50p, and no significant acetylation has been detected (21Evjenth R. Hole K. Karlsen O.A. Ziegler M. Arnesen T. Lillehaug J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31122-31129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Notably, both Naa50p and Naa10p have been reported to have the ability to acetylate themselves in vitro; however, it is widely accepted that NAT enzymes are only minimally active as side chain lysine acetyltransferases and select for N-terminal acetylation through an unknown mechanism (21Evjenth R.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4422-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for how NAT proteins such as Naa50p mediate catalysis and selectively target the α-amino group of N-terminal residues over side chain lysine residues, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of a ternary Naa50p complex with coenzyme A and a cognate N-terminal substrate peptide and carried out structure-based mutagenesis as well as accompanying biochemical and enzymatic characterization. A pETM-GST vector (G. Stier, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) containing DNA encoding full-length human Naa50p (amino acids 1–169) fused to GST through a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable site was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C until the cell A600 reached ∼0.7, induced for protein expression with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 18 °C. Cells were isolated by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was isolated and passed over GST-binding resin (Clontech). Unbound proteins were washed off the resin with lysis buffer, and tobacco etch virus protease was added directly to the resin and allowed to incubate overnight at room temperature. Untagged Naa50p was washed off the resin with lysis buffer; collected; dialyzed into buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; and bound to a 5-ml HiTrap SP ion exchange column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted in the same buffer using a salt gradient of 50–750 mm NaCl and further purified to homogeneity using a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in storage buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Peak fractions containing protein that was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE were concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml using a 10-kDa protein concentrator (Millipore) and stored at −70 °C until used. All protein mutants were generated using the QuikChange protocol from Stratagene (23Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). Protein harboring point mutations was obtained following the expression and purification protocols described above. The peptides and CoA used in crystallization were purchased from GenScript and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. The ternary Naa50p·CoA·peptide complex was prepared for crystallization by mixing in a 1:3:3 molar ratio, respectively. The length of the substrate peptide was varied between 7 and 20 amino acids in crystallization trials. The protein concentration used in crystallization was 12 mg/ml, and the peptide that produced the best diffracting crystals was a 10-mer with the sequence MLGPEGGRWG. Crystals of the ternary Naa50p·CoA·peptide complex were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C over 1–3 days against reservoir solution containing 16% PEG 8000, 20% glycerol, and 40 mm potassium phosphate (monobasic; pH 5.0). Crystals were transferred to harvest solution containing well solution supplemented with 25% glycerol prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and processed using HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure of the ternary Naa50p·CoA·peptide complex was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser in the CCP4 suite of programs using the binary Naa50p·CoA complex (Protein Data Bank code 2PSW) as a search model (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules and CoA were excluded from the search model. Structure refinement was performed by initially applying 3-fold non-crystallographic symmetry and running phenix.refine with group atomic displacement parameters for the initial cycles (26Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16817) Google Scholar). Subsequently, CoA and substrate peptide were built into the resulting Fo − Fc electron density map, and additional refinement was performed manually using the molecular graphics program Coot (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). In advanced stages of refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were released, individual atomic displacement parameters were refined, and solvent was added. The final model was checked for errors against a composite omit map generated in CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Refinement statistics can be found in Table 1.

A saturating amount of acetyl-CoA (300 μm) was used in all enzymatic reactions, and the substrate peptide (+NH3-MLGPEGGRWGRPVGRRRRP-COO−; GenScript) concentration was varied to determine steady-state catalytic parameters. In the assay, radiolabeled [14C]acetyl-CoA (4 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was mixed with the substrate peptide and allowed to incubate with enzyme in a 25-μl reaction volume. To quench the reaction, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was added to P81 paper discs (Whatman), and the paper discs were immediately placed in wash buffer. Washes were then carried out three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), with each wash lasting 5 min, to remove unreacted acetyl-CoA. The papers were then dried with acetone and added to 4 ml of scintillation fluid, and the signal was measured using a Packard Tri-Carb 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer. Background control reactions were performed in the absence of enzyme. Reactions were also performed in the absence of the substrate peptide to ensure that any possible signal due to autoacetylation was negligible. Substrate peptide Km and Vmax parameters were derived by titrating the substrate peptide at eight different concentrations ranging from 100 to 1500 μm in the presence of 300 μm acetyl-CoA. Complications caused by TFA from the addition of high concentrations of the substrate peptide prevented point mutant catalytic assays from reaching a saturating amount of peptide, so we instead analyzed the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of these mutants. By keeping the substrate concentration far below Km, we were able to plot velocity versus [peptide] and use the slope of the resulting line to obtain kcat/Km values for several of these mutants based on the following equation: v = (kcat/Km)[E][S]. These results allowed us to compare quantitatively the catalytic efficiencies of each mutant with the wild-type enzyme. The acetyl-CoA Km value was determined by titrating a range of acetyl-CoA concentrations (25–500 μm) into a reaction containing 2.5 mm peptide in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The high concentration of Tris is required to counter the pH effect caused by TFA carried into the reaction with high concentrations of peptide. A pH-rate profile was determined using a three-component buffer system able to maintain constant ionic strength at all pH values used in this study (29Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in triplicate. All radioactive count values were converted to molar units using a standard curve created with known concentrations of radioactive acetyl-CoA added to scintillation fluid. Crystals of the ternary Naa50p·CoA·substrate peptide complex formed in space group P21 with three molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to a 2.75-Å resolution limit. The structure was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 19.0/25.4% with good stereochemistry and with 96.9% of the residues in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The structure reveals a mixed α/β-fold with a conserved acetyl-CoA-binding core region composed of one α-helix (α3) and three β-strands (β2–β4) as shown in Fig. 1. This motif is characteristic of GNATs and allows us to confidently place Naa50p into this family of enzymes (30Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Indeed, Naa50p superimposes well with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of Gcn5, with a root mean square deviation of Cα atoms of 4.1 Å (Fig. 1B). In addition to a high degree of superposition within the core domain, the entire β-sheet that cuts through the center of the structure (β1–β5 and β7) and the α1-turn-α2 that flanks one side of the protein substrate-binding site superimpose well (Fig. 1B). The greatest regions of divergence between the two proteins map to C-terminal segments of the two proteins that flank the opposing side of the respective protein substrate-binding site, which also maps to the largest region of sequence and structural divergence between the GNAT proteins (30Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 31Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Sterner D.E. Venkataramani R.N. Wang L. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8931-8936Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the case of Gcn5, this region forms a loop-helix-loop-strand motif that facilitates the formation of a relatively wide protein substrate-binding site, whereas in the case of Naa50p, this regions forms a β-hairpin (β6-loop-β7) containing a relatively long 14-residue loop that blocks off part of the protein substrate-binding site that is otherwise accessible in Gcn5 (Fig, 1B). In addition to well ordered electron density for the entire CoA molecule, we observed strong electron density in the Fo − Fc map corresponding to the first four residues of the 10-residue peptide that was used for the crystal structure (Fig. 2A). Following refinement, side chain density was visible for the first two residues of the peptide, whereas backbone density could be traced to the fourth residue (Fig. 1A). This correlates with the contacts formed between the peptide and the enzyme in the crystal structure (Fig. 2, B and C). Hydrogen bonding can be observed throughout the backbone for the first two residues, and the Met1 and Leu2 side chains both sit in hydrophobic pockets that appear to be tailored for these residues (Fig. 2, B and C). 3The positions of residues in the peptide substrate are indicated by superscript numbers, and those in the protein enzyme are indicated by hyphenated full-size numbers. There are no substantial interactions beyond the leucine backbone carbonyl group seen in the structure. The overall thermal B-factor of the peptide is 73.9, which is high in relation to the overall thermal B-factor of the protein, 55. This discrepancy can be accounted for by the skewed nature of the B-factors of the individual residues of the peptide. Met1 has a B-factor of 62, and this value increases for each residue of the peptide that extends out of the binding pocket, with the Pro4 B-factor reaching 93. For comparison, the atoms of CoA have an average B-factor of 50. Superposition of the ternary complex with the binary Naa50p·acetyl-CoA complex (Protein Data Bank code 2OB0) showed no significant structural rearrangement upon substrate peptide binding (supplemental Fig. 1), further revealing that Naa50p does not undergo significant structural change upon protein substrate binding. The N-terminal peptide substrate points into the protein active site, with the backbone roughly perpendicular to the central β-sheet and parallel to the pantothenate arm of the CoA (Figs. 1B and 2A). The peptide is anchored to the protein through a series of hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Tyr-31 and Tyr-139 and the backbone carbonyl atoms of Met-75 and His-112 (Fig. 2C). The N-terminal methionine sits in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Phe-27, Pro-28, and Val-29 from the α1-α2 loop and Tyr-139 and Ile-142 from the β6-β7 hairpin loop, which each make van der Waals contacts with Met1 of the peptide. Leu2 also sits in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tyr-31 and Phe-35 from the α1-α2 loop segment, Tyr-138 from the β6-β7 hairpin loop, and Tyr-73 and Met-75 from the β4 strand (Fig. 2C). There are also hydrophilic groups in the vicinity of Leu2 such as the hydroxyls of Tyr-73 and Tyr-138 and the guanidinium group of Arg-62 (Fig. 2C), which provides an explanation for the ability of Naa50p to acetylate a substrate with a hydrophilic residue at the second position. Consistent with the importance of residues that contact the peptide, each of these residues is highly conserved within the Naa50p orthologs from other species (Fig. 2D). In particular, the residues that contact the peptide backbone (Tyr-31, Met-75, His-112, and Tyr-139) and Met1 (Phe-27, Pro-28, Val-29, Tyr-139, and Ile-142) are strictly conserved, and residues that contact Leu2 (Tyr-31, Phe-35, Tyr-73, Met-75, and Tyr-138) are strictly or highly conserved (Fig. 2D). To establish directly the functional importance of Naa50p residues that appear to make important peptide substrate contacts in the crystal structure, we targeted several of these residues for mutagenesis, followed by enzymatic characterization of the mutant proteins. Each mutated residue was changed to alanine, and the catalytic efficiency of each mutant was determined and compared with that of the wild-type protein. Each mutant was purified to homogeneity and exhibited gel filtration chromatography elution profiles identical to that of the wild-type construct. To confirm further that the mutant proteins were folded properly, they were subjected to circular dichroism experiments, each revealing a similar spectrum to the wild-type protein (data not shown). Notably, each of the mutant proteins showed defects in catalytic efficiency, with most of the mutant proteins showing no detectable activity (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Of the residues that contact the peptide backbone, Tyr-31, His-112, and Tyr-139 were mutated, and each of these mutants showed no detectable activity, arguing for the importance of these residues for backbone interaction, although Tyr-31 also participates in Leu2 peptide contact, and His-112 likely participates directly in catalysis, as will be described below (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Of the residues that contact Met1 of the peptide, the Phe-27 mutant showed no detectable activity, whereas the Pro-28 and Val-29 mutants showed at least an 85% reduction in activity. The Tyr-139 mutant showed no detectable activity, and the Ile-142 mutant retained ∼40% activity (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Mutants of Leu2 peptide contact residues Tyr-31, Phe-35, and Tyr-73 each showed no detectable activity (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Taken together, the results from the structure-based mutagenesis are consistent with the functional importance of the protein-peptide substrate interactions observed in the crystal structure.TABLE 2Catalytic efficiency of the wild-type Naa50p enzyme and mutantsEnzymekcat/KmWild-type efficiencyμm−1 min−1%Wild-type1.94 ×10−2100F27ANDaND, mutants that did not yield detectable activity at 2.0 mm substrate peptide and a saturating amount of acetyl-CoA.<10P28A2.59 ×10−313.4V29A2.38 ×10−312.3Y31AND<10F35AND<10Y73AND<10Y73FND<10H112AND<10H112FND<10Y139AND<10I142A8.18 ×10−342.2a ND, mutants that did not yield detectable activity at 2.0 mm substrate peptide and a saturating amount of acetyl-CoA. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Naa50p active site revealed that only two residues are in position to function in catalysis, Tyr-73 and His-112 (Fig. 4A). Although the functional groups of these residues could participate in proton extraction of the amino nitrogen substrate, the hydroxyl of Tyr-73 and the imidazole nitrogen of His-112 are too far for direct proton extraction. To potentially circumvent this issue, a well ordered water molecule, with a B-factor of 48, is in a position to mediate proton abstraction. This molecule is held in place via hydrogen bonds with the peptide N-terminal α-amino group and the backbone carbonyl and nitrogen of Ile-74 and His-112, respectively (Fig. 4A). Supporting the role of such a water molecule, the GNAT histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 has been shown to employ a glutamate residue to mediate proton abstraction from the substrate peptide through a well ordered water molecule (32Rojas J.R.

Here, we report that Aβ oligomers secreted by 7PA2 cells caused synapse damage in cultured neurons via a PrP(C)-dependent process. Exogenous PrP(C) added to Prnp knock-out((0/0)) neurons was targeted to synapses and significantly increased Aβ-induced synapse damage. In contrast, the synapse damage induced by a phospholipase A(2)-activating peptide was independent of PrP(C). In Prnp wild-type((+/+)) neurons Aβ oligomers activated synaptic cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)). In these cells, the addition of Aβ oligomers triggered the translocation of cPLA(2) in synapses to cholesterol dense membranes (lipid rafts) where it formed a complex also containing Aβ and PrP(C). In contrast, the addition of Aβ to Prnp((0/0)) neurons did not activate synaptic cPLA(2), which remained in the cytoplasm and was not associated with Aβ. Filtration assays and non-denaturing gels demonstrated that Aβ oligomers cross-link PrP(C). We propose that it is the cross-linkage of PrP(C) by Aβ oligomers that triggers abnormal activation of cPLA(2) and synapse damage. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that monoclonal antibody mediated cross-linkage of PrP(C) also activated synaptic cPLA(2) and caused synapse damage."
https://openalex.org/W1998917613,"Methanobactin (Mb), a 1217-Da copper chelator produced by the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, is hypothesized to mediate copper acquisition from the environment, particularly from insoluble copper mineral sources. Although indirect evidence suggests that Mb provides copper for the regulation and activity of methane monooxygenase enzymes, experimental data for direct uptake of copper loaded Mb (Cu-Mb) are lacking. Uptake of intact Cu-Mb by M. trichosporium OB3b was demonstrated by isotopic and fluorescent labeling experiments. Confocal microscopy data indicate that Cu-Mb is localized in the cytoplasm. Both Cu-Mb and unchelated Cu are taken up by M. trichosporium OB3b, but by different mechanisms. Uptake of unchelated Cu is inhibited by spermine, suggesting a porin-dependent passive transport process. By contrast, uptake of Cu-Mb is inhibited by the uncoupling agents carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and methylamine, but not by spermine, consistent with an active transport process. Cu-Mb from M. trichosporium OB3b can also be internalized by other strains of methanotroph, but not by Escherichia coli, suggesting that Cu-Mb uptake is specific to methanotrophic bacteria. These findings are consistent with a key role for Cu-Mb in copper acquisition by methanotrophs and have important implications for further investigation of the copper uptake machinery."

https://openalex.org/W1965265620,"Copper is reported to promote and prevent aggregation of prion protein. Conformational and functional consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to prion protein (PrP) are not well understood largely because most of the Cu(2+)-binding studies have been performed on fragments and truncated variants of the prion protein. In this context, we set out to investigate the conformational consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to full-length prion protein (PrP) by isothermal calorimetry, NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering. In this study, we report altered aggregation behavior of full-length PrP upon binding to Cu(2+). At physiological temperature, Cu(2+) did not promote aggregation suggesting that Cu(2+) may not play a role in the aggregation of PrP at physiological temperature (37 °C). However, Cu(2+)-bound PrP aggregated at lower temperatures. This temperature-dependent process is reversible. Our results show two novel intra-protein interactions upon Cu(2+)-binding. The N-terminal region (residues 90-120 that contain the site His-96/His-111) becomes proximal to helix-1 (residues 144-147) and its nearby loop region (residues 139-143), which may be important in preventing amyloid fibril formation in the presence of Cu(2+). In addition, we observed another novel interaction between the N-terminal region comprising the octapeptide repeats (residues 60-91) and helix-2 (residues 174-185) of PrP. Small angle x-ray scattering studies of full-length PrP show significant compactness upon Cu(2+)-binding. Our results demonstrate novel long range inter-domain interactions of the N- and C-terminal regions of PrP upon Cu(2+)-binding, which might have physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2087491749,"ATP-dependent Clp protease (ClpP) is an attractive new target for the development of anti-infective agents. The ClpP protease consists of two heptameric rings that enclose a large chamber containing 14 proteolytic active sites. Recent studies indicate that ClpP likely undergoes conformational switching between an extended and degraded active state required for substrate proteolysis and a compacted and catalytically inactive state allowing product release. Here, we present the wild-type ClpP structures in two distinct states from Staphylococcus aureus. One structure is very similar to those solved ClpP structures in the extended states. The other is strikingly different from both the extended and the compacted state as observed in ClpP from other species; the handle domain of this structure kinks to take on a compressed conformation. Structural analysis and molecular dynamic simulations show that the handle domain predominantly controls the way in which degradation products exit the chamber through dynamic conformational switching from the extended state to the compressed state.

Furthermore, in compacted states the catalytic triads are disorganized when compared with those in extended states. Although both the extended and compacted structures were solved for EcClpP, the latter was crystallized from an engineered protein by using disulfide cross-linking (22Kimber M.S. Yu A.Y. Borg M. Leung E. Chan H.S. Houry W.A. Structure. 2010; 18: 798-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To date, no firm structural data exist that simultaneously show these two states are accessible to a given wild-type ClpP from a specific species. Solved ClpP crystal structures have provided valuable information for understanding the process by which a substrate peptide enters a cylindrical chamber and is recognized in the active site for degradation (17Szyk A. Maurizi M.R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, how the degraded polypeptides are released from the ClpP proteolytic chamber still remains largely controversial. Investigators have made many efforts to find structural evidence that would elucidate the molecular mechanisms of peptide fragments release. Two major models have been put forth. One model proposes that degraded oligopeptide products exit the catalytic chamber by passive diffusion through the same axial pores that allow the entry of unfolded proteins (26Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proposal is problematic, however, because ATPase binds to ClpP simultaneously at both ends, which interrupts product release (28Ortega J. Lee H.S. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The other model proposes that the degraded peptides exit the catalytic chamber through side pores generated transiently by the dynamic conformational changes of the handle regions. Studies of x-ray structural analysis of an A153P mutation of SpClpP (23Gribun A. Kimber M.S. Ching R. Sprangers R. Fiebig K.M. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16185-16196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and quantitative NMR spectroscopy characterization of EcClpP (29Sprangers R. Gribun A. Hwang P.M. Houry W.A. Kay L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16678-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) support this proposal. Nevertheless, the second proposal requires further structural evidence. While this paper was in preparation, a structural study of SaClpP found that the handle helix bent in the tetradecameric packing form, which was suggested to generate pores through degradative products might escape the proteolytic chamber (30Geiger S.R. Böttcher T. Sieber S.A. Cramer P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 5749-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we have determined two crystal structures of wild-type SaClpP proteins in two distinct conformations. Although all ClpP structures solved to date are either in the extended or compacted states, these SaClpP structures presented here are the first examples to provide different conformational assemblies for a given ClpP. One structure is very similar to those ClpP structures solved in the extended states; the other is quite different from either the extended or compacted ClpP structures in that the handle domains adopt compressed conformations. In conjunction with biochemical analyses and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these structures provide two different conformational snapshots during ClpP protease dynamic degradation cycle, explain the organizational principles behind biological complex formation, and reveal mechanistic insight into the biological function of the degradation of peptides in the active site as well as the release of products from the catalytic chamber. Three forms of SaClpP proteins (N-2-SaClpP, C-His-SaClpP, and mature SaClpP) were constructed for both crystallization and activity studies. N-2-SaClpP protein, which includes two more amino acids at the N terminus, was produced for the crystallization experiment by cloning S. aureus Newman strain clpP gene into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 vector (Novagen) for overexpression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C, with shaking at 220 rpm, in LB media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.6, at which time protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. A cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT, and lysed at 4 °C by sonication. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min to remove the insoluble material, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml GST high performance column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a single gradient of 10 mm glutathione (pH 8.0) in lysis buffer. After thrombin digestion off the GST tag at 4 °C overnight, 2 extra amino acids of Gly-Ser were introduced in protein sequence at the N terminus. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, 120 ml) in buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 2 mm DTT. C-His-SaClpP, the SaClpP with a C terminus His tag, was constructed by cloning the corresponding gene into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET28b vector (Novagen) and purified through a HisTrap High Performance column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–400 mm imidazole. Gel filtration purification was followed to give pure protein that has the native sequence at the N terminus. The C-terminal His6 tag was intact for functional study. The mature SaClpP protein was designed and constructed with N-terminal His-tagged in the NheI and XhoI sites of pET28b vector, so that the tag could be autoproteolytically cleaved during expression to produce protein in native sequence. After cell growth and harvest by a procedure similar to the aforementioned, the supernatant was added to 3 volume of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), loaded onto an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column (GE Healthcare, 20 ml) that had been equilibrated with buffer A, and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m). The combined fractions (10 ml/fraction) were treated with 1.0 m ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare, 5 ml). The flow-through fractions were collected and concentrated to 2 ml and then subjected to gel filtration purification using a Superdex 200 column. Gel filtration was performed at 4 °C using a calibrated Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) attached to an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with either a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT or a buffer using a salt condition of 50–200 mm sodium sulfate instead of 100 mm KCl. Molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) used were: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). Protein was monitored by absorbance at the wavelength of 280 nm. For peptidase activity (27Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the model substrate peptide N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LY-AMC) was purchased from Shanghai GL Biochem Ltd and directly used without further purification. Measurements of the hydrolysis rate of the labeled peptide were performed on 2104 Envision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Typically, 20 μg of SaClpP proteins in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT were incubated at 32 °C for 5 min, and then 0.5 mm substrate peptide Suc-LY-AMC was added in the reaction system. The fluorescence increase was continuously monitored for 100 min, and the excitation wavelength of 340 nm and the emission wavelength of 450 nm were used. Kinetic assays were performed in triplicate, and kinetic constants were determined with the GraphPad Prism 5 Software by plotting the enzyme velocity against substrate concentration. To further investigate and compare the proteolytic activity of these SaClpP proteins, we carried out protein degradation assays by using two model substrates, GFP-SsrA and β-casein, as described previously (31Wojtyra U.A. Thibault G. Tuite A. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48981-48990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, each run contained 0.6 μm SaClpX, 0.33 μm SaClpP, and 5.0 μm GFP-SsrA or 15.0 μm β-casein in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 100 μl, where control reactions were performed in the absence of SaClpP proteins. All reactions were monitored at 37 °C for 40 or 90 min by separating the proteins on SDS-PAGE that were Coomassie-stained. Crystallization of purified N-2-SaClpP protein was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Typically, the crystallization drop was prepared by well mixing a 2-μl protein (10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl) and an equal volume of reservoir solution and then equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution. Sphenoid-shaped crystals grew up in a reservoir solution containing 100 mm citric acid (pH 3.5) and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate within 2 days. Hexagonal rod-like crystals appeared in the reservoir solution of 10% (w/v) PEG 3000, 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 200 mm MgCl2. The crystals were mounted and flash-frozen in liquid N2 after cryoprotection with the reservoir solution containing an extra 10–20% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 17U. All x-ray data were processed using HKL2000 program suite (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.276. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors within the CCP4 program (33CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P6122 and C2. The structures were phased by molecular replacement in Phaser (34Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) using previously published BsClpP truncated monomer as search model (PDB code 3KTG). The N-2-SaClpP model was manually built using COOT (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Data collection and refinement parameters statistics for all two structures are summarized in Table 1. Molecular graphics figures were prepared with PyMOL (37DeLano, W. L.

The water box was 10 Å from the protein on all sides (i.e. the starting structure had 20 Å between periodic images). Hydrogen bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm (41Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H. Fraaije J. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11986) Google Scholar). Na+ ions and Cl− ions were added to neutralize the simulation systems. Long range electrostatic interactions were treated by using the particle-mesh Ewald method (42Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar). Periodic boundary conditions were applied to avoid edge effects in all calculations. The temperature was kept constant at 300 K by separately coupling the water, ions, and protein in a thermal bath using the Berendsen thermostat method (43Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23947) Google Scholar) with a coupling time of 1 ps. Berendsen pressure coupling (43Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23947) Google Scholar) was used for equilibration of the systems. To investigate the conformational transitions of SaClpP protease implied by these two structures, we carried out 200-ns MD simulations on SaClpPmono and SaClpP14half. Before the MD simulation run, the systems were subjected to energy minimizations using the steepest-descents algorithm (44Fletcher R. Practical Methods of Optimization. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980: 1-40Google Scholar). Then the systems were heated gradually from 0 to 300 K. First, a 100-ps simulation was carried out to heat the solvent molecules and ions. After that, 50- and 20-ps simulations were performed to heat all the atoms in the system with the restriction of main chain and protein Cα atoms, respectively. Finally, the conventional MD was performed with coordinates saved every 10 ps during the entire process. In the size exclusion chromatography, the retention time of N-2-SaClpP protein under 100 mm KCl was between those of tetradecameric and heptameric EcClpP (supplemental Fig. 1A), suggesting that the oligomeric state of N-2-SaClpP is in equilibrium in heptameric and tetradecameric forms. However, both the mature SaClpP and C-His-SaClpP proteins display tetradecameric organization under the same buffer conditions (Fig. 1A). The EcClpP double rings could be reversibly dissociated in the presence of sodium sulfate (45Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test whether this would also happen on SaClpP, we conducted a gel filtration assay for all three proteins in a buffer containing 200 mm sodium sulfate. Consistent with previous observation in EcClpP, the stability of the double heptameric rings of wild-type SaClpP is also dependent on salt conditions (Fig. 1A). Moreover, treatment of the native C-His-SaClpP protein with sodium sulfate causes the tetradecameric oligomerization to migrate toward a heptameric state in a salt concentration-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1B, two SaClpP proteins having native amino acid sequences at the N terminus (mature SaClpP and C-His-SaClpP), and the protein with two extra amino acids at the N terminus (N-2-SaClpP) are all active for efficient degradation of the short model peptide Suc-LY-AMC in a comparable range of activity in vitro. The measured Km and Kcat values were 145 μm and 225 min−1 for mature SaClpP, 133 μm and 146 min−1 for C-His-SaClpP, and 151 μm and 151 min−1 for N-2-SaClpP, respectively (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this peptidase activity appears dependent on sulfate concentration. The Km stayed almost constant (between 133 and 158 μm), but Kcat increases ∼3-fold (from 145 to 456 min−1) as the sodium sulfate concentration was raised to 200 mm (supplemental Fig. 1C and Table 1), indicating that the substrate peptide binding by SaClpP is not affected by the sulfate ion. However, the enzyme catalytic turnover is increased in the presence of sulfate. Consistent with previous reports on EcClpP (15Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Beyer D. Kroll H.P. Endermann R. Ladel C. Schroeder W. Hinzen B. Raddatz S. Paulsen H. Henninger K. Bandow J.E. Sahl H.G. Labischinski H. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the N-terminal His6 tag is able to undergo autoproteolysis by SaClpP protease itself during protein expression (supplemental Fig. 1D). In the degradation of the model substrate proteins GFP-SsrA and β-casein in the presence of SaClpX, the N-2-SaClpP protein shows lower proteolysis activity compared with the native protein C-His-SaClpP under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1E). This result is possibly due to its organizational equilibrium between tetradecamer and heptamer. This observation suggests that the tetradecameric organization of ClpP assembly is necessary for degradation of substrate protein. The extended SaClpP was crystallized in space group C2. The structure was refined at 2.28 Å resolution (Table 1). In this crystal, the asymmetric unit consists of two heptameric rings stacking face-to-face to form a tetradecamer. Because ClpPs display a high degree of sequence similarity in various organisms (Fig. 2), it is no surprise that the overall protein folding of SaClpP tetradecamer closely resembles the common feature of the previously solved ClpP structures in the extended states from other organisms (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) (9Wang J.

Structurally, a SaClpP monomer can be divided into three parts: N-terminal loop (colored in green), head domain (yellow), and handle domain (cyan) (Fig. 3A). Functionally, the N-terminal loops bearing seven antiparallel β-hairpins (Fig. 3D) control the entrance diameter of the protease chamber. In this extended SaClpP, the loops fill the space surrounding the entrance to the axial channel in defining a narrow pore about 12 Å in diameter (see Fig. 5A, bottom panel) to allow only the passage of a single amino acid (16Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The head domain comprises the bulk of the protein and forms the apical surface of the tetradecamer. The handle domains in each heptamer consist of one β-strand and a long helix (αE), which intercalates with the handle domains of the opposing heptameric ring to enclose a tetradecameric cylinder of SaClpP.FIGURE 3Crystal structure of the extended SaClpP.

Recent structural data demonstrated that MxA oligomerizes into multimeric filamentous or ring-like structures by virtue of its stalk domain. Here, we show that negatively charged lipid membranes support MxA self-assembly. Like dynamin, MxA assembled around spherical liposomes inducing liposome tubulation. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy revealed that MxA oligomers around liposomes have a “T-bar” shape similar to dynamin. Moreover, biochemical assays indicated that the unstructured L4 loop of the MxA stalk serves as the lipid-binding moiety, and mutational analysis of L4 revealed that a stretch of four lysine residues is critical for binding. The orientation of the MxA molecule within the membrane-associated oligomer is in agreement with the proposed topology of MxA oligomers based on crystallographic data. Although oligomerization of wild-type MxA around liposomes led to the creation of helically decorated tubes similar to those formed by dynamin, this lipid interaction did not stimulate GTPase activity, in sharp contrast to the assembly-stimulated nucleotide hydrolysis observed with dynamin. Moreover, MxA readily self-assembles into rings at physiological conditions, as opposed to dynamin which self-assembles only at low salt conditions or onto lipids. Thus, the present results indicate that the oligomeric structures formed by MxA critically differ from those of dynamin.

Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Daumke O. Kochs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Members of the dynamin superfamily have important roles in endocytosis, vesicle transport, antiviral resistance, and many other cellular functions (2Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Current Opin.

MxA has intrinsic antiviral activity against many different viruses, including highly pathogenic influenza A and bunyaviruses (4Haller O. Kochs G. J.

MxA accumulates in the cytoplasm of IFN-stimulated cells and recognizes viral nucleocapsids during infection thereby blocking a critical step for virus replication (6Kochs G. Haller O. Proc. Natl.

It features an N-terminal GTP-binding domain (G domain; residues 1–341) that binds and hydrolyzes GTP, a central middle domain (MD; residues 366–533), and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED; residues 572–662) known to interact with the MD and G domain by intramolecular backfolding (9Schwemmle M.

Dynamin has a similar domain structure, but it contains two additional regions, namely a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain involved in lipid binding (12Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and a proline-rich domain known to mediate protein-protein interactions (13Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Recent crystallographic data revealed that the architecture of MxA and dynamin is more complex and consists of three distinct entities that are composed of discrete subunits of the classical domains (1Haller O. Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Daumke O. Kochs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Low H.H. Löwe J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These are (i) the globular G domain, (ii) the bundle signaling element consisting of the C-terminal portion of the GED and two helices connected to the G domain (15Chappie J.S. Acharya S. Leonard M. Schmid S.L. Dyda F. Nature. 2010; 465: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and (iii) an elongated stalk structure formed by the MD and the N-terminal part of the GED (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MxA stalk contains a 40-amino acid long loop L4 (residues 533–572) which is located at equivalent position to the PH domain of dynamin (Fig. 1) (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). MxA stalks assemble in a criss-cross fashion into stable dimers and tetramers which further oligomerize into extended multimers (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This arrangement guarantees that the G domains are positioned at one side of the MxA filaments whereas the L4 loops are found at the opposite side. The positioning of L4 implies that this unstructured loop may serve as a docking site for membranes or viral targets. A hallmark of dynamin family members is their association with lipid templates and the assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (2Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Accordingly, association with lipid membranes was described for MxA in IFN-treated cells as well as in vitro (16Accola M.A. Huang B. Al Masri A. McNiven M.A. J. Biol.

To investigate the function of lipid interaction for MxA and identify the region responsible for membrane binding, we performed a detailed study of the membrane binding properties of MxA using biochemical assays as well as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). To introduce single amino acid exchanges from lysine to glutamic acid into loop L4 of the full-length MxA, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. The constructs were cloned into the pQE9 expression vector using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites for further protein production. Recombinant MxA and mutant forms of MxA protein were expressed in Escherichia coli M15 using pQE-9 vector (Qiagen) as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein as described (22Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm imidazole). His-tagged MxA was eluted using 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. For further purification, His-MxA was loaded on a Superdex 200 (1.6 × 60 cm) column and eluted in HCB500 buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Aliquots of purified protein were stored at −70 °C. Dynamin was extracted from rat brains using its affinity to SH3 domains as described previously (26Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences), encoding amphiphysin-2 SH3 domain fused to glutathione S-transferase, was used for expression of SH3-GST in E. coli BL21 cells for expression. The cell pellet was lysed in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) by sonication. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) to prepare an SH3 affinity column. Rat brains were homogenized in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The homogenate was incubated with the SH3-GST-loaded beads, dynamin was eluted with 2 ml of buffer D (20 mm Pipes, pH 6.2, 1.2 m NaCl, 10 mm Ca2+) and dialyzed overnight against 400 ml of buffer E (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Aliquots of purified dynamin were stored at −70 °C. MxA protein (60 μg/ml) and dynamin (160 μg/ml) were incubated in 50 μl of HCB150 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl) with 1 mm GTP, 200 nCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 100 nm AMP-PNP as described (23Richter M.F.

At various time points reactions were terminated by mixing with the same volume of 2 mm EDTA in 0.5% SDS. Radiolabeled GDP was separated from the GTP substrate by chromatography on PEI-cellulose coated plates (Merck) with 1 m LiCl and 1 m acetic acid. Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography and quantified using MacBAS software from Fuji. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (10 mg/ml) (from Avanti Polar lipids, obtained in chloroform) and Folch fraction of total bovine brain lipids (TBLs) (Sigma) dissolved in chloroform to 10 mg/ml, were dried under a stream of nitrogen and kept under vacuum for at least 2 h. Then the lipids were resuspended to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in HCB of the indicated salt concentration. To ensure the integrity of the liposomes, each preparation was osmotically balanced for the salt concentration used in the different experiments. To generate liposomes of uniform size, the lipid solution was extruded 21 times through a 400-nm polycarbonate membrane (Avanti Polar Lipids). Purified MxA was diluted in HCB150 to a protein concentration of 180 μg/ml in a total volume of 50 μl. When indicated, preformed TBL liposomes were added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Then the protein mixture was incubated for 20 min at 20 °C. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and the mixture was further incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. The digestion was stopped by adding 15 μl of 4-fold SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting using antibodies specific for MxA (M143) and the histidine tag (Sigma). Purified MxA was diluted in HCB of the indicated NaCl concentrations to a protein concentration of 180 μg/ml in a total volume of 50 μl. Preformed liposomes were added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Then the protein-lipid mixture was incubated for 20 min at 20 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 20 °C in a TLA-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Supernatants (50 μl) were mixed with 15 μl of 4-fold SDS-sample buffer, and pellets were resuspended in 65 μl of SDS-sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Supernatants (20 μl) and pellets (20 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the protein bands were quantified using the Quantityone software of The Discovery series (Bio-Rad). MxA was diluted in HCB of the indicated NaCl concentration to a protein concentration of 250 μg/ml and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C or 16 h at 4 °C. Then, a 400-mesh carbon-coated grid was placed on a 20-μl sample drop for 2 min at room temperature and blotted with a filter paper to remove excess solution. The sample was chemically stained by placing the grid on a 20-μl drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 2 s and blotting, then placing the grid on another 20-μl drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min, followed by blotting and air-drying. Specimens were examined in a Philips CM120 TEM operating at 120 kV. Images were recorded digitally on a Gatan MultiScan 791 camera using the DigitalMicrograph software (Gatan, U.K.). Specimens were prepared manually in a controlled environment vitrification system (CEVS) or using the commercial environmentally controlled automated Vitrobot (FEI). In both devices, cryo-TEM samples were prepared at a controlled temperature and at saturated air humidity. A 6-μl drop of the solution was placed on a 200-mesh TEM copper grid (Ted-Pella) covered with a perforated carbon film. The drop was blotted, manually in the CEVS and automatically in the Vitrobot, and the sample was plunged into liquid ethane (−183 °C) to form a vitrified specimen, then transferred to liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for storage. Vitrified specimens were examined in a Tecnai T12 G2 TEM (FEI) or in a Philips CM120 at 120 kV, at temperatures below −175 °C. Images were recorded digitally on a Gatan UltraScan 1000 2k × 2k or Gatan MultiScan 791 cooled CCD camera using DigitalMicrograph (Gatan) in the low dose imaging mode to minimize beam exposure and electron beam radiation damage, as described previously (30Danino D. Bernheim-Groswasser A. Talmon Y. Colloid Surface-Physicochem. Eng. Asp. 2001; 183: 113-122Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We first studied the effect of salt concentration and temperature on MxA self-assembly by electron microscopy. MxA formed ring-like structures in the presence of 25 mm and 100 mm NaCl at 25 °C (Fig. 2, a and b) that disassembled at 300 mm salt concentration (Fig. 2c). The rings of oligomerized MxA had a diameter of about 50 nm, similar to rings created by dynamin in low salt (19Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and by DLP1 (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We used a salt concentration of 100 mm NaCl to analyze the MxA structures in more detail by cryo-TEM in the next set of experiments. Incubation of MxA at 25 °C resulted in the formation of ring-like structures (Fig. 2e) whereas at 4 °C MxA oligomerized into long filamentous structures with a diameter of about 10 nm and a length of about 500–1000 nm (Fig. 2d). The assembly of MxA into rings or long filaments was reversible. A shift to lower temperature led to the conversion of the ring structures into long filaments and vice versa (data not shown). Higher magnification of the cryo-TEM images revealed that the rings and filaments contained two parallel sets of electron-dense structures that together form the more compact structures (Fig. 2, f and g, arrowheads). These results support the recent model of two parallel chains of MxA molecules in the oligomer, based on the crystal structure of the MxA stalk region (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). MxA has been shown to associate with membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (17Stertz S. Reichelt M. Krijnse-Locker J. Mackenzie J. Simpson J.C. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006; 26: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and with liposomes in vitro (16Accola M.A. Huang B. Al Masri A. McNiven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21829-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To study association of MxA with lipid membranes, sedimentation assays in the absence and presence of liposomes were carried out (22Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Low salt concentrations led to accumulation of MxA into the pellet fraction, whereas at 300 mm salt buffer, MxA remained mostly in the supernatant (Fig. 3A). In the presence of liposomes, MxA co-sedimented with the liposomes even at 300 mm salt, suggesting an association with the lipid structures (Fig. 3B). This association was further studied by TEM (Fig. 3C). Clearly, MxA bound to spherical liposomes and transformed them into tubes with a diameter of about 50 nm (Fig. 3C, a and b). Evidently, the tubes were decorated by MxA in a highly ordered helical pattern as shown by cryo-TEM for MxA with TBL (Fig. 3Cc) as well as with PS at 100 mm (Fig. 3Cd) and 300 mm NaCl (Fig. 3Ce). Furthermore, MxA structures on the surface of lipid tubes strikingly resembled the dynamin oligomers formed under identical conditions (Fig. 3Cf). As in the case of dynamin, MxA shows protein concentration-dependent cooperative activation of GTP hydrolysis in solution (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For dynamin and dynamin-like proteins, it was shown previously that oligomerization on liposomes enhances GTP hydrolysis most likely by favoring intermolecular G domain-G domain contacts (15Chappie J.S. Acharya S. Leonard M. Schmid S.L. Dyda F. Nature. 2010; 465: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat.

Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 610-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, incubation of MxA with TBL liposomes did not result in enhanced GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 4A). To verify that this lack of stimulation was not an artifact of the assay system, control experiments were performed. Cross-linking of MxA by monoclonal antibody 2C12 but not antibody M143 (see Fig. 8a) is known to stimulate GTP hydrolysis (32Flohr F. Schneider-Schaulies S. Haller O. Kochs G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, incubation of MxA with the 2C12 antibody stimulated GTP hydrolysis about 3-fold as demonstrated by an increase of the turnover number from 31.2 ± 4.6 min−1 to 79.4 ± 18.9 min−1 (Fig. 4A). This increase is in the expected range (23Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Flohr F. Schneider-Schaulies S. Haller O. Kochs G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and demonstrates the intrinsic ability of MxA for enhanced GTP hydrolysis under the present assay conditions. Incubation of dynamin with liposomes led to about 20-fold increase of its GTPase activity (Fig. 4B). The basic GTP turnover number of 5.3 ± 0.6 min−1 of our dynamin preparation is in the range of previously published dynamin activities (18Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and is about 6-fold lower than the basal activity of MxA under identical assay conditions. The difference in the liposome-activated GTP hydrolysis between MxA and dynamin implies that the lipid-bound oligomeric structures of these two dynamin family members differ in an as yet unknown way.FIGURE 8Structural model of MxA oligomers associated with liposomes. a, linear structure of human MxA with the N-terminal G domain and the C-terminal part forming the stalk.

The same tubulation of liposomes was found with MxA(T103A), a mutant with a single amino acid exchange within the GTP-binding site that inactivates GTPase activity (33Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A, c and d). To clarify the orientation of the MxA monomers within these membrane-associated structures, we made use of two proteinase K cleavage sites in full-length MxA. The first cleavage occurs after an N-terminal asparagine at position 40. It removes the N-terminal His tag thereby reduces the molecular mass of the protein to 72 kDa (p72) (Fig. 5B). The second cleavage takes place after a C-terminal phenylalanine at position 563 in the L4 loop resulting in two fragments of 60 and 10 kDa (p60 and p10, respectively) (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Schwemmle M. Richter M.F. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

The full-length MxA and the p72 and p60 cleavage products were detected by the monoclonal antibody M143 recognizing a central epitope of MxA (see Fig. 8a) (32Flohr F. Schneider-Schaulies S. Haller O. Kochs G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Preincubation of MxA with TBL liposomes and subsequent incubation with proteinase K resulted in partial protection of the L4 loop from cleavage but did not prevent the loss of the His tag. Protection of the L4 cleavage site by lipid association could be reversed when the lipid bilayer was destroyed by Triton X-100 (Fig. 5C). Theoretically, protection from proteinase K digestion could be due to nonspecific oligomerization of MxA in the presence of lipid membranes rather than to lipid binding. To exclude this possibility, we took advantage of the fact that GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, promotes MxA oligomerization in the absence of lipid membranes (8Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the proteolytic digestion of L4 in the presence of GTPγS. Incubation with ATP and GDP were used as controls. GTPγS-induced oligomerization of MxA did not prevent proteinase K digestion, whereas preincubation with liposomes partially affected the cleavage of MxA, as expected (Fig. 5D)."
https://openalex.org/W2040824960,"To understand the role of the splice regulator muscleblind 1 (MBNL1) in the development of RNA splice defects in myotonic dystrophy I (DM1), we purified RNA-independent MBNL1 complexes from normal human myoblasts and examined the behavior of these complexes in DM1 myoblasts. Antibodies recognizing MBNL1 variants (MBNL1(CUG)), which can sequester in the toxic CUG RNA foci that develop in DM1 nuclei, were used to purify MBNL1(CUG) complexes from normal myoblasts. In normal myoblasts, MBNL1(CUG) bind 10 proteins involved in remodeling ribonucleoprotein complexes including hnRNP H, H2, H3, F, A2/B1, K, L, DDX5, DDX17, and DHX9. Of these proteins, only MBNL1(CUG) colocalizes extensively with DM1 CUG foci (>80% of foci) with its partners being present in <10% of foci. Importantly, the stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes is altered in DM1 myoblasts, demonstrating an increase in the steady state levels of nine of its partner proteins. These changes are recapitulated by the expression of expanded CUG repeat RNA in Cos7 cells. Altered stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes results from aberrant protein synthesis or stability and is unlinked to PKCα function. Modeling these changes in normal myoblasts demonstrates that increased levels of hnRNP H, H2, H3, F, and DDX5 independently dysregulate splicing in overlapping RNA subsets. Thus expression of expanded CUG repeats alters the stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes to allow both the reinforcement and expansion of RNA processing defects."
https://openalex.org/W1987632085,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate a potent immunostimulatory response. There is clear evidence that overactivation of TLRs leads to infectious and inflammatory diseases. Recent biochemical studies have shown that the membrane-bound form of ST2 (ST2L), a member of the Toll-like/IL-1 receptor superfamily, negatively regulates MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathways by sequestrating the adapters MyD88 and Mal (TIRAP). Specifically, ST2L attenuates the recruitment of Mal and MyD88 adapters to their receptors through its intracellular TIR domain. Thus, ST2L is a potent molecule that acts as a key regulator of endotoxin tolerance and modulates innate immunity. So far, the inhibitory mechanism of ST2L at the molecular level remains elusive. To develop a working hypothesis for the interactions between ST2L, TLRs (TLR1, 2, 4, and 6), and adapter molecules (MyD88 and Mal), we constructed three-dimensional models of the TIR domains of TLR4, 6, Mal, and ST2L based on homology modeling. Since the crystal structures of the TIR domains of TLR1, 2 as well as the NMR solution structure of MyD88 are known, we utilized these structures in our analysis. The TIR domains of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, MyD88, Mal and ST2L were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent environment. The refined structures obtained from the MD simulations were subsequently used in molecular docking studies to probe for potential sites of interactions. Through protein-protein docking analysis, models of the essential complexes involved in TLR2 and 4 signaling and ST2L inhibiting processes were developed. Our results suggest that ST2L may exert its inhibitory effect by blocking the molecular interface of Mal and MyD88 adapters mainly through its BB-loop region. Our predicted oligomeric signaling models may provide a basis for the understanding of the assembly process of TIR domain interactions, which has thus far proven to be difficult via in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W1993074359,"Proteasomal degradation is mediated through modification of target proteins by Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chain, which interacts with several binding partners in this pathway through hydrophobic surfaces on individual Ub units. However, the previously reported crystal structures of Lys-48-linked diUb exhibit a closed conformation with sequestered hydrophobic surfaces. NMR studies on mutated Lys-48-linked diUb indicated a pH-dependent conformational equilibrium between closed and open states with the predominance of the former under neutral conditions (90% at pH 6.8). To address the question of how Ub-binding proteins can efficiently access the sequestered hydrophobic surfaces of Ub chains, we revisited the conformational dynamics of Lys-48-linked diUb in solution using wild-type diUb and cyclic forms of diUb in which the Ub units are connected through two Lys-48-mediated isopeptide bonds. Our newly determined crystal structure of wild-type diUb showed an open conformation, whereas NMR analyses of cyclic Lys-48-linked diUb in solution revealed that its structure resembled the closed conformation observed in previous crystal structures. Comparison of a chemical shift of wild-type diUb with that of monomeric Ub and cyclic diUb, which mimic the open and closed states, respectively, with regard to the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to the solvent indicates that wild-type Lys-48-linked diUb in solution predominantly exhibits the open conformation (75% at pH 7.0), which becomes more populated upon lowering pH.

These Ub regulatory functions are expressed by its modification of target proteins through the formation of isopeptide linkages at the C terminus. Ubiquitination is catalyzed by the sequential action of the Ub-activating enzyme E1, Ub-conjugating enzyme E2, and Ub-protein ligase E3. The C-terminal group of Ub can also be linked to another Ub (termed the distal and proximal moieties, respectively) through all seven lysine residues at positions 6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48, and 63 as well as the N terminus, giving rise to various types of polyUb chains (3Baboshina O.V.

To investigate the sensitization prevalence and cross-reactivity of Api g 2 from celery stalks in a Mediterranean population and in a mouse model. Methodology 786 non-randomized subjects from Italy were screened for IgE reactivity to rApi g 2, rArt v 3 (mugwort pollen LTP) and nPru p 3 (peach LTP) using an allergen microarray. Clinical data of 32 selected patients with reactivity to LTP under investigation were evaluated. Specific IgE titers and cross-inhibitions were performed in ELISA and allergen microarray. Balb/c mice were immunized with purified LTPs; IgG titers were determined in ELISA and mediator release was examined using RBL-2H3 cells. Simulated endolysosomal digestion was performed using microsomes obtained from human DCs. Results IgE testing showed a sensitization prevalence of 25.6% to Api g 2, 18.6% to Art v 3, and 28.6% to Pru p 3 and frequent co-sensitization and correlating IgE-reactivity was observed. 10/32 patients suffering from LTP-related allergy reported symptoms upon consumption of celery stalks which mainly presented as OAS. Considerable IgE cross-reactivity was observed between Api g 2, Art v 3, and Pru p 3 with varying inhibition degrees of individual patients' sera. Simulating LTP mono-sensitization in a mouse model showed development of more congruent antibody specificities between Api g 2 and Art v 3. Notably, biologically relevant murine IgE cross-reactivity was restricted to the latter and diverse from Pru p 3 epitopes. Endolysosomal processing of LTP showed generation of similar clusters, which presumably represent T-cell peptides. Conclusions Api g 2 represents a relevant celery stalk allergen in the LTP-sensitized population. The molecule displays common B cell epitopes and endolysosomal peptides that encompass T cell epitopes with pollen and plant-food derived LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2086061191,"Trefoil factor (TFF) peptides are pivotal for gastric restitution after surface epithelial damage, but TFF cellular targets that promote cell migration are poorly understood. Conversely, Na/H exchangers (NHE) are often implicated in cellular migration but have a controversial role in gastric restitution. Using intravital microscopy to create microscopic lesions in the mouse gastric surface epithelium and directly measure epithelial restitution, we evaluated whether TFFs and NHE isoforms share a common pathway to promote epithelial repair. Blocking Na/H exchange (luminal 10 μm 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride or 25 μm HOE694) slows restitution 72-83% in wild-type or NHE1(-/-) mice. In contrast, HOE694 has no effect on the intrinsically defective gastric restitution in NHE2(-/-) mice or TFF2(-/-) mice. In TFF2(-/-) mice, NHE2 protein is reduced 23%, NHE2 remains localized to apical membranes of surface epithelium, and NHE1 protein amount or localization is unchanged. The action of topical rat TFF3 to accelerate restitution in TFF2(-/-) mice was inhibited by AMD3100 (CXCR4 receptor antagonist). Furthermore, rat TFF3 did not rescue restitution when NHE2 was inhibited [TFF2(-/-) mice +HOE694, or NHE2(-/-) mice]. HOE694 had no effect on pH at the juxtamucosal surface before or after damage. We conclude that functional NHE2, but not NHE1, is essential for mouse gastric epithelial restitution and that TFFs activate epithelial repair via NHE2."

However, most previous research has focused on analyzing single or only a few populations, and quantified isolated effects rather than handling multiple factors in conjunction. By using a multi-river mixed-effects model we estimated the effects of oceanic and river conditions, as well as human impacts, on year-to-year and between-river variability across 60 time series of recreational catch of one-sea-winter salmon (grilse) from Norwegian rivers over 29 years (1979-2007). Warm coastal temperatures at the time of smolt entrance into the sea and increased water discharge during upstream migration of mature fish were associated with higher rod catches of grilse. When hydropower stations were present in the course of the river systems the strength of the relationship with runoff was reduced. Catches of grilse in the river increased significantly following the reduction of the harvesting of this life-stage at sea. However, an average decreasing temporal trend was still detected and appeared to be stronger in the presence of salmon farms on the migration route of smolts in coastal/fjord areas. These results suggest that both ocean and freshwater conditions in conjunction with various human impacts contribute to shape interannual fluctuations and between-river variability of wild Atlantic salmon in Norwegian rivers. Current global change altering coastal temperature and water flow patterns might have implications for future grilse catches, moreover, positioning of aquaculture facilities as well as the implementation of hydropower schemes or other encroachments should be made with care when implementing management actions and searching for solutions to conserve this species."
https://openalex.org/W2024356608,"Regulation of epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC)-mediated transport in the distal nephron is a critical determinant of blood pressure in humans. Aldosterone via serum and glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) stimulates ENaC by phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which induces interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, the mechanisms of SGK1- and 14-3-3-mediated regulation of Nedd4-2 are unclear. There are three canonical SGK1 target sites on Nedd4-2 that overlap phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 interaction motifs. Two of these are termed ""minor,"" and one is termed ""major,"" based on weak or strong binding to 14-3-3 proteins, respectively. By mass spectrometry, we found that aldosterone significantly stimulates phosphorylation of a minor, relative to the major, 14-3-3 binding site on Nedd4-2. Phosphorylation-deficient minor site Nedd4-2 mutants bound less 14-3-3 than did wild-type (WT) Nedd4-2, and minor site Nedd4-2 mutations were sufficient to inhibit SGK1 stimulation of ENaC cell surface expression. As measured by pulse-chase and cycloheximide chase assays, a major binding site Nedd4-2 mutant had a shorter cellular half-life than WT Nedd4-2, but this property was not dependent on binding to 14-3-3. Additionally, a dimerization-deficient 14-3-3ε mutant failed to bind Nedd4-2. We conclude that whereas phosphorylation at the Nedd4-2 major site is important for interaction with 14-3-3 dimers, minor site phosphorylation by SGK1 may be the relevant molecular switch that stabilizes Nedd4-2 interaction with 14-3-3 and thus promotes ENaC cell surface expression. We also propose that major site phosphorylation promotes cellular Nedd4-2 protein stability, which potentially represents a novel form of regulation for turnover of E3 ubiquitin ligases."

Although several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been implicated in spine development and plasticity in hippocampal neurons, it is not known how many different Rho GEFs contribute to spine morphogenesis or how they coordinate the initiation, establishment, and maintenance of spines. In this study, we screened 70 rat Rho GEFs in cultured hippocampal neurons by RNA interference and identified a number of candidates that affected spine morphogenesis. Of these, Dock180, which plays a pivotal role in a variety of cellular processes including cell migration and phagocytosis, was further investigated. We show that depletion of Dock180 inhibits spine morphogenesis, whereas overexpression of Dock180 promotes spine morphogenesis. ELMO1, a protein necessary for in vivo functions of Dock180, functions in a complex with Dock180 in spine morphogenesis through activating the Rac GTPase.

Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which spine morphogenesis and plasticity are regulated is crucial to understanding how information is processed and stored in the brain and the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases.

There are 21 members of the family of Rho GTPases in mammals but nearly 80 Rho GEFs. These GEFs can be divided into two distinct subfamilies: Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domain-containing proteins and CDM (Ced-5, Dock180 and Myoblast city) and zizimin homology (CZH) proteins (13Meller N.

However, it is not known how many Rho GEFs play a role in spine morphogenesis or how the Rho GEFs coordinate the initiation, establishment, and maintenance of spines. Dock180, a prototype member of CDM and zizimin homology subfamily proteins, is an unconventional Rho GEF in that Dock180 is catalytically active toward Rac1 in cells only when it is in a complex with ELMO (24Brugnera E.

Despite the important functions of Dock180 in different types of cells in normal and pathological conditions, a role for Dock180 in spine morphogenesis has yet to be revealed. In this study, we screened an RNAi library consisting of 70 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting rat Rho GEFs and identified a number of candidate proteins that may be involved in spine morphogenesis. We show that Dock180 is required for spine formation and demonstrate that the RhoG/ELMO1/Dock180 signaling module plays a role in spine morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons.

Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 19 rat embryos as described previously (34Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 19 rat embryos, trypsinized, and triturated through a glass Pasteur pipette. Dissociated neurons were plated on glass coverslips coated with 1 mg ml−1 poly-l-lysine. After initial attachment, the coverslips were transferred to dishes containing a monolayer of glia cells. Cultures were grown in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). Neurons were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described (34Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cerebral cortical regions were isolated and dissociated with 0.25% (v/v) trypsin digestion and trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Six-well plates coated with 1% (w/v) poly-l-lysine were seeded with 1 × 106 cells. The cells were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 mm glutamine, and glucose. Lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA for Dock180, Elmo1, or RhoG were constructed by replacing the tetO-H1 promoter region in pLVTHM (Addgene plasmid 12247 (51Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar)) with the H1-shRNA cassette, bearing a BamHI and a ClaI site, from the pSuper-shRNA vectors. Lentiviral vectors expressing Dock180 or Elmo1 were constructed by inserting the Dock180 or Elmo1 cDNA into the NotI or BamHI/SpeI sites of pLV-Venus (35McCaffrey L.M. Macara I.G. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All vectors were verified by sequencing. Lentivirus production and titering were carried out as described previously (35McCaffrey L.M. Macara I.G. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using 293T cells. Hippocampal and cerebral cortical neurons cultured for 7 days were infected with the lentiviral vectors. The virus-containing medium was removed 2 h later and replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium. Three days after infection, the cultures were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. Hippocampal neurons infected with the Dock180- or ELMO1-expressing lentiviral vector were harvested with ice-cold lysis buffer. The whole cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST-PBD (p21-binding domain from PAK, for Rac1 and Cdc42) or GST-RBD (Rho-binding domain from Rhotekin, for RhoA) immobilized to GSH beads. Bound small GTPases were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, hippocampal neurons at DIV 10 were lysed by lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm. Cleared lysates were incubated with anti-Dock180 antibody (2 μg) or IgG (2 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (22Zhang H. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For endogenous immunostaining of Dock180 and ELMO1, hippocampal neurons were fixed in 1:1 methanol:acetone for 20 min at −20 °C. They were blocked using Roche Applied Science Western blocking reagent (diluted 1:10 in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. Neurons were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were incubated with the neurons at room temperature for 1 h. Neurons were then washed with PBS and mounted using VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). Hippocampal neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 15 min. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion lens, an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope with a 60× water immersion lens, or an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon TE-200) with a 60× water immersion lens (Plan Achromatic, NA 1.2) coupled to a CCD camera (Hamamatsu OrcaER), controlled by Openlab 5.0.1 software (Improvision, Boston, MA). Dendritic spines were defined as mushroom- or stubby-shaped protrusions contacted by presynaptic terminals. Filopodia were defined as long, thin protrusions without an enlarged spine head and not contacted by presynaptic terminals. Lamellipodia were defined as broad (width of >3 μm) protrusions. Lamellipodia were excluded in the spine head size quantifications. Spine density was measured by counting the number of spines on 15–20 neurons. Spine head size was measured using ImageJ. All experiments were repeated at least three times. A two-tailed, two-sample, unequal variance Student's t test was used to calculate the p values. The Rho GTPases are central regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, which is highly enriched in the spines. To identify potential regulators of spine morphogenesis, we generated a library of 70 shRNAs in pSUPER against the rat Rho family GEFs. A screen using the shRNA library revealed a number of interesting candidates (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1), including those known to be involved in spine morphogenesis, such as intersectin (16Irie F. Yamaguchi Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1117-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One of the candidate proteins was Dock180, which has been known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton through Rac1 for phagocytosis, cell migration, and neuronal polarization (26Gumienny T.L.

Nature. 2003; 424: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to investigate the role for Dock180 in spine morphogenesis. First, we examined Dock180 expression levels at different stages of neuronal development and found that the protein is expressed at all developmental stages examined (Fig. 1a), consistent with a role in neurite extension as well as synaptogenesis. We then examined the endogenous distribution of Dock180 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Dock180 accumulated in punctate structures that partially co-localize with the excitatory synaptic marker PSD-95 (Fig. 1b), further indicating a potential role in synaptogenesis. To explore a role for Dock180 in the morphogenesis of spines and synapses, we transfected hippocampal neurons with wild type Dock180 and dominant negative Dock180 (Dock180-ISP). Expression of Dock180-ISP significantly reduced spine density, whereas expression of WT Dock180 resulted in increased spine density (Fig. 1, c and d). In addition, overexpression of Dock180 resulted in the formation of many branched spines and lamellipodia-like protrusions. Quantification showed that 76% of the Dock180-overexpressing neurons form lamellipodia-like protrusions, which are defined as protrusions with a width of >3 μm. There was no significant effect of Dock180 overexpression on spine head size (Fig. 1e, lamellipodia-like structures are excluded in the quantification). Finally, the spines induced by Dock180 overexpression are apposed to presynaptic terminals, indicating that these spines are functional (Fig. 1f). To further confirm a role for Dock180 in dendritic spine morphogenesis, we constructed new shRNAs against different regions of the Dock180 gene. shRNA 2 caused a substantial decrease in endogenous Dock180 expression in Rat2 fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S2a) as well as neurons (Fig. 1g) and was used for subsequent experiments. Neurons transfected with shRNA 2 showed a dramatic reduction in spine density (Fig. 1, h and i), similar to the phenotype seen with our original screen. To verify that the phenotype observed was due specifically to the loss of Dock180, we constructed a Dock180 mutant (mtDock180) that harbors silent mutations, making it resistant to the shRNA construct. We then performed rescue experiments using this mtDock180. As seen in Fig. 1, h and i, mtDock180 was able to partially rescue the spine formation defect seen in the Dock180-depleted neurons, suggesting that the effect of the RNAi was specific. The binding of Dock180 to Rac1 is insufficient for GTP loading, and a Dock180-ELMO1 interaction is necessary to modulate actin cytoskeleton for phagocytosis and cell migration (24Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 26Gumienny T.L.

Cell. 2001; 107: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To address whether ELMO1 also plays a role in spine morphogenesis, we first examined the localization of endogenous ELMO1 in hippocampal neurons. As shown in Fig. 2a, endogenous ELMO1 localizes to punctate structures that co-localize with the excitatory synaptic marker PSD-95, indicating a possible role for ELMO1 in the formation of spines and their associated synapses. To see whether ELMO1 is required for spine morphogenesis, we constructed shRNAs against ELMO1 and tested their efficiency of knockdown in Rat2 fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S2b) and neurons (Fig. 2b). ELMO1 depletion inhibited spine formation to a similar level as the Dock180 shRNA (Fig. 2, c and d). However, in contrast to Dock180 knockdown, ELMO1 depletion caused the formation of filopodia-like protrusions (Fig. 2, c and d). This result suggests that ELMO1 does not exert its functions entirely through Dock180. To verify that the effect of the ELMO1 shRNA was specific, we performed rescue experiments in which we depleted endogenous ELMO1 using the shRNA construct and co-expressed mouse ELMO1 fused with GFP. Exogenously expressed GFP-ELMO1 was able to effectively rescue the defects caused by ELMO1 shRNA, showing that the observed defects were specifically due to the loss of ELMO1 (Fig. 2, c and d). Next, we asked whether ELMO1 and Dock180 interact with each other to regulate spine formation through Rac1 in hippocampal neurons. To answer this question, we examined the effect of various mutant and wild type ELMO1 constructs on spine morphogenesis (Fig. 3a). Overexpression of wild type ELMO1 caused an increase in spine density, similar to Dock180-overexpressing neurons (Fig. 3, b and c). ELMO1 overexpression also caused a small fraction of the spines to adopt a highly branched or lamellipodia-like shape, although the effect is not as dramatic as Dock180 overexpression. Quantification demonstrated that 31% of the ELMO-overexpressing neurons show lamellipodia-like protrusions, but there was no significant effect on the average spine head size when lamellipodia-like structures were excluded (Fig. 3d). Expression of an N-terminally deleted ELMO1 mutant (326–727) or an ARM1 mutant resulted in increased spine density, similar to overexpression of wild type ELMO1 (Fig. 3, b and c). By contrast, a C-terminally truncated ELMO1 mutant (1–280) clearly inhibited dendritic spine formation (Fig. 3, b and c). We observed a similar phenotype with a longer ELMO1 (1–558) mutant lacking the C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and proline-rich motif (data not shown). These results suggest that the C terminus of ELMO1 is necessary for activation of Dock180 in hippocampal neurons, which is consistent with previous studies reporting that the C terminus of ELMO1 mediates the interaction with Dock180 and is required for the ELMO1/Dock180 complex to function in phagocytosis and cell migration (39Komander D.

Immunostaining for the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 confirmed that these spines are apposed to presynaptic terminals, showing that ELMO1-induced spines bear synapses (Fig. 3e). ELMO1 and Dock180 function as a complex in various cellular processes. To confirm that they form an endogenous complex in hippocampal neurons, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from cultured hippocampal neurons. ELMO1 was specifically detected in Dock180 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4a), showing that they form a complex in these neurons. The ELMO1/Dock180 complex functions through Rac1 in various cellular contexts including migration and phagocytosis (33Grimsley C.M. Kinchen J.M. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Brugnera E. Haney L.B. Lu M.

To see whether this complex functions through Rac1 in hippocampal neurons, we used lentivirus to overexpress ELMO1 and Dock180 in hippocampal neurons and examined the activation of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, using GST pulldown assays. As seen in Fig. 4b, we observed a significant increase in the activation of Rac1, but no detectable activation of RhoA and Cdc42 in neurons overexpressing ELMO1 and Dock180. These data suggest that ELMO1 and Dock180 function through the Rac1 GTPase in hippocampal neurons. To further confirm that Dock180 and ELMO1 function through Rac in regulating spine morphogenesis, we co-expressed a dominant negative Rac, RacN17, with either ELMO or Dock180. RacN17 reversed the phenotype of ELMO1 and Dock180 overexpression (Fig. 4, c–f), further showing that the ELMO/Dock180 complex functions through Rac in spine morphogenesis.

However, it was also reported that RhoG is dispensable for cell spreading and migration and could induce membrane ruffling via both Rac-dependent and Rac-independent pathways (46Meller J. Vidali L. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoG promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation and regulates anoikis not through interaction with ELMO, but through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism (47Fujimoto S. Negishi M. Katoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4941-4950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yamaki N. Negishi M. Katoh H. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2821-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RhoG is part of the ELMO/Dock180 module that functions in spine morphogenesis, we first examined the expression levels of RhoG and ELMO1 at different developmental stages. Both RhoG and ELMO1 are expressed at low levels during neurite extension, but their levels significantly increased during the synaptogenesis period (Fig. 5a), consistent with a function in synaptogenesis. To investigate whether they form an endogenous complex in hippocampal neurons, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from cultured hippocampal neurons. ELMO1 was specifically detected in RhoG immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5b), showing that they form a complex in these neurons. To explore the role of endogenous RhoG in this process, we designed shRNA constructs to deplete RhoG in hippocampal neurons. As seen in Fig. 5c, the shRNA construct was able to significantly reduce RhoG expression in neurons. Neurons transfected with RhoG shRNA showed dramatically reduced spine density, similar to Dock180-depleted neurons (Fig. 5, d and e). This defect was partially rescued by co-expressing a mutant RhoG that is resistant to the shRNA construct (Fig. 5, d and e, and supplemental Fig. S2c), indicating that the effect was specific. To further analyze the effects of RhoG in spine morphogenesis, we expressed WT RhoG, constitutively active RhoG-Q61L, and dominant negative RhoG-T17N in hippocampal neurons. The ectopic expression of RhoG-Q61L increased spine density (Fig. 6, a and b) as well as spine head size (Fig. 6c). There was also an increase in abnormally shaped spines. By contrast, overexpression of RhoG-T17N inhibited normal spine formation (Fig. 6, a and b). The spines induced by RhoG Q61L overexpression are apposed to presynaptic terminals (Fig. 6d), indicating that these spines are functional. We conclude, therefore, that RhoG functions to promote spine morphogenesis. RhoG has been shown to have both Rac-dependent and Rac-independent functions (46Meller J. Vidali L. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 47Fujimoto S. Negishi M. Katoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4941-4950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yamaki N. Negishi M. Katoh H. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2821-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoG functions through ELMO1/Dock180/Rac in spine morphogenesis, we depleted ELMO1 in the context of the constitutively active RhoG-Q61L. As seen in Fig. 7, a and b, we were able to reverse the RhoG-Q61L phenotype by depleting ELMO1. In addition, overexpression of ELMO1 was able to rescue the defects caused by RhoG depletion (Fig. 7, c and d). Finally, RacN17 was able to reverse the phenotype induced by RhoG Q61L (Fig. 7, e and f). Taken together, these results argue that RhoG functions upstream of ELMO1/Dock180/Rac in spine morphogenesis. Our data reveal a signaling module, consisting of RhoG, ELMO1, and Dock180, which functions in spine morphogenesis. The ELMO1/Dock180 complex has been shown to regulate a number of Rac-dependent processes including cell migration and phagocytosis (24Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 26Gumienny T.L. Brugnera E. Tosello-Trampont A.C.

Cell. 2001; 107: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, RhoG has been shown to function in both a Rac-dependent and a Rac-independent manner (46Meller J. Vidali L. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we identify a novel function for ELMO1/Dock180 in regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis and show that RhoG functions upstream of this process. Our domain analysis shows that the C terminus of ELMO1, which mediates the interaction with Dock180, is sufficient to promote spine morphogenesis. This indicates that ELMO1 functions through regulating Dock180 in this process. Furthermore, the N terminus of ELMO1, which mediates the interaction with active RhoG, caused a reduction in spine density. This suggests that the N terminus of ELMO1 functions as a dominant negative by binding RhoG but preventing the downstream activation of Dock180 and Rac. Taken together, these data suggest that RhoG, ELMO1, and Dock180 function as a signaling module to regulate spine morphogenesis, with RhoG being upstream of the ELMO1/Dock180 complex. Interestingly, we observed reproducible differences in phenotypes in RhoG- or ELMO1-depleted versus Dock180-depleted neurons. For example, ELMO1 depletion caused a reduction in spine number along with the formation of filopodia-like protrusions; however, we did not observe filopodia-like protrusions in RhoG- or Dock180-depleted neurons. In addition, Dock180 knockdown caused a reduction in spine density as well as in dendrite branching, whereas RhoG or ELMO1 depletion did not have any effect on dendrite branching (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, it is likely that the separate components of this signaling module are each involved in additional pathways. This is consistent with our finding that Dock180 and RhoG/ELMO1 exhibit differential developmental expression profiles (Figs. 1c and 4a). Our results show that activating RhoG caused an enlargement of the spine head (Fig. 6c), whereas overexpression of ELMO1 and Dock180 caused the formation of lamellipodia-like protrusions, without changing the size of the remaining spines (Figs. 1e and 3d). It is likely that RhoG Q61L caused downstream activation of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180, which are correctly localized to dendritic spines. Thus, activation of RhoG would cause local activation of Rac in the dendritic spines, leading to spine head enlargement. By contrast, overexpression of ELMO1 and Dock180 would cause a fraction of the proteins to mislocalize outside the spines, leading to more global activation of Rac and the formation of lamellipodia-like structures. The morphogenesis and plasticity of dendritic spines are critical for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. It is generally believed that activity-dependent spine structural plasticity plays an important role in memory processes; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Thus, it would be of great interest to elucidate the upstream regulators of the RhoG/ELMO1/Dock180 module. Possible candidates include neurotransmitter receptors and other cell surface receptors. Further investigation into the upstream pathways will shed more light on the function of this module in spine morphogenesis and potentially activity-dependent structural plasticity of spines. Our finding of a role for the RhoG/ELMO1/Dock180 complex in dendritic spine morphogenesis adds to the ever growing network of signaling molecules that function in this process. Several other Rho family GEFs are also known to be involved in spine morphogenesis. These include Kalirin-7, β-PIX (p21-activated kinase [PAK]-interacting exchange factor), Tiam1, intersectin, and GEFT (15Bryan B. Kumar V. Stafford L.J. Cai Y. Wu G. Liu M. J. Biol.

Further studies are needed to examine the role of these Rho GEFs in different brain regions and types of neurons, as well as different stages of neuronal development. Within the same neuron, these Rho GEFs are likely involved in the spatial and temporal regulations of Rho GTPase activity. Consistent with this, highly localized Rho GTPase activation has been recently observed in hippocampal neurons (23Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Niu S. Horwitz A.F. J.

Science. 2007; 315: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Following this analysis, a surface proteome for T. vaginalis was generated, which verified localization of several membrane proteins predicted by the genome, identified other T. vaginalis surface protein families, and identified several unique hypothetical proteins that are found on the surface of T. vaginalis (13de Miguel N.

Along with surface proteins, several groups have examined the role of surface carbohydrates in the adhesion of T. vaginalis to human cells. Early experiments demonstrated that more virulent strains of T. vaginalis bound more strongly to soybean agglutinin than less adherent strains (17Warton A. Honigberg B.M. J.

Furthermore, treatment of T. vaginalis with glycosidases or periodate reduced binding of the parasite to epithelial cells (20Warton A. Kon V.B. Papadimitriou J.M. J.

These data implicated surface carbohydrates in adhesion of T. vaginalis, prompting isolation of the most abundant surface glycoconjugate from the parasite, which was described as a lipophosphoglycan (LPG) 4The abbreviations used are: LPGlipophosphoglycanTvLGT. vaginalis lipoglycandH2Odistilled H2OHFhydrofluoric acidGal-olgalactitolGlcNAc-olN-acetylglucosaminitolLacNAcN-acetyllactosamineLNBlacto-N-biose. because of its similarities to Leishmania LPGs (22Singh B.N.

Research on this LPG-like molecule has revealed a role in adhesion and immune interaction. In regard to adhesion, the isolated LPG-like material has been shown to inhibit binding of T. vaginalis to multiple human cell lines (24Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect.

Immun. 2006; 74: 5773-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, parasites with truncated LPG-like molecules have reduced binding to vaginal epithelial cells, and their LPG-like glycans have lost the ability to compete parasite binding to host cells (25Bastida-Corcuera F.D. Okumura C.Y. Colocoussi A. Johnson P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, galectin-1 has been shown to be the host cell receptor that binds the T. vaginalis LPG-like molecule (27Okumura C.Y. Baum L.G. Johnson P.J. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although there is no direct evidence that LPG-galectin-1 interaction alters protein expression in the host cell, exposure of vaginal epithelial cells to purified T. vaginalis LPG-like molecules results in an increase in IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α expression (26Fichorova R.N.

T. vaginalis LPG-like molecules also activate nuclear factor-κB and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (28Singh B.N. Hayes G.R. Lucas J.J. Sommer U. Viseux N. Mirgorodskaya E. Trifonova R.T.

These data suggest that T. vaginalis LPG-like glycan plays an important role in attachment of the parasite to the host and modulation of host cell gene expression. lipophosphoglycan T. vaginalis lipoglycan distilled H2O hydrofluoric acid galactitol N-acetylglucosaminitol N-acetyllactosamine lacto-N-biose. Despite its variety of functions, the structure of the T. vaginalis LPG-like material is incompletely described. The LPG structure from Leishmania, upon which the T. vaginalis LPG-like material tends to have been modeled, is that of a glycoinositol phospholipid core of Galα1–6Galα1–3Galfβ1–3(±Glcα1-6)Manα1–3Manα1–4GlcNα1–6myo-inositol-1-P-sn-1-alkyl-2-lyso-glycerol attached through the 6-position of the non-reducing terminal Gal residue to several (from 10 to 30) phosphosaccharide repeats of -6Galβ1–4Manα1-P- (that can be substituted at the 3-position of the Gal residue with various carbohydrate side chains) and finally capped with di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides (29McConville M.J.

The GlcNα1–6myo-inositol-1-P-lipid motifs of the Leishmania LPGs further define them as members of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol superfamily of eukaryotic glycophospholipids (30McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The pioneering work of Singh and colleagues (32Singh B.N. Beach D.H. Lindmark D.G. Costello C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Costello C.E. Glushka J. van Halbeek H. Singh B.N. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) clearly shows that the T. vaginalis LPG-like material has similarities to Leishmania LPGs (i.e. it is based on an inositol phospholipid (in this case an inositol phosphoceramide), it is devoid of protein components, and it is rich in carbohydrate). However, there are also significant differences in composition, with the T. vaginalis LPG-like material containing little or no mannose but containing other sugars that are absent from Leishmania LPGs, like N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), xylose (Xyl) and rhamnose (Rha) (23Singh B.N. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 152-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Bastida-Corcuera F.D. Okumura C.Y. Colocoussi A. Johnson P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, Singh and colleagues (21Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) defined a significant structural feature for the T. vaginalis LPG-like material by showing that it contains N-acetyllactosamine (-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-), LacNAc, repeats. These authors further proposed the current model of T. vaginalis LPG-like molecule as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-based structure containing GlcN-inositol phosphoceramide and at least two domains separated by an acid-labile region. In this paper, we test parts of this model and provide additional structural information on this extremely complex molecule. Furthermore, we utilize our structural information to identify portions of the molecule that mediate adherence to host cells. T. vaginalis strain B7RC2 was grown in TYM medium as described previously (34Clark C.G. Diamond L.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The human ectocervical cell line Ect1 E6/E7 (CRL 2614) was grown in Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) as described previously (35Fichorova R.N. Rheinwald J.G. Anderson D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TvLG was extracted from T. vaginalis utilizing an extraction procedure developed for purification of Leishmania major LPG with minor alterations (36McConville M.J. Bacic A. Mitchell G.F. Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Parasites were washed and resuspended at 2 × 109 cells/ml in dH2O and then mixed with methanol and chloroform to a final water/methanol/chloroform ratio of 0.8:2:1. The mixture was sonicated, incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and then centrifuged. The pellet was extracted with water, methanol, and chloroform at the same ratios as above, recollected by centrifugation, and dried under N2. This delipidated pellet was extracted by resuspension in 9% 1-propanol in 100 mm ammonium acetate, sonication, and a 2-h incubation at room temperature. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation, pooled, and incubated with 2.5 μg/ml proteinase K at room temperature for 24 h. Samples were then subjected to octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography using a gradient from 5% 1-propanol in 100 mm ammonium acetate to 70% 1-propanol. The eluate fraction containing TvLG was determined by spotting on a HPTLC plate and staining with orcinol reagent. TvLG was also visualized by separation on SDS-PAGE and staining with Schiff reagent or Stains-All. For adherence assays, TvLG was isolated using the method described in Bastida-Corcuera et al. (25Bastida-Corcuera F.D. Okumura C.Y. Colocoussi A. Johnson P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the final extraction and dialysis of TvLG, the sample was lyophilized, suspended in 5% 1-propanol in 100 mm ammonium acetate, and loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column. After washing, TvLG was eluted with 45% 1-propanol and lyophilized. Dried TvLG was suspended in dH2O, and size and lack of protein were confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed with periodic acid-Schiff staining and silver staining, respectively. Monosaccharide composition analysis was then performed as described below. The monosaccharide composition of TvLG was determined using methanolysis, TMS derivatization, and GC-MS as described by Ferguson (37Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Lipid Modifications of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-230Google Scholar). TvLG was dried in a capillary tube with a known amount of scyllo-inositol internal standard then suspended in methanol and redried. The samples were then methanolyzed, under vacuum, with 0.5 m HCl in dry methanol at 80 °C for 4 h. In addition, a known mixture of monosaccharides and scyllo-inositol was used as an external sugar standard to compare the response factors of the different monosaccharides in the assay. After cooling and opening the tubes, the samples were neutralized with pyridine, and any N-acetylated sugars were re-N-acetylated by adding acetic anhydride, and then the samples were dried and redried from methanol in a SpeedVac. The resulting methyl glycosides were trimethylsilylated with a pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/chlorotrimethlysilane mixture (10:3:1). The TMS-derivatized samples were analyzed by GC-MS on an HP-5 column (Agilent). For GC-MS, the splitless injector was held at 280 °C, and the initial oven temperature was 80 °C. The main part of the GC oven gradient was 140–250 °C at 5 °C/min, that temperature being held for 10 min. At the end of the run, the temperature was ramped to the final temperature of 280 °C. The GC-MS interface was held throughout the program at 280 °C. Material was detected by electron impact ionization using total ion scanning from m/z 40 to 500. h at 4 °C. Acid was removed by freeze drying the samples and redrying four times from dH2O. Hydrolyzed samples were reduced with 0.5 m NaBD4 for 12 h at 4 °C. The reductant was inactivated by the addition of 1 m acetic acid until reactivity ceased. The reduced samples were desalted by application to an AG50 column and then dried. These samples were washed and dried by successive washes with methanol in 1% acetic acid, methanol, and then toluene. This material was analyzed along with alditol standards using GC-MS as described for monosaccharide composition analysis. Phosphate content of TvLG was determined using BIOMOL green (Enzo Life Sciences). TvLG was dried in acid-washed vials and hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 h in sealed tubes. The hydrolysis products were dried by SpeedVac, suspended in dH2O, and transferred to a 96-well plate. Samples and standard curve containing supplied phosphate standard were then exposed to a 2× volume of BIOMOL green at room temperature for 20 min. Absorbance was measured at 620 nm, and the concentration of phosphate in TvLG was determined utilizing the standard curve. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired on dephosphorylated TvLG after exchange into 2H2O using a Bruker spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 300 K. The carbohydrate spin systems were assigned from two-dimensional COSY and TOCSY 1H spectra acquired at 303 K on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 800 MHz for 1H. Two TOCSY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 60 and 120 ms. The TvLG sample used in these experiments was repurified on octyl-Sepharose after further digestion with β-hexosaminidase and β-galactosidase. The linkages between monosaccharides in TvLG were determined as previously described (37Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Lipid Modifications of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-230Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, TvLG was suspended in a slurry of NaOH in DMSO and then methylated by three successive treatments with methyl iodide. Chloroform and aqueous sodium thiosulfate were added to inactivate the methyl iodide, and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed four times with dH2O and dried. The sample was then hydrolyzed with H2SO4 in acetic acid for 4 h at 80 °C. Samples were cooled then neutralized with methanolic NaOH. To reduce these methylated monosaccharides, hydrolyzed products were dissolved in NH4OH (with scyllo-inositol as an internal standard) at room temperature for at least 12 h with NaBD4. Reductant was destroyed through the addition of acetic acid. Samples were dried, and these partially methylated alditols were acetylated by incubation with acetic anhydride followed by extraction with dichloromethane and water. The organic phase was extracted and concentrated under N2 and then analyzed by GC-MS on an HP-5 column using the conditions described for monosaccharide analysis. Mild TFA treatment to determine the extent of phosphorylation in TvLG was carried out by drying TvLG and then incubating in 40 mm TFA for 10 min at 100 °C. The sample was dried again and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column. The monosaccharide composition of unbound, wash, and bound fractions was determined as described above. For analysis by MALDI-TOF or ESI-MS/MS, TvLG was treated with 0.1 m TFA for 40 min or 1 h at 100 °C. Samples were then treated for analysis by mass spectrometry or reduced to identify reducing and non-reducing ends on the TFA fragments. For reduction, TFA-digested TvLG was incubated in 0.25 m NaBD4 for 12 h at 4 °C. The reductant was destroyed by the addition of 1 m acetic acid, and the reaction was applied to an AG50 column to desalt. Eluted fractions were lyophilized and then co-evaporated three times with 2% acetic acid in methanol, three times with methanol, and twice with toluene. Samples were then treated for use in mass spectrometry. The positive ion MALDI mass spectrum of native TvLG glycoconjugate was collected in linear mode on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR instrument using dihydroxybenzoic acid at 10 mg/ml in 0.1% TFA. Samples were mixed with matrix in a 1:1 ratio and then applied to the plate and dried. The accelerating voltage was 20,000 V, the extraction time was 600 ns, and the laser intensity was 2252 V. Data from 500 laser shots was averaged over a mass range of 1000–50,000 Da. TFA-digested TvLG, with or without reduction, was permethylated prior to analysis by mass spectrometry as described previously (36McConville M.J. Bacic A. Mitchell G.F. Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, the treated TvLG samples were dried in an acid-washed vial, redried from methanol, and then suspended in 50 μl of DMSO. A slurry of NaOH in DMSO (120 mg/ml) was prepared, and 50 μl was added to each vial, and after 20 min, 10 μl of methyl iodide was also added. A further addition of 10 μl of methyl iodide was made after 10 min, and then a final addition of 20 μl was added after another 10 min. 20 min after the final addition of methyl iodide, the permethylated glycans were recovered, and the methyl iodide was inactivated by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform and 1 ml of 100 mg/ml sodium thiosulfate. After thorough mixing, the phases were separated, and the lower (CHCl3) phase was extracted and washed five times with dH2O and then dried. For MALDI-TOF analysis, the hydrolyzed permethylated TvLG was mixed 1:1 with dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix, as above. These samples were analyzed in the positive reflectron mode on the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer as above but using a mass range of 500–8000 Da. For electrospray mass spectrometry, samples were permethylated and dried as described above and then resuspended in 80% acetonitrile and mixed with an equal volume of 1 mm sodium acetate in 80% acetonitrile. The mixture was loaded into a nanotip (Micromass type F) and analyzed by positive ion ESI-MS on a Q-Star XL instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Analyst software. For enzymatic digestion, TvLG was incubated with 0.5 unit of β-galactosidase (bovine testes; Sigma), 15 units of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (New England Biolabs), or a combination of the two at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5. For mock treatment, equivalent amounts of TvLG, as used in digestion reactions, were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in buffer only. Following digestion or mock treatment, the reaction was applied to an octyl-Sepharose column and washed with 5% 1-propanol, 100 mm ammonium acetate. TvLG was then eluted from the column by application of 45% 1-propanol. The eluted fraction was dried before additional treatment or analysis. Digest with α-galactosidase (10 units) was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 5.5. Following each digestion, the reactions were applied to an octyl-Sepharose column and eluted as described above. The eluted fraction was then utilized for the next digest. Smith degradation was carried out using a revised version of the protocol outlined by Abdel Aker et al. (38Abdel Akher M. Cadotte J.E. Montgomery R. Smith F. Vancleve J.W. Lewis B.A. Nature. 1953; 171: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). TvLG in dH2O was added to an equal volume of 400 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% 1-propanol, 60 mm sodium periodate. This mixture was incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 72 h. Ethylene glycol was added to the solution, and this reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by room temperature for 30 min. The products were then reduced by the addition of 1 m NaBD4 in 1 m NaOH for 12 h at 4 °C. The reductant was eliminated by the addition of 2 m acetic acid. The reaction was then applied to an octyl-Sepharose column and eluted by the addition of 45% 1-propanol after several washes of 5% 1-propanol. The eluted fraction was dried, dissolved in 0.5 m TFA, and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. The samples were dried again prior to further analysis or treatment. Control samples of TvLG were also subjected to mild acid treatment with 0.5 m TFA for 24 h at 30 °C. Human ectocervical cell line Ect1/E6E7 was grown as described (25Bastida-Corcuera F.D. Okumura C.Y. Colocoussi A. Johnson P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Fichorova R.N. Rheinwald J.G. Anderson D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For adherence assays, cells were grown on 12-mm coverslips in 24-well plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until confluent. Adherence assays were carried out as described by Bastida-Corcuera et al. (25Bastida-Corcuera F.D. Okumura C.Y. Colocoussi A. Johnson P.J. Eukaryot.

Ectocervical cells grown on coverslips were washed with complemented Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h with 0.64 μm mock-digested TvLG or TvLG digested with β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. Because the total amount of rhamnose should not change upon digest, concentration of both digested and mock-treated TvLG was determined by extrapolating the molarity of the total molecule from the exper"
https://openalex.org/W2005954219,"Myocardial differentiation is associated with the activation and expression of an array of cardiac specific genes. However, the transcriptional networks that control cardiac gene expression are not completely understood. Myocardin is a cardiac and smooth muscle-specific expressed transcriptional coactivator of Serum Response Factor (SRF) and is able to potently activate cardiac and smooth muscle gene expression during development. We hypothesize that myocardin discriminates between cardiac and smooth muscle specific genes by associating with distinct co-factors. Here, we show that myocardin directly interacts with Tbx5, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors involved in the Holt-Oram syndrome. Tbx5 synergizes with myocardin to activate expression of the cardiac specific genes atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and alpha myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), but not that of smooth muscle specific genes SM22 or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC). We found that this synergistic activation of shared target genes is dependent on the binding sites for Tbx5, T-box factor-Binding Elements (TBEs). Myocardin and Tbx5 physically interact and their interaction domains were mapped to the basic domain and the coil domain of myocardin and Tbx5, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates that the Tbx5G80R mutation, which leads to the Holt-Oram syndrome in humans, failed to synergize with myocardin to activate cardiac gene expression. These data uncover a key role for Tbx5 and myocardin in establishing the transcriptional foundation for cardiac gene activation and suggest that the interaction of myocardin and Tbx5 maybe involved in cardiac development and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2054099630,"The CD1 family consists of five proteins that are related to the peptide-presenting MHC class I family. T cells can recognize the presentation of both foreign and self-derived lipids on four CD1 family members. The identities of the self-lipids capable of stimulating autoreactive T cell responses remain elusive or controversial. Here, we employed mass spectrometry to analyze the lipid content of highly purified CD1c and CD1d protein samples. We report the identification of 11 novel self-lipids presented by CD1c and nine by CD1d. Rigorous controls provide strong evidence that the identified lipids were specifically loaded into the lipid-binding site of the CD1 molecules. The diverse but distinct population of lipids identified from each CD1 family member implies each present a different subset of self-lipids, and the enrichment of particular motifs indicates that the lipids that are presented by CD1 family members could be predicted. Finally, our results imply the CD1 system surveys the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and/or secretory compartments, in addition to its well characterized surveillance of the endocytic and lysosomal compartments."

https://openalex.org/W2062289824,"Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyzes reversible conversion between glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate using NAD(P)(H) as a coenzyme. Although mammalian GDH is regulated by GTP through the antenna domain, little is known about the mechanism of allosteric activation by leucine. An extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus, possesses GDH with a unique subunit configuration composed of two different subunits, GdhA (regulatory subunit) and GdhB (catalytic subunit). T. thermophilus GDH is unique in that the enzyme is subject to allosteric activation by leucine. To elucidate the structural basis for leucine-induced allosteric activation of GDH, we determined the crystal structures of the GdhB-Glu and GdhA-GdhB-Leu complexes at 2.1 and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively. The GdhB-Glu complex is a hexamer that binds 12 glutamate molecules: six molecules are bound at the substrate-binding sites, and the remaining six are bound at subunit interfaces, each composed of three subunits. The GdhA-GdhB-Leu complex is crystallized as a heterohexamer composed of four GdhA subunits and two GdhB subunits. In this complex, six leucine molecules are bound at subunit interfaces identified as glutamate-binding sites in the GdhB-Glu complex. Consistent with the structure, replacement of the amino acid residues of T. thermophilus GDH responsible for leucine binding made T. thermophilus GDH insensitive to leucine. Equivalent amino acid replacement caused a similar loss of sensitivity to leucine in human GDH2, suggesting that human GDH2 also uses the same allosteric site for regulation by leucine."
https://openalex.org/W1976099423,"Metastatic melanoma has poor prognosis and is refractory to most conventional chemotherapies. The alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is commonly used in treating melanoma but has a disappointing response rate. Agents that can act cooperatively with TMZ and improve its efficacy are thus highly sought after. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737, which can induce apoptosis by targeting pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, has been found to enhance the efficacy of many conventional chemotherapeutic agents in multiple cancers. We found that combining TMZ and ABT-737 induced strong synergistic apoptosis in multiple human melanoma cell lines. When the drugs were used in combination in a mouse xenograft model, they drastically reduced tumor growth at concentrations where each individual drug had no significant effect. We found that TMZ treatment elevated p53 levels, and that the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa was elevated in TMZ/ABT-737 treated cells. Experiments with shRNA demonstrated that the synergistic effect of TMZ and ABT-737 was largely dependent on Noxa. Experiments with nutlin-3, a p53 inducer, demonstrated that p53 induction was sufficient for synergistic cell death with ABT-737 in a Noxa-dependent fashion. However, p53 was not necessary for TMZ/ABT-737 synergy as demonstrated by a p53-null line, indicating that TMZ and ABT-737 together induce Noxa in a p53-independent fashion. These results demonstrate that targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members is a promising method for treating metastatic melanoma, and that clinical trials with TMZ and Bcl-2 inhibitors are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2168390241,"Genome-wide analysis has documented differential gene expression between closely related species in plants and animals and nonadditive gene expression in hybrids and allopolyploids compared to the parents. In Arabidopsis, 15–43% of genes are expressed differently between the related species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, the majority of which are nonadditively expressed (differently from mid-parent value) in allotetraploids. Nonadditive gene expression can be caused by transcriptional regulation through chromatin modifications, but the role of posttranscriptional regulation in nonadditive gene expression is largely unknown. Here we reported genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay in resynthesized Arabidopsis allotetraploids. Among ∼26,000 annotated genes, over 1% of gene transcripts showed rapid decay with an estimated half-life of less than 60 minutes, and they are called allotetraploid genes with unstable transcripts (AlloGUTs). Remarkably, 30% of alloGUTs matched the nonadditively expressed genes, and their expression levels were negatively correlated with the decay rate. Compared to all genes, these nonadditively expressed alloGUTs were overrepresented 2-6-fold in the Gene Ontology (GOSlim) classifications in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, signal transduction, and transcription. Interestingly, the AlloGUTs include transcription factor genes that are highly inducible under stress conditions and circadian clock regulators that regulate growth in A. thaliana. These data suggest a role of mRNA stability in homoeologous gene expression in Arabidopsis allopolyploids. The enrichment of nonadditively expressed genes in stress-related pathways were commonly observed in Arabidopsis and other allopolyploids such as wheat and cotton, which may suggest a role for stress-mediated growth vigor in hybrids and allopolyploids."

Binding to LPS induces structural changes in cell-free Hb, which activates the redox activity of the protein for the generation of microbicidal free radicals. Although the interaction between Hb and LPS has implications for innate immune defense, the precise LPS-interaction sites on Hb remain unknown. Using surface plasmon resonance, we found that both the Hb α and β subunits possess high affinity LPS-binding sites, with KD in the nanomolar range. In silico analysis of Hb including phospho-group binding site prediction, structure-based sequence comparison, and docking to model the protein-ligand interactions showed that Hb possesses evolutionarily conserved surface cationic patches that could function as potential LPS-binding sites. Synthetic Hb peptides harboring predicted LPS-binding sites served to validate the computational predictions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis differentiated LPS-binding peptides from non-binders. Binding of the peptides to lipid A was further substantiated by a fluorescent probe displacement assay. The LPS-binding peptides effectively neutralized the endotoxicity of LPS in vitro. Additionally, peptide B59 spanning residues 59–95 of Hbβ attached to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria as shown by flow cytometry and visualized by immunogold-labeled scanning electron microscopy. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Hb subunits further confirmed the function of the predicted residues in binding to LPS.

https://openalex.org/W2009621169,"The mutants Mut5 and Mut5CC from a psychrophilic α-amylase bear representative stabilizing interactions found in the heat-stable porcine pancreatic α-amylase but lacking in the cold-active enzyme from an Antarctic bacterium. From an evolutionary perspective, these mutants can be regarded as structural intermediates between the psychrophilic and the mesophilic enzymes. We found that these engineered interactions improve all the investigated parameters related to protein stability as follows: compactness; kinetically driven stability; thermodynamic stability; resistance toward chemical denaturation, and the kinetics of unfolding/refolding. Concomitantly to this improved stability, both mutants have lost the kinetic optimization to low temperature activity displayed by the parent psychrophilic enzyme. These results provide strong experimental support to the hypothesis assuming that the disappearance of stabilizing interactions in psychrophilic enzymes increases the amplitude of concerted motions required by catalysis and the dynamics of active site residues at low temperature, leading to a higher activity."
https://openalex.org/W2038104245,"Original antigenic sin is the phenomenon in which prior exposure to an antigen leads to a subsequent suboptimal immune response to a related antigen. Immune memory normally allows for an improved and rapid response to antigens previously seen and is the mechanism by which vaccination works. I here develop a dynamical system model of the mechanism of original antigenic sin in influenza, clarifying and explaining the detailed spin-glass treatment of original antigenic sin. The dynamical system describes the viral load, the quantities of healthy and infected epithelial cells, the concentrations of naïve and memory antibodies, and the affinities of naïve and memory antibodies. I give explicit correspondences between the microscopic variables of the spin-glass model and those of the present dynamical system model. The dynamical system model reproduces the phenomenon of original antigenic sin and describes how a competition between different types of B cells compromises the overall effect of immune response. I illustrate the competition between the naïve and the memory antibodies as a function of the antigenic distance between the initial and subsequent antigens. The suboptimal immune response caused by original antigenic sin is observed when the host is exposed to an antigen which has intermediate antigenic distance to a second antigen previously recognized by the host's immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1976626198,"Recent evidence indicates that zinc plays a major role in neurochemistry. Of the many zinc-binding proteins, metallothionein-3 (Mt3) is regarded as one of the major regulators of cellular zinc in the brain. However, biological functions of Mt3 are not yet well characterized. Recently, we found that lysosomal dysfunction in metallothionein-3 (Mt3)-null astrocytes involves down-regulation of c-Abl. In this study, we investigated the role of Mt3 in c-Abl activation and actin polymerization in cultured astrocytes following treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Compared with wild-type (WT) astrocytes, Mt3-null cells exhibited a substantial reduction in the activation of c-Abl upon treatment with EGF. Consistent with previous studies, activation of c-Abl by EGF induced dissociation of c-Abl from F-actin. Mt3 added to astrocytic cell lysates bound F-actin, augmented F-actin polymerization, and promoted the dissociation of c-Abl from F-actin, suggesting a possible role for Mt3 in this process. Conversely, Mt3-deficient astrocytes showed significantly reduced dissociation of c-Abl from F-actin following EGF treatment. Experiments using various peptide fragments of Mt3 showed that a fragment containing the N-terminal TCPCP motif (peptide 1) is sufficient for this effect. Removal of zinc from Mt3 or pep1 with tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine abrogated the effect of Mt3 on the association of c-Abl and F-actin, indicating that zinc binding is necessary for this action. These results suggest that ZnMt3 in cultured astrocytes may be a normal component of c-Abl activation in EGF receptor signaling. Hence, modulation of Mt3 levels or distribution may prove to be a useful strategy for controlling cytoskeletal mobilization following EGF stimulation in brain cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010542577,Background We investigate disinfection of a reconstructed human skin model contaminated with biofilm-formative Staphylococcus aureus employing plasma discharge in liquid. Principal Findings We observed statistically significant 3.83-log10 (p<0.001) and 1.59-log10 (p<0.05) decreases in colony forming units of adherent S. aureus bacteria and 24 h S. aureus biofilm culture with plasma treatment. Plasma treatment was associated with minimal changes in histological morphology and tissue viability determined by means of MTT assay. Spectral analysis of the plasma discharge indicated the presence of highly reactive atomic oxygen radicals (777 nm and 844 nm) and OH bands in the UV region. The contribution of these and other plasma-generated agents and physical conditions to the reduction in bacterial load are discussed. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the potential of liquid plasma treatment as a potential adjunct therapy for chronic wounds.
https://openalex.org/W2000185032,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an inducible cytoplasmic transcription factor that plays a role as a master regulator of airway mucosal inflammation. The prototypical (""canonical"") NF-κB pathway controls cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation in response to stimulation by the mononuclear cytokine, TNF. Despite intensive investigation, the spectrum of kinases involved in the canonical NF-κB pathway has not yet been systematically determined. Here we have applied a high throughput siRNA-mediated loss-of-function screening assay to identify novel kinases important in TNF-induced NF-κB signaling. Type II A549 epithelial cells stably expressing an IL-8/luciferase reporter gene optimized for high throughput siRNA format (Z' score of 0.65) and siRNAs for 636 human kinases were reverse-transfected and screened in the assay. 36 candidate genes were identified that inhibited TNF signaling with a Z score deviation of <-1.3 in replicate plates. From this group, 11 kinases were selected for independent validation, of which eight were successfully silenced. Six kinases were validated, including ATM, CDK2, -5, and -7, CALM3, MAPAKP5, and MAP3K/MEKK3. The surprising function of ATM in TNF signaling was confirmed where reduced NF-κB/RelA translocation and Ser-276 phosphorylation were seen in ATM(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts. These data indicate that ATM is a key regulatory kinase that may control global NF-κB activation in the TNF-induced canonical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1973590833,"Objective Increasing evidence has accumulated showing the role of APOBEC3G (A3G) and 3F (A3F) in the control of HIV-1 replication and disease progression in humans. However, very few studies have been conducted in HIV-infected children. Here, we analyzed the levels of A3G and A3F expression and induced G-to-A hypermutation in a group of children with distinct profiles of disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings Perinatally HIV-infected children were classified as progressors or long-term non-progressors according to criteria based on HIV viral load and CD4 T-cell counts over time. A group of uninfected control children were also enrolled in the study. PBMC proviral DNA was assessed for G-to-A hypermutation, whereas A3G and A3F mRNA were isolated and quantified through TaqMan® real-time PCR. No correlation was observed between disease progression and A3G/A3F expression or hypermutation levels. Although all children analyzed showed higher expression levels of A3G compared to A3F (an average fold of 5 times), a surprisingly high A3F-related hypermutation rate was evidenced in the cohort, irrespective of the child's disease progression profile. Conclusion Our results contribute to the current controversy as to whether HIV disease progression is related to A3G/A3F enzymatic activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing A3G/F expression in HIV-infected children, and it may pave the way to a better understanding of the host factors governing HIV disease in the pediatric setting."
https://openalex.org/W2075252695,"Increasing evidence has pointed to activated type I interferon signaling in tumors. However, the molecular basis for such activation and its role in tumorigenesis remain unclear. In the current studies, we report that activation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling in tumor cells is primarily due to elevated secretion of the type I interferon, IFN-β. Studies in oncogene-transformed cells suggest that oncogenes such as Ras and Src can activate IFN-β signaling. Significantly, elevated IFN-β signaling in Ras-transformed mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells was shown to contribute to Ras transformation as evidenced by morphological changes, anchorage-independent growth, and migratory properties. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the type I IFN, IFN-β, contributes to Ras transformation and support the notion that oncogene-induced cytokines play important roles in oncogene transformation."

The Siberian roe deer occupies a vast area of Asia and is considerably less studied than the European roe deer. Modern systematics of the Siberian roe deer remain controversial with 4 morphological subspecies. Roe deer fossilized bones are quite abundant in Denisova cave (Altai Mountains, South Siberia), where dozens of both extant and extinct mammalian species from modern Holocene to Middle Pleistocene have been retrieved.We analyzed a 629 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region from ancient bones of 10 Holocene and four Pleistocene Siberian roe deer from Denisova cave as well as 37 modern specimen belonging to populations from Altai, Tian Shan (Kyrgyzstan), Yakutia, Novosibirsk region and the Russian Far East. Genealogical reconstructions indicated that most Holocene haplotypes were probably ancestral for modern roe deer populations of Western Siberia and Tian Shan. One of the Pleistocene haplotypes was possibly ancestral for modern Yakutian populations, and two extinct Pleistocene haplotypes were close to modern roe deer from Tian Shan and Yakutia. Most modern geographical populations (except for West Siberian Plains) are heterogeneous and there is some tentative evidence for structure. However, we did not find any distinct phylogenetic signal characterizing particular subspecies in either modern or ancient samples.Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from both ancient and modern samples of Siberian roe deer shed new light on understanding the evolutionary history of roe deer. Our data indicate that during the last 50,000 years multiple replacements of populations of the Siberian roe deer took place in the Altai Mountains correlating with climatic changes. The Siberian roe deer represent a complex and heterogeneous species with high migration rates and without evident subspecies structure. Low genetic diversity of the West Siberian Plain population indicates a recent bottleneck or founder effect."

Although complement activation is secondary to autoantibodies that form immune complexes (ICs), the trigger for alterations in human peripheral blood T cells is poorly understood. To study the impact (on T cells) of several types of preformed ICs and terminal complement complex, also referred to as C5b-9, we incubated these immune reactants with peripheral blood naive CD4+ T cells as well as Jurkat cells and analyzed their effects on cellular behavior. We first assembled the C5b-9 in situ on the membrane and observed its assembly primarily on a single site where it promoted aggregation of membrane rafts and recruitment of the CD3 signaling complex. However, C5b-9 alone did not initiate proliferation or commencement of downstream signaling events associated with T cell activation. When T cells were treated with ICs together with nonlytic C5b-9, changes associated with T cell activation by possible antigen engagement then occurred. T cell antigen receptor signaling proteins, including ζ-chain, ZAP-70, Syk, Src, and Lck, were phosphorylated and organized in a synapse-like structure. The cytoskeleton formed F-actin spindles and a distal pole complex, resulting in a bipolar distribution of phosphorylated ezrin-radixin-moesin and F-actin.

In IC-mediated diseases, infections, and rheumatic diseases, complement activation triggers sequential assembly of the terminal complement C5b, C6, and C7 (C5b-7), which then inserts into the membrane and subsequently binds to C8 and C9 to form trans-membrane channels (10Hammer C.H. Nicholson A. Mayer M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells resist C5b-9-mediated lytic death by its removal from the membrane by exocytosis within minutes of its deposition, leaving nonlytic C5b-9 on the cell membrane (11Morgan B.P. Dankert J.R.

In addition, C5b-9 in the plasma binds to clustrin and vitronectin to form cytolytically inactive C5b-9.

Also, deposition of nonlytic C5b-9 is more common on host cells and is considered a more physiologically relevant event that triggers a number of signaling events such as the following: 1) synthesis of eicosanoids, interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; 2) platelet activation; 3) release of growth factors; 4) increase in diacylglycerol and ceramides; 5) activation of membrane phospholipases, and 6) apoptosis (15Shin M.L.

These studies suggest that in the state of moderate complement activation, the nonlytic C5b-9 acts as a signaling protein complex. This led us to explore the role of nonlytic C5b-9 in T cell activation. In this study, we explore the role of nonlytic C5b-9 purified from serum and in situ C5b-9 assembled from purified late complement proteins in T cell activation. The in situ C5b-9 represents both lytic and nonlytic C5b-9, where lytic C5b-9 is removed by endocytosis or ectocytosis leaving nonlytic C5b-9 on the membrane (11Morgan B.P. Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. J.

ICs that activate the complement system are observed in SLE patients along with hyperactivation of T cells associated with an increase in calcium levels (23Crispín J.C. Kyttaris V.C. Terhorst C.

Freshly isolated T cells from SLE patients demonstrate aggregation of membrane rafts (MRs) that may contribute to T cell activation (24Jury E.C. Kabouridis P.S. Flores-Borja F. Mageed R.A.

This led us to investigate interactions among nonlytic C5b-9, ICs, and human naive CD4+ T cells. Here, we show a phenomenon that has not been observed previously, C5b-9 forms a synapse on human naive CD4+ T cells. This synapse facilitates the deposition of ICs, which leads to co-receptor engagement and downstream signaling in T cells such as phosphorylation of Lck, ζ-chain, ZAP-70, and Src in microclusters. During this process, T cells polarize by sequestering of the TCR signaling proteins and organizing cytoskeletal elements in a supramolecular activation cluster-like structures (26Grakoui A.

Jurkat cells (J.RT3) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. They were propagated in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Human naive CD4+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The peripheral blood lymphocyte fraction was separated from 20 ml of heparinized blood using Histopaque (Sigma). The adherent monocytes were removed by plating the cells in a Nunc culture dish at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. The nonadherent cell population was labeled using a mixture of antibody mixture from naive CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The naive CD4+ T cells were then separated using a magnetic assisted cell separation column. The purity of the isolated cells was analyzed using flow cytometry by staining for CD4 and CD45RA (naive CD4+ T cells markers). These cells were 93–96% pure based on the CD4+ CD45RA+ staining. The purified cells were over 97% viable in all the preparation using vital dye trypan blue. Affinity-purified anti-ovalbumin was mixed with purified chicken ovalbumin at a molar ratio of 1:0.5 and 1:4 in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The mixture was kept at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 4 °C overnight. This mixture was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein estimation was carried out, and the Ova-ICs were then stored at −70 °C. The ICs from SLE patients (SLE-ICs) were purified from plasma using an affinity matrix as described previously (25Chauhan A.K. Moore T.L. Clin. Exp.

During the wash step, resin was stirred multiple times, and proteins were monitored in the eluate. ICs were eluted using 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 3.5). The eluted material was neutralized using 1 m Tris base. High salt from the ICs preparation was removed by buffer exchange, and ICs were then stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Fluid phase C5b-9 was isolated from pooled normal sera as described previously (29Accardo-Palumbo A. Triolo G. Casiglia D. Sallì L. Giardina E. Triolo G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Morgan B.P. Daniels R.H. Williams B.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 73: 473-478PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 200 mg of zymosan A was added to 20 ml of serum, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The C5b-9 was then precipitated by adding 7% polyethylene glycol 6000 weight by volume, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. C5b-9-containing fractions were then pelleted by centrifugation at 43,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was washed again with 7% polyethylene glycol. The precipitate was dissolved in PBS, and the protein content was measured. Thereafter, the mixture was fractionated over a SuperoseTM 6 YK column (GE Healthcare). The fractions were analyzed for the presence of polymerized C9 by monitoring the generation of C9 neo-epitope using a monoclonal antibody (clone aE11) in an ELISA system. The fractions containing C5b-9 were pooled and concentrated, and the protein was estimated. The preparation was stored at −70 °C. The nonlytic dose for C5b-9 was determined by incubating 1 × 106 Jurkat cells with 0.25, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μg of protein and measuring apoptosis and necrosis using Vybrant Apoptosis Assay 3 (Eugene, OR) as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol. This titration was also carried out in the presence of 2.0 and 5.0 μg of Ova-IC. At a concentration of 2.5 μg of C5b-9 in the presence of ICs after a 2-h interval, cells remain viable. Subsequently, we used 2.5 μg of C5b-9 (nonlytic) in the presence of 1 μg of purified ICs in all experiments unless otherwise noted. Purified C9 was labeled with Alexa Fluor® 594 as per the manufacturer's recommendation. For in situ deposition of the C5b-9, a total of 2 × 106 cells were washed with RPMI and plated onto 24-well culture plates. After a 4-h incubation in plain RPMI, the cells were incubated with purified C5b-6 (2 μg), C7 (1 μg), C8 (2 μg), and C9-Alexa Fluor® 594 (2.5 μg) to form C5b-9 (in situ). These conditions were used for in situ deposition of C5b-9 in all subsequent experiments. Cell aliquots at 0.75, 1.5, 3, 4, and 24 h were removed, washed with cold PBS, and fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 30 min and then mounted on slides for examination. The cells with C5b-9 deposits remained viable as observed with trypan blue dye prior to fixation. The viability was also assessed using Vybrant assay kit (Invitrogen). The cells were observed for the formation of C5b-9 using a confocal and fluorescent microscope. The percentages of cells with deposits were calculated by counting the cells with and without C5b-9 deposits from at least three fields in three independent experiments. The images were captured using both ×200 and 630. To co-localize ICs and C5b-9, Jurkat or naive CD4+ T cells were treated with labeled Ova-ICs or AHG, 5 μg of total protein for 1 × 106 cells during assembly of in situ C5b-9. Control cells were treated with equivalent amounts of labeled ICs or labeled C9. Ova-ICs were formed in vitro by incubating the ovalbumin with anti-ovalbumin antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 (Invitrogen). AHG was also labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488. The Ova-ICs with antibody to antigen molar ratio of 1:4 were used for membrane deposition, because this ratio demonstrated the most consistent phosphorylation of proteins of the TCR pathway in the Western blot analysis. After treatment of cells with Ova-ICs or AHG and in situ C5b-9, cells were washed and images were captured using either fluorescent or confocal microscope. The cells were starved for 4 h in plain RPMI, before treatment. Human naive CD4+ cells or Jurkat cells were treated with either nonlytic C5b-9 or in situ C5b-9 in the presence of SLE-ICs (2 μg) or Ova-ICs (2 μg). Post-treatment, the cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS. To 1 × 106 cells, a total of 0.2 μg of cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated with FITC was added and allowed to incubate for 20 min in an ice bath (31Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells during the in situ C5b-9 formation, C8 protein was omitted. Thereafter, these cells were washed and mounted on slides using SlowFade Gold antifade reagent with DAPI. These cells were then examined as described previously. The cell images were captured at ×400 and 630. To observe the cytoskeletal polarization, we stained cells for F-actin and pERM (32Valitutti S. Dessing M. Aktories K. Gallati H. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In 24-well plates, 2 × 106 cells were treated with 2 μg of purified SLE-ICs or Ova-ICs with 2.5 μg of nonlytic C5b-9 for 2 h. After a 2-h treatment, the medium was replaced with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For staining, the cells were harvested at 4- and 12-h intervals. The cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in cold 3% formaldehyde prepared in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized for 10 min by keeping in 90% ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. After washing again, the cells were stained using a 1:200 dilution of anti-pERM antibody prepared in blocking buffer obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA) for 1 h. After washing two times with PBS, the cells were again washed and treated at RT for 1 h with 1:100 dilution of anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 594 prepared in blocking buffer. Following pERM staining, the cells were stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor® 488, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cells were observed with the appropriate filter in the fluorescent microscope, and images were captured at ×200, 400, or 630. For scoring cells with cytoskeletal changes, images from three fields were examined in each experiment. The percentages of cells exhibiting the changes were calculated by counting total cells and cell with changes. Cells were treated with purified complement proteins C5b-6, C7, C8, and Alexa Fluor® 594-labeled C9 to form in situ C5b-9. These cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 15 min at RT. For detection of CD3, after two washes cells were incubated with anti-CD3-FITC conjugate in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min. The cells were washed and mounted on a slide and examined for C5b-9 and CD3 with a fluorescent microscope, and images were captured at ×200 and 630. Fluorescence was analyzed using an Olympus confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000, BX61). Multiple channel imaging was employed to analyze conjugates emitting fluorescence at wavelengths of 405, 488, and 594 nm. To visualize the cells, we used DAPI for staining nuclei and differential interference contrast (DIC) image. Cellular distribution of proteins in cells was observed by capturing images in horizontal optical sections from 0.22 to 0.55 μm in vertical steps throughout the whole height of the representative cell. In some circumstances, the optical zoom was used to visualize and capture the cellular details in the images. Briefly, 1 × 106 Jurkat cells were washed and suspended in 1 ml of RPMI and plated in 24-well culture plates. Cells were then starved for 4 h in plain RPMI prior to treatment. These cells were treated with nonlytic C5b-9 alone, ICs alone, or in combination with the ICs and nonlytic C5b-9. Purified nonlytic C5b-9 (2.5 μg) and ICs purified from two SLE patients at two concentrations of SLE-ICs, one at 1 μg and the other at 4.5 μg, were used. In addition, Ova-ICs at antibody to antigen molar ratios of 1:0.5 designated as Ova-IC(1) and molar ratio of 1:4 designated as Ova-IC(2) were also used. These ratios were selected to generate ICs in either antibody or antigen excess (33Mannik M. J. Rheumatol. 1987; 14: 35-42Google Scholar, 34Wener M.H. Mannik M. Schwartz M.M. Lewis E.J. Medicine. 1987; 66: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, cells were removed from the culture dish, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 10 mm Na3VO4. The cell lysates were vortexed, briefly sonicated, and then subjected to centrifugation at 13,500 rpm in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5424). The protein quantities were estimated using a commercial protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and a total of 50 μg of protein was mixed with SDS-PAGE 4× loading buffer containing 50 mm DTT. The samples were electrophoresed using NuPAGE 4–12% gradient gel and transferred to Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore). The blots were incubated with blocking buffer composed of 3% BSA at RT. Thereafter, blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBS-T), and the membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) followed by anti-mouse-HRP antibody, and the blots were developed with chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore). To investigate the activation of the TCR complex, the membrane blots prepared as above were probed for phospho-Lck (Tyr192/Ser194), phospho-Syk (Tyr525/526), phospho-Src (Tyr416), and phospho-Zap-70 (Tyr319). We used primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 in 3% BSA prepared in TBS-T. Next, the blots were treated with an appropriate dilution of the secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP enzyme, and blots were developed as above. The same blots were re-probed using anti-pSyk, anti-pLck, anti-pSrc, and anti-pZap-70. After Western blot analysis, the membranes were stripped and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 stain, and the stained membranes were scanned, and images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) to compare the intensity of protein loading for each lane. The purified naive CD4+ T cells were plated in RPMI with 10% FBS supplemented with 50 ng/ml of IL-2 and allowed to grow for 2 days. Thereafter, the cells were harvested, washed two times with plain RPMI 1640 medium, and starved for 4 h. Naive CD4+ T cells (1 × 106) were treated with 2.5 μg/ml nonlytic C5b-9 in the presence of 1 μg/ml ICs. The cells were harvested at 1- and 2-h intervals, washed twice with cold PBS, and fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT. After washing, cells were permeabilized as described previously. The cells were then washed and treated for 1 h with blocking buffer composed of 1% BSA and 5% species-specific serum. These cells were then treated overnight with an appropriate dilution of primary antibodies at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were stained with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with either Alexa Fluor® 488 or Alexa Fluor® 594 diluted in blocking buffer. After 1 h of incubation, cells were washed three times and mounted on glass slides with antifade reagent containing DAPI from Invitrogen. The cells were examined in a minimum of three fields in every experiment. Confocal imaging was performed as described earlier using the Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope. Cells were loaded using carboxyfluorescein diacetyl succinimidyl ester (CFSC) as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Invitrogen). Immediately after CFSC loading, cells were kept in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37 °C. These cells were then washed three times with 15 ml of plain RPMI and incubated further for 4 h. 1 × 106 cells were then treated with 2.5 μg of nonlytic C5b-9, 1 μg of SLE-ICs, or a combination of C5b-9 and ICs for 2 h in plain RPMI. Thereafter, 50,000 cells were plated in an individual well of a 48-well culture plate with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were harvested at 24 and 48 h and analyzed in flow cytometer (SLRII, BD Biosciences) for carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilution. For positive control, 1 × 106 cells/1 ml were stimulated using 5 μl of phytohemagglutinin (Invitrogen). The data were analyzed using proliferation node of FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). The dead cells were excluded from the analysis by SSC and FSC gating. Purified naive CD4+ T cells at a density of 1 × 106/ml were starved in plain RPMI for 4 h. Then 1 ml of cells were treated with 2.5 μg of nonlytic C5b-9, 1 μg of SLE-ICs, or a combination of nonlytic C5b-9 and ICs for 2 h. Control cell did not receive any treatment. After treatment, the media were replaced with complete media supplemented with 20 ng of IL-2, and 0.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 96-well plate. For positive control, 1 μg of plate-bound anti-CD3 and 0.5 μg of anti-CD28 antibodies were used. The supernatants were harvested at 48-h intervals for IFN-γ measurement. IFN-γ was measured using an ELISA kit as per the manufacturer's recommendation (PeproTech). Purified human peripheral blood naive CD4+ T cells or Jurkat cells were treated with nonlytic C5b-9 and ICs. In addition, in situ C5b-9 was assembled using purified complement proteins. Two types of ICs, including the in vitro-formed Ova-ICs or SLE-ICs, were used to treat both cell types in combination with either nonlytic or in situ C5b-9. AHG was also utilized as IC substitute. The effect of these two players, ICs and C5b-9, were characterized relative to events associated with T cell activation and IS formation, including mobility of MRs, cytoskeletal changes, phosphorylation of TCR signaling proteins, cell proliferation, and IFN-γ production. Similar results were obtained with all three types of ICs and two forms of C5b-9. To address a possible role of nonlytic C5b-9 in T cell activation, we assembled the in situ C5b-9 on naive CD4+ T cells and Jurkat T cells using purified human terminal complement pathway proteins (C5b-6, C7, C8, and Alexa Fluor® 594-labeled C9). We observed that in both cell types over a period of 1–2 h, the deposited C5b-9 formed a single large cluster on the cell membrane (Fig. 1A and supplemental Video 1). C9 alone or the assembly of in situ C5b-9 in the absence of C8 did not demonstrate this pattern (Fig. 1B, left panel, and supplemental Video 2). The in situ C5b-9 could be visualized as early as 45 min from the start time of treatment of cells with complement proteins. A total of 30–50% of the cells showed C5b-9 deposition as scored by examination of three independent optical fields (Fig. 1B). By 3–4 h, these deposits had grown substantially, occupying ∼5–15% of the cell membrane (Fig. 1A, right panel). All initial experiments were done using Jurkat cells, and afterward these findings were also confirmed using naive CD4+ T cells. To assess the effect of ICs on in situ C5b-9 deposition, we followed in parallel the binding of Ova-ICs labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488. The simultaneous treatment of cells with labeled Ova-ICs and in situ-formed C5b-9 showed co-deposition of both complexes on naive CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2) and Jurkat cells (data not show"
https://openalex.org/W2016529720,"Paxillin and HIC5 are closely related adapter proteins that regulate cell migration and are tyrosine-phosphorylated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Paxillin, HIC5, and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation increase upon cell attachment and decrease upon detachment from extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, we found that although FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in attached cells did not require paxillin, in detached fibroblasts there was remaining FAK tyrosine phosphorylation that required expression of paxillin and was not supported by HIC5. The support of attachment-independent FAK tyrosine phosphorylation required the paxillin LIM domains and suggested that paxillin might facilitate oncogenic transformation. Paxillin but not HIC5 augmented anchorage-independent cell proliferation induced by RAS. Both anchorage-independent FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and RAS-induced colony formation required multiple docking sites on paxillin, including LD4 (docking sites for FAK-Src and GIT1/2-PIX-NCK-PAK complex), LD5, and all four carboxyl-terminal LIM domains (that bind tubulin and PTP-PEST). Analysis using paxillin mutants dissociated domains of paxillin that are required for regulation of cell migration from domains that are required for anchorage-independent cell proliferation and demonstrated essential functions of the paxillin LIM domains that are not found in HIC5 LIM domains. These results highlight the role of paxillin in facilitating attachment-independent signal transduction implicated in cancer."

The WAVE regulatory complex is a key regulator of actin assembly, yet how the WAVE signaling is regulated to coordinate actin assembly with mitotic entry is not clear. Here, we have uncovered a novel mechanism that regulates the WAVE complex at the onset of mitosis. We found that the Bcr-Abl-stimulated F-actin assembly is abrogated during mitosis. This mitotic inhibition of F-actin assembly is accompanied by an attenuation of Bcr-Abl-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the WAVE complex. We identified serine 216 of Abi1 as a target of CDK1/cyclin B kinase that is phosphorylated in cells at the onset of mitosis. The Abi1 phosphorylated on serine 216 displayed greatly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in the hematopoietic cells transformed by Bcr-Abl. Moreover, a phosphomimetic mutation of serine 216 to aspartic acid in Abi1 was sufficient to attenuate Bcr-Abl-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the WAVE complex and F-actin assembly. Ectopic expression of Abi1 with serine 216 mutations interfered with cell cycle progression. Together, these data show that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of serine 216 in Abi1 serves as a regulatory mechanism that may contribute to coordinated actin cytoskeleton remodeling during mitosis.

https://openalex.org/W2167412690,"Health and socioeconomic disparities tend to be experienced along racial and ethnic lines, but investigators are not sure how individuals are assigned to groups, or how consistent this process is. To address these issues, 1,919 orthodontic patient records were examined by at least two observers who estimated each individual's race and the characteristics that influenced each estimate. Agreement regarding race is high for African and European Americans, but not as high for Asian, Hispanic, and Native Americans. The indicator observers most often agreed upon as important in estimating group membership is name, especially for Asian and Hispanic Americans. The observers, who were almost all European American, most often agreed that skin color is an important indicator of race only when they also agreed the subject was European American. This suggests that in a diverse community, light skin color is associated with a particular group, while a range of darker shades can be associated with members of any other group. This research supports comparable studies showing that race estimations in medical records are likely reliable for African and European Americans, but are less so for other groups. Further, these results show that skin color is not consistently the primary indicator of an individual's race, but that other characteristics such as facial features add significant information."
https://openalex.org/W2092978507,"Subunit a is the main part of the membrane stator of the ATP synthase molecular turbine. Subunit c is the building block of the membrane rotor. We have generated two molecular fusions of a and c subunits with different orientations of the helical hairpin of subunit c. The a/c fusion protein with correct orientation of transmembrane helices was inserted into the membrane, and co-incorporated into the F0 complex of ATP synthase with wild type subunit c. The fused c subunit was incorporated into the c-ring tethering the ATP synthase rotor to the stator. The a/c fusion with incorrect orientation of the c-helices required wild type subunit c for insertion into the membrane. In this case, the fused c subunit remained on the periphery of the c-ring and did not interfere with rotor movement. Wild type subunit a inserted into the membrane equally well with wild type subunit c and c-ring assembly mutants that remained monomeric in the membrane. These results show that interaction with monomeric subunit c triggers insertion of subunit a into the membrane, and initiates formation of the a-c complex, the ion-translocating module of the ATP synthase.

Correct assembly of the ATP synthase incorporating topologically correct fusion of subunits a and c validates using this model protein for high resolution structural studies of the ATP synthase proton channel. ATP synthase catalyzes formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate at the expense of energy stored in the transmembrane gradient of protons or Na+ ions. In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria, the reaction is reversible under physiological conditions and can build up transmembrane ion gradients at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. ATP synthase is composed of the cytoplasmic F1 complex and the F0 complex, which is integrated into the cell membrane (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in active sites located in the F1 complex. This process is coupled to transmembrane ion translocation through the F0 complex. In E. coli, the F0 complex consists of three types of subunits present in an ab2c10 ratio. ATP synthase functions as a molecular turbine. The transmembrane flow of protons through the F0 complex drives rotation of the subunit c oligomer (2Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), which is transmitted inside the core of the F1 complex by an elongated shaft built of F1 subunits γ and ϵ. The tip of subunit γ rotating inside the molecular bearing created by three pairs of symmetrically arranged α- and β-subunits causes cyclical conformational changes in the three nucleotide binding sites on the β subunits, which lead first to tight binding of ADP and phosphate and then to the release of the newly synthesized ATP molecules (3Abrahams J.P.

Celebi N. Chen M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39260-39267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The YidC chaperone is also involved in insertion of subunit a (22Yi L. Jiang F. Chen M. Cain B. Bolhuis A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10537-10544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In E. coli, subunits b and c were shown to insert into the membrane independently of the other two subunits of the F0 complex, but both b and c were required for incorporation of subunit a into the membrane (23Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to earlier reports that found that subunit a inserts independently of b and c (24Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10136-10143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunit c overproduced in the absence of the other two F0 subunits may spontaneously assemble into stable ring structures (25Arechaga I. Butler P.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Formation of the c-ring in the membrane, was reported to be assisted by the atpI gene product, a small hydrophobic protein, which is not a stoichiometric component of the mature ATP synthase complex (26Ozaki Y. Suzuki T. Kuruma Y. Ueda T. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki T. Ozaki Y. Sone N. Feniouk B.A. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20776-20781Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although this protein is not strictly required for the assembly of functional ATP synthase in E. coli cells (28Gay N.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 820-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mitochondria, assembly of the c-ring, and its association with F1 is believed to precede attachment of subunit a (subunit 6) to the rotor (29Rak M. Gokova S. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the sequence of events in formation of the F0 complex and develop an experimental model for high-resolution structure determination of the ATP synthase proton channel, we have investigated assembly of ATP synthase incorporating fusion proteins consisting of subunits a and c. Plasmid pBWU13 (30Iwamoto A. Omote H. Hanada H. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16350-16355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the complete atp operon with the atpB gene (subunit a) modified to include an N-terminal His6 tag (31Stalz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27068-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used to generate molecular fusions between subunits a and c (Fig. 1A) and for subsequent protein expression. In the first fusion protein, named a-c, the N terminus of subunit c (gene atpE) is connected to the C terminus of subunit a (gene atpB) by a linker peptide, GTASASNGASA, which is based on the sequence of linker peptides used previously to generate functional dimers of subunit c (32Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To generate the a-c protein, a derivative of the pBWU13 plasmid containing atpIBEFHA genes only was amplified by around-the-plasmid PCR with 5′-phosphorylated primers. The first primer was designed to anneal to the 3′ terminus of the coding strand of atpB and included a noncomplementary 5′-sequence corresponding to the N-terminal half of the linker peptide, which also contained a KpnI site for the next cloning step. The second primer annealed to the 3′ terminus of the noncoding strand of the atpE gene and included a noncomplementary 5′ sequence corresponding to the C-terminal half of the linker peptide. Ligation of the purified PCR product resulted in formation of a plasmid containing an engineered gene encoding the a-c fusion protein instead of the separate atpB and atpE genes. In the second fusion protein, named a-c/2-c, a GT dipeptide followed by the sequence corresponding to the polar loop and the C-terminal transmembrane helix of subunit c (Gly38-Ala79) was inserted between the C terminus of subunit a and linker peptide GTASASNGASA of the a-c protein. This gene fusion was generated by amplifying the corresponding segment of the atpE gene by PCR and cloning it into the KpnI site introduced during the construction of the a-c gene at the previous step. The genes coding for the a-c and a-c/2-c fusion proteins were then cloned into the pBWU13 plasmid (Fig. 1B). In the first set of plasmids, either a-c or a-c/2-c gene fusions replaced both atpB and atpE genes. A fragment of the atp operon containing the respective gene fusion was cloned into HindIII-SphI sites of pBWU13 to produce plasmids containing the a-c (pHP2) and a-c/2-c fusions (pBROD6) in the full operon context. In the second set of plasmids, genes coding for the fusion proteins only replaced the atpB gene, whereas wild type atpE was present on the plasmid in addition to the gene fusion. To generate these plasmids, pBWU13 was amplified by around-the-plasmid PCR with 5′-phosphorylated primers. The forward primer was designed to anneal at the 3′ end of the atpB gene and contained an NheI site immediately after the atpB stop codon. The reverse primer annealed 40 bases downstream of the unique PflMI site in atpB. The linear PCR product, which contained the full plasmid sequence except for the larger part of the atpB gene, was digested with NheI and PflMI and ligated with NheI-PflMI fragments of the a-c and a-c/2-c fusion genes yielding plasmids pHP7 and pHP808, respectively. The plasmids were then transformed into a recA− derivative of strain OM202 carrying complete deletion of the atp operon on the chromosome. The E. coli cell cultures were grown on a minimal medium to the late exponential phase (33Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were processed in a cell disruptor (Constant Systems Inc., Kennesaw, GA) at 35,000 p.s.i., and the cell membranes were isolated from the homogenate by ultracentrifugation (34Mosher M.E.

Oxidative phosphorylation activity was tested by growing cells on minimal agar plates containing 0.6% succinate as the sole source of carbon. ATP-dependent proton translocation was monitored by 9-amino-6-chloro-4-methoxyacridine fluorescence quenching (35Rottenberg H. Moreno-Sanchez R. Biochim. Biophys.

Following SDS-gel electrophoresis (36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work (data not shown), we found expression of subunit a without subunit c toxic for the cells. Subunit a requires subunit c for stable insertion into the membrane, whereas subunit c inserts in the absence of the other two F0 subunits (23Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the absence of the partner subunits, subunit a is rapidly degraded by membrane protease FtsH (46Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 47Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Is interaction with the monomeric c subunit sufficient, or is an assembled c-ring required for membrane insertion of subunit a? To address this question we investigated insertion of fusion proteins constructed of a and c polypeptides, expressed in the context of the complete atp operon, with and without wild type subunit c. Orientation of ATP synthase subunit c in the membrane is known, with both the N and C termini of the helical hairpin located in the periplasm. Subunit a is believed to have five transmembrane helices with the C terminus located in the cytoplasm (12Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), although this topology remains to be confirmed by high resolution structure determination. We have generated two polypeptide fusions linking subunit c to subunit a in a head-to-tail fashion. The two fusion proteins have a different number of transmembrane helices to account for the two possible orientations of the C terminus of subunit a relative to the N terminus of subunit c in the cell membrane. In the a-c fusion protein, the N terminus of subunit c is connected to the C terminus of subunit a through a flexible linker, which has a high content of polar amino acids and is expected to partition into the aqueous phase. Consequently, the N and C termini of the a-c fusion protein, which is predicted to contain seven transmembrane helices, should be located on the opposite sides of the cell membrane. This is different from the transmembrane topology predicted for subunits a and c in the native ATP synthase, where both the N terminus of subunit a and the C terminus of subunit c are located in the periplasm. The a-c/2-c fusion protein contains an additional segment corresponding to the polar loop and transmembrane helix II of subunit c inserted between the C terminus of subunit a and the N terminus of the full-length copy of subunit c. This construct is predicted to have eight transmembrane helices and should assume the same transmembrane topology as subunits a and c in the native ATP synthase (Fig. 1A). If interaction with monomeric subunit c is sufficient for subunit a insertion, the a-c/2-c fusion should insert into the membrane without wild type subunit c. Indeed, in a-c/2-c, the fusion protein was found in membranes of the strain containing plasmid pBROD6, which lacked the wild type atpE (subunit c) gene (Fig. 2, lane c), although the amount of protein in the membrane was somewhat reduced compared with the strain expressing the wild type atp operon (no a and c fusions, Fig. 2, lane f). In contrast, the a-c fusion protein, which is predicted to have incorrect membrane topology, was not found in the membrane without the wild type subunit c (plasmid pHP2, Fig. 2, lane b). Remarkably, both fusion proteins were readily incorporated into the cell membrane when the respective fusion proteins were coexpressed with wild type subunit c (plasmids pHP7 and pHP808, Fig. 2, lanes d and e). The amounts of fusion proteins found in the membrane in this case were similar to that of wild type subunit a expressed from the parent full operon plasmid pBWU13 (Fig. 2, lane f) as estimated from band intensity on Western blots. These results indicated that monomeric subunit c can chaperone subunit a insertion into the membrane, and an assembled ring is not required for this process, but the c subunit has to assume correct membrane topology. Although the incorrectly attached c subunit was not able to guide subunit a insertion in the case of a-c fusion, it did not interfere with the chaperone function of the wild type subunit c. We then investigated insertion of wild type subunit a in the presence of subunit c mutants G23D and L31F, which insert into the membrane but do not assemble into the oligomeric rings (48Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 49Kol S. Majczak W. Heerlien R. van der Berg J.P. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous conclusion, wild type subunit a was present in similar amounts in the membranes from strains expressing wild type subunit c, and cG23D or cL31F mutants (Fig. 3A), confirming that subunit c oligomerization is not required for subunit a insertion. In our experiments, the G23D mutation affected not only the c-ring assembly, but also insertion of subunit c into the membrane, as the amount of G23D subunit c in the membrane was much lower than of the wild type. The L31F mutant, on the other hand, was present in the membranes at wild type levels (Fig. 3B). As expected, both cG23D and cL31F mutants had little or no ATP-driven H+ translocation activity (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Importantly, even the comparatively low amount of G23D mutant present in the membrane was sufficient for normal insertion of subunit a, further supporting the notion that monomeric subunit c rather than the c10-oligomer is required for subunit a insertion. The OM202recA− cells, which have complete atp operon deletion on the chromosome, were able to grow by oxidative phosphorylation when the a-c, but not the a-c/2-c fusion protein was co-expressed with wild type subunit c from plasmids pHP7 and pHP808, respectively. As expected, the OM202recA−/pBROD6 and OM202recA−/pHP2 strains, which lack the wild type atpE gene, and therefore do not produce the c10-oligomer, were unable to grow by oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4), although growth on glucose minimal medium was normal (not shown). The a-c protein supported proton translocation driven by ATP hydrolysis, which was inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a specific inhibitor of proton transport in ATP synthase, although the rate of H+-transport was lower than in the wild type (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, the rate of ATP-dependent H+-translocation with the a-c/2-c fusion protein was negligible (Fig. 5C). Lack of H+ accumulation in vesicles with the a-c/2-c protein reflects a drastic decrease in the rate of proton pumping coupled to ATP hydrolysis, and not increased proton leak across the membrane, because NADH-dependent H+ transport rates with both fusion constructs were similar to the wild type (Fig. 5, D–F).FIGURE 5The a-c fusion protein supports ATP-dependent proton translocation, but the a-c/2-c does not. ATP-driven (A–C) and NADH-driven (D–F) proton translocation was measured by 9-amino-6-chloro-4-methoxyacridine fluorescence quenching in the membrane vesicles (50 μg/ml of total membrane protein) with wild type subunit a from strain OM202recA−/pBWU13 (A and D), with the a-c fusion from strain OM202recA−/pHP7 (B and E), and with the a-c/2-c fusion from strain OM202recA−/pHP808 (C and F). Additions of 2.0 mm ATP or 0.2 mm NADH and 2.0 μm proton uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) are indicated by the arrows. Gray traces were recorded with membranes pretreated with 80 μm DCCD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the a-c protein, the c-polypeptide is fused to subunit a in the incorrect orientation, and therefore cannot be incorporated into the rotor. Because ATP synthase with the a-c fusion is active, the fused c-polypeptide must be displaced to the periphery of the ring, so that it does not interfere with movement of the rotor (Fig. 6, A and B). In the a-c/2-c protein the transmembrane helices of subunit c are in the correct orientation, and can be incorporated into the rotor together with wild type c-subunits. This would tether the rotor to the stator and produce an inactive enzyme (Fig. 6, C or D), explaining the lack of ATP-dependent H+-transport observed with the a-c/2-c protein. To further test this hypothesis, we purified the F0 complex from the membranes of strains expressing wild type subunit a, the a-c, and a-c/2-c fusion proteins as described by Schneider and Altendorf (37Schneider E. Altendorf K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both fusion proteins were found in F0 complex preparations (Fig. 7), and the yield and ratio of the F0 subunits in these preparations were similar to the wild type.FIGURE 7The a-c and a-c/2-c fusion proteins are incorporated into the F0 complex. The F0 complex preparations from the membranes of OM202recA− strains transformed with pHP7 (a-c fusion), pHP808 (a-c/2-c fusion), or pBWU13 (wild type) were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Three samples of each preparation containing 0.2, 1.0, or 5.0 μg of protein as indicated by the triangles are shown. Positions of molecular mass markers and their masses in kDa are shown on the left. Similar to wild type subunits a and c (37Schneider E. Altendorf K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the fusion proteins display anomalous electrophoretic mobility that does not correspond to their actual molecular weights, a common property of many highly hydrophobic proteins. The calculated and apparent molecular masses for subunit a are 30 and 26 kDa, respectively, for the a-c fusion protein, 38 and 28 kDa, and for the a-c/2-c fusion, 42 and 33 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP synthase maintains precise coupling between ATP synthesis, or hydrolysis, in the F1 complex and proton translocation through the F0 complex. For this reason, inhibition of rotor movement by the bulky adduct of the DCCD reaction with Asp61 of subunit c results in nearly complete loss of F0F1-ATPase activity. As a test of proper enzyme assembly with the a-c/2-c protein, we investigated if the F1 complex was attached to the F0 portion and if the coupling mechanism was intact"

Nishikawa H. Jungbluth A.A. Güre A.O. Ritter G. Jäger E. Knuth A. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2006; 95: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Spontaneous Ab and T cell-based immune response against NY-ESO-1 were readily detectable in a wide spectrum of cancer patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors, including older patients with late stage cancers whose immune systems were known to be less responsive (9Gnjatic S. Nishikawa H. Jungbluth A.A. Güre A.O. Ritter G. Jäger E. Knuth A. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2006; 95: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spontaneous NY-ESO-1 antigen loss in melanoma suggested that anti-NY-ESO-1 responses could affect the natural history of cancer (10Barrow C. Browning J. MacGregor D. Davis I.D. Sturrock S. Jungbluth A.A. Cebon J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 was not due to its higher level of expression compared with other TAA. Indeed, the expression of NY-ESO-1 at least in melanoma was much lower than that of melanocyte differentiation antigens such as gp100, MART-1, TRP-1, and TRP-2, as well as other cancer/testis antigens, such as MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 based on quantitative real-time PCR analysis of fresh tumor samples (11Riker A.I. Kammula U.S. Panelli M.C. Wang E. Ohnmacht G.A. Steinberg S.M. Rosenberg S.A. Marincola F.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 818-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent investigation of the specific interaction between NY-ESO-1 and complement C1q receptor (regarded in the literature as the same as calreticulin or CRT) on the surface of immature DC, macrophages, and monocytes, indicated a unique interaction between NY-ESO-1 and the innate immune system (12Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Tian X. Seiler D. Zhang X. Jin Y. Rao J. Li W. Chen D. Langford M.P. Duggan C. Belldegrun A.S. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence showing that the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 is accounted for by its own polymeric structure as well as the host TLR4 status in mice. Truncated NY-ESO-1 containing amino acid residues 1–74, termed ESO(1–74), was described previously (13Zeng G. Touloukian C.E. Wang X. Restifo N.P. Rosenberg S.A. Wang R.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To introduce site-directed mutagenesis to the NY-ESO-1 cDNA, PCR was carried out to replace cysteines at amino acids 75, 76, and 78 with serines using the following phosphorylated primer pairs: forward primer, 5′-TCCTCCAGATCCGGGGCCAGGGGG CCGGAGAG (underlined residues indicate mutations) and reverse primer, 5′-TCCATTCAGCCCTGAAGCCGCGCCGCCAT. Long PCR was performed on a template of a previously described expression vector pET-28-NY-ESO-1 (13Zeng G. Touloukian C.E. Wang X. Restifo N.P. Rosenberg S.A. Wang R.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using the high fidelity PCR system (Invitrogen). The resultant PCR product was ligated to generate a new plasmid encoding ESOcs1. The same approach was used to introduce Cys-to-Ser mutations at amino acids 152 and 165, termed ESOcs2, with the following primer pairs: forward primer, 5′-TTGATGTGGATCACGCAGTCCTTTCTGCCCGTG and reverse primer, 5′-CAGGGAAAGCTGCTGGAGAGAGGAGCTGATG (mutated nucleotides were underlined). Similarly, a plasmid encoding NY-ESO-1 with all five Cys-to-Ser mutations at amino acids 75, 76, 78, 152, and 165 (termed ESOcs3) was obtained. To construct eukaryotic expression plasmids that encode ESOcs1, ESOcs2, and ESOcs3, PCR was used to amplify the NY-ESO-1 coding region with the corresponding mutations. The resultant PCR products were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1TOPO vectors (Invitrogen). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The wild-type NY-ESO-1 and its variants, including LAGE-1b, a natural homologue sharing four of five cysteines (14Lethé B. Lucas S. Michaux L. De Smet C. Godelaine D. Serrano A. De Plaen E. Boon T. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), were also cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma-Aldrich) and pDisplay vector (Invitrogen), resulting in a fusion between NY-ESO-1 and the N-terminal FLAG and c-Myc epitope, respectively. Monoclonal Ab against the c-Myc epitope was purchased from Genscript, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). The anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), monoclonal Ab against human β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), CRT (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and TLR4 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) were purchased from the indicated venders. HEK293 and melanoma cell lines 397, 624, and 2984 (kind gifts from Paul F. Robbins, National Cancer Institute) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Melanoma lines M202, F5.1, F5.4, and F5.6 were early cultures of primary tumors and gifts from Ali Jazirehi (UCLA). Transfection of plasmids into 293 cells was carried out using the Lipofectamine 2000 system (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed and developed using an ECL system (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The pET-28 (Novagen, San Diego, CA) based bacterial expression vectors encoding the wild-type NY-ESO-1, ESO(1–74), ESOcs1, ESOcs2, and ESOcs3 were used to transform BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. Protein purification was conducted following a previously described protocol (13Zeng G. Touloukian C.E. Wang X. Restifo N.P. Rosenberg S.A. Wang R.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Notably, the wild-type NY-ESO-1 protein was purified by Novavax, Inc. (Rockville, MD) under good manufacturing practice conditions with the resulting endotoxin below 5 enzyme units/mg/ml. Purified proteins were all dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of 0.5 m free l-arginine for proper refolding. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using mouse Myc-CaP cell line (15Watson P.A. Ellwood-Yen K. King J.C. Wongvipat J. Lebeau M.M. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11565-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which endogenously expresses mouse TLR4 and CRT, a gift of Charles Sawyers (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute, New York, NY). Myc-CaP was transduced with a retrovirus encoding NY-ESO-1 and its variants fused with the c-Myc tag. Cells collected from a 10-cm culture dish were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2/CaCl2 in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated overnight with Ab against the c-Myc tag conjugated onto magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) followed by magnetic separation and analysis of total proteins by native gel or reducing SDS-PAGE. To exclude any potential effects of LPS associated with protein immunization, plasmid DNA purified using endotoxin-free maxiprep kits (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was used to immunize 6–8-week-old C57BL/10 and C57BL/10ScNJ (TLR4−/−) mice by gene gun (16Leitner W.W. Hwang L.N. deVeer M.J. Zhou A. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Dubensky T.W. Ying H. Restifo N.P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For immunization of Balb/c mice with plasmids encoding CA9 and NY-ESO-1 fused with CA9, ∼100 μg plasmid/mouse were injected intramuscularly, followed by one or two injections of 50 μg plasmid/mouse with 2-week intervals. In all cases, blood from immunized mice was collected 2 weeks after immunization, and the serum was obtained using a centrifugation-based serum collection tube (BD Biosciences). Detection of NY-ESO-1 Ab present in mouse serum was carried out using ELISA as described previously (13Zeng G. Touloukian C.E. Wang X. Restifo N.P. Rosenberg S.A. Wang R.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A similar protocol was used to measure Ab against β-galactosidase (β-gal, Sigma/Aldrich) and human HMGB-1 (Genway Biotechnology, Inc., San Diego, CA). Ab titers against the Art v 1 allergen was determined using luminometric ELISA as described previously (17Hartl A. Weiss R. Hochreiter R. Scheiblhofer S. Thalhamer J. Methods. 2004; 32: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A procedure approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board was used in obtaining human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the virology core laboratory. Human DC were generated from isolated CD14-positive (Miltenyi Biotech) monocytes in the presence of 1000 unit/ml human GM-CSF (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) and 1000 unit/ml human IL-4 (Schering-Plough, San Francisco, CA) for 6 days. Iscove's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human male serum (BioCheMed, Winchester, VA) was used for DC culture. Mouse DC were generated from bone marrow cells of C57BL/10 mice and corresponding TLR2 and TLR4 knock-out mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) using a previously described protocol (12Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Tian X. Seiler D. Zhang X. Jin Y. Rao J. Li W. Chen D. Langford M.P. Duggan C. Belldegrun A.S. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All DC binding experiments were carried out on ice to prevent active internalization of the protein target by immature DC as described previously (12Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Tian X. Seiler D. Zhang X. Jin Y. Rao J. Li W. Chen D. Langford M.P. Duggan C. Belldegrun A.S. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unless specified, the protein concentrations used were 3, 10, and 1 μg/ml for NY-ESO-1 and its variants, gp100, and ESO(1–74), respectively, to maintain equal molarities. About 105 pre-chilled, immature DC from mouse or human were mixed with the above protein in 50 μl of PBS buffer supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum to block nonspecific interactions. After a 20-min incubation on ice, samples were washed twice followed by adding a FITC-conjugated secondary Ab, either a monoclonal Ab against NY-ESO-1 or against the polyhistidine tag (Sigma/Aldrich). Cells were incubated for another 20 min, washed twice, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. NY-ESO-1 proteins derived from bacterial and mammalian cells were found to form polymers even in the presence of regular concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer (Fig. 1, A and B). To further examine the role of cysteines in the formation of NY-ESO-1 polymers, serines were introduced to substitute cysteines present at amino acid residues 75, 76, 78, 152, and 165. Three NY-ESO-1 variants carrying amino acid substitutions were generated: ESOcs1 containing Cys-to-Ser substitutions at 75, 76, and 78, ESOcs2 at position 152 and 165, and ESOcs3 containing C-to-S substitutions at all five positions. These proteins were purified and compared for oligomerization status using Western blot (Fig. 1B). Although the wild-type protein showed a clear formation of dimers, tetramers, and even polymers above 130 kDa; ESOcs1 and ESOcs2 were mainly present as monomers and dimers. ESOcs3 appeared primarily as monomers. This experiment indicated that the oligomerization of NY-ESO-1 was due to intermolecular disulfide bonds. NY-ESO-1 present in tumor cells was detected primarily as trimers or tetramers with few monomers and dimers using Western blot even in the presence of regular amount of β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer (Fig. 1C). According to our previous report, a unique feature of NY-ESO-1 was its capacity of binding to immature DC, monocytes, and macrophages in vitro. Compared with the wild-type NY-ESO-1, binding to immature DC by NY-ESO-1 variants with Cys-to-Ser mutations was significantly affected in vitro (Fig. 1, D and E). NY-ESO-1 engagement of immature DC of mouse and human was thus a function of its own oligomeric structure in vitro. To investigate the involvement of TLR in mediating NY-ESO-1 binding to DC, bone marrow-derived immature DC from wild-type mice were compared with those from TLR4 and TLR2 knock-out mice for NY-ESO-1 binding affinities. The absence of TLR4 but not TLR2 partially impaired the binding of NY-ESO-1 to bone marrow derived DC in vitro (Fig. 2A). Because NY-ESO-1 also bound to immature DC through CRT in mouse and human, it retained significant binding to DC from TLR4-knock-out mice. In accordance, direct binding of recombinant NY-ESO-1 to human and mouse DC was blocked by anti-TLR4 Ab in a similar manner as did anti-CRT Ab (Fig. 2B); meanwhile, Ab against β-actin served as negative controls with no apparent blocking of NY-ESO-1 and immature DC interactions. Combination of the Ab against TLR4 and CRT did not show apparent synergistic inhibition of NY-ESO-1/DC interactions under the conditions used. Direct interactions between NY-ESO-1 and TLR4 came as evidence showing that mouse TLR4 co-precipitated with the wild-type polymeric NY-ESO-1 and CRT in an apparent macromolecular complex (Fig. 2C). The macromolecular complex, containing polymeric but not monomeric or low oligomeric NY-ESO-1 apparently shifted the mobility of CRT and TLR4, compared with those present in total cell lysates. Consistent with the pattern of binding between different versions of NY-ESO-1 and immature DC (Fig. 1D), the amount of mouse TLR4 co-precipitated with NY-ESO-1 decreased with the less extent of oligomerization (Fig. 2D). These experiments provided further evidence that NY-ESO-1 was able to bind mouse and possibly human DC through cell-surface TLR4. NY-ESO-1 and its oligomeric variants provided us with unique examples to study the effect of engaging TLR4 on the resultant adaptive immune responses. To avoid using recombinant proteins in vivo, endotoxin-free plasmid DNA encoding the wild-type NY-ESO-1 and its oligomeric variants, including the natural variant LAGE-1b, were used to immunize C57BL/10 and C57BL/10ScNJ (TLR4−/−) mice by a standard gene gun procedure (16Leitner W.W. Hwang L.N. deVeer M.J. Zhou A. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Dubensky T.W. Ying H. Restifo N.P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding β-gal and a membrane-anchored HMGB-1 were used as controls. Two immunizations were conducted at a two-week interval. Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were sacrificed for analysis of serum Ab titers. Antigen-specific, class-switched Ab was efficiently induced by a plasmid encoding NY-ESO-1 and the positive control plasmid pSport-β-gal in wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). Note that ESO(1–74) protein, containing a dominant B cell epitope shared by both NY-ESO-1 and its variants (18Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Wang Y. Pantuck A.J. Wang A.Y. Liu Y.X. Han Y. Yuan Y. H Robbins P.F. Dubinett S.M. deKernion J.B. Belldegrun A.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 114: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was used for measuring Ab to minimize the potential difference in binding to the wild-type NY-ESO-1 by Ab induced by oligomeric variants. Ab titers induced by ESOcs1 were somewhat reduced, whereas those by ESOcs2 and ESOcs3 were barely detectable. In TLR4 knock-out mice (Fig. 3B), NY-ESO-1-specific Ab induced by the plasmid encoding the wild-type protein was significantly decreased; whereas β-gal-specific Ab was essentially the same as in the wild-type mice. This experiment indicated the TLR4-dependent nature of the NY-ESO-1 Ab response, whereas the route (skin) and mechanism (gene gun delivery of plasmid) of immunization was independent of TLR4. Surprisingly, immunization with plasmid DNA encoding HMGB-1, a previously reported protein with potential interactions with TLR4, induced only marginal Ab in TLR4−/− mice (note that HMGB-1 Ab ELISA had a much lower background than NY-ESO-1 and β-gal, Fig. 3B) but not in wild-type mice with intact TLR4. NY-ESO-1 structural variants displayed a correlation between Ab titers and Cys-to-Ser mutations in wild-type mice, but a different pattern in TLR4 knock-out mice. For example, ESOcs1 induced relatively high Ab responses in wild-type but not TLR4 knock-out mice, assuming the same pattern of immunogenicity as the wild-type NY-ESO-1. In contrast, ESOcs2 induced relatively high titer Ab responses in TLR4 knock-out but not wild-type mice, contrasting wild-type NY-ESO-1 but resembling HMGB-1 in its immunogenicity. ESOcs3 remained barely immunogenic in both types of mice. This experiment indicated that IgG Ab responses elicited by NY-ESO-1 were accounted for by its oligomeric structure and the host TLR4 status in vivo. The fact that polymeric NY-ESO-1 engaged immature DC through cell-surface receptors and was highly immunogenic in mouse and human implied the potential role of NY-ESO-1 as a molecular adjuvant in vivo. The adjuvant effect of NY-ESO-1 on immune responses against allergens was then investigated in mice. A plasmid encoding NY-ESO-1 fused with Art v 1, the major allergen of mugwort pollen (19Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was delivered by gene gun to Balb/c mice. Wild-type Art v 1 (wtArt) was known for its poor immunogenicity in mice, for example, DNA vaccines encoding wtArt was nonimmunogenic in Balb/c mice but could be overcome by adapting the sequence of wtArt to mammalian codon usage (reconstituted Art) (20Bauer R. Himly M. Dedic A. Ferreira F. Thalhamer J. Hartl A. Allergy. 2003; 58: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fusion with NY-ESO-1 significantly increased the immunogenicity of wtArt and induced faster onset (Fig. 4A) of class-switched IgG after only one immunization. The IgG Ab induced by the fusion protein after one immunization was even more profound than those induced by reconstituted Art, which only reached a similar level only after a second immunization (Fig. 4A). In another instance, a plasmid DNA encoding fusion of human CA9 (21Hernández J.M. Bui M.H. Han K.R. Mukouyama H. Freitas D.G. Nguyen D. Caliliw R. Shintaku P.I. Paik S.H. Tso C.L. Figlin R.A. Belldegrun A.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1906-1916PubMed Google Scholar) with NY-ESO-1, pcDNA-CA9-ESO, was compared with pcDNA-CA9 encoding human CA9 alone after immunization via the intramuscular route. Balb/c mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the fusion protein effectively generated high titer Ab against both the NY-ESO-1 protein and the otherwise less immunogenic CA9 protein (Fig. 4B). In contrast, a plasmid encoding CA9 alone failed to induce class-switched Ab responses under the same conditions. The improvement of CA9 immunogenicity was dependent on the genetic fusion with NY-ESO-1 because a mixture of two plasmids, pcDNA-CA9 and pcDNA-ESO, did not improve the Ab titers under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4C). NY-ESO-1 is expressed in human cancers of the esophagus, prostate, breast, ovary, lung, stomach, head and neck, bladder, as well as neuroblastoma, hepatoma, myeloma, and melanoma. In normal tissues, NY-ESO-1 expression is restricted to the germ line cells of testis, ovary, and placenta (9Gnjatic S. Nishikawa H. Jungbluth A.A. Güre A.O. Ritter G. Jäger E. Knuth A. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2006; 95: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Even though NY-ESO-1 expression is much lower than most TAA in cancer cells (11Riker A.I. Kammula U.S. Panelli M.C. Wang E. Ohnmacht G.A. Steinberg S.M. Rosenberg S.A. Marincola F.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 818-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it naturally induces a profound helper T cell and class-switched Ab response in cancer patients (12Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Tian X. Seiler D. Zhang X. Jin Y. Rao J. Li W. Chen D. Langford M.P. Duggan C. Belldegrun A.S. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fact that spontaneous anti-NY-ESO-1 immune responses occur even in advanced stage cancers despite a severely immunosuppressive tumor environment provides an impetus for us to investigate intrinsic factors contributing to the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1. Following our previous report that NY-ESO-1/DC interactions through DC surface CRT might be accounted for the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 in human (12Zeng G. Aldridge M.E. Tian X. Seiler D. Zhang X. Jin Y. Rao J. Li W. Chen D. Langford M.P. Duggan C. Belldegrun A.S. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this study provides further details of the NY-ESO-1/DC interaction. Intrinsic factors from NY-ESO-1 and the host, i.e. polymeric structure of NY-ESO-1 and TLR4 were involved in the unique interaction between NY-ESO-1 and the immature DC. Both factors may have directly contributed to the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 in mouse and human. Along the same line, the following processes are presumably responsible for IgG Ab against NY-ESO-1 and its variants in the experiment described in Fig. 3: 1) B cell receptors cross-link and uptake antigens into B cells, which are then matured in the presence of IL-4 secreted by CD4+ T helper cells; 2) uptake of NY-ESO-1 by the CRT-TLR4 receptor complex on DC, which lead to generation of antigen-specific CD4+ T helper cells to provide powerful help to Ab-producing B cells. This study provides evidence that the later process is dependent on strong binding affinity between polymeric NY-ESO-1 and the DC surface CRT-TLR4 complex. On the other hand, we postulate that the former process may slightly favor ESOcs2, which is more soluble and accessible to B cell receptors than the wild-type NY-ESO-1 or ESOcs1. Thus, in wild-type mice, TLR4-dependent antigen uptake and specific helper T cell responses play major roles leading to strong Ab responses against polymeric NY-ESO-1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the B cell receptor-mediated process is the dominant factor in TLR4 knock-out animals, leading to relatively strong Ab responses against ESOcs2 (Fig. 3B). Based on the unique properties of polymeric NY-ESO-1 protein, we exploited its adjuvant effects in two circumstances: generation of prophylactic IgG class Ab against the mugwort pollen allergen Art v 1 and the cell-surface renal cell carcinoma antigen CA9. In both cases, high titer Ab responses were efficiently induced by the fusion genes delivered using a gene gun and via intramuscular injection, respectively. However, strength of the NY-ESO-1 adjuvant effect in comparison with other standard adjuvants has not been defined and will be investigated in future studies. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the natural immunogencity and the adjuvant effect of NY-ESO-1 in human: polymeric NY-ESO-1 released from necrotic tumor cells naturally engages immature DC through TLR4 and complement C1q receptor. In the literature, the complement C1q receptor is regarded the same as CRT and forms a receptor complex with TLR4 because CRT does not possess a transmembrane domain and has to interact laterally with a cell-surface receptor (22Chen D Texada D.E. Duggan C. Liang C. Reden T.B. Kooragayala L.M. Langford M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22425-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We postulate that due to its intrinsic immunogenicity, NY-ESO-1 expression is effectively shut down in normal tissues during evolution to avoid exposure to the innate immune system. In cancer cells, abruptly expressed NY-ESO-1 is released from the cytoplasm of necrotic tumors into the environment and initiates a cascade of immunological events, resulting in spontaneous immunity across many cancer types (Fig. 5). In this regard, we believe NY-ESO-1 assumes dual role as a TAA and its own adjuvant, thus can be categorized as a damage-associated molecular pattern. In summary, the proposed mechanism of action of the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 may find important implications as molecular adjuvants in autoimmune disease, allergy, infectious disease, and cancer immunotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2026949116,"Background Hispanics are known to be an extremely diverse and genetically admixed ethnic group. The lack of methodologies to control for ethnicity and the unknown admixture in complex study populations of Hispanics has left a gap in understanding certain cancer disparity issues. Incidence rates for oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) in Puerto Rico are among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. We conducted an epidemiological study to examine risk and protective factors, in addition to possible genetic susceptibility components, for oral cancer and precancer in Puerto Rico. Methodology/Principal Findings We recruited 310 Puerto Rico residents who had been diagnosed with either an incident oral squamous cell carcinoma, oral precancer, or benign oral condition. Participants completed an in-person interview and contributed buccal cells for DNA extraction. ABI Biosystem Taqman™ primer sets were used for genotyping 12 ancestry informative markers (AIMs). Ancestral group estimates were generated using maximum likelihood estimation software (LEADMIX), and additional principal component analysis was carried out to detect population substructures. We used unconditional logistic regression to assess the contribution of ancestry to the risk of being diagnosed with either an oral cancer or precancer while controlling for other potential confounders. The maximum likelihood estimates showed that study participants had a group average ancestry contribution of 69.9% European, 24.5% African, and 5.7% detectable Native American. The African and Indigenous American group estimates were significantly higher than anticipated. Neither self-identified ethnicity nor ancestry markers showed any significant associations with oral cancer/precancer risk in our study. Conclusions/Significance The application of ancestry informative markers (AIMs), specifically designed for Hispanics, suggests no hidden population substructure is present based on our sampling and provides a viable approach for the evaluation and control of ancestry in future studies involving Hispanic populations."
https://openalex.org/W2021794073,"Background As schizophrenia is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, targeting genetically informative phenotypes may help identify greater linkage signals. The aim of the study is to evaluate the genetic linkage evidence for schizophrenia in subsets of families with earlier age at onset or greater neurocognitive deficits. Methods Patients with schizophrenia (n = 1,207) and their first-degree relatives (n = 1,035) from 557 families with schizophrenia were recruited from six data collection field research centers throughout Taiwan. Subjects completed a face-to-face semi-structured interview, the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and were genotyped with 386 microsatellite markers across the genome. Results A maximum nonparametric logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 4.17 at 2q22.1 was found in 295 families ranked by increasing age at onset, which had significant increases in the maximum LOD score compared with those obtained in initial linkage analyses using all available families. Based on this subset, a further subsetting by false alarm rate on the undegraded and degraded CPT obtained further increase in the nested subset-based LOD on 2q22.1, with a score of 7.36 in 228 families and 7.71 in 243 families, respectively. Conclusion We found possible evidence of linkage on chromosome 2q22.1 in families of schizophrenia patients with more CPT false alarm rates nested within the families with younger age at onset. These results highlight the importance of incorporating genetically informative phenotypes in unraveling the complex genetics of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2154944229,"About 30% of the population of the United States suffers from acute or chronic pain, often of unknown cause. Among this group might be included patients with symptoms claimed to be caused by a poorly defined condition called ""chronic Lyme disease"" in which chronic pain is a major contributor. Since there is no evidence to indicate that chronic Lyme disease is due to a persistent infection and that extended antibiotic therapy is beneficial and safe, this condition should not be viewed solely as an infectious disease problem. Rather, it should be considered within the context of a broad-based, multidisciplinary approach to determining the cause of chronic pain per se and developing more effective strategies for its treatment as outlined in a recent report on pain issued by the Institute of Medicine."

The arginine (and lysine) substitutes for the third and the sixth residues (Ala-359 and Met-356, respectively) external to the outmost basic residue (Arg-362) in S4 dramatically and additively stabilize S4 in the resting conformation. Also, Leu-361 and Leu-358 play a very similar role in stabilization of S4 in the resting position, presumably by their hydrophobic side chains. Moreover, the double mutation A359R/E283A leads to a partially extruded position of S4 and consequently prominent closed-state inactivation, suggesting that Glu-283 in S2 may coordinate with the arginines in the extruded S4 upon depolarization. We conclude that the triad organization extends into the S3–4 linker for about six amino acids in terms of their microenvironment. These approximately six residues should retain the same helical structure as S4, and their microenvironment serves as part of the “gating canal” accommodating the extruding S4. Upon depolarization, S4 most likely moves initially as a sliding helix and follows the path that is set by the approximately six residues in the S3–4 linker in the resting state, whereas further S4 translocation could be more like, for example, a paddle, without orderly coordination from the contiguous surroundings. The highly conserved fourth transmembrane segment (S4) is the primary voltage sensor of the voltage-dependent channel and would move outward upon membrane depolarization.

S4 is comprised of a repetitive triad of one basic (and presumably voltage-sensing) residue followed by two hydrophobic ones. Membrane depolarization (and hyperpolarization) would move S4 and transfer maximally three to four triads (i.e. a three to four elementary charge) for an S4 across the membrane field (1Larsson H.P.

Several different models of S4 motion were forwarded based on experimental results and simulation data from structural and functional studies (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two major ones are the conventional “helical screw” model and the “paddle” model initiated from crystallographic studies (6Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

The two models predict different moving scales of S4, namely 3–13 Å and 15–20 Å, respectively. Moreover, the screw model stands for sequential interactions of S4 charges with an appropriate microenvironment such as a “gating canal” that accommodates the moving S4, whereas the paddle model suggests a sliding of a helix-turn-helix paddle, which contains parts of S4 and the S3–4 linker as a charged cargo and does not have the foregoing sequential or orderly coordination for the amino acids in S4 (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

In other words, the essence of the helical-screw model implies that each of the three residues in a triad may, respectively, move to the corresponding position of its preceding triad like a ratchet, whereas the paddle model implies a large-scale movement of a charged cargo without clearly predefined intermediate steps. Although several modified models have been suggested, a consensus is yet to be reached, and many key questions remain (14Chanda B. Asamoah O.K. Blunck R. Roux B. Bezanilla F.

Both functional and structural findings agree that two conserved acidic residues (Glu-283 and Glu-293 in Shaker K+ channels) in S2 may, respectively, act as countercharges of the third and the fourth arginines (Arg-3 and Arg-4) in S4 in the activated state, and the former acidic residue may also interact with the outmost arginine (Arg-1) in S4 in the resting state (11Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

Physiol. 2010; 135: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The existence of these countercharge interactions, however, cannot directly argue for or against either model. For the helical-screw model, it is desirable to have a more systemic perspective on the sequential coordination of the repetitive triads in S4 during channel gating. For the paddle model, a more comprehensive view on the spatial distribution of the negative countercharges, and consequently the pattern of paddle movement, seems mandatory. Previously, we reported that a hydrophobic residue Leu-361 (which is located just external to the outmost arginine Arg-362 in S4) in the S3–4 linker is important for stabilization of S4 in the resting Shaker K+ channel (23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Together with a recent report that the gating canal could also be occupied by Ala-359 (24Gamal El-Din T.M. Heldstab H. Lehmann C. Greeff N.G. Channels. 2010; 4: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these findings imply an imperative effect of the external extension of S4 (the S3–4 linker) and/or its microenvironment on the positioning of S4. We therefore did mutational scanning of the S3–4 linker residues in the Shaker K+ channel. We found that the microenvironment surrounding a short segment (containing approximately six amino acids up to Met-356) external to S4 preserves the “pitch” of repetitive triads, presumably designated to accommodate S4 residues upon channel activation. As a result, the initial outward movement of S4 for roughly two triads may be well confined by a gating canal immediately outside S4. Without such a structuralized microenvironment, the subsequent movement, however, may employ a more “liberal” and probably larger scale path to complete the total transfer of three to four triads (three to four charges) across the membrane field. The Shaker GH4 K+ channel cDNA (Shaker H4 channels with the addition of three “silent” restriction enzyme sites and a Xenopus α-globin untranslated sequence) was used (23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Point mutations were done with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) on both the wild-type cDNA and the N terminus (6–46 residues) deleted construct (the fast inactivation-removed or IR channels). Both DNA sequencing and biophysical examination were performed to verify the mutations. The full-length cRNA transcript was then synthesized using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). To isolate oocytes, mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthetized by cold water and 1.7 gl−1 of tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid, Sigma) and allowed to recover immediately after the surgery. All animal procedures were under the supervision of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in National Taiwan University College of Medicine and College of Public Health and that in Chang Gung University. Defolliculated Xenopus oocytes (stage V–VI) were injected with the cRNA transcript and then maintained at 18 °C for 1–5 days before electrophysiological recordings. When recording, the oocyte was continuously perfused by ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Voltage-sensing and current-passing electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (serial resistance, 0.1–0.4 megohms). Methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET, Toronto Research Chemicals) was stocked at −70 °C and was freshly prepared before use. Data were acquired with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (model OC-725C, Warner Instruments) at room temperature (∼25 °C) and pCLAMP software and digitized at a 20–100-μs interval using a Digidata 1200 analog/digital interface (MDS Analytical Technologies). The WT data were performed in parallel with the mutant data from time to time, and we found little change of results among batches of oocytes. All averaged data are given as mean ± S.E. To plot the inactivation curves, the oocyte was held at −120 mV and stepped every 3 s to the inactivating pulse for 100 ms and then to a test pulse of 0 mV (or +70 mV for FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, where the activation curves may be dramatically positively shifted by mutation) to elicit currents. The peak current after each inactivating pulse is normalized to the maximal peak current and plotted against the voltage (V) of the inactivating pulse. The plot is fitted with a Boltzmann function: 1/(1 + exp((V − V½)/k)), where V½ is the half-inactivating potential, and k is the slope factor. To plot the normalized conductance-voltage curves (activation curves), the oocyte expressing the fast IR variant of the wild-type or mutant Shaker K+ channel was subjected to a series of test pulses increased by a 10-mV step to elicit K+ currents. The holding potential was −120 mV. The normalized conductance is obtained from the normalized current increase (to the maximal increase) in each 10-mV step and is plotted against the test-pulse voltage where each 10-mV step begins. The plot is fitted with a Boltzmann function 1/(1 + exp((V½ − V)/k)). The rising phase of the macroscopic currents of the IR channel and the decay phase of the macroscopic currents of the fast inactivation-intact channel are fitted with monoexponential functions to obtain the activation and inactivation time constants (τ), respectively. For the double-mutant cycle analysis (25Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) based on the shift of the activation curves in the double mutant and either component single mutant channels, the free energy change (ΔΔG) for each mutant is derived from the product of V½ and the equivalent gating charges (derived from RT/Fk) in the mutant channel minus that in the wild-type channel (R, T, and F have their usual biophysical meanings). The interaction energy ΔΔGinter is equal to the difference between the ΔΔG of the double mutant channel and the sum of ΔΔG in each of component single mutant channels.FIGURE 5The effect of E283A mutation on the A359R mutant channel. A and B, the averaged free energy changes in the double mutant channels involving either A359R (A) or M356R (B) and in related component single mutant channels are compared in terms of the shift of the activation curve. (For details, see text and “Experimental Procedures;” n = 5 for each mutant.) The open circle indicates the sum of free energy changes in component single mutant channels. The rectangle highlights the largest interaction energy between E283A and A359R. C and D, the inactivation curve (D) but not the activation curve (C) is split into two components in the E283A/A359R double mutant channel. The WT curves are from Fig. 1. E, the activation rates are paradoxically slowed by more depolarized holding potentials in the IR A359R/E283A channel. The representative currents are elicited by a step depolarization to +70 mV from a series of 300-ms prepulse potentials (−120 mV to 0 mV). Note that the rising phase of the macroscopic currents differs with different prepulse potentials, and the macroscopic activation rate is saturating when the prepulse voltage approaches either −120 mV or 0 mV. The arrow indicates zero current level. F, the averaged macroscopic activation time constant (τ, measured by an exponential fit of the rising phase of macroscopic currents in E) is plotted against the prepulse voltage (n = 8). The line is the best fit to the data with the Boltzmann function, with a V½ value of −53.6 mV and a k value of 11.6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously found that the hydrophobicity of Leu-361, an S3–4 linker residue next to the outmost Arg-362 in S4, is important for stabilization of S4 in the resting Shaker K+ channel (23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Leu-358, the third residue external to Leu-361, plays a very similar functional role to Leu-361. Exactly analogous to the cases with L361R or L361K mutation, the L358R or L358K mutant channel is activated and inactivated at much more hyperpolarized membrane potentials with apparently less voltage dependence when compared with the WT channel (Fig. 1, A–C). The changes are not significantly different between arginine and lysine substitutions, and the shifts of the activation and the inactivation curves are quantitatively similar (Fig. 1, B and C, see also Fig. 2E). The latter finding is consistent with a shifted equilibrium between resting and activated states of the mutant channel, based on a simplistic gating model that fast inactivation happens downstream of activation in Shaker K+ channels. In addition, compared with the WT channel, the macroscopic kinetics of activation and inactivation in both L358R and L358K mutant channels are much faster at relatively negative test voltages but would seem to reach similar saturating rates at more positive pulses (Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these findings suggest a destabilized S4 in the resting L358R and L358K mutant channels, exactly the same as what was proposed for the Leu-361 mutation (23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). If the aligned arginine residues in S4 helix are designated as the “R” line, we may have two lines of hydrophobic residues designated as “R−1” and “R+1” lines, respectively. In this regard, both Leu-361 and Leu-358 belong to the R−1 line (see schematic illustration in Fig. 8). The similar findings of Leu-361 and Leu-358 mutations therefore strongly suggest a functional extension of the repetitive triads (and thus the R−1 line) from S4 into the adjacent S3–4 linker. Moreover, the hydrophobic residues in the R−1 line of the S3–4 linker immediately adjacent to S4 may play a critical role in the positioning of S4 in the resting channels.FIGURE 2The activation and inactivation curves of the L358Q, L358F, A355R, and A355K mutant channels (n = 5–6).

Because the k value is only a rough estimate of the gating changes from the fitting curve and is in general varied within a reasonable small range of 5–8, the values are reported without further statistical analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 8A, a schematic showing that the amino acids in the S4 helix are arranged in repetitive triads and aligned as R, R−1, and R+1 lines. The helix is drawn with three amino acids per turn for the sake of simplicity in presentation. (There is no intention to designate S4 as a 310-helical structure, and this figure can be easily redrawn as an α-helix with all of the arguments unchanged.) The relative positions of S4 and presumable countercharges are shown based on a resting channel with fully retracted S4 (see also C). The green bar denotes the cell membrane. The filled circles with negative signs and the dotted circle (showing the position of E283A) represent the putative microenvironment responsible for coordination of R line residues. B, a summary of averaged shifts of gating curves with arginine or lysine substitutions for different S3–4 linker residues. Data are taken from Figs. 2E and 4F (except that the data for Leu-361 mutations are from Ref. 23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). C, a schematic model describing the possible interaction of the R line residues with their microenvironment during outward movement of S4. The same rationale may also apply to the microenvironment for the R−1 and R+1 lines (not depicted). S4 is presented as a gold rectangular bar with the three outermost arginines (Arg-362, Arg-365, and Arg-368) indicated at its top, followed by other R line residues shown as positive signs. The position of S4 residues relative to the cell membrane is consistent with previous findings (4Yang N. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 35Yang N. Horn R.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The other part of the channel that constitutes the S4 gating canal presumably provides negative countercharges or other suitable microenvironment, part of which are shown as negative signs to accommodate the arginines. The red circles mark where the interactions with arginines occur. E283A is marked as a dotted black circle without a negative sign to designate loss of the countercharge due to mutation. Here, we simplistically illustrate the movement of S4 as translational. Also, in the resting wild-type channel, S4 is depicted to have a pair of charge-charge interaction at its top for simplicity. The argument would remain the same if S4 movement involves rotation and if there are more pairs of interaction. See the text for more details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further documented possible changes in the activation and inactivation curves by other substitutions for Leu-358. Again, similar to the cases of Leu-361 (23Yang Y.C. Own C.J. Kuo C.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), neutral hydrophilic glutamine substitution for Leu-358 causes shallower and leftward-shifted activation and inactivation curves. The quantity of shift (∼30 mV) is almost the same as that by L358K or L358R (Fig. 2, A, B, and E). On the other hand, neutral hydrophobic substitution such as L358F only slightly shifts the activation and inactivation curves rightward. These findings support a similar contribution of R−1 line residues, Leu-358 and Leu-361, to channel gating, possibly via hydrophobic interaction between leucine and the microenvironment. It seems that the explicit triad organization of amino acid residues in S4 implicitly extends into the S3–4 linker in terms of the organization of the “S4 canal,” presumably serving to accommodate an extruded S4 upon depolarization. In this regard, there is only minor or negligible change (shifts smaller than 10 mV considered as energetically negligible change) in the activation and inactivation curves with either A355K or A355R mutations (Fig. 2, C–E), suggesting that the “implicit triads” in the S4 canal do not reach the level of Ala-355. In light of the findings of functional extension of the R−1 line into the S3–4 linker, we then examined whether this extension is also the case for the R line, presumably the main voltage-sensing part in S4. We made arginine and lysine substitutions for Ala-359 and Met-356, the third and the sixth residues external to Arg-362 (the outmost arginine in S4), respectively. In contrast to the prominent leftward shift of the gating curves with arginine or lysine in the extended R−1 line, arginine or lysine substitution for either Met-356 or Ala-359 shifts both the activation and inactivation curves rightward by ∼20 mV in the voltage axis (Fig. 3, A and B, see also Fig. 4F). Moreover, both macroscopic activation and inactivation rates are slowed rather than accelerated over a wide range of test voltages (Fig. 3, C and D). These data are consistent with the idea that the addition of a positive charge in the immediate external extension of the R line would help stabilize the S4 voltage sensor in the resting state (presumably a retracted position of S4). Thus, the repeating triplet organization of the S4 canal once more seems to extend beyond S4 and into the adjacent S3–4 linker. Because arginine substitution for Asn-353 has little effect on the activation and inactivation curves (Fig. 3, E and F), the R line extension probably ends at Met-356. This would indicate a functional extension of the triplet organization beyond S4 for two more repeats, consistent with the finding for the R−1 line (Fig. 2). Positive charge substitutions for Met-356 and those for Ala-359 show quantitatively very similar effects (Fig. 3). To answer the question whether their effects are ascribed to the same (overlapping) or different (separate) molecular interactions, we made a double mutation containing both A359R and M356R. In the A359R/M356R double mutant channels, the activation and inactivation curves are shifted by approximately the sum of the shift by either single mutation (A359R or M356R, Fig. 4, A–C and F). The additive effect indicates separate or independent interactions of A359 and M356 with their respective corresponding environments for stabilization or positioning of S4. Consistently, the kinetics of macroscopic activation and inactivation are much more slowed by the double mutation than the single mutations (Fig. 4, D and E, compared with Fig. 3, C and D). In search of the corresponding microenvironment that interacts with A359R or M356R (and thus the presumable coordinating ligands for the R line residues during S4 movement), we scanned four acidic residues, Glu-283, Glu-293, Asp-316, and Glu-418, that are previously reported as possible countercharges for the S4 arginines. We neutralized each of the acidic residues, made paired mutations with either A359R or M356R, and then documented the gating changes in the single and double mutant channels. Among the mutations examined, the result of double mutant cycle analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) shows that the largest interaction energy is between E283A and A359R (approximately ∼3 RT, consistent with the expected value for a salt bridge between arginine and glutamate side chains, Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, only in the E283A/A359R double mutant channel, the inactivation curve is intriguingly split into two parts. This is as if a closed-state inactivation is made manifest (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, the activation curve is shifted toward the right but well described by one Boltzmann function with a shallower slope rather than split into two parts (Fig. 5C). These findings can be explained if Glu-283 contributes to the coordination and stabilization of A359R (and S4) in the resting position, presumably via a salt bridge. With neutralization of Glu-283, A359R (and thus S4) probably would tend to move to another energetically favorable substituting microenvironment (e.g. another countercharge, see schematic model in Fig. 8). This new, double mutation-caused position of S4 probably stabilizes a closed-state inactivation. In other words, this mutant channel tends to be partially inactivated without significant activation at relatively more hyperpolarized membrane potentials (e.g. −60 mV, Fig. 5, C and D). Further movement of S4 is still required for channel activation and complete inactivation (as inferred by the matched range of membrane potential between the activation curve and the second part of the inactivation curve, Fig. 5, C and D). This model is consistent with the proposal from previous studies that S4 movement drives a number of closed states before channel opening, although these closed states may not be stable enough to be significantly populated at equilibrium in the wild-type channel (26Schoppa N.E.
