https://openalex.org/W2040351161,"Electrostatic effects dominate many aspects of protein behavior. When polypeptide chains fold up, most polar side chains seek the exterior, where they can be solvated. Water bound in the interior has been found between the domains of enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, and between the subunits of hemoglobin and tobacco mosaic virus protein. Assembly of this protein from disk to virus is triggered by electrostatic interactions between neighboring subunits. Lysozyme stabilizes the constellation of charges involved in the transition state of its substrate by both permanent and induced dipoles. All factors that lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin act by strengthening the salt bridges that constrain its quaternary deoxy (T) structure. Enzymes of thermophile bacteria owe their extra stability mostly to additional salt bridges. The rate of denaturation of hemoglobins by alkali is determined by the ionization of internal side chains with pK's of about 12."

https://openalex.org/W2049190580,"Chicks whose vision was restricted to the frontal visual field became extremely myopic (mean, -10 diopters; maximum, -24 diopters) and had eyes of increased axial length. Animals restricted to lateral field vision did not differ from normal animals. Monocular deprivation of form vision also produced myopia and eye enlargement and, in addition, produced increased anterior chamber depth."

https://openalex.org/W2046555779,"Volunteer subjects with previous histories of cocaine use were administered cocaine hydrochloride intravenously or intranasally. There was a positive relationship between peak plasma concentration, physiological and subjective responses, and dose administered. The rate of cocaine disappearance after intravenous administration paralleled the drop in physiological and subjective drug effects. After intranasal administration, blood levels remained elevated for a considerably longer period."
https://openalex.org/W2078825043,"This report describes a simple method for the preparation of transcriptionally active and inactive chromatins from the hen oviduct. Oviduct nuclei were incubated with micrococcal nuclease until 2–3% of the DNA was rendered acid-soluble. The nuclear suspension was centrifuged following digestion. The resulting first supernatant fraction (1SF) contained chromatin particles released from intact nuclei. The nuclei in the sediment were lysed and centrifuged again to yield a pellet and a second supernatant fraction (2SF). DNA extracted from the 1SF and 2SF were hybridized to radioactive DNA complementary to purified ovalbumin mRNA for quantitation of ovalbumin genes. The results demonstrated that 1SF DNA was 5–6 fold enriched in the ovalbumin gene as compared to total nuclear DNA, whereas 2SF DNA was 5–6 fold depleted in this transcribed sequence. The fractionation procedure is related to transcriptional activity since nonexpressed genes such as the gene for ovalbumin in hen liver and the genes for globin in the oviduct were not preferentially localized in 1SF DNA. Electrophoretic analysis of the DNA in the active fraction (1SF) revealed a single band which corresponded to mononucleosome-length DNA (145–200 base pairs). Larger molecular weight oligonucleosome fragments were observed in the 2SF. To determine whether the fractionation of the ovalbumin gene was related to DNA fragment length, 1SF and 2SF DNA were combined and separated into four size classes by preparative electrophoresis. Hybridization studies revealed that the concentration of the ovalbumin coding sequence in mononucleosome-length DNA was 5 fold greater than in undigested DNA, and 16 fold greater than in the fraction containing DNA fragments >1200 bp in length. The concentration of transcriptionally inactive genes in mononucleosome-length DNA, in contrast, was equivalent to their concentration in the larger molecular weight DNA fragments. These results suggest that micrococcal nuclease selectively excises nucleosomes from oviduct chromatin containing the ovalbumin gene. This selectivity permits the recovery of mononucleosomes in the 1SF which are enriched in the ovalbumin gene and oligonucleosomes in the 2SF which are depleted in this sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2015522802,"Even in the absence of eye movements, we show that subjects are able, upon instruction, to selectively attend to certain kinds of targets and parts of visual arrays. The major mechanism of altering attention is the switching of attention from trial to trial, although intermediate states of shared attention do occur. Attention operating characteristics are shown to be a useful way of describing such data and of assessing the compatibility of tasks to be performed simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2025485968,"Explants of human chorion-decidual tissue obtained at delivery from normal, full-term pregnancies synthesize and secrete prolactin. This hormone is indistinguishable from pituitary prolactin by chromatographic, electrophoretic, immunologic, and receptor assay techniques. These results suggest that chorion-decidua may be the source of the large quantities of prolactin in amniotic fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2000062730,"Exogenously added prostaglandins E1 and E2, but not F2alpha, inhibited the tumoricidal activity of interferon-activated macrophages of mice. A role for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in modulating macrophage functional activity was suggested because prostaglandins of the E series increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP in macrophages and because treatment of interferon-activated macrophages with dibutyryl cyclic AMP consistently inhibits expression of cytotoxicity. Since the activated macrophage releases high concentrations of prostaglandin E2, it is postulated that this prostaglandin could act locally in negative feedback inhibition to limit cell activities."
https://openalex.org/W1967807986,"The nudibranch mollusk Hermissenda crassicornis is normally attracted to a test light. Three days of training consisting of 50 trials per day of light paired with a rotational stimulus led to a significant increase, lasting for days, in the animal's response latency to enter a test light. The group that received light associated with rotation was significantly different from groups subjected to nonassociative control procedures. Modifications of well-known sensory networks may be related to a behavioral change that shares several operational features with associative learning."

https://openalex.org/W2093853078,"A group of RNAs 90--100 nucleotides long were isolated by melting them from poly(A)-terminated nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA from cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Conditions that favor hydrogen bond formation allowed the reassociation of these low molecular weight RNAs with poly(A)-terminated RNA. The nuclear poly(A)-terminated molecules contained 1.3 moles of the low molecular weight RNAs per mole of poly(A), while the cytoplasmic poly(A)-terminated RNA contained only one seventh as much. These low molecular weight RNAs were also isolated from the total 4S RNA of either the nucleus or cytoplasm by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They formed a prominantly labeled band of RNA in the gels after cells had been labeled with H(3)32PO4 for 4 hr. The low molecular weight RNAs melted from the nuclear poly(A)-terminated RNA were slightly different (although not necessarily in primary nucleotide sequence) from those melted from the cytoplasmic poly(A)-terminated RNA."

The amount begins to decrease in the second semester of life, and the incidence declines during the third year. The unanticipated results bear on both the etiology and the neural sequelae of astigmatism."

https://openalex.org/W1990337270,"Two female chimeric mice have been produced by aggregates of three genetically marked eight-cell embryos. All three embryonic genotypes are clearly expressed in the pigment pattern of the adults. These hexaparental mice together with their littermates demonstrate that, in the 64-celled blastocyst, at least three cells, and probably only three, are the source of all adult tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1985831025,"We have analyzed human cellular DNA for its δ- and β-globin gene sequence content by separation of restriction enzyme fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis; transfer of the DNA fragments to nitrocellulose filters; hybridization of filters with 32P-β-globin cDNA; and analysis by autoradiography. A short cDNA has been used to identify specifically the 3′ end of the genes and to orient the fragments. A comparison of the globin gene fragments generated by normal and Lepore DNA has been used to distinguish fragments representing DNA sequences between the δ and β genes and those containing sequences flanking either 5′ to the δ gene or 3′ to the β gene. The results indicate that unique restriction fragments are presented in normal DNA and absent in Lepore DNA, and allow preliminary ordering of these fragments on a restriction enzyme map. In addition, the Lepore, δ- and β-globin genes have been found to contain at least one inserted nucleotide sequence of about 1000 bases which is not represented in mature globin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2067533199,"Photorefraction of a sample of 93 infants of ages 1 day to 12 months showed that 63 percent of the subjects had astigmatism of 0.75 diopter or greater, and 12 percent greater than 2 diopters. Seventy percent of these astigmatisms were in the horizontal-vertical meridians. By comparison, only 8 percent of a sample of 26 adults tested by the same method showed astigmatism (all 0.75 to 1 diopter). The high incidence of infant astigmatism has implications for critical periods in human visual development and for infant acuity."
https://openalex.org/W2043259363,"A site-specific inversion event is responsible for phase transition in Salmonella, as indicated by heteroduplex analysis of recombinant molecules carrying the gene coding for H2 flagellin in Salmonella. The inversion region corresponds to approximately 800 base pairs in length, and the inversion process does not appear to be dependent upon the E. coli RecA recombination pathway. Specific deletion derivatives of the cloned fragments no longer produce H2-specific flagella, effectively mapping the H2 gene within about 300 bp of the inversion region. Recombinant products of the hybrid molecules arose spontaneously, and they were used in the mapping of restriction sites within the inversion region. The restriction maps further demonstrate the extent and nature of the inversion."

Hence, the concentration of acetylcholine in the tissues may normally be under direct, short-term nutritional control."
https://openalex.org/W1967392322,"Nine cloned repetitive sequences were labeled, strand-separated and individually hybridized with RNA extracted from the nuclei of gastrula stage sea urchin embryos and of adult sea urchin intestine cells. The concentration of transcripts complementary to each cloned sequence was measured by RNA excess hybridization kinetics and by a DNA excess titration method. Transcripts of certain of the repeat families are present at over 100 times the concentration of transcripts of other families in each RNA. The set of repetitive sequence families highly represented in intestine nuclear RNA is different from that highly represented in gastrula nuclear RNA. Together with the results obtained with mature oocyte RNA and presented in the accompanying paper by Costantini et al. (1978), these findings show that quantitative patterns of repetitive sequence representation in RNA are specific to each cell type. Both strands of all of the nine cloned repeats are represented at some level in all the RNAs studied. Usually, though not always, the concentrations of transcripts complementary to the two strands of each repeat do not differ by more than a factor of two. The cloned tracers do not react with polysomal messenger RNA, and the nuclear RNA molecules with which they hybridize are many times larger than the repetitive sequences themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2048945446,"Crystals and other regular arrangements of nucleosome cores have been obtained and analyzed in the electron microscope. Two types of regular structures have been studied in detail, the nucleosome arcs and cylinders. The latter are composed of concentric cylindrical layers of intertwined right-handed helices of nucleosome cores. These studies lead to the following conclusions and concepts. The overall structure of the nucleosome core is a short, wedge-shaped cylinder measuring about 110 by 110 by 60 angstroms. Nucleosome cores interact primarily between top and bottom planes. Nucleosome cores exhibit large conformational variability. A pivot allowing two degrees of rotational freedom is postulated in the region of the 70th base pair to account for this property of the nucleosome."

https://openalex.org/W2046068894,"The primary structure of the coat protein messenger RNA of turnip yellow mosaic virus is presented. This sequence is the first complete nucleotide sequence of the coat protein messenger of a plant virus to be reported. The coding region, consisting of 567 nucleotides, is flanked by a 5' noncoding region of 19 nucleotides (not including the initiation codon and the cap structure) and by a 3' noncoding region of 109 nucleotides (including the termination signal). The coat protein mRNA has a base composition identical to that of the genome RNA with, in particular, the same high content in cytosine (38%). The codons that govern the incorporation of amino acids into the coat protein are nonrandomly utilized: is greater than 50% of the time the third base of the codons used is a cytosine. This pattern of codon preference is particularly marked for Leu, lle Val, Thr and Cys."
https://openalex.org/W1984028980,"Rats 16 days old received passive-avoidance training in the presence or absence of home litter cues. Rats trained in the context of home litter cues learned the passive avoidance reliably faster than rats trained in isolation. In the presence of home litter cues, 16-day-old rats also exhibited more adultlike spontaneous alternation. Pavlovian conditioning of rats trained at 2 days of age was studied in the presence and absence of conspecifics. These experiments suggest that deficiencies in inhibitory behaviors and conditioning associated with immaturity can be alleviated when the testing environment is made more similar to the home environment."

https://openalex.org/W1984986569,"In the presence of dUTP, net DNA synthesis in vitro is substantially reduced. Small DNA fragments that arise during in vitro DNA synthesis in the presence of dUTP are produced as a result of dUMP incorporation and subsequent post-replication excision repair process initiated by uracil-DNA-glycosylase. The size of the fragments is dependent upon the amount of dUMP incorporated, but unlike the normal 4S intermediates of DNA synthesis, these repair products are not precursors to high molecular weight DNA but are further degraded. The high levels of dUTPase as well as the presence of RNA primers on most nascent DNA pieces (Tseng and Goulian, 1977) suggest that repair of uracil-containing DNA does not contribute to the generation of the small, nascent DNA pieces found during DNA synthesis in this in vitro system."

https://openalex.org/W2045074448,"The synthesis of histones and DNA was examined in BHK cells arrested in G1 by isoleucine starvation and in cells progressing into the S phase upon isoleucine refeeding. Approximately 2-3% of the cells were not arrested in G1 and synthesized DNA. The rate of synthesis of DNA and nucleosomal histones observed in cells starved for isoleucine could be accounted for by the presence of these asynchronous cells. Synthesis of H1 histones by cells in G1, however, was 3 times that of the nucleosomal histones and approximately 15% of the rate of H1 histone synthesis in mid-S. Upon entry into S, the histones were synthesized in the same molar ratio in which they are present in chromatin. The possible biological significance of H1 histone synthesis in G1 cells and its implications for the regulatory mechanisms controlling histome synthesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2001237586,"Surgical removal of colon carcinomas leads to a decrease in the rate of incorporation of [14C]fucose into its endogenous acceptor in human serum; normal incorporation rates are attained within 14 days. A similar time course has been determined for alpha2- and alpha3-fucosyltransferase when either desialo- or desialodegalactofetuin are employed as exogenous acceptors. A correlation has also been seen between transferase activity and the therapeutic response of patients with breast cancer. These results indicate that the determination of fucosyltransferase activity can facilitate the diagnosis of neoplasia, and the success of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2041731182,"The thermophilic mycoplasma Thermoplasma acidophilum has tightly bound to its DNA a protein that closely resembles the histones of eukaryotes. DNA associated with this protein is more stable than free DNA against thermal denaturation by about 40 degrees C, as shown in both native nucleoprotein and in hybrid nucleoprotein reconstituted in vitro with calf DNA. Since only about 20 percent of the DNA in this organism is associated with the histone-like protein, we suggest that its physiological function is to prevent complete separation of the DNA strands during brief exposures of the organism to denaturing conditions, and thus to facilitate rapid renaturation when normal environmental conditions return."
https://openalex.org/W2018397718,Human sleep is characterized by episodes of immobility punctuated by major postural shifts. The organization of this motor activity was shown with a combination of photographic and electroencephalographic recording to be periodic and related to the electroencephalographic sleep cycle. The amount of immobility as measured photographically was positively related to subjective estimates of the goodness of sleep.
https://openalex.org/W2074247301,"RNA transcribed in isolated sea urchin nuclei and assayed by hybridization to histone genes cloned in E. coli contains sequences homologous to each of the five histone genes. Histone RNA is synthesized exclusively from the same DNA strand which is the template in vivo. Synthesis of the histone gene transcripts is sensitive to alpha-amanitin concentrations which inhibit RNA polymerase II activity. The fraction of histone RNA synthesized in vitro is comparable at two developmental stages to the fraction synthesized in vivo. The nuclear histone transcripts contain sequences homologous to spacer DNA regions present between the coding regions of the 6500 base pair (bp) histone gene repeat unit. The transcription of spacer sequences was demonstrated by hybridization of the nuclear transcripts to subcloned spacer DNA. Although the bulk of the RNA transcripts are greater than 2000 bases long, the histone-specific transcripts are of discrete sizes ranging from 100 bases to about 1100 bases long. Each histone gene hybridizes with at least one of the larger transcripts and with a different subset of smaller RNAs. We do not detect any giant polycistronic transcript spanning the entire histone repeat unit."
https://openalex.org/W2026383751,"Sequential Giemsa-11 and C-band staining of the heterochromatic region of chromosome 1 from 30 unrelated individuals revealed a high degree of variability within this region, more than was identifiable with either stain alone. The Giemsa-11 stained material usually appeared as a single band of only slightly varying size within the heterochromatic region. The position of this band ranged from a location immediately adjacent to the centromere, to one farther along the long arm or at the junction of the C-band heterochromatin and euchromatin. Two individuals had a chromosome 1 with no detectable Giemsa-11 band but an average-size C-band. Two others with a large heterochromatic segment by C-banding had two Giemsa-11 positive bands. Additional studies of five members of one family were consistent with transmission of these heteromorphisms in codominant Mendelian fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2016841775,"Picosecond spectroscopy is a relatively new field of science that utilizes ultrashort laser pulses to monitor events taking place in the 10(-12) second regime. The continuing development of picosecond spectroscopy has made possible the detection and measurement of the primary events in many physical and tiological processes. This article describes a currently used picosecond spectroscopy system that is capable of reliably recording picosecond events. Two areas of picosecond research are discussed; one concerns the interaction of electrons in fluids, and the second the primary events in vision."
https://openalex.org/W1969546826,"Response saturation of blue-sensitive cone pathways was studied by measuring increment thresholds for violet test flashes on flashed violet fields in the presence of a steady yellow ""auxiliary"" field of constant radiance. Adding intense yellow field flashes to the violet field flash could eliminate or reduce response saturation (greatly reduce threshold), whereas ""negative"" yellow field flashes drove the mechanism to further saturation. The response saturation is thus not, in general, controlled exclusively by independent blue-sensitive cones but by spectrally opponent mechanisms that receive opposite-signed signals from blue-sensitive cones and from green- or red-sensitive cones. These results add to a growing number of studies that demonstrate that detection of signals from blue-sensitive cones is largely through a color-opponent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2074664699,The effect of immune RNA treatment on the incidence of death from pulmonary metastases was studied in C57BL/6J mice after excision of a B16 murine melanoma. Immune RNA was extracted from the lymphoid tissues of guinea pigs immunized with B16 tumor and then incubated in vitro with normal C57BL/6J mouse splenocytes. Mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of these RNA-treated syngeneic splenocytes after the primary B16 isograft was resectioned showed significantly improved long-term survival (42 to 67 percent in three successive experiments) as compared to control mice (0 to 20 percent survival) receiving untreated splenocytes. The effect of RNA treatment was tumor-specific and ribonuclease sensitive. The results suggest that immunotherapy with immune RNA may be of benefit to certain patients after surgery for cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2092566771,New treatments are aimed at correcting the 2 major causes of female infertility: failure to ovulate and obstruction of the fallopian tubes. Bromocriptine a drug which inhibits prolactin secretion is currently being used in the U.S. for the short-term treatment of women with both amenorrhea and galactorrhea but has not yet been approved for the treatment of infertility. In England however bromocriptine treatment has been effective in inducing pregnancy in women with hyperprolactinemia a leading cause of infertility. It has also helped women with pituitary tumors to become pregnant. Women with normal levels of prolactin are being treated with clomiphene citrate or human menopausal gonadotropin. The former is the drug of choice as it is less likely to overstimulate the ovaries. A synthetic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone which acts on the pituitary has been in use in a New Orleans hospital since 1971 and effective in 30% of patients; however the ideal dosage and mode of administration have not yet been established. Blocked fallopian tubes are present in an estimated 40% of women seeking treatment for infertility. Microsurgery has a 75% success rate (in terms of pregnancy) on women who had been sterilized by having a section of their tubes looped out and tied but only a 20% success rate in cases of extensive tubal infection e.g. from gonorrhea. There are as yet few treatments for infertile men mainly because diagnosis is more difficult than in the female. In addition there is lack of agreement on the number of sperm necessary for fertility. Estimates range from 60 to 20 million sperm/millileter semen but according to recent studies the number may be 10 or lower. The measurement of sperm quality is also difficult. Sperm morphology may be a better indicator of quality than motility. Men with a large proportion of abnormally shaped sperm may be infertile because such sperm contain defective chromosomes.
