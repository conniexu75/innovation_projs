This may provide a promising approach to nanodevice fabrication. The dependence of the critical voltage on tunneling current, tip polarity, and tip material was studied with silver, gold, platinum, and tungsten tips. The results are consistent with field emission of positive and negative silicon ions. The variation of critical voltage with current is explained quantitatively by a simple tunneling equation that includes the effect of the contact potential between tip and sample."
https://openalex.org/W2014348999,"In 1891 Zuntz (6) presented the view that bacteria in the rumen of animals utilize nonprotein nitrogenous compounds to form protein, which in turn was used by the animals. In recent years it has been conclusively shown that protein is formed in the rumen from dietary urea and ammonium salts. The protein thus formed appears to be of relatively low biological value (3-5) but, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to measure the amino acid composition of protein synthesized in the"

This was made possible by the discovery of a stela with a long inscription at La Mojarra, Veracruz, Mexico, in 1986. This decipherment is based on both a reconstruction of the early stages of languages spoken in the region and semantic clues provided by comparison with cultural practices and other script traditions of early southern Mesoamerica. Summarized here is the current state of the phonetic decipherment, the methods used for the decipherment, and results concerning the epi-Olmec language and script. The language identified in the inscriptions is pre-proto-Zoquean, the ancestor of four languages now spoken in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca. The decipherment contributes to knowledge of early Mixe-Zoquean language history. The script is more closely related to Mayan hieroglyphic writing than to other early Mesoamerican scripts, and this relation is closer than previously recognized."

This overlap implies (i) that there was a similar style of seawater-ocean crust interaction during the past 2 billion years; (ii) that the oxygen isotope composition of early Proterozoic seawater was similar to the modern value; (iii) that early Proterozoic sea-floor spreading rates were similar to, or greater than, average modern rates; and (iv) that early Proterozoic carbonate rocks and cherts with low (18)O/(16)O ratios do not reflect global-scale (18)O depletion of early Proterozoic oceans."

Spectra were obtained for CH and C(2) radicals over a range of conditions including those for the plasma chemical vapor deposition of diamond films. Numerical simulations based on a one-dimensional stagnation-point flow model are in good agreement with the measurements. The CH mole fraction is shown to rise and fall as a function of distance from the substrate, which is compelling experimental evidence for the complex chemistry that is occurring in the plasma boundary layer."

https://openalex.org/W2029676914,"Oxygen isotope ratios measured by ion microprobe in magnetite from granulite-facies marble of the Adirondack Mountains, New York, range from +2 to +11 per mil (standard mean ocean water) across a single grain that measures 3 millimeters by 5 millimeters. Low values are concentrated in irregular domains near the grain boundary but also occur in the grain's interior. In contrast, grains 1 millimeter in diameter that are from a second nearby sample show no significant heterogeneity, except within 10 micrometers of the grain boundary. These data, including large gradients of up to 9 per mil per 10 micrometers, provide important new constraints on the nature and origins of intragrain isotopic heterogeneity and on oxygen isotope thermometry. The differences between these magnetite grains result from contrasting mechanisms of isotope exchange with fluids after the peak of regional metamorphism. Volume diffusion of oxygen through the crystal structure of magnetite contributed to isotope exchange in the rims of small grains, but larger grains are crosscut by healed cracks that are not readily detected and that short-circuited diffusion."

https://openalex.org/W1974277173,"In the spring of 1993, two groups of scientists will unite general circulation models with computer models of forests, grasslands, and swamps. The models will map changes in vegetation that occur as a result of climate changes. One model, BIOME, assigns 14 types of vegetation to 60 km square grids and tracks changes in vegetation patterns in response to changes in minimum temperature, degree days, and moisture. The other model, DOLY, works much the same way. Changes in vegetation cover will then drive the climate to a new equilibrium. Other ecologists are developing bottom-up models that try to describe how species mixture and other complex factors that vary on small scales influence an ecosystems response to changes in climate. Hopefully the modelers will pool their strategies on an international network based at the University of Virginia. Also, large-scale field experiments are being conducted to study the interplay between natural ecosystems and climatic factors such as CO[sub 2]. Future projects will also attempt to account for changes caused by human activities such as deforestation."
https://openalex.org/W2062784932,"A group of 2000 DNA sequences representing human genes was published in October 1992 by Genethon. Since then, more than half (possibly up to 85%) of the sequences appear to be from yeast and unidentified bacteria. This represents the problem of researchers submitting sequences directly to databases without peer review or serious error checking. While database managers rely on scientists to submit correct data, the managers can take steps to detect obvious errors. Further cases of gross contamination will require more stringent quality control, even at the expense of some delay."

https://openalex.org/W2023407973,"The emerging problems with YACs may have been a blow to many genome researchers, but some scientists have long been advocating more funding for alternative DNA carriers. As the Human Genome Project focused on YACs in recent years, however, support for the development of non-YAC systems has been hard to come by. But as the community comes to grips with the limitations of YACs, researchers are starting to take another look at the alternatives. One of the most promising is the newest-the Bacteria Artificial Chromosome (BAC). Like a YAC, it is formed by inserting foreign DNA into a microorganism - E. coli in the case of the BAC - and letting the organism's genetic reproduction machinery take over to make copies. Mel Simon and his group at Caltech developed the BAC in 1990 specifically to try to get around some of the problems with YACs, and Simon says they have ben at least partially successful. BACs don't appear to result in unrelated pieces of DNA being spliced together and cloned, for example, and very preliminary analysis suggests that deletion of stretches of DNA will not be a significant problem. Best of all, he says, those regions of the human genomemore » that are uncloneable in YACs will probably clone just fine in BACs, and vice-versa. BACs do, however, have one significant disadvantage: They can carry stretches of only 200,000 to 300,000 bases of foreign DNA - less than one-quarter as long as the best YACs. And other possible alternatives to YACs are limited to even shorter fragments. Another bacteria-based carrier known as a P1 can carry DNA insets of about 100,000 bases, and cosmids, which have been around the longest, are shorter yet - about 40,000 bases. While none of these systems is going to challenge the YAC for the size of their genome fragments, Simon says, they should provide a more precise complement to the YACs brute-force capabilities.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2074697612,"It's easy to see how climate change might affect the globe's vegetation, driving hardwood forests into regions now covered with evergreens and causing deserts to shift. It's less easy to picture the other side of the coin: biology's impact on the atmosphere. So mathematician Berrien Moore III of the University of New Hampshire, who heads the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program task force on global analysis, interpretation, and modeling, staged a simple demonstration. He modeled the effects of a biosphere fertilized by increased CO[sub 2] - and found that it could first help, then hinder, human efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases. To simulate such a biotic carbon sink, Moore combined a simple model of CO[sub 2] uptake by the ocean with an equally simple model of its uptake by photosynthesis on land and its release by deforestation and plant decay. He then forced this simple ocean-atmosphere-vegetation model with fossil fuel CO[sub 2] emissions from 1860 to the present. As expected, his model ended up with too much carbon in the atmosphere. So he turned up photosynthesis, fertilizing plant growth in his model, until the rate of CO[sub 2] buildup just matched the observed increase. Moore then explored how thismore » terrestrial carbon sink would respond if the CO[sub 2] buildup slowed. The result: If you were to cap the rate of CO[sub 2] emissions from fossil fuel burning, [this terrestrial] sink would reduce the atmospheric lifetime of CO[sub 2] by a factor of four or five. This cleansing effect would operate on timescales of years or decades, compared with centuries for the ocean, says Moore - fast enough to aid human efforts to slow the CO[sub 2] buildup. However, it doesn't do it forever. If at some point emissions cuts and the terrestrial sink succeeded in reducing atmospheric CO[sub 2], plant growth would drop and CO[sub 2] levels would bounce back up as all the extra biomass rotted away.« less"
