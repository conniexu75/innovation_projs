https://openalex.org/W4308451957,"Astrocytes, a type of glia, are abundant and morphologically complex cells. Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4308430557,"We report three searches for high energy neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with IceCube between 2011 and 2020. Improvements over previous work include new neutrino reconstruction and data calibration methods. In one search, the positions of 110 a priori selected gamma-ray sources were analyzed individually for a possible surplus of neutrinos over atmospheric and cosmic background expectations. We found an excess of $79_{-20}^{+22}$ neutrinos associated with the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 at a significance of 4.2$\,\sigma$. The excess, which is spatially consistent with the direction of the strongest clustering of neutrinos in the Northern Sky, is interpreted as direct evidence of TeV neutrino emission from a nearby active galaxy. The inferred flux exceeds the potential TeV gamma-ray flux by at least one order of magnitude."

Using geostationary satellite images of the 15 January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, we find that the volcanic plume produced by this volcano reached an altitude of 57 kilometers at its highest extent. This places the plume in the lower mesosphere and provides observational evidence of a volcanic eruption injecting material through the stratosphere and directly into the mesosphere. We then discuss potential implications of this injection and suggest that the altitude reached by plumes from previous eruptions, such as the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, may have been underestimated because of a lack of observational data."
https://openalex.org/W4308448193,"Several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by intermittent episodes of pathological activity. Although genetic therapies offer the ability to modulate neuronal excitability, a limiting factor is that they do not discriminate between neurons involved in circuit pathologies and ""healthy"" surrounding or intermingled neurons. We describe a gene therapy strategy that down-regulates the excitability of overactive neurons in closed loop, which we tested in models of epilepsy. We used an immediate early gene promoter to drive the expression of Kv1.1 potassium channels specifically in hyperactive neurons, and only for as long as they exhibit abnormal activity. Neuronal excitability was reduced by seizure-related activity, leading to a persistent antiepileptic effect without interfering with normal behaviors. Activity-dependent gene therapy is a promising on-demand cell-autonomous treatment for brain circuit disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4308448213,"Arctic fires can release large amounts of carbon from permafrost peatlands. Satellite observations reveal that fires burned ~4.7 million hectares in 2019 and 2020, accounting for 44% of the total burned area in the Siberian Arctic for the entire 1982-2020 period. The summer of 2020 was the warmest in four decades, with fires burning an unprecedentedly large area of carbon-rich soils. We show that factors of fire associated with temperature have increased in recent decades and identified a near-exponential relationship between these factors and annual burned area. Large fires in the Arctic are likely to recur with climatic warming before mid-century, because the temperature trend is reaching a threshold in which small increases in temperature are associated with exponential increases in the area burned."
https://openalex.org/W4308430556,"Long-distance quantum communication and networking require quantum memory nodes with efficient optical interfaces and long memory times. We report the realization of an integrated two-qubit network node based on silicon-vacancy centers (SiVs) in diamond nanophotonic cavities. Our qubit register consists of the SiV electron spin acting as a communication qubit and the strongly coupled silicon-29 nuclear spin acting as a memory qubit with a quantum memory time exceeding 2 seconds. By using a highly strained SiV, we realize electron-photon entangling gates at temperatures up to 1.5 kelvin and nucleus-photon entangling gates up to 4.3 kelvin. We also demonstrate efficient error detection in nuclear spin-photon gates by using the electron spin as a flag qubit, making this platform a promising candidate for scalable quantum repeaters."
https://openalex.org/W4308445192,"Genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators are ideally suited to reveal the millisecond-scale interactions among and between targeted cell populations. However, current indicators lack the requisite sensitivity for in vivo multipopulation imaging. We describe next-generation green and red voltage sensors, Ace-mNeon2 and VARNAM2, and their reverse response-polarity variants pAce and pAceR. Our indicators enable 0.4- to 1-kilohertz voltage recordings from >50 spiking neurons per field of view in awake mice and ~30-minute continuous imaging in flies. Using dual-polarity multiplexed imaging, we uncovered brain state-dependent antagonism between neocortical somatostatin-expressing (SST+) and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons and contributions to hippocampal field potentials from cell ensembles with distinct axonal projections. By combining three mutually compatible indicators, we performed simultaneous triple-population imaging. These approaches will empower investigations of the dynamic interplay between neuronal subclasses at single-spike resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4308439092,"Cereblon (CRBN) is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) substrate receptor protein co-opted by CRBN E3 ligase modulatory drug (CELMoD) agents that target therapeutically relevant proteins for degradation. Prior crystallographic studies defined the drug-binding site within CRBN’s thalidomide-binding domain (TBD), but the allostery of drug-induced neosubstrate binding remains unclear. We performed cryo–electron microscopy analyses of the DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1)–CRBN apo complex and compared these structures with DDB1-CRBN in the presence of CELMoD compounds alone and complexed with neosubstrates. Association of CELMoD compounds to the TBD is necessary and sufficient for triggering CRBN allosteric rearrangement from an open conformation to the canonical closed conformation. The neosubstrate Ikaros only stably associates with the closed CRBN conformation, illustrating the importance of allostery for CELMoD compound efficacy and informing structure-guided design strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4308448385,"Male and female unisexual flowers evolved from hermaphroditic ancestors, and control of flower sex is useful for plant breeding. We isolated a female-to-male sex transition mutant in melon and identified the causal gene as the carpel identity gene CRABS CLAW (CRC) . We show that the master regulator of sex determination in cucurbits, the transcription factor WIP1 whose expression orchestrates male flower development, recruits the corepressor TOPLESS to the CRC promoter to suppress its expression through histone deacetylation. Impairing TOPLESS-WIP1 physical interaction leads to CRC expression, carpel determination, and consequently the expression of the stamina inhibitor, the aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 7 ( CmACS7 ), leading to female flower development. Our findings suggest that sex genes evolved to interfere with flower meristematic function, leading to unisexual flower development."
https://openalex.org/W4309070657,"Background We aimed to improve mental health referral quality of young people by helping educators build capacity for early identification of youth at risk of mental illness and facilitate referrals between the education and health systems. Methods We applied the Go-To Educator mental health literacy training for early identification, triage and support in 208 schools in Calgary, Alberta between 2013 and 2016. Students presenting to mental health services during this time were compared on a number of clinical, system, and demographic variables, based on the training status of the school (untrained schools; before and after training schools), using retrospective cohort design. Based on clinical and system data, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to compare the three school status domains. Results After training, referrals differed significantly from control and pre-training schools. Students presenting to services from these schools were younger, from single parent families; were referred more because of adjustment and learning/attention problems; had complex social/family issues; thought disturbances, and harmful behavior/thoughts towards others. While they waited longer to be admitted they stayed longer in services; had more provisional comorbid diagnoses and demonstrated positive treatment outcomes. Conclusions The Go-To Educator training may be an effective intervention helping educators identify students at risk of mental disorders and in substantial need of mental health services, demonstrating improved linkages between education and health sectors."
https://openalex.org/W4309112109,"Digitalization in healthcare through advanced methods, tools, and the Internet are prominent social development factors. However, hackers and malpractices through cybercrimes made this digitalization worrisome for policymakers. In this study, the role of E-Government Development as a proxy for digitalization and corruption prevalence has been analyzed in Healthcare sustainability in developing and underdeveloped countries of Asia from 2015 to 2021. Moreover, a moderator role of Cybersecurity measures has also been estimated on EGDI, CRP, and HS through the two-step system GMM estimation. The results show that EGDI and CRP control measures significantly improved HS in Asia. Furthermore, by deploying strong and effective Cybersecurity measures, Asia’s digitalization and institutional practices are considerably enhanced, which also has an incremental impact on HS and ethical values. This present study added a novel contribution to existing digitalization and public health services literature and empirical analysis by comprehensively applying advanced econometric estimation. The study concludes that cybersecurity measures significantly improved healthcare digitalization and controlled the institutional malfunctioning in Asia. This study gives insight into how cybersecurity measures enhance the service quality and promote institutional quality of the health sector in Asia, which will help draft sustainable policy decisions and ethical values in the coming years."

Data were analyzed with deductive content analysis.We have identified four main themes that are barriers to vaccinating against COVID-19: 1) concerns about accessing appropriate healthcare services, 2) financial issues and 3) immigration matters, as well as 4) misinformation.Findings illustrate the pervasive role of addressable social determinants of health in the intention of rural and urban Latino communities in being vaccinated, which is a pressing public health issue. Policy implications: Findings provide evidence for a systemic shift to prioritize equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines to Latino communities."

https://openalex.org/W4309070579,"Cell therapies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) are expected to ameliorate acute kidney injury (AKI). However, using hiPSC-derived NPCs clinically is a challenge because hiPSCs themselves are tumorigenic. LIN28A , ESRG , CNMD and SFRP2 transcripts have been used as a marker of residual hiPSCs for a variety of cell types undergoing clinical trials. In this study, by reanalyzing public databases, we found a baseline expression of LIN28A , ESRG , CNMD and SFRP2 in hiPSC-derived NPCs and several other cell types, suggesting LIN28A , ESRG , CNMD and SFRP2 are not always reliable markers for iPSC detection. As an alternative, we discovered a lncRNA marker gene, MIR302CHG , among many known and unknown iPSC markers, as highly differentially expressed between hiPSCs and NPCs, by RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. Using MIR302CHG as an hiPSC marker, we constructed two assay methods, a combination of magnetic bead-based enrichment and qRT-PCR and digital droplet PCR alone, to detect a small number of residual hiPSCs in NPC populations. The use of these in vitro assays could contribute to patient safety in treatments using hiPSC-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W4309112113,"Despite many institutions gaining access to improved water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, childcare centres in informal settlements have low access and poor condition of WASH services. It is imperative to understand how existing actors and social networks operate in the WASH sector in childcare centres in Nairobi's informal settlements.To empirically map and understand how different actors within informal settlements influence the provision of adequate and quality water, sanitation and hygiene services within childcare centres in Nairobi's informal settlements.This was a qualitative study. We conducted an ethnographic study using governance diaries with 24 participants from Korogocho and Viwandani informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. The governance diaries approach involved conducting bi-weekly governance in-depth interviews (IDIs) with study participants for 4 months, complemented with observations, reflections, participant diaries and informal discussions. We used a framework analysis which is partly deductive, informed by the governance framework and stakeholder framework.Social accountability actors were individuals or groups involved in WASH service provision in childcare centres. The actors included both key actors (actors who are primary to meeting the day-to-day WASH service needs of children) and non-key actors (actors operating in the WASH sector but not always present for day-to-day provision in childcare centres). The key actors were unanimously identified as childcare centre owners/teachers and parents/guardians as they had a more direct role in the provision of WASH services in childcare centres. The actors had direct, possible or desired networks, with the direct networks portrayed more by the parents and childcare centre owners, whose roles included acting as a voice and responding to the WASH service needs of children as it relates to access and quality. Centre owners had more power/authority over WASH services for children in childcare centres than the parents. Key actors derived power by their discretion depending on whether a decision was beneficial to children or not. Lastly, the interest of key actors were diverse ranging from income generation, access to WASH services by children, compliance with government regulations, and promotion of child health, to the prevention of the spread of diseases.Our study highlights that parents and childcare owners play an important role in WASH service provision. While service providers and other players may be statutorily given primary responsibilities for WASH provision, and more visible in official standing, among study participants they are not seen as primary actors but secondary players with ancillary responsibilities. We conclude that WASH service provision in child care centres may be realised when key actors have a voice and work within networks to demand WASH services from desired networks including the government. We also conclude that developing more direct networks and converting desired and potential networks into direct networks in WASH service provision is critical for the success of WASH service delivery. Lastly, actors in WASH services in childcare centres may need to collaborate in identifying potential avenues for strengthening existing networks that enhance access and quality of WASH services in childcare centres."
https://openalex.org/W4309112456,"Socioeconomic factors have exacerbated the impact of COVID–19 worldwide. Brazil, already marked by significant economic inequalities, is one of the most affected countries, with one of the highest mortality rates. Understanding how inequality and income segregation contribute to excess mortality by COVID–19 in Brazilian cities is essential for designing public health policies to mitigate the impact of the disease. This paper aims to fill in this gap by analyzing the effect of income inequality and income segregation on COVID–19 mortality in large urban centers in Brazil. We compiled weekly COVID–19 mortality rates from March 2020 to February 2021 in a longitudinal ecological design, aggregating data at the city level for 152 Brazilian cities. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were compared across weeks, cities and states using mixed linear models. We estimated the associations between COVID-19 mortality rates with income inequality and income segregation using mixed negative binomial models including city and week-level random intercepts. We measured income inequality using the Gini index and income segregation using the dissimilarity index using data from the 2010 Brazilian demographic census. We found that 88.2% of COVID–19 mortality rates variability was between weeks, 8.5% between cities, and 3.3% between states. Higher-income inequality and higher-income segregation values were associated with higher COVID–19 mortality rates before and after accounting for all adjustment factors. In our main adjusted model, rate ratios (RR) per 1 SD increases in income inequality and income segregation were associated with 17% (95% CI 9% to 26%) and 11% (95% CI 4% to 19%) higher mortality. Income inequality and income segregation are long-standing hallmarks of large Brazilian cities. Risk factors related to the socioeconomic context affected the course of the pandemic in the country and contributed to high mortality rates. Pre-existing social vulnerabilities were critical factors in the aggravation of COVID–19, as supported by the observed associations in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4309112543,"Previous studies have shown that illusory ownership over a mannequin's body can be induced through synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation as well as through synchronous visuo-vestibular stimulation. The current study aimed to elucidate how three-way combinations of correlated visual, tactile and vestibular signals contribute to the senses of body ownership and self-motion. Visuo-tactile temporal congruence was manipulated by touching the mannequin's body and the participant's unseen real body on the trunk with a small object either synchronously or asynchronously. Visuo-vestibular temporal congruence was manipulated by synchronous or asynchronous presentation of a visual motion cue (the background rotating around the mannequin in one direction) and galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerve generating a rotation sensation (in the same direction). The illusory experiences were quantified using a questionnaire; threat-evoked skin-conductance responses (SCRs) provided complementary indirect physiological evidence for the illusion. Ratings on the illusion questionnaire statement showed significant main effects of synchronous visuo-vestibular and synchronous visuo-tactile stimulations, suggesting that both of these pairs of bimodal correlations contribute to the ownership illusion. Interestingly, visuo-tactile synchrony dominated because synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation combined with asynchronous visuo-vestibular stimulation elicited a body ownership illusion of similar strength as when both bimodal combinations were synchronous. Moreover, both visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular synchrony were associated with enhanced self-motion perception; self-motion sensations were even triggered when visuo-tactile synchrony was combined with visuo-vestibular asynchrony, suggesting that ownership enhanced the relevance of visual information as a self-motion cue. Finally, the SCR results suggest that synchronous stimulation of either modality pair led to a stronger illusion compared to the asynchronous conditions. Collectively, the results suggest that visuo-tactile temporal correlations have a stronger influence on body ownership than visuo-vestibular correlations and that ownership boosts self-motion perception. We present a Bayesian causal inference model that can explain how visuo-vestibular and visuo-tactile information are combined in multisensory own-body perception."
https://openalex.org/W4309070428,"Inflammatory cholestatic liver diseases, including Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), are characterized by periportal inflammation with progression to cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to examine interactions between oxidative stress and autophagy in cholestasis. Using hepatic tissue from male acute cholestatic (bile duct ligated) as well as chronic cholestatic (Mdr2KO) mice, localization of oxidative stress, the antioxidant response and induction of autophagy were analyzed and compared to human PSC liver. Concurrently, the ability of reactive aldehydes to post-translationally modify the autophagosome marker p62 was assessed in PSC liver tissue and in cell culture. Expression of autophagy markers was upregulated in human and mouse cholestatic liver. Whereas mRNA expression of Atg12, Lamp1, Sqstm1 and Map1lc3 was increased in acute cholestasis in mice, it was either suppressed or not significantly changed in chronic cholestasis. In human and murine cholestasis, periportal hepatocytes showed increased IHC staining of ubiquitin, 4-HNE, p62, and selected antioxidant proteins. Increased p62 staining colocalized with accumulation of 4-HNE-modified proteins in periportal parenchymal cells as well as with periportal macrophages in both human and mouse liver. Mechanistically, p62 was identified as a direct target of lipid aldehyde adduction in PSC hepatic tissue and in vitro cell culture. In vitro LS-MS/MS analysis of 4-HNE treated recombinant p62 identified carbonylation of His123, Cys128, His174, His181, Lys238, Cys290, His340, Lys341 and His385. These data indicate that dysregulation of autophagy and oxidative stress/protein damage are present in the same periportal hepatocyte compartment of both human and murine cholestasis. Thus, our results suggest that both increased expression as well as ineffective autophagic degradation of oxidatively-modified proteins contributes to injury in periportal parenchymal cells and that direct modification of p62 by reactive aldehydes may contribute to autophagic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4309070531,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists may have favorable outcomes on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study serves as proof of concept to evaluate whether dual PPAR-α/γ agonists improve non-invasive tests of liver steatosis and fibrosis.This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial comprising 7226 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent coronary artery disease randomized to receive aleglitazar, a PPAR-α/γ agonists, or placebo for two years. Main outcomes were change in non-invasive tests for liver steatosis and fibrosis: Liver Fat Score (LFS), Liver Accumulation Product (LAP), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS).LFS, LAP and FIB-4 decreased upon treatment, whereas scores in the placebo group remained the same or increased (P<0.001). NFS responded differently but remained consistently lower than placebo. In the treatment group more participants shifted to a lower FIB-4 and NFS category, or improved in respect to the LAP cut-off values compared to the placebo group (P<0.001 for FIB-4 and LAP, P<0.004 for NFS). LFS had a low discriminative power in this study.This post-hoc analysis showed improvement of non-invasive tests of liver steatosis and fibrosis after starting dual PPAR-α/γ agonist treatment, adding to the evidence that this pathway has potential in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4309070538,"Helminth infections are cryptic and can be difficult to study in wildlife species. Helminth research in wildlife hosts has historically required invasive animal handling and necropsy, while results from noninvasive parasite research, like scat analysis, may not be possible at the helminth species or individual host levels. To increase the utility of noninvasive sampling, individual hosts can be identified by applying molecular methods. This allows for longitudinal sampling of known hosts and can be paired with individual-level covariates. Here we evaluate a combination of methods and existing long-term monitoring data to identify patterns of cestode infections in gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. Our goals were: (1) Identify the species and apparent prevalence of cestodes infecting Yellowstone wolves; (2) Assess the relationships between wolf biological and social characteristics and cestode infections; (3) Examine how wolf samples were affected by environmental conditions with respect to the success of individual genotyping. We collected over 200 wolf scats from 2018-2020 and conducted laboratory analyses including individual wolf genotyping, sex identification, cestode identification, and fecal glucocorticoid measurements. Wolf genotyping success rate was 45%, which was higher in the winter but decreased with higher precipitation and as more time elapsed between scat deposit and collection. One cestode species was detected in 28% of all fecal samples, and 38% of known individuals. The most common infection was Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (primarily E. canadensis). Adult wolves had 4x greater odds of having a cestode infection than pups, as well as wolves sampled in the winter. Our methods provide an alternative approach to estimate cestode prevalence and to linking parasites to known individuals in a wild host system, but may be most useful when employed in existing study systems and when field collections are designed to minimize the time between fecal deposition and collection."
https://openalex.org/W4309112120,"The advent and distribution of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in late 2020 was thought to represent an effective means to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This optimistic expectation was dashed by the omicron waves that emerged over the winter of 2021/2020 even in countries that had managed to vaccinate a large fraction of their populations, raising questions about whether it is possible to use scientific knowledge along with predictive models to anticipate changes and design management measures for the pandemic. Here, we used an extended SEIR model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission sequentially calibrated to data on cases and interventions implemented in Florida until Sept. 24 th 2021, and coupled to scenarios of plausible changes in key drivers of viral transmission, to evaluate the capacity of such a tool for exploring the future of the pandemic in the state. We show that while the introduction of vaccinations could have led to the permanent, albeit drawn-out, ending of the pandemic if immunity acts over the long-term, additional futures marked by complicated repeat waves of infection become possible if this immunity wanes over time. We demonstrate that the most recent omicron wave could have been predicted by this hybrid system, but only if timely information on the timing of variant emergence and its epidemiological features were made available. Simulations for the introduction of a new variant exhibiting higher transmissibility than omicron indicated that while this will result in repeat waves, forecasted peaks are unlikely to reach that observed for the omicron wave owing to levels of immunity established over time in the population. These results highlight that while limitations of models calibrated to past data for precisely forecasting the futures of epidemics must be recognized, insightful predictions of pandemic futures are still possible if uncertainties about changes in key drivers are captured appropriately through plausible scenarios."

Despite an increasing focus on the effect of patient-centered factors on health outcomes, little is known about the impact of marital/partner status on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Objective To synthesize evidence of the association between marital/partner status and PROMs after AMI and stroke and to determine whether associations differ by sex. Methods and analysis We will search MEDLINE (via Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection (as licensed by Yale University), Scopus, EMBASE (via Ovid), and PsycINFO (via Ovid) from inception to July 15, 2022. Two authors will independently screen titles, abstracts, and then full texts as appropriate, extract data, and assess risk of bias. Conflicts will be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. The primary outcomes will be the associations between marital/partner status and PROMs. An outcome framework was designed to classify PROMs into four domains (health-related quality of life, functional status, symptoms, and personal recovery). Meta-analysis will be conducted if appropriate. Subgroup analysis by sex and meta-regression with a covariate for the proportion of male participants will be performed to explore differences by sex. Ethics and dissemination This research is exempt from ethics approval because the study will be conducted using published data.

https://openalex.org/W4309070500,"Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models are recommended for stable people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) but there are few rigorous evaluations of patient outcomes.Adherence clubs (ACs) are a form of DSD run by community health workers at community venues with 2-4 monthly ART refills and annual nurse assessments). Clinic-based care involves 2-monthly ART refills and 4-monthly nurse/doctor assessments. We compared virologic outcomes in stable adults randomised to ACs at four months post-ART initiation to those randomised to primary health care (PHC) ART clinics through 12 months on ART in Cape Town, South Africa (NCT03199027). We hypothesised that adults randomised to ACs would be more likely to be virally suppressed at 12 months post-ART initiation, versus adults randomised to continued PHC care. We enrolled consecutive adults on ART for 3-5 months who met local DSD ['adherence clubs' (AC)] eligibility (clinically stable, VL<400 copies/mL). The primary outcome was VL<400 copies/mL at 12 months on ART.Between January 2017 and April 2018, 220 adults were randomised (mean age 35 years; 67% female; median ART duration 18 weeks); 85% and 94% of participants randomised to ACs and PHCs attended their first service visit on schedule respectively. By 12 months on ART, 91% and 93% randomised to ACs and PHCs had a VL<400 copies/mL, respectively. In a binomial model adjusted for age, gender, previous ART use and nadir CD4 cell count, there was no evidence of superiority of ACs compared to clinic-based care (RD, -2.42%; 95% CI, -11.23 to 6.38). Findings were consistent when examining the outcome at a threshold of VL <1000 copies/mL.Stable adults referred to DSDs at 4 months post-ART initiation had comparable virologic outcomes at 12 months on ART versus PHC clinics, with no evidence of superiority. Further research on long-term outcomes is required."

In the current investigation, rDNA-ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and TEF (Transcriptional Elongation Factor) sequencing were used for molecular identification of six Beauveria bassiana strains. Both, leaf discs and potted plant bioassaye were carried out to study their pathogenicity against the cassava mite, Tetranychus truncatus. LC50 and LC90 values of potential B. bassiana strains were estimated. We also discovered a correlation between intraspecific B. bassiana strains pathogenicity and comprehensive metabolome profiles. Bb5, Bb6, Bb8, Bb12, Bb15, and Bb21 strains were identified as B. bassiana by sequencing of rDNA-ITS and TEF segments and sequence comparison to NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) GenBank. Out of the six strains tested for pathogenicity, Bb6, Bb12, and Bb15 strains outperformed against T. truncatus with LC50 values 1.4×106, 1.7×106, and 1.4×106 and with a LC90 values 7.3×107, 1.4×108, and 4.2×108 conidia/ml, respectively, at 3 days after inoculation and were considered as potential strains for effective mite control. Later, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the above six B. bassiana strains was done on secondary metabolites extracted with ethyl acetate revealed that the potential B. bassiana strains (Bb6, Bb12, and Bb15) have higher levels of acaricidal such as Bis(dimethylethyl)-phenol: Bb6 (5.79%), Bb12 (6.15%), and Bb15 (4.69%). Besides, insecticidal (n-Hexadecanoic acid), and insect innate immunity overcoming compound (Nonadecene) were also identified; therefore, the synergistic effect of these compounds might lead toa higher pathogenicity of B. bassiana against T. truncatus. Further, these compounds also exhibited two clusters, which separate the potential and non-potential strains in the dendrogram of Thin Layer Chromatography. These results clearly demonstrated the potentiality of the B. bassiana strains against T. truncatus due to the occurrence of their bioactive volatile metabolome."
https://openalex.org/W4309070558,"HIV-1 transcription is specifically augmented by a transcriptional activator complex composed of Tat, an HIV-1-encoded activator, and the host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, which is composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1. Several observations suggest that P-TEFb is an attractive anti-HIV-1 drug target. However, the long-term cytotoxicity of CDK9 inhibitors hinders their widespread use in HIV-1 therapy. Thus, novel and safe inhibitors are sorely needed. By performing molecular dynamics simulations of the 3D structure of Tat/P-TEFb, we previously identified a unique cavity structure of CDK9, the CDK9 hidden cavity, that is specifically induced by Tat binding. Here, we attempted to identify compounds that fit this cavity and inhibit CDK9 activity by in silico screening. We identified compounds that could inhibit CDK9 activity. One of such compound, 127 , showed the strongest inhibitory activity against CDK9. Interestingly, it also inhibited CDK6 to a similar extent. We inspected the amino acid sequence and structural properties of the CDK9 hidden cavity to determine whether it is conserved in other CDKs, such as CDK6. The Ile61, comprising the center of the CDK9 hidden cavity, appears to be crucial for its kinase activity, thus indicating that the identification of the CDK9 hidden cavity may provide vital information for the development of novel CDK9 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4309070580,"Local attacks in networked systems can often propagate and trigger cascading failures. Designing effective healing mechanisms to counter cascading failures is critical to enhance system resiliency. This work proposes a self-healing algorithm for networks undergoing load-based cascading failure. To advance understanding of the dynamics of networks with concurrent cascading failure and self-healing, a general discrete-time simulation framework is developed, and the resiliency is evaluated using two metrics, i.e., the system impact and the recovery time. This work further explores the effects of the multiple model parameters on the resiliency metrics. It is found that two parameters (reactivated node load parameter and node healing certainty level) span a phase plane for network dynamics where three regimes exist. To ensure full network recovery, the two parameters need to be moderate. This work lays the foundation for subsequent studies on optimization of model parameters to maximize resiliency, which will have implications to many real-world scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4309070787,"Land ecological security is the core of regional coordinated economic development and land ecological security planning. In this paper, with Shenzhen as the research area, 28 evaluation indicators were selected from 5 dimensions based on the DPSIR model to construct an indicator system for land ecological security evaluation, so as to evaluate the land ecological security status in the research area from 2009 to 2019. Based on the TOPSIS evaluation model, regional levels were determined, and finally the GM (1,1) model was adopted to scientifically predict the land ecological security system of Shenzhen from 2020 to 2025. The results showed that: (1) from the perspective of the main influencing factors, the weight of 16 indicators of Shenzhen's land ecological security exceeds 0.03, including the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery (D5) and Engel coefficient (I4). These factors are the main factors that have led to the deterioration of land ecological security in Shenzhen in the past decade; (2) comprehensive situation analysis revealed that from 2009 to 2019, the level of land ecological security in Shenzhen exhibited an increasing trend overall, but the land ecological security in Shenzhen still needs to be greatly improved; (3) regarding various subsystems, from 2009 to 2019, except the pressure subsystem which was in a downward trend, other subsystems showed a fluctuating and upward trend; (4) after modeling and calculation using the GM (1,1) model, it was concluded that most of the indicator factors are in a slow growing trend with the social and economic development of Shenzhen, but severe land ecological problem still exists. The research result is expected to provide a reference for the stable and sustainable development of society and economy and regional land ecosystem protection."
https://openalex.org/W4309070834,"Woody cells, such as tracheids, fibers, vessels, rays etc., have unique structural characteristics such as nano-scale ultrastructure represented by multilayers, microfibril angle (MFA), micro-scale anatomical properties and spatial arrangement. Simultaneous evaluation of the above indices is very important for their adequate quantification and extracting the effects of external stimuli from them. However, it is difficult in general to achieve the above only by traditional methodologies. To overcome the above point, a new methodological framework combining polarization optical microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and image segmentation is proposed. The framework was tested to a model softwood species, Chamaecyparis obtusa for characterizing intra-annual transition of MFA and tracheid morphology in a radial file unit. According our result, this framework successfully traced the both characteristics tracheid by tracheid and revealed the high correlation (|r| > 0.5) between S2 microfibril angles and tracheidal morphology (lumen radial diameter, tangential wall thickness and cell wall occupancy). In addition, radial file based evaluation firstly revealed their complex transitional behavior in transition and latewood. The proposed framework has great potential as one of the unique tools to provide detailed insights into heterogeneity of intra and inter-cells in the wide field of view through the simultaneous evaluation of cells' ultrastructure and morphological properties."
https://openalex.org/W4309112375,"The COVID-19 epidemic resulted in a dramatic contraction in employment in the U.S., but the effects of this contraction have been unevenly distributed. We examine differences in employment among foreign- and native-born workers by race/ethnicity during the course of the epidemic. We test individual fixed-effects models based on data from the monthly CPS panel from January 2020 to December 2021 adjusting for seasonality. Immigrant men and women experienced greater declines in employment than non-immigrants of the same race/ethnicity when both compared to native-born Whites, but their disadvantage were limited to the initial months of the epidemic. Ethnoracial and immigrant status disparities were substantially reduced by the fall of 2020, except for Hispanic immigrant men and women, who still experienced substantial employment gaps with their native-born White counterparts. Differences in family characteristics account for Hispanic immigrant women's lower employment rates during the epidemic but do not appear to account for differences between Black and Asian women and native-born Whites. Observed disparities in employment by race/ethnicity and immigrant status cannot be fully explained by differences in education, the concentration of minority and immigrant workers in industries and occupations that suffered steeper employment declines, or regional differences in the intensity of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W4309112457,"Compared to other species, the extent of human cooperation is unparalleled. Such cooperation is coordinated between community members via social norms. Developmental research has demonstrated that very young children are sensitive to social norms, and that social norms are internalized by middle childhood. Most research on social norm acquisition has focused on norms that modulated intra-group cooperation. Yet around the world, multi-ethnic communities also cooperate, and this cooperation is often shaped by distinct inter-group social norms. In the present study, we will investigate whether inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic social norm acquisition follows the same, or distinct, developmental trajectories. Specifically, we will work with BaYaka foragers and Bandongo fisher-farmers who inhabit multi-ethnic villages in the Republic of the Congo. In these villages, inter-ethnic cooperation is regulated by sharing norms. Through interviews with adult participants, we will provide the first descriptive account of the timing and mechanism by which BaYaka and Bandongo learn to share with out-group members. Children (5–17 years) and adults (17+ years) will also participate in a modified Dictator Game to investigate the developmental trajectories of children’s intra- and inter-ethnic sharing choices. Based on our ethnographic knowledge of the participating communities, we predict that children’s intra-ethnic sharing choices in the Dictator Game will match those of adults at an earlier age than their inter-ethnic sharing choices. We will analyze our data using logistic Bayesian modelling."
https://openalex.org/W4309112542,"In this article, we compare the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the maximum product of spacing estimate (MPSE) of a stress-strength reliability model, θ = P(Y < X), under adaptive progressive type-II progressive hybrid censoring, when X and Y are independent random variables taken from the inverse Weibull distribution (IWD) with the same shape parameter and different scale parameters. The performance of both estimators is compared, through a comprehensive computer simulation based on two criteria, namely bias and mean squared error (MSE). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we used two examples of real-life data based on Breakdown Times of an Insulated Fluid by (Nelson, 2003) and Head and Neck Cancer Data by (Efron, 1988). It is concluded that the MPSE method outperformed the MLE method in terms of bias and MSE values."

https://openalex.org/W4309070474,"Most sex worker population studies measure population at discrete points in time and very few studies have been done in industrialized democracies. The purpose of this study is to consider how time affects the population dynamics of contact sex workers in Canada using publicly available internet advertising data collected over multiple years.3.6 million web pages were collected from advertising sites used by contact sex workers between November, 2014 and December, 2016 inclusive. Contacts were extracted from ads and used to identify advertisers. First names were used to estimate the number of workers represented by an advertiser. Counts of advertisers and names were adjusted for missing data and overcounting. Two approaches for correcting overcounts are compared. Population estimates were generated weekly, monthly and for the two year period. The length of time advertisers were active was also estimated. Estimates are also compared with related research.Canadian sex workers typically advertised individually or in small collectives (median name count 1, IQR 1-2, average 1.8, SD 4.4). Advertisers were active for a mean of 73.3 days (SD 151.8, median 14, IQR 1-58). Advertisers were at least 83.5% female. Respectively the scaled weekly, monthly, and biannual estimates for female sex workers represented 0.2%, 0.3% and 2% of the 2016 Canadian female 20-49 population. White advertisers were the most predominant ethnic group (53%).Sex work in Canada is a more pervasive phenomenon than indicated by spot estimates and the length of the data collection period is an important variable. Non-random samples used in qualitative research in Canada likely do not reflect the larger sex worker population represented in advertising. The overall brevity of advertising activity suggests that workers typically exercise agency, reflecting the findings of other Canadian research."
https://openalex.org/W4309070481,"Purpose This study aimed to develop and examine the effects of an internet-based intervention program on environmental perception and behavior among Korean pregnant women based on revised protection motivation theory. Method This study was a non-equivalent control group pre-post-test design. The experimental program consisted of prenatal education, reduction of fine dust, birth education, environmental health promotion, and postnatal management education using zoom video conferences. The face-to-face interventions were provided through regular prenatal classes at public health services for the control group. The total participant was 49 pregnant women: 25 in the experimental group and 24 in the control group. The program adaptation was conducted between April 2021 and November 2021 in Korea. The data were analyzed by ANCOVA and t-test to examine the effects using SPSS 26.0 program. Results After intervention of the program, environmental severity (F = 17.96, p &lt; .001), response efficacy (F = 15.69, p &lt; .001), and total environmental perception (F = 7.80, p = .008) were higher in the experimental group than in the control group. There were no significant differences in feasibility, accessibility, satisfaction, susceptibility, self-efficacy, barrier, personal environmental behavior, and community environmental behavior between the two groups. Conclusion The internet-based educational program can be the alternative for the face-to-face prenatal class to promote environmental health perceptions during pregnancy in the pandemic situations."

This study aims to systematically consolidate the epidemiological research on family-level psychosocial mediators and moderators to ultimately produce causal diagram(s) of the intergenerational transmission of trauma.We will identify epidemiological peer-reviewed publications, dissertations, and conference abstracts that measure the impact of at least one psychosocial family-level factor mediating or moderating the relationship between parental trauma exposure and a child mental health outcome. English, French, Kinyarwanda, and Spanish articles will be eligible. We will search MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PTSDpubs, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and will conduct forward citation chaining of included documents. Two reviewers will perform screening independently. We will extract reported mediators, moderators, and relevant study characteristics for included studies. Findings will be presented using narrative syntheses, descriptive analyses, mediation meta-analyses, moderating meta-analyses, and causal diagram(s), where possible. We will perform a risk of bias assessment and will assess for publication bias.The development of evidence-based causal diagram(s) would provide more detailed understanding of the paths by which the psychological impacts of trauma can be transmitted intergenerationally at the family-level. This review could provide evidence to better support interventions that interrupt the cycle of intergenerational trauma.Systematic review registration: PROSPERO registration ID #CRD42021251053."
https://openalex.org/W4309070549,"In many aspects of life on earth, individuals may engage in cooperation with others to contribute towards a goal they may share, which can also ensure self-preservation. In evolutionary game theory, the act of cooperation can be considered as an altruistic act of an individual producing some form of benefit or commodity that can be utilised by others they are associated with, which comes at some personal cost. Under certain conditions, individuals make use of information that they are able to perceive within a group in order to aid with their choices for who they should associate themselves within these cooperative scenarios. However, cooperative individuals can be taken advantage of by opportunistic defectors, which can cause significant disruption to the population. We study a model where the decision to establish interactions with potential partners is based on the opportune integration of the individual’s private ability to perceive the intentions of others (private information) and the observation of the population, information that is available to every individual (public information). When public information is restricted to a potential partners current connection count, the population becomes highly cooperative but rather unstable with frequent invasions of cheaters and recoveries of cooperation. However, when public information considers the previous decisions of the individuals (accepted / rejected connections) the population is slightly less cooperative but more stable. Generally, we find that allowing the observation of previous decisions, as part of the available public information, can often lead to more stable but fragmented and less prosperous networks. Our results highlight that the ability to observe previous individual decisions, balanced by individuals personal information, represents an important aspect of the interplay between individual decision-making and the resilience of cooperation in structured populations."
https://openalex.org/W4309070576,"Several studies using mice have examined the effects of aging on cognitive tasks, as well as sensory and motor functions. However, few studies have examined the influence of aging on social behavior. Prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster ) are a socially monogamous and biparental rodent that live in small family groups and are now among the most popular rodent models for studies examining social behavior. Although the social behavioral trajectories of early-life development in prairie voles have been well-studied, how social behavior may change throughout adulthood remains unknown. Here we examined behavior in virgin male and female prairie voles in four different age groups: postnatal day (PND) 60–80, 140–160, 220–240, and 300–320. All animals underwent testing in a novel object task, a dominance test, a resident-intruder test, and several iterations of social approach and social interaction tests with varying types of social stimuli (i.e., novel same-sex conspecific, novel opposite-sex conspecific, familiar same-sex sibling/cagemate, small group of novel same-sex conspecifics). We found that age influenced neophobia and dominance, but not social approach behavior. Further, we found that young adult, but not older adult, prairie voles adapt prosocial and aggressive behavior relative to social context, and that selective aggression occurs in relation to age even in the absence of a pair bond. Our results suggest that prairie voles calibrate social phenotype in a context-dependent manner in young adulthood and stop adjusting behavior to social context in advanced age, demonstrating that social behavior is plastic not only throughout early development, but also well into adulthood. Together, this study provides insight into age-related changes in social behavior in prairie voles and shows that prairie voles may be a viable model for studying the cognitive and physiological benefits of social relationships and social engagement in advanced age."
https://openalex.org/W4309070652,"Lithuania has a long history of remunerated donations. The first steps towards voluntary, non-remunerated blood and blood component donations started in 2004. Lithuania achieved 99.98% voluntary non-remunerated donations (VNRDs) in 2020. This study aimed to assess the risk of transfusion-transmitted infectious (TTI) disease markers for remunerated donations in comparison with VNRDs in Lithuania from 2013 to 2020. Data were obtained from the Lithuanian Blood Donor Register. The prevalence was calculated as the rate between the number of confirmed positive results for all TTI disease markers (serological anti-HCV, HBsAg, Ag/anti-HIV 1 and 2, and syphilis, and/or HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 NAT) per 100 donations. The relative risk of infectious disease markers for remunerated donations was then estimated. In total, 796310 donations were made. Altogether, 2743 donations were positive for TTI markers as follows: HCV, 1318; HBV, 768; syphilis, 583; and HIV 1 and 2, 74. The prevalence of confirmed TTI markers were 2.86, 0.97, 0.18, and 0.04 per 100 first-time remunerated donations, first-time VNRDs, repeat remunerated donations, and repeat VNRDs, respectively. Remunerated first-time and repeat donations had a statistically higher prevalence of TTI disease markers than VNRDs. First-time and repeat remunerated donations had statistically significantly higher relative risks of confirmed TTI disease markers than VNRD. In conclusion, the risks of TTI disease markers for remunerated first-time and repeat blood and its component donations are significantly higher than those for VNRDs."
https://openalex.org/W4309070779,"Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in protecting and saving the lives of general people. As health workers are more likely to be infected with COVID-19, it is inevitable to safeguard them through vaccination in advance to continue healthcare services. Hence the study aimed to explore the infection and vaccination status along with immediate health consequences among these frontiers. This was a cross-sectional, web-delivered study conducted among the 300 healthcare frontiers working at COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in eight divisions of Bangladesh. The study questionnaire encompasses infection, vaccination status with dose information, and demographical and organizational information among the respondents. A multivariate logistic regression model and Chi-square test was used for the analytical exploration. Adjusted and Unadjusted Odds Ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated for the specified setting indicators. The study revealed that 49% of all respondents tested positive whereas 98% of them were found vaccinated of which mostly (52.3%) had their 2nddoses and 68.7% faced immediate health consequences for having the vaccination. As predictor for COVID-19 infection status, young and senior adult group (30-39 years: AOR = 2.01/0.03; 95% CI: 1.08-3.76; >50 years: AOR = 4.36/0.01; 95% CI: 1.65-11.55) and respondents who received Sinopharm as their vaccine found to have more significant positive infection history. The predictors regarding experiencing immediate health effects after vaccination, surprisingly female (AOR = 3.31/0.01; 95% CI: 1.82-6.04) health professionals of the capital city (AOR = 1.91/0.03; 95% CI: 1.06-3.46) were observed to have health consequences on vaccination. As the older female group (>50 years) in the nursing profession was found more infected with COVID-19 and a significant number of health professionals especially the age group (30-39 years) in the nursing profession experienced immediate health effects of COVID-19 vaccination, implementation of specific strategies and policies are needed to ensure the safety precaution and effective vaccination among the health professionals of Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4309112098,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is estimated to cause over two million cases of human disease annually. Trinidad and Tobago is one of the largest livestock producer and consumer of sheep and goat meat in the Caribbean, however, the potential role of these animals in the epidemiology of STEC infections has not been previously described. To fill this critical gap in knowledge, the prevalence of Shiga toxin genes (stx 1 and stx 2 ) shed in the faeces of healthy sheep (n = 204) and goats (n = 105) in Trinidad was investigated. Based on PCR screening, goats had a higher stx prevalence than sheep (46% vs 35%, P = 0.06). Most of the recovered STEC isolates were positive for stx 1 only; and only three isolates were positive for the eae gene. None of the recovered isolates belonged to the O157 serogroup. In both species, the prevalence of stx was higher in young animals versus older animals. Sheep reared on deep litter flooring (43%) had a higher prevalence than sheep reared other flooring types, however this was not the same for goats. The presence of cows on the same premise was not an associated predictor for STEC carriage in sheep or goats. This study demonstrates that although sheep and goats in Trinidad are reservoirs for stx -positive E . coli isolates, no fecal samples tested positive for O157 STEC, harbored. Furthermore, it appears that non-O157 stx -positive isolates harbored by these animals do not pose a significant threat to human health"
https://openalex.org/W4309112104,"California cannabis regulations require testing for four pathogenic species of Aspergillus–A . niger , A . flavus , A . fumigatus and A . terreus in cannabis flower and cannabis inhalable products. These four pathogenic species of Aspergillus are important human pathogens and their presence in cannabis flower and cannabis products may pose a threat to human health. In this study, we examined the potential of X-ray irradiation for inactivation of cannabis flower contaminated with any of the four pathogenic species of Aspergillus . We determined that X-ray irradiation at a dose of 2.5 kGy is capable of rendering Aspergillus cells non-viable at low (10 2 spores/g dried flower), medium (10 3 spores/g dried flower) and high (10 4 spores/g dried flower) levels of inoculation. We also showed that X-ray treatment of cannabis flower did not significantly alter the cannabinoid or the terpene profiles of the flower samples. Therefore, X-ray irradiation may be a feasible method for Aspergillus decontamination of cannabis flower. More work is required to determine the consumer safety of irradiated cannabis flower and cannabis products."
https://openalex.org/W4309112130,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health threat responsible for 700,000 deaths per year worldwide. There is scientific evidence of the causal relationship between antimicrobial use (AMU) along the food chain and AMR. Improving AMU in livestock is therefore a key component in the fight against AMR. To improve AMU in livestock, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and strategies must be context-adapted and socially acceptable for actors in order to increase AMU sustainability. AMU decision-making is based on an interdependent set of economic, behavioral, ethical, and cultural factors that need to be assessed to advise on the potential impacts of measures. We hypothesized that a participatory strategic planning approach may increase the plausibility and the efficacy of the strategies formulated by facilitating the dialogue between actors of diverse backgrounds, stimulating innovative thinking and constant considerations of contextual factors, actors and impacts. We adapted and applied the ImpresS ex ante approach (IMPact in reSearch in the South, https://impress-impact-recherche.cirad.fr/) within a Living Lab engaging actors from the French pig and poultry sectors in co-creation of innovative strategies towards improved AMU. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory workshops between April 2021 and March 2022. The results describe 1) an initial diagnosis of the current AMU situation in the pig and poultry sectors in France; 2) a common vision of the future to which participants would like to contribute through the intervention; 3) an identification of the current problems opposed to this vision of the future; 4) a defined scope of the intervention; 5) a typology of actors protagonist or impacted by those issues and 6) outcome maps to solve a priority problem related to indicators and monitoring. This study provides recommendations for decision-makers on plausible and innovative strategies to sustainably improve AMU in pig and poultry sectors in France and evidence of the benefits of participatory strategic planning approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4309112372,"Background Despite the availability of effective vaccines and treatments for hepatitis B virus (HBV), it continues to be a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Routine screening for HBV in pregnant women is widely recommended, but there is lack of screening for HBV during pregnancy in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess viral load, and genetic diversity among pregnant women in the Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Materials and methods Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing was performed on 1846 pregnant women, 85 of who tested positive were included in this study. HBV DNA was isolated from 85 positive sera, and the partial surface/polymerase gene was amplified and sequenced. HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, serotypes and mutations in surface genes and polymerase were studied. Results Out of 85 pregnant women`s HBsAg positive sera, 59(69.4%) had detectable viral DNA. The median viral load was 3.4 log IU/ml ranging from 2.6 to7.6 and 46 samples were successfully sequenced and genotyped. Genotypes A and D were identified in 39 (84.8%) and 7 (15.2%); respectively. All genotype A isolates were further classified into sub-genotype A1 and serotype adw2 (84.8%) whereas genotype D isolates were further classified into three sub genotypes; 2 (4.3%) D2, 1(2.2%) D4, and 4 (8.7%) D10 with serotypes ayw2 (10.9%), and ayw3 (4.3%). There were 19 (41.3%) surface gene mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR). Six (13.1%) of them were discovered in MHR`s `a’-determinant region. Six polymerase gene mutations (13%) were identified. Conclusion Genotype A was the predominant genotype in the Amhara National Regional State. The surface and polymerase gene mutations identified in this study may lead to immune therapy failure, diagnostics escape and drug resistance. Thus, the data generated in this study will contribute to the planning of HBV diagnosis, vaccination and treatment, and most importantly to the prevention of vertical transmission of HBV in Ethiopia. Therefore, further molecular studies on HBV are warranted and continuous surveillance is important for patient management and for the prevention and control of HBV infection in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4309112400,"Driverless cars are predicted to dramatically reduce collisions and casualties on the roads. However, there has been controversy about how they should be programmed to respond in the event of an unavoidable collision. Should they aim to save the most lives, prioritise the lives of pedestrians, or occupants of the vehicle? Some have argued that driverless cars should all be programmed to minimise total casualties. While this would appear to have wide international public support, previous work has also suggested regional variation and public reluctance to purchase driverless cars with such a mandated ethical setting. The possibility that algorithms designed to minimise collision fatalities would lead to reduced consumer uptake of driverless cars and thereby to higher overall road deaths, represents a potential “utility paradox”. To investigate this paradox further, we examined the views of the general public about driverless cars in two online surveys in the UK and Japan, examining the influence of choice of a “personal ethical setting” as well as of framing on hypothetical purchase decisions. The personal ethical setting would allow respondents to choose between a programme which would save the most lives, save occupants or save pedestrians. We found striking differences between UK and Japanese respondents. While a majority of UK respondents wished to buy driverless cars that prioritise the most lives or their family members’ lives, Japanese survey participants preferred to save pedestrians. We observed reduced willingness to purchase driverless cars with a mandated ethical setting (compared to offering choice) in both countries. It appears that the public values relevant to programming of driverless cars differ between UK and Japan. The highest uptake of driverless cars in both countries can be achieved by providing a personal ethical setting. Since uptake of driverless cars (rather than specific algorithm used) is potentially the biggest factor in reducing in traffic related accidents, providing some choice of ethical settings may be optimal for driverless cars according to a range of plausible ethical theories."
https://openalex.org/W4309112511,"Homeostasis between platelet production and clearance is essential for human health. A critical facet of the balance that facilitates platelet clearance from the circulation is apoptosis (programmed cell death). The precise cellular mechanisms that underpin platelet apoptosis are not defined. In nucleated cells, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is known to regulate platelet apoptosis. However, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating apoptosis in platelets has not been extensively studied as they are anucleate and exhibit a distinctive physiology. Here, apoptosis was induced in washed human platelets using ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic drug. Mitochondrial depolarization was measured using the ratiometric dye JC-1; surface phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was measured by annexin V binding; caspase-3 activation was measured by Western blotting. All three apoptotic markers were unaffected by the presence of either the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D or the actin polymerizing drug jasplakinolide. Moreover, platelets were isolated from wild-type ( WT ) mice and mice deficient in gelsolin ( Gsn ), an actin-binding protein that is essential for normal cytoskeletal remodeling. In response to ABT-737, gelsolin-null ( Gsn -/- ) platelets initially showed accelerated PS exposure relative to WT platelets, however, both WT and Gsn -/- platelets exhibited similar levels of mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation in response to ABT-737. We conclude that ABT-737 induces established markers of platelet apoptosis in an actin-independent manner."
