https://openalex.org/W2053128592,"In an attempt to systematically dissect the ligand binding properties of human serum albumin (HSA), the gene segments encoding each of its three domains were defined based on their conserved homologous structural motifs and separately cloned into a secretion vector for Pichia pastoris. We were able to establish a generally applicable purification protocol based on Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, suggesting that each of the three domains carries a binding site specific for this ligand. Proteins were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, gel filtration, N-terminal sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, as well as near- and far-UV CD. In addition to the affinity chromatography ligand Cibacron Blue, binding properties toward hemin, warfarin, and diazepam, each of which represents a standard ligand for HSA, respectively, were investigated by the measurement of induced circular dichroism. Clear experimental evidence is provided here for the location of the primary hemin binding site to be on domain I of HSA, and for the primary diazepam binding site to be on domain III. Further, secondary binding sites were found for hemin to be located on domains II and III, and for diazepam on domain I. The warfarin binding site was located primarily on domain II, while on domain I, a secondary binding site and/or parts of the primary binding site were found.

In the serum of human adults, the concentration of albumin is ∼40 mg/ml. It has an exceptional binding capacity for a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands, and its abundance makes it an important determinant of the pharmacokinetic behavior of many drugs (1Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar, 2Peters Jr., T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1996Google Scholar). HSA is composed of three structurally similar globular domains, each of which contains two subdomains, denominated subdomain IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB (Fig. 1). It is generally accepted today that albumin evolved from an ancestral protein of about 190 amino acids by triplication of this primordial domain. This view is most impressively documented by the striking internal homology of the atomic structure of the protein (3Carter D.C. He X.M. Munson S.H. Twigg P.D. Gernert K.M. Broom M.B. Miller T.Y.

Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar), and by the symmetrical location of the introns and exons of the albumin gene on chromosome 4 (5Minghetti P.P.

Although still partly controversial, consensus exists today that there are two high affinity binding sites (6Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar) for small heterocyclic or aromatic compounds (located on subdomains IIA and IIIA), two to three dominant long-chain fatty acid binding sites (located on subdomains IB and IIIB) (1Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar), and two distinct metal-binding sites, one involving Cys-34 and the other the N terminus, making a total of six dominant areas of ligand association to albumin (2Peters Jr., T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1996Google Scholar). Recently, a crystal structure was reported that showed five molecules of the medium-chain-length fatty acid myristate bound in different pockets of the HSA molecule (7Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Based on the observation of the quasi-independence of the three HSA domains, attempts have been made early on to use fragments of HSA produced by proteolytic or chemical cleavage to define the binding sites for several ligands (Refs. 8Reed R.G. Feldhoff R.C. Clute O.L. Peters Jr., T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4578-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Ledden D.J. Feldhoff R.C. Chan S.K. Biochem.

However, these studies have been dictated by the location of the cleavage sites on the primary sequence and did not allow for a deliberate selection of the exact size of the domains and their boundaries. Bos and colleagues (12Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Bos O.J. Fischer M.J. Wilting J.

Hrkal et al. (15Hrkal Z. Kodicek M. Vodrazka Z. Meloun B. Moravek L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have investigated the binding of hemin to the three large cyanogen bromide fragments of HSA. Compagnini et al. (16Compagnini A. Fisichella S. Foti S. Maccarrone G. Saletti R. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 736: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have used cyanogen bromide fragments of HSA in an attempt to define the Cibacron Blue binding sites by a chromatographic procedure and reported that two molecules of Cibacron Blue may be located in the hydrophobic pocket corresponding to subdomain IIA, with a third molecule in the hydrophobic site corresponding to subdomain IIIA. In a recent study, Kjeldsen et al. (17Kjeldsen T. Pettersson A.F. Drube L. Kurtzhals P. Jonassen I. Havelund S. Hansen P.H. Markussen J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have expressed domains I and III inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, but were unable to produce domain II in this expression system. Ligand binding studies with myristate and an insulin analogue acylated with myristic acid showed that the latter bound to both domains while myristate alone interacted only with domain III. Details of the molecular interactions of ligand binding to albumin are known for only a small number of cases (1Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). Insight gained from such studies shows promise in improving the design of many pharmaceuticals and diagnostic agents. In the present study, all three domains of HSA were produced by molecular cloning in a completely predetermined manner, based solely on the natural boundaries of the domains. This definite advance over the previous studies using either albumin fragments produced by proteolytic or chemical cleavage or incomplete sets of recombinant domains is expected to allow an in-depth study of the folding of the domains and of their viability as “stand-alone” proteins. Furthermore, ligand-binding studies with these domains will help in defining the exact location of the various binding sites. This paper reports on the cloning and expression of the three domains, their purification, and biochemical as well as structural characterization, providing a qualitative estimate of the chemistry of some important binding events and their comparability to natural albumin. HSA (essentially free of fatty acids and globulin), warfarin, and hemin were from Sigma (catalog nos. A3782, A2250, and H2250, respectively), and diazepam was from Sigmapharm, Vienna, Austria. Drugs were used as received, and stock solutions were prepared by dissolving warfarin in sodium phosphate buffer, hemin in 10 mm NaOH (final concentration), and diazepam in absolute ethanol. Blue Sepharose 6 Fast Flow and Superdex 75 prep grade were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lipidex-1000 was purchased from Canberra-Packard. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The gene segments coding for the HSA domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using a cDNA clone of HSA as template.EcoRI restriction sites for the subsequent cloning into the secretion vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen) were attached at the same time. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into Pichia pastoris GS115 by electroporation following standard procedures (Invitrogen). All clones were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and by DNA sequencing. Domains encompassed the following amino acids: HSA-DOM I, 1–197; HSA-DOM II, 189–385; HSA-DOM III, 381–585. All clones contained an extra two N-terminal amino acids (Glu-Phe) due to the restriction site used for cloning. Standard protocols and media formulations were used (Invitrogen). Briefly, clones were grown up on YPD medium and transferred to BMMY medium for induction with methanol in baffled shake flasks. All incubations were performed at 30 °C on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. All manipulations were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation, followed by filtration and dialysis against PBS. 1800 ml of protein containing dialysate were passed through a Blue Sepharose column (150 ml gel volume in a XK50 column) preequilibrated with PBS. After washing with 10 volumes of PBS, elution was performed by 1m KSCN in PBS. After dialysis against PBS and concentration by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 10, Amicon), samples were adjusted to a final NaCl concentration of 0.25 m and were applied to a Superdex 75 prep grade XK26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using PBS containing 0.25 m NaCl as running buffer. For delipidation, a chromatography over Lipidex 1000 was performed at 37 °C according to Glatz and Veerkamp (18Glatz J.F. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1983; 8: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Then, the protein samples were extensively dialyzed against water. Finally, the preparations were concentrated by ultrafiltration as above and lyophilized. All purification steps were monitored with protein assay and SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels were scanned, and the purity of the preparations was evaluated using the program Non-Linear-Dynamic LTD (Phoretics). Protein concentrations were measured by their absorbance at 278 nm on a Hewlett Packard HP8453 spectrophotometer. For HSA, an absorption coefficient ( A278 nm,1 cm0.1%) of 0.58 was used (12Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the HSA domains, the molar extinction coefficients were determined using the method of Gill and Hippel (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). A Bio-Rad protein assay with HSA standard solutions (Sigma) was used to confirm the photometric results. Analysis was performed on an LKB instrument equipped with a variable wavelength monitor set at 214 nm for detection. Data were analyzed using a Nelson Analytical 900 Series interface and Turbochrom3 software. Samples (100 μg/ml) were run in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.15m sodium chloride at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For calibration, a low molecular weight calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Relative masses of the proteins were detected by MALDI-TOF with a Dynamo instrument (Thermo BioAnalysis) using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the UV-absorbing matrix. Calibration of the instrument was performed with carbonic anhydrase. Measurements were made using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter using 1-mm cells at 25 °C in a thermostatic cell holder. Scans were made from 250 to 190 nm. The slit width was programmed for a half-bandwidth of 1 nm, and the dynode voltage never exceeded 0.6 kV. All spectra were recorded at least twice. The data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRW, degrees × cm2 × dmol−1), using the mean residue weights of 113.7 for the intact molecule, 114.9 for HSA-DOM I, 113.2 for HSA-DOM II, and 113.0 for HSA-DOM III. The secondary structure elements of the proteins were determined from the CD spectra (1-nm interval) using the procedure of Provencher and Glöckner (20Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 21Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Measurements were made using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter using 10-mm cells at 25 °C in a thermostatic cell holder. The slit width was programmed for a half-bandwidth of 1 nm and the dynode voltage never exceeded 0.4 kV. Over 250 nm, the results are expressed in molar ellipticity ([θ], degrees × cm2 × dmol−1). In the ICD experiments, all solutions were scanned from a wavelength at which no induced ellipticity was observed (hemin, 450–360 nm; warfarin, 360–260 nm; diazepam, 360–250 nm). Stock solutions of the ligands were prepared as follows and added stepwise to the protein solutions: 2 mm hemin in 10 mm NaOH; 4 mm warfarin in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 4 mm diazepam in absolute ethanol (ethanol concentration in the ICD measurements never exceeded 1% and the effects of the organic solvent on the CD measurements were undetectable). Protein solutions were 10 μm for the hemin measurements and 20 μm for the experiments with warfarin and diazepam, in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. All spectra were recorded at least twice. The induced ellipticity was defined as the ellipticity of the drug/protein mixture minus the ellipticity of the protein alone at the same wavelength and was expressed in degrees. Intrinsic ellipticity was shown to be undetectable for all ligands at the relevant wavelengths. Expression of the domains was achieved as secreted proteins (due to the α-factor leader sequence present in the vector pPICZαA) in the supernatant of the recombinant Pichia clones with yields between 65 and 300 mg/liter. Based on the assumption that HSA harbors several Cibacron Blue binding sites, with each of the domains containing at least one of them, however weak, we successfully employed Blue Sepharose affinity chromatography as the central step in our purification procedure. Binding of HSA-DOM II and HSA-DOM III to the Blue Sepharose column was strongest, since hardly any protein could be detected in the flow-through of the column. The efficiency was somewhat lower for HSA-DOM I, but the overall yield of purified protein was in the same order of magnitude in all three cases. Evaluation of scans of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel indicated a purity of the domain preparations greater than 98% (Fig.2). The chromatographic elution profile (data not shown) of the analytical gel filtration indicated that the HSA domains are present in our preparations as monomeric proteins. MALDI-TOF analysis gave the expected molecular masses of the proteins, and N-terminal sequencing resulted in the expected sequences (leading Glu-Phe residues are due to the EcoRI restriction site used for cloning), indicating both correct cleavage of the α-factor leader sequence as well as the absence of unexpected posttranscriptional modification events. The measured isoelectric points are in close agreement with the values predicted from the sequence.

A comparison of the spectra of the HSA domains with that of intact HSA on a mean residue weight basis is shown in Fig. 3. Minima of the spectra are given in Table I, and the results of the quantitative analysis using the CONTIN program (21Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) are given in TableII. The results obtained with defatted HSA are in good agreement with published data (22- 24). The spectra of HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM III are similar in shape with HSA, but have reduced intensity, indicating reduced α-helix content, which is supported by the quantitative analysis. This is more pronounced in HSA-DOM I than in HSA-DOM III. Evaluation of the results obtained with HSA-DOM II indicates that its structure resembles that of an α + β protein rather than that of an all α protein. This could be due to increased instability of the newly exposed long helical regions at the N and C termini of this domain, as can be seen in Fig. 1.Table IIFraction of secondary structure elements as calculated from the respective CD spectraα-Helixβ-SheetCoilTurnHSA (defatted)66 ± 0.66 ± 0.826 ± 1.12 ± 0.9HSA-DOM I46 ± 0.522 ± 0.720 ± 1.012 ± 0.6HSA-DOM II37 ± 0.534 ± 0.714 ± 0.815 ± 0.9HSA-DOM III53 ± 1.5037 ± 3.010 ± 1.6Human mercaptalbuminaData are from Ref. 22.661123a Data are from Ref. 22Wetzel R.

Open table in a new tab To obtain insight into the molecular environment of the aromatic side chains of HSA as well as the domains, near UV-CD measurements were performed. As can be seen in Fig. 4, HSA and its domains all have negative ellipticity in this wavelength region. For both HSA and each of the domains, we found negative extrema at 268 nm and 262 nm, confirming data that have previously been reported for HSA (25Sjoholm I. Ljungstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8434-8441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sum of the molar ellipticities of the three domains shows the same minima and shape as HSA, especially at wavelengths above 265 nm. Below 265 nm, deviations are observed, which could be due to the additional phenylalanine residue that has been added to the N terminus of each of the domains as a result of the cloning procedure. Taken together, the results of the CD measurements indicate that the domains have secondary and the tertiary structures with significant contribution of α-helical conformation. However, it is clear that β-sheet and random structure elements have increased in percentage as compared with native HSA. This observation is most pronounced for HSA-DOM II. The observed differences to the HSA signals, in particular as seen in the far UV-CD measurements, are probably the result of the disruption of non-covalent bonds stabilizing the albumin tertiary structure in the native molecule rather than of incorrect folding or irreversible denaturation of the domains, as further supported by the ligand binding data shown below. The method of ICD is based on the observation that an optical activity arises from dissymmetry in the ligand induced by its binding to the protein, since the free ligand has either no asymmetric center (hemin, diazepam) or is a racemic mixture (R,S-warfarin) and therefore gives no signal in solution. Fig. 5 A shows the ICD spectra of hemin complexed with the three domains and with HSA. A ligand/protein molar ratio of 0.5 was selected to ensure that all of the ligand is bound to the primary binding site, avoiding interactions with secondary, weaker binding sites. Hemin complexed with HSA-DOM I and HSA, respectively, shows very similar spectra sharing the same minimum at 397 nm, indicating the location of the primary hemin binding site to be on HSA-DOM I. With this ligand, HSA-DOM II and HSA-DOM III display ICD spectra with different shapes, suggesting the presence of one or more secondary, weaker binding sites. However, it cannot be fully excluded that new binding sites, which are not present on native HSA, were created by exposing the domains as isolated proteins. The results of the titration of HSA and HSA-DOM I with hemin are presented in Fig. 5 B. No saturation of the ICD signal was achieved under our experimental conditions; however, a shift in the induced wavelength minimum was observed, which is in accordance with the experiments conducted with HSA by Beaven et al. (26Beaven G.H. Chen S.H. d'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Starting at a molar ratio of hemin to HSA of 2, the negative extrinsic Cotton effect shifts from 397 nm to 400 nm with HSA, while under the same conditions HSA-DOM I causes a shift from 397 nm to 402 nm, which is already finished at a molar ratio of 2. The shift in the induced ellipticity is interpreted by the binding of hemin to one or more secondary binding sites with different binding properties and optical characteristics. This notion is further supported by similar observations in titration of HSA-DOM II und HSA-DOM III, which also show wavelength shifts upon titration with hemin (data not shown). Fig. 6 Ashows the ICD spectra of warfarin complexed with the three domains and with HSA at a molar ratio of warfarin/protein of 0.5. The binding of warfarin to HSA generates extrinsic Cotton effects with a positive band at 308 nm, a negative one at 278 nm, and a positive shoulder near 340 nm, as previously shown by Fehske et al. (27Fehske K.J. Muller W.E. Wollert U. Velden L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 778-789PubMed Google Scholar) and Otagiriet al. (28Otagiri M. Maruyama T. Imai T. Suenaga A. Imamura Y. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1987; 39: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Warfarin binding to HSA-DOM II shows a similar spectrum with respect to positive and negative Cotton effects. However, the intensity of the bands is reduced, the wavelength of the positive and the negative bands is slightly shifted to 310 nm and 281 nm, respectively, and no shoulder is observed in the region of 340 nm. HSA-DOM I shows significant ellipticity with a broad band in the positive region (maximum at 306 nm), whereas no significant signal is observed for HSA-DOM III. The results of the titration of HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM II with warfarin are shown in Fig. 6 (B and C, respectively). A concentration-dependent signal is observed with both domains tested. HSA-DOM II yields a signal that is qualitatively comparable to that of HSA. However, it is clear that the level of the ICD signal obtained with this domain is lower than that obtained with HSA. Based on the concentration-dependent signal observed with HSA-DOM I, it can be concluded either that secondary binding site(s) are located here or, more likely, that a part of the primary binding site is present on this domain, as was previously suggested by Bos et al. (12Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Bos O.J. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1979-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An unambiguous interpretation of the interaction between warfarin and HSA-DOM III is not possible based on the data presented here, since the absence of an ICD signal with this domain could mean either the absence of binding or a binding event that does not produce an ICD signal. The ICD spectrum of diazepam bound to HSA shows a strong positive band at 260 nm and a negative one at 317 nm, which is in accordance with the findings of Wilting et al. (29Wilting J. Hart B.J. De Gier J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, but with reduced intensity, binding of diazepam to HSA-DOM III shows a positive band near 260 nm and a negative one near 315 nm. In contrast, the induced ellipticity of diazepam bound to HSA-DOM I is negative at 260 nm and positive at 315 nm, with considerably lower intensity. Diazepam with HSA-DOM II shows no significant ICD spectrum in the observed wavelength range (Fig.7 A). In the titration experiment (Fig. 7 B), saturation of the signal obtained with HSA was observed at molar ratios higher than 2. However, no such saturation was obtained using HSA-DOM III, indicating that binding of diazepam to this domain, although qualitatively very similar, is probably taking place with reduced affinity as compared with HSA. Numerous reports on the fragmentation of albumins, predominantly of bovine or human origin, have been published in the literature, all of which have been aimed at gaining insight into the structure/function relationships of the different regions of the albumin molecule (e.g. Refs. 8Reed R.G.

The production of fragments employed standard methods, including cyanogen bromide cleavage and proteolytic digestion by pepsin or trypsin. Drug binding studies have for a long time relied on the use of albumin fragments, which proved to be valuable research tools, allowing the dissection and separation of the complex array of different binding sites present on HSA from each other, thereby facilitating the study of the binding of ligands that have more than one binding site on albumin (10Bos O.J.

https://openalex.org/W2032405173,"Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is a key enzyme in the protection of biomembranes exposed to oxidative stress. We investigated the role of mitochondrial PHGPx in apoptosis using RBL2H3 cells that overexpressed mitochondrial PHGPx (M15 cells), cells that overexpressed non-mitochondrial PHGPx (L9 cells), and control cells (S1 cells). The morphological changes and fragmentation of DNA associated with apoptosis occurred within 15 h in S1 and L9 cells upon exposure of cells to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was observed in S1 cells after 4 h and was followed by the activation of caspase-3 within 6 h. Overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx prevented the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-3, and apoptosis, but non-mitochondrial PHGPx lacked the ability to prevent the induction of apoptosis by 2DG. An ability to protect cells from 2DG-induced apoptosis was abolished when the PHGPx activity of M15 cells was inhibited by diethylmalate, indicating that the resistance of M15 cells to apoptosis was indeed due to the overexpression of PHGPx in the mitochondria. The expression of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad, was unchanged by the overexpression of PHGPx in cells. The levels of hydroperoxides, including hydrogen and lipid peroxide, in mitochondria isolated from S1 and L9 cells were significantly increased after the exposure to 2DG for 2 h, while the level of hydroperoxide in mitochondria isolated from M15 cells was lower than that in S1 and L9 cells. M15 cells were also resistant to apoptosis induced by etoposide, staurosporine, UV irradiation, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D, but not to apoptosis induced by Fas-specific antibodies, which induces apoptosis via a pathway distinct from the pathway initiated by 2DG. Our results suggest that hydroperoxide, produced in mitochondria, is a major factor in apoptosis and that mitochondrial PHGPx might play a critical role as an anti-apoptotic agent in mitochondrial death pathways.

Moreover, it has recently been revealed that ROS modulate the physiological state of cells and influence cell death (1Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). A relationship between ROS and apoptosis has been suggested by many experimental findings. Apoptosis is induced by pro-oxidant agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, diamide, etoposide, and semiquinones (2Jabs T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 3Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Other apoptotic stimuli, such as treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and ceramide, also elevate intracellular levels of ROS (4Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,5Degli Esposti M. McLennan H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, suppress apoptosis by acting as scavengers of ROS, and their actions provide additional evidence that ROS act as signaling molecules to initiate apoptosis (6Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are a major physiological source of ROS, which are generated during mitochondrial respiration (7Guarnieri C. Muscari C. Caldarera C.M. Emerit I. Chance B. Free Radicals and Aging. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 73-77Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ROS that are generated in excess in mitochondria act as mediators of the apoptotic signaling pathway (8Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα- and ceramide-induced production of ROS in mitochondria have been proposed as early events in the induction of apoptosis (9Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J.

Activators of apoptosis, such as caspase-2, caspase-9, cytochrome c (as an activator of caspases), and apoptosis-inducing factor, are all found in mitochondria (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N.

Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). The liberation of cytochrome c and that of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria are irreversible execution in the process that leads to apoptosis. Mitochondria also contain proteins that regulate apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl-2 family, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad, which can prevent or accelerate apoptosis (13Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 14Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence in the cited reports indicates that mitochondria are major participants in apoptosis and that ROS produced in mitochondria contribute to cell death by acting as apoptotic signaling molecules. The production of ROS in mitochondria is regulated by a number of antioxidant enzymes within mitochondria, which include phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), classical glutathione peroxidase (cGPx), and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). The proposal of a role for mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes in preventing apoptosis is based on the observation that Bcl-2, a general inhibitor of apoptosis in mammalian cells, has an apparent antioxidant function (15Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is localized predominantly in mitochondrial membranes. Cells that overexpress Bcl-2 are resistant to apoptosis that is normally caused by agents such as TNFα, staurosporine, and etoposide (16Albrecht H. Tschopp J. Jongeneel C.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recently, Manna et al. (19Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoptosis of MCF-7 cells upon treatment with TNFα was completely suppressed by the overexpression of Mn-SOD. Such reports suggest that antioxidant enzymes localized in mitochondria might be linked to apoptosis and might contribute to modulation of apoptotic signals. PHGPx is a unique intracellular antioxidant enzyme that directly reduces peroxidized lipids that have been produced in cell membranes (20Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 21Thomas J.P. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Girotti A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although PHGPx might participate in defense systems as an anti-oxidant enzyme that protects lipids in mitochondria from damage (22Flohé L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 643-731Google Scholar), little is known about the biological significance of mitochondrial PHGPx in apoptosis that is mediated by mitochondrial pathways. We conducted a series of experiments to clarify the role of PHGPx in mammalian cells. Two types of PHGPx (of 20 and 23 kDa, respectively) were translated in vitro from a cDNA that included two sites for initiation of transcription (23Imai H. Sumi D. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Sugiyama A. Chiba N. Kuchino Y. Nakagama Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the long form of PHGPx (23 kDa) was the mitochondrial PHGPx and included a signal peptide for transport to mitochondria, while the short form of PHGPx (20 kDa) was the non-mitochondrial PHGPx. Recently, we obtained evidence to indicate that PHGPx plays a role as an antioxidant enzyme in mammalian cells. Stably transformed rat basophile leukemia 2H3 (RBL2H3) cells harboring the gene for non-mitochondrial PHGPx were resistant to cell death caused by a radical initiator (25Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Overexpression of non-mitochondrial PHGPx suppresses the activity of 5-lipoxygenase by reducing lipid hydroperoxides in nuclei (26Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx also protects cell from necrotic death caused by chemical hypoxia. However, non-mitochondrial PHGPx does not protect cells from necrotic death. Cells undergo necrosis when exposed to severe oxidative stress due to exogenously added ROS (27Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial PHGPx suppressed apoptotic cell death via the mitochondrial death pathway that was activated by 2DG, deprivation of glucose, etoposide, staurosporine, UV irradiation, actinomycin D, or cycloheximide, but it was ineffective in cases of Fas-mediated or A23187-induced apoptosis. Non-mitochondrial PHGPx suppressed neither Fas-mediated apoptosis nor mitochondrial apoptosis. It seems possible that hydroperoxide produced in mitochondria might play a crucial role in the liberation of cytochromec from mitochondria. Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) and dihydroethidium (DHE) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Hoechst 33258 and digitonin were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG), diethylmalate (DEM), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, staurosporine, etoposide, and A23187 were purchased from Sigma. Acetyl-DEVD-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Ac-DEVD-MCA), a substrate for caspase-3, was obtained from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Specific antibodies against Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bad were purchased from Transduction. Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Specific polyclonal antibodies against Bax were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Specific polyclonal antibodies against Fas antigen were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A specific monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c was obtained from PharMingen, Inc. (San Diego, CA). We used the previously established strains of PHGPx-overexpressing RBL2H3 cells, namely L9 cells that overexpressed non-mitochondrial PHGPx and M15 cells that overexpressed mitochondrial PHGPx. The control cells (S1) have been stably transfected with the expression vector without inserts (27Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) that contained 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Glucose depletion was achieved by incubating cells in the presence of 100 mm 2DG in DMEM that contained 5% FCS for 16 h or in glucose-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% dialyzed FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16 h. S1, L9, and M15 cells were plated at 0.5 × 105 cells/well in flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates and cultured for 24 h. Apoptotic cell death was induced by treating cells with indicated doses of antibodies against rat Fas for 40 h, of etoposide for 16 h, of the calcium ionophore A23187 with 1 mm CaCl2 for 16 h, of actinomycin D for 16 h, of cycloheximide for 16 h, and of staurosporine for 16 h. Some cells were exposed to UV-B light at the indicated dose and then incubated for 16 h. An assay of the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used for the determination of cell viability, as described previously (27Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h with 2 mm DEM for depletion of glutathione (GSH) prior to exposure to 2DG, and they were then incubated for 16 h with 100 mm 2DG in addition to glucose at the indicated dose to examine the requirement for glucose of cell viability. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33258. Cells were collected, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and then fixed for 20 min in 3.6% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were stained with 1.6 μm Hoechst 33258 for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, the samples were treated with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) before mounting. Samples were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) that was equipped with a 100× objective, with excitation at 360 nm. At the indicated times, 2 × 106 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 250 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmEDTA). An equal amount of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) was then added, and cells were lysed for 30 min. Then the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. DNA in supernatants was precipitated with ethanol, treated with RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Almere, The Netherlands) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then extracted with phenol and chloroform. Recovered fragments of DNA were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Cells were treated with 100 mm 2DG, 50 μm etoposide, 0.1 μm staurosporine, 1 μm calcium ionophore (A23187), plus 1 mm CaCl2 or 300 ng/ml antibodies against rat Fas. At the times indicated, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 400 μl of PBS with 10 μg/ml digitonin at 37 °C for 5 min. Lysates were collected and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. Supernatants were diluted with 400 μl of reaction buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) and incubated with 50 μmol of Ac-DEVD-MCA, as the substrate for caspase-3, at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin that had been cleaved from Ac-DEVD-MCA by caspase-3 was measured with a CytoFluor system (model 4000; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. After incubations, supernatants of lysates of digitonin-treated cells were collected, as described above, for analysis of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Proteins in supernatants were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid and precipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15.0% polyacrylamide) under non-reducing conditions. Bands of proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (26Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was blocked by incubation with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) for 1 h and incubated with antibodies against cytochromec for 2 h. The PVDF membrane was then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies raised in goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The binding of antibodies to the PVDF membrane was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Cell homogenates (50 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 15.0% acrylamide gel, and bands of protein were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, and Bax was examined by immunoblotting with the corresponding specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, as described above. Cellular levels of ATP were determined by the luciferin-luciferase method (28Naderi S. Melchior D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with a kit from Sigma. After incubation in medium that contained 100 mm 2DG for indicated times, cells were washed twice with PBS and then scraped into 0.04 m Tris borate buffer (pH 9.2). The suspensions of cells were then placed in boiling water for 5 min to inactive cellular ATPases. The samples were then chilled and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Then 15-μl aliquots of samples were added to 100-μl aliquots of the luciferin-luciferase reagent. After addition of the luciferin-luciferase, luminescence was immediately monitored over a 10-s period with a CytoFluor plate reader. Levels of intracellular hydroperoxide and superoxide were monitored by measuring changes in fluorescence that resulted from oxidation of an intracellular probe. To assess levels of intracellular hydroperoxide, we used 2 μg/ml DHR. DHR is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxide to yield fluorescent rhodamine 123 (Rh123). To assess levels of superoxide, we used 2 μg/ml DHE. DHE is oxidized by superoxide to yield fluorescent ethidium. Cells were plated at 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated in DMEM that contained DHR (2 μg/ml) or DHE (2 μg/ml). 2DG was added to give a final concentration of 100 mm in a final total volume of 1 ml. Fluorescence was monitored with a CytoFluor plate reader at the indicated times. To assess levels of mitochondrial hydroperoxide, mitochondria of RBL2H3 cells treated with or without 2DG for 4 h were prepared by differential centrifugation of cell homogenates as described previously (27Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Aliquots of mitochondria were incubated with 2 μg/ml DHR for 20 min, and fluorescence was monitored with a CytoFluor plate reader. Concentrations of proteins were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. In a previous study, we prepared three lines of RBL2H3 cells as follows: cells that overexpressed mitochondrial PHGPx (M15 cells), cells that overexpressed non-mitochondrial PHGPx (L9 cells), and cells that expressed the vector only (S1 cells). We studied the resistance of these three lines to apoptotic cell death in response to glucose deprivation. Cells were cultured in glucose-free medium, and viability was monitored in terms of the release of LDH (Fig.1 A). Numbers of dead S1 cells increased gradually after incubation for 8 h and reached approximately 80% of the total within 12 h. By contrast to S1 cells, M15 cells were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of glucose deprivation and more than 90% remained viable at 12 h. L9 cells, which overexpressed non-mitochondrial PHGPx, were quite sensitive to the glucose deprivation, resembling S1 cells in this respect. Cells were exposed to 2DG, which competitively inhibits the cellular uptake and utilization of glucose. The cytotoxic effect of 2DG was observed, and the effect was both dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 1, B and C). S1 and L9 cells were particularly susceptible to treatment with 2DG, and cell deaths were observed after 15 h. Overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx markedly protected cells from the toxic effects of 2DG. By contrast, non-mitochondrial PHGPx did not prevent cell death. The difference in the effects of 2DG on M15 and L9 cells was not due to a difference between rates of uptake of 2DG since no significant differences in rates of uptake of tritiated 2DG were observed among the three lines of cells during treatment with 2DG (data not shown). The nature of the cell death caused by 2DG was examined by monitoring the morphology of nuclei by fluorescence microscopy and the pattern of DNA fragmentation by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (Fig.2, A and B). The cleavage of DNA into a “ladder” of fragments was clearly detected in S1 and L9 cells after incubation with 2DG for 14 h (Fig.2 A). Condensation of nuclei was also observed after staining with Hoechst 33258 of nuclei in S1 and L9 cells, when treatment with 2DG had been continued for 16 h (Fig. 2 B). These results showed clearly that 2DG had induced apoptotic cellular death in S1 and L9 cells. Neither fragmentation of DNA nor the condensation of nuclei was observed in M15 cells. We examined the effects of exogenously added glucose on apoptosis in order to determine whether the apoptosis caused by 2DG was initiated by the depletion of utilizable glucose in cells (Fig.3). Exogenously added glucose prevented the killing of cells by 2DG, and the viability of S1 and L9 cells were restored to 80–90% after the addition of glucose at 100 mm to the growth medium. The release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3 were monitored in order to examine the signaling pathway of 2DG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). Cytochrome c, released from mitochondria, was detectable in S1 and L9 cells 4 h after the start of exposure to 2DG, while no detectable cytochrome c was found in the cytosol of 2DG-treated M15 cells (Fig. 4 A). The proteolytic activity of caspases was measured in terms of the ability to cleave Ac-DEVD-MCA, which is a substrate of caspase-3, a common effector of apoptosis (Fig.4 B). No evidence for the activation of caspase-1 was found during 2DG-induced apoptosis in RBL2H3 cells (data not shown). No activation of caspase-3 in S1 and L9 cells was detected for 3 h after the start of treatment with 2DG, but activation was evident at 6 h, after the release of cytochrome c. The activation of caspase-3 reached a maximum at 15 h, and apoptotic cell death occurred at this time. No activation of caspases was induced by 2DG in M15 cells. Activation of caspase-3 appears to be associated with the process of apoptosis since acetyl-DEVD-Chinese hamster ovary, an irreversible inhibitor of caspase-3, effectively protected cells from apoptosis induced by 2DG (data not shown). These results indicate that 2DG induces the liberation of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis and, moreover, that mitochondrial PHGPx prevents apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria. Since the overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx had a considerable protective effect against the toxicity of 2DG, we examined whether the resistance to 2DG of M15 cells might have resulted from the overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx. DEM, which is a glutathione-depleting (GSH-depleting) agent, inhibits the activity of PHGPx by lowering the level of intracellular glutathione. The level of intracellular GSH fell to approximately 3% of the control level after treatment of cells with DEM, as described previously (29Sakamoto H. Kitahara J. Nakagawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of DEM on cell viability, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the activity of caspase-3 after the exposure to 2DG of DEM-pretreated cells (Fig. 5). When M15 cells had been pretreated with DEM, they lost their resistance to 2DG (Fig. 5 A) and exhibited typical symptoms of apoptotic death, such as DNA fragmentation and the condensation of nuclei (data not shown). Inhibition of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3 in 2DG-treated M15 cells were prevented when the PHGPx activity was inhibited (Fig. 5,B and C). These results confirm that the resistance of M15 cells to 2DG-induced apoptotic death was indeed due to the overexpression of PHGPx in mitochondria. Levels of intracellular ATP were measured in S1, L9, and M15 cells when the utilization of glucose was impaired by 2DG (Fig.6). The level of ATP fell markedly to 25% of the control level within 1 h. No significant differences in the extent of the reduction in the level of ATP were observed among the three lines of cells at the early stage of apoptosis. Levels of ATP in S1 and L9 cells fell still further at the late phase (16 h), at which time most S1 and L9 cells were no longer viable. Members of the family of Bcl-2-related proteins, which are apoptosis-regulating proteins, include both antagonists (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and agonists (Bax and Bad) of apoptosis. We evaluated the expression of these proteins by immunoblotting analysis in order to characterize the participation of each protein in apoptosis (Fig.7). We found no significant differences in the respective levels of expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad between cells that were resistant and cells that were sensitive to 2DG-induced apoptosis. Our finding that protection from apoptosis was associated with the overexpression of mitochondrial PHGPx suggested that mitochondrial injury caused by 2DG might increase levels of ROS. Therefore, we determined levels of superoxide and hydroperoxide using specific fluorescent indicators. Marked increases in the levels of intracellular superoxide and hydroperoxide including hydrogen and lipid peroxides were observed after the exposure of cells to 2DG (Fig.8). Superoxide was detectable in S1, L9, and M15 cells within 1 h after the start of exposure to 2DG, and its level increased at a steady rate for up to 4 h. There were no differences in rates of production of superoxide among the three lines of cells (Fig. 8 A). Hydroperoxide also accumulated in cells after exposure to 2DG. It accumulated more slowly than superoxide and was first detectable in S1 cells at 2 h. Overexpression of PHGPx suppressed the production of hydroperoxide, and the production o"

Shank directly interacts with GKAP and Homer, thus potentially bridging the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-PSD-95-GKAP complex and the mGluR-Homer complex in synapses (Naisbitt, S., Kim, E., Tu, J.

S., Brakeman, P., Doan, A., Aakalu, V. K., Lanahan, A. A., Sheng, M., and Worley, P. F. (1999) Neuron 23, 583–592). Shank contains multiple domains for protein-protein interaction including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 domain, a sterile α motif domain, and a proline-rich region. By characterizingShank cDNA clones and RT-PCR products, we found that there are four sites for alternative splicing in Shank1 and another four sites in Shank2, some of which result in deletion of specific domains of the Shank protein. In addition, the expression of the splice variants is differentially regulated in different regions of rat brain during development. Immunoblot analysis of Shank proteins in rat brain using five different Shank antibodies reveals marked heterogeneity in size (120–240 kDa) and differential spatiotemporal expression. Shank1 immunoreactivity is concentrated at excitatory synaptic sites in adult brain, and the punctate staining of Shank1 is seen in developing rat brains as early as postnatal day 7. These results suggest that alternative splicing in the Shank family may be a mechanism that regulates the molecular structure of Shank and the spectrum of Shank-interacting proteins in the PSDs of adult and developing brain.

One interesting question is whether there is any physical link between these specific glutamate receptor complexes and whether these links are regulated.Recently, a synaptic protein, termed Shank, that may bridge the NMDA receptor complex and the mGluR receptor complex has been isolated (22Naisbitt S.

Shank is made of five domain/regions that are likely involved in protein-protein interactions: ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PDZ domain, an SAM domain, and a proline-rich region.

The proline-rich region of Shank directly interacts with the EVH1 domain of Homer, a putative anchoring protein for mGluR receptor (11Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A., R, O.B. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Thus, Shank may bridge two different (NMDA and metabotropic) glutamate receptor complexes.Interestingly, the characterization of multiple cDNA clones ofShank1 and Shank2 suggests the presence of diverse splice variants in the Shank family. Here, we show that these splice sites are mainly localized at the boundaries between the domains of Shank, suggesting that Shank proteins with diverse domain compositions can be generated by alternative splicing. We investigated the heterogeneity of Shank in the rat brain at both mRNA and protein level and analyzed the differential regulation and localization of Shank proteins during rat brain development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNorthern Blot AnalysisTo make specific probes for Northern blot analysis, the inserts of the original yeast two hybrid clones containing part of Shanks (the r8 clone of Shank1, the r9 clone of Shank2, and the h10 clone of Shank3) (22Naisbitt S.

Rat multiple tissue Northern membrane (CLONTECH) was sequentially probed with the Shank probes in ExpressHyb solution following the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH).RT-PCR AnalysisTotal RNA from cortex and cerebellum of adult and developing rat brains were isolated by using RNAgents total RNA isolation system (Promega). RT-PCRs were performed using specific primers (Table I) and the Access RT-PCR system (Promega). RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 68 °C for 1 min. Relevant cDNAs and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. RT-PCR products were resolved on 3% agarose gels. Calculation of the ratio of band signals with and without an insert was done by scanning positive photographs followed by densitometric reading with the Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).Table INucleotide sequences of the primers used in RT-PCRPrimer nameNucleotide sequenceShank1 Ins 1aCTTTACAGTGAGGGTCACTCTTGCTShank1 Ins 1bCCGCCGACCGGGACTCAGCAGCShank1 Ins 1rACACTCGCTGGCACTGTGGCGTTCShank1 Ins 2aGGCAAAGAGACTCTTCAGGCATTACShank1 Ins 2bCCGCCCCCTGCGCTATCCTCCAShank1 Ins 2rTGTCCTTCTTCTGCAGTAAGACTGTShank1 Ins 3aCATCTCCCTGCGTTCCAAGTCTATGShank1 Ins 3rCTCATCCAGTTTGTTGAGTGCCATCShank1 Ins 4aGCAGCACAGACAGCCACCACGGAGGTShank1 Ins 4rGTTTAGGCCAGTTCTGAAAGATGCTGShank2 Ins 1aCGTGCGGACCGCAGCAAGAAGCTCShank2 Ins 1bGTGATGATGACCGGTTACAATAATGShank2 Ins 1rAGCACAAATCCAAAGCCCTCGTTGTShank2 Ins 2 & 3aCCACCTCCAAAGCGGGCTCCGACCAShank2 Ins 2 & 3rTTCTATGGCCACGTTCTCTGCAGTCShank2 Ins 4fTCCCTCGAGGTACGATGCGAAGGCAShank2 Ins 4aCTGGCATGGACAAGCTTCGGGTGAAShank2 Ins 4bGTGAGAGGCCCAGGGCTCAGAATTGAPDHaGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.forwardGGGTGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTGAPDH reverseAAGAATGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCa GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Open table in a new tab Expression Constructs, COS Cell Transfection, and ImmunohistochemistryHA-tagged Shank expression constructs were made as follows. The r8 clone of Shank1 and the r9 clone ofShank2 were amplified by PCR, digested with XbaI, and subcloned into pCDNA3 HA (Invitrogen). The h10 clone ofShank3 was isolated from pGAD10 by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pCDNA3 HA. GW1 mammalian expression construct containing the full-length Shank1a has been described (22Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala S. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) (GW1, British Biotechnology). GW1 Shank1b construct lacking the C-terminal SAM domain was made by replacing the C-terminal AvrII-SalI (nucleotides 4340–7040) fragment of Shank1a (GenBankTM accession number AF131951) with the AvrII-SalI (nucleotides 4340–6919) fragment from the Shank1 clone 1-3-11 that contains an insertion (81 base pairs) with an in frame stop codon (Ins 4 in Fig. 3 B and Fig.6 D). Thus, GW1 Shank1b (total 1863 amino acid residues long) contains aa 1–1849 of Shank1a + aa 1–14 of Ins 4 of Shank1 (see Fig.3 B). GW1 Shank1c and Shank1d were made by replacing the N-terminal ankyrin repeat + SH3 domain (aa 1–582) of Shank1a and Shank1b with Ins 2b of Shank1, which contains an alternative translational start site (see Fig. 3 B and Fig.6 D). Specifically, a PCR product containing aa 37–88 (see Fig. 3 B) of Ins 2b + aa 583–618 of Shank1a was amplified by PCR from the Shank1 clone r11 (22Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala S.

This construct was again linearized by EcoRI digestion and ligated with theEcoRI fragment of GW1 Shank1a containing aa 619–2087 of Shank1a to make GW1 Shank1c, or ligated with the EcoRI fragment of GW1 Shank1b containing aa 619–1863 of Shank1b to make GW Shank1d.Figure 6Characterization of Shank antibodies and the heterogeneity of Shank proteins in brain. A, anti-Shank antibodies. The regions of Shank1 and Shank2 used as antigens for generating the various Shank antibodies are indicated. The nature of the antibody is described. B, specificity of anti-Shank antibodies. Individual antibodies were tested by Western blotting of COS cells transfected with HA-tagged partial Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 cDNAs (lanes 2–4) or untransfected COS cells (lane 1). 1355 and 1356 antipeptide antibodies are relatively specific for Shank1, whereas 3856 and Sh2-15 react with Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3. 3858 is relatively specific for Shank1 and Shank2. The position of molecular mass standards is indicated in kDa. A nonspecific band recognized by HA antibody is indicated by an asterisk. C,heterogeneity of Shank proteins in rat brain. Crude synaptosomal proteins (P2 fraction) from adult rat cortex and cerebellum were immunoblotted with various Shank antibodies (lanes 1–10), or with the same antibodies preincubated with their cognate antigens (lanes 11–20). Shank1-specific antibodies reveals several bands (240, 220, 190, 180, 130, and 120 kDa, lanes 1–4), whereas the other Shank antibodies with broad specificity recognize additional bands indicated by circles (210, 170, and 160 kDa, lanes 5–10). The asterisk indicates a nonspecific band recognized by 3858 antibody. D, comigration of brain Shank bands with Shank proteins expressed in COS cells. Shank proteins expressed in COS cells were run along with the cortical (Ctx) crude synaptosomal Shank proteins to get an idea of the molecular nature of the brain bands (Untrans,untransfected). Schematic domain structures of Shank1a, Shank1b, Shank1c, and Shank1d are shown. The membrane was probed with Shank (3856) antibody that can recognize all four (Shank1a–d) Shank proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the specificity of Shank antibodies under Western and immunohistochemical conditions, the HA-tagged Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 were used to transfect COS cells on six-well plates or coverslips coated with polylysine, respectively. COS cell transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (DNA:LipofectAMINE ratio of 0.4 μg:1.2 μl) and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h of transfection, COS cells on six-well plates were harvested and used for immunoblot analysis. For immunohistochemical analysis, COS cells on coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and stained with anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1356 Shank1 antibodies at 1 μg/ml each for 1 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:200 and 1: 1000 for 30 min, respectively. The images of COS cells were captured by using LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss).AntibodiesTo make anti-peptide Shank antibodies, two synthetic peptides containing aa 544–559 (QEGRQESRSDKAKRLFCfor 1355 antibody) and aa 425–440 (CARSPSRGRHPEDAKRQ for 1356 antibody) of Shank1a were synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and immunized to rabbits (QCB). Cysteines, indicated by underline, were introduced to couple the peptides to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. To make anti-fusion protein Shank antibodies, the regions containing the SH3 + PDZ domains of Shank1 (aa 469–691) or Shank2 (aa 94–309 of the rat r9 clone) were amplified by PCR, digested withBamHI, and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pET32a (thioredoxin fusion protein, Novagen) digested withBamHI and CIP. Glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Probond resin (Promega), respectively. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were used to immunize rabbits, and thioredoxin fusion proteins were used to make affinity columns for the purification of specific antibodies (Sulfolink, Pierce). To raise a monoclonal antibody, thioredoxin fusion protein containing the SH3 + PDZ domains of Shank2 was used as immunogen. Guinea pig PSD-95 antibody was described previously (7Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies specific for PSD-95 (K28/58.8.5) and glutamic acid decarboxylase were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. and Sigma, respectively.Immunoblot AnalysisCrude synaptosomal membrane proteins (P2 fraction) from different regions of adult and developing rat brains were used in immunoblot analysis. PSD fractions were isolated as described (27Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Protein samples resolved by SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Working concentrations for the primary antibody incubation were as follows: Shank polyclonal antibodies, 1–2 μg/ml; Shank monoclonal antibody, 1:1000 dilution; PSD-95 monoclonal and HA antibody, 1 μg/ml.Immunohistochemistry on Rat Brain SectionsAdult and developing rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brain sections were cut by using vibratome. Brain sections were permeabilized by incubating the sections in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) + 1 mm EDTA) containing 15 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 10 min, or by incubating in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 at room temp for 10 min. For DAB staining, sections were incubated with Shank1 antibody (1356) at 1 μg/ml at room temperature overnight followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody in the Elite Vectastain ABC kit (Vector). For immunofluorescence staining, brain sections were incubated with Shank1 (1356), PSD-95 (guinea pig), or glutamic acid decarboxylase (Sigma) antibody at 1 μg/ml or 1:1000 dilution followed by Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:1000 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively (Jackson Immunoresearch). The images were captured by using LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss).RESULTSComparision of the Members of the Shank FamilyTo extend the protein interaction network extending from the NMDA receptor-PSD-95 complex, we have searched binding partners of GKAP, an abundant protein that binds to the GK domain of PSD-95 (24Kim E.

Alignment of the amino acid sequences of EST19111 and the r9 clone (original yeast two hybrid rat Shank2 clone) reveals 99% of amino acid sequence identity in the region of high homology including the PDZ domain, whereas the N-terminal region of EST191111 is completely different from the r9 clone, suggesting the presence of a splice variation in this region (Fig.1 A). In addition, EST191111 showed 99% amino acid sequence identity to CortBP1, a recently published rat protein enriched in the growth cone (31Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W.C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), except for its C terminus, suggesting the presence of another splice variation in this region (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that the r9 clone, EST191111, and CortBP1 are splice variants of the same gene, termedShank2/CortBP1.Figure 1Comparison of the domain structure of Shank family proteins and cortBP1.

The similar domain structure and amino acid sequences of Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 suggest that they are the members of a protein family.Tissue distribution of mRNAs of Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 was examined by Northern blotting of poly(A) RNA (Fig. 2).Shank1 mRNA (10 kilobases) is exclusively expressed in rat brain; Shank2 mRNA (9 kilobases) is strongly expressed in brain and at lower levels in liver and kidney, whereasShank3 mRNA (7–7.5 kilobases) is expressed abundantly in heart and moderately in brain and spleen.Figure 2Tissue distribution of Shank mRNAs by Northern blot analysis.

Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). We found four splice sites in Shank1 and another four in Shank2 (Fig.3 A). Actual nucleotide or amino acid sequences of alternative insertion(s) at each splice site are shown (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, some insertions contain alternative translational start codons (Shank1 Ins 2b and Shank2 Ins 1) or in frame stop codons (Shank1 Ins 4 and Shank2 Ins 4). In addition, most of the splice sites are located between the recognizable domains, except for the first splice site of Shank1 and the fourth splice site of Shank2 (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that alternative splicing in Shank can not only introduce small insertions but also generate Shank splice variants with differential domain compositions. For instance, the N-terminal ankyrin repeats + SH3 domain or the C-terminal SAM domain can be deleted in Shank1. Similarly, the N-terminal ankyrin repeats + SH3 domain, or the proline-rich region + SAM domain can be deleted in Shank2. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are additional alternative splice sites in Shank, for instance, at sites in Shank2 that are equivalent to sites 1 and 4 in Shank1. Systematic characterization of alternative splicing in Shank3 was not performed because only one cDNA clone (h10) for Shank3 was available.Differential Expression of the Splice Variants of Shank1 and Shank2 in Developing BrainTo test in vivo existence and differential expression of Shank splice variants, we performed RT-PCR analysis on total RNA from cortex and cerebellum of adult and developing rat brains (Fig. 4).

Concomitantly, Gβγ stimulated autophosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ (EC50, 30 nm; stoichiometry ≥0.6 mol of Pi/mol of p110γ), which also occurred in the absence of p101. Surprisingly, we found that p101 affected the lipid substrate preference of PI3Kγ in its Gβγ-stimulated state. With phosphatidylinositol as substrate, p110γ but not p101/p110γ was significantly stimulated by Gβγ to form PI-3-phosphate (EC50, 20 nm). The opposite situation was found when PI-4,5-bisphosphate served as substrate. Gβγ efficiently and potently (EC50, 5 nm) activated the p101/p110γ heterodimer but negligibly stimulated the p110γ monomer to form PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate. However, this weak stimulatory effect on p110γ was overcome by excess concentrations of Gβγ (EC50, 100 nm). This finding is in accordance with the in vivo situation, where activated PI3K catalyzes the formation of PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate but not PI-3-phosphate. We conclude that p101 is responsible for PI-4,5-bisphosphate substrate selectivity of PI3Kγ by sensitizing p110γ toward Gβγ in the presence of PI-4,5-P2.

On the one hand it is cleaved into inositol-1,4,5-P3 and diacylglycerol by members of the phospholipase C family (4Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which respond to receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (5Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S.

On the other hand, the d-3 position of the inositol ring of PI-4,5-P2 is sensitive to phosphorylation leading to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3) (7Cantley L.C. Auger K.R.

PI-3,4,5-P3 is considered to act as a second messenger, since it is absent in quiescent cells but spikes instantly upon exposure to various stimuli (8Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Harris A.L. Thompson B.L.

Putative PI-3,4,5-P3-dependent functions include regulation of cell proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and vesicle trafficking (10Bi L. Okabe I. Bernard D.J. Wynshaw-Boris A.

PI-3,4,5-P3 is generated from PI-4,5-P2 by members of a considerably large family of enzymes called class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) (16Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S.

They are heterodimers consisting of 110–120-kDa catalytic (p110α, -β, -γ, and -δ) and 50–100-kDa non-catalytic subunits (p85α, -β, p55γ, and p101), which are also capable of phosphorylating PI and PI-4-P in vitro, although they are assumed to exhibit a preference for PI-4,5-P2 within the cell (21Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Hawkins P.T. Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In contrast, class II and class III PI3Ks show a more restrictive lipid specificity (23Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9129-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Activation of class I PI3Ks is observed in response to a wide array of cellular ligands including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and cytokines. Although an ever increasing number of cellular responses are elicited by these lipid kinases, a remarkable degree of specificity is maintained within pleiotropic PI3K-dependent signaling pathways, allowing the assignment of intracellular effects to extracellular stimuli. This surprising specificity is certainly due to a structural heterogeneity of class I PI3K isoforms in concert with different expression patterns as well as spatial and/or temporal compartmentation. Based on their tight association with non-catalytic binding proteins, catalytic subunits of class I PI3Ks are subdivided into class IA p85- or class IB p101-associated heterodimers. Until recently this grouping went strictly parallel with the isoform-specific regulation by different signaling pathways. Whereas class IA-isoforms (p110α, -β, and -δ) were assumed to be sensitive to tyrosine kinases, the only class IB member p110γ is activated by G-proteins. This structure-function relationship was challenged by reports detailing a synergistic activation of PI3Kβ and other so far unidentified isoforms by either regulator (24Kurosu H. Hazeki O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14193-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In line with their sensitivity toward tyrosine kinases, the catalytic p110 subunits of PI3Kα, -β, and -δ are associated with p85 adaptors, which are indispensable for activation (27Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These adaptors harbor various regions such as SH2-, SH3-, or proline-rich domains, which contribute to further selectivity within tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways (18Fruman D.A.

Genet. 1999; 2: 230-235Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, the G-protein-regulated p110γ does not bind to p85 adaptors but instead associates with a non-catalytic p101 subunit (31Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D.

Nevertheless at first it was assumed to serve as an adaptor for Gβγ liberated by GPCRs. However, we and others (26Tang X. Downes C.P. J. Biol.

Thus, the function of this p101 non-catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ has yet to be identified. Versatility in PI3K-dependent signaling appears to be accomplished by a second enzymatic function, i.e.protein-serine kinase activity, which is inherent to the class I PI3Ks (34Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Accordingly, first evidence emerged that cellular signaling bifurcates at the level of the PI3Kγ (35Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Whereas lipid kinase activity of PI3Kγ stimulated protein kinase B, its protein kinase activity signaled to the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this context recent reports are of interest which suggested that the non-catalytic p101 subunit was crucial for supporting p110γ-induced protein kinase B and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation but had only little effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (36Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1998; 275: 394-397Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 37Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, p101 may function as a regulatory subunit of PI3Kγ that differently modulates protein and lipid kinase activity of PI3Kγ. The intention of the present study was to examine the sensitivity of PI3Ks toward Gβγ. We therefore purified recombinant proteins including all four known class I PI3K isoforms. Monomeric and heterodimeric enzyme preparations were analyzed for the role of non-catalytic subunits as adaptors for Gβγ-induced stimulation of PI3Ks. Furthermore, this experimental approach was successfully applied to assign a novel functional role to the p101 subunit of PI3Kγ. Construction of recombinant baculoviruses for expression of PI3K subunits was described previously (31Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B.

For protein expression, cells were incubated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 virus per cell. Subunits of heterodimeric PI3Ks were coexpressed at equal m.o.i. numbers in Sf9 cells and used for functional studies. After 48–60 h of infection cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 ×g) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice. For purification of GST fusion proteins cells were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, benzamidine, leupeptin, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc® SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). They were disrupted by N2cavitation (30 min at 4 °C, 25 bar) or by forcing the cell suspension through a 22-gauge needle (5 times) and subsequently through a 26-gauge needle (10 times). Nuclei and debris were discarded. The cytosolic fraction was separated from the particulate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 50 min. Cytosol was incubated 3–4 h with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prewashed with buffer A. The Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins were stored at −20 °C in buffer B containing 50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.57 mg/ml benzamidine. For enzymatic assays GST fusion proteins were freshly eluted with buffer C consisting of buffer A with 10 mm glutathione for 1 h at 4 °C. For purification of hexa-His-tagged PI3Kβ cells were disrupted using buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 μg/ml each of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, benzamidine, leupeptin, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc®SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the same procedure as described above. The cytosolic fraction was incubated 1–2 h with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) prewashed with buffer D containing 20 mm imidazole. After extensive washing with buffer D, proteins were eluted with buffer D containing 150 mm imidazole. Purified proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For coexpression experiments with recombinant subunits of PI3Kγ, i.e. p101, p110γ, and mutants thereof, equal m.o.i. numbers for all recombinant baculoviruses were used. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and eluted GST fusion proteins were analyzed for binding of p101. For coexpression experiments with recombinant Gβ1γ2, cell lysates were obtained by forcing the Sf9 cell suspension through needles as described above and subsequent incubation (30 min) with buffer A supplemented with 0,5% Lubrol PX. After incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B eluted proteins were analyzed for bound Gβγ. For isolation of bovine brain Gβγ, we employed standard techniques with modifications. Bovine brain G-proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity in the presence of aluminum fluoride. Isolation and final purification of Gβγ was achieved using a Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fast protein liquid chromatography column (39Exner T. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Kleuss C. Nürnberg B. Proc.

Gβγ complexes were identified by their immunoreactivity to specific antisera and quantified by the method of Lowry and by Coomassie Blue staining of Gβ following SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Contamination by pertussis toxin-sensitive (PT) Gα subunits was excluded by analysis of autoradiographic signals after PT-mediated [32P]ADP ribosylation with a BAS 1500 Fuji-Imager (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Purified Gβγ were highly concentrated and contained Lubrol PX (0.1%) and CHAPS (11 mm) as detergents and were stored at −70 °C until use.

Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and supplied by Schering AG, Berlin. A non-phosphorylated peptide was used as a control and had no effect. Characterization of the monoclonal antibody against p110γ, antisera against p101, and Gβ subunits (AS 398) were detailed elsewhere (33Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-GST antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). For detection of GST fusion proteins, p110γ, p101, or Gβ, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Visualization of specific antisera was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the CDP-Star chemiluminescence reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Lipid kinase activity was determined basically as detailed previously (33Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 41Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nürnberg B. Macrez N.

In brief, the assays were conducted in a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 120 mm NaCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (buffer E) as described with some modifications. Lipid vesicles (30 μl containing 320 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, 300 μm phosphatidylserine, 140 μm phosphatidylcholine, 30 μm sphingomyelin supplemented with either 300 μm PI or 40 μmPI-4,5-P2 in buffer E) were mixed with stimuli as indicated and incubated on ice for 10 min. For measuring the effects of Gβγ on PI3K activity, it was ensured that stimuli-containing vehicles did not suppress enzymatic activity. In addition, assay samples containing different amounts of Gβγ were adjusted to identical detergent concentrations, i.e. 0.0004% for Lubrol PX and 0.044% for CHAPS. Mg2+ at 10 and 7 mm for PI and PI-4,5-P2 as substrates, respectively, was added to lipids before sonification. For inhibition assays, kinase preparations were preincubated with wortmannin or 17-OH wortmannin (Schering AG) at 37 °C. Thereafter, the enzyme fraction (1–10 ng) was added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 10 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 40 μl. The assay was then started by adding 40 μmATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, NEN Life Science Products) in 10 μl of the above assay buffer (30 °C). After 15 min the reaction was stopped with ice-cold 150 μl of 1 n HCl and placing tubes on ice. The lipids were extracted by vortexing samples with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After centrifugation the organic phase was washed twice with 200 μl of 1 n HCl. Subsequently, 40–80 μl of the organic phase were resolved on potassium oxalate-pretreated TLC plates (Whatman) with 35 ml of 2n acetic acid and 65 ml of n-propyl alcohol as the mobile phase. Dried TLC plates were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated with a BAS 1500 Fuji-Imager. The assays were performed as described for lipid kinase activity with some modifications. The assay volume was 25 μl (2–3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per tube) and usually contained 7 mm Mg2+. Lipid vesicles were devoid of PI3-kinase lipid substrates such as PI or PI-4,5-P2. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of ice-cold 2× sample buffer according to Laemmli containing 10 mm ATP. Following separation on SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Dried membranes were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated with a BAS 1500 Fuji-Imager. Based on the observation that the structural subdivision of class I PI3Ks does not correlate with regulation by different signaling pathways, all four members were examined for their Gβγ sensitivity. Therefore we isolated heterodimeric enzymes following expression in Sf9 cells (Fig.1 A). As previously reported for p110α (42Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), coexpression of p110α, -β, and -δ catalytic subunits together with p85 increased the amount of protein in Sf9 cytosolic fractions. In contrast, p101 did not enhance expression of p110γ but preserved the catalytic subunit from rapid degradation during storage. In initial experiments we found no difference in the enzymatic activities of PI3Kγ preparations, regardless whether the GST tag was fused to p110γ or p101. For convenience we used p101-GST/p110γ heterodimeric preparations throughout the study. The isolated heterodimers were assayed for their sensitivity toward purified bovine brain Gβγ and phosphotyrosyl peptides resembling an intracellular p85-binding region of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Fig. 1 B). As expected, PI3Kγ was solely activated by Gβγ, whereas PI3Kα only responded to phosphotyrosyl peptides. However, coincubation of PI3Kβ with both stimuli led to a remarkable synergistic activation of lipid kinase activity in accordance with previous reports (24Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike these published results, PI3Kβ was also significantly activated by Gβγ alone, suggesting that PI3Kβ represents an effector of Gβγ (see Fig.1 B). Interestingly, PI3Kδ like PI3Kα was only responsive to phosphotyrosyl peptides but not to Gβγ, although p110δ exhibits the highest degree of overall amino acid sequence identity to p110β. It should be mentioned that all stimulatory effects were observed in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Since PI3Kβ and -γ were sensitive to Gβγ but complexed with different non-catalytic subunits, we next examined the influence of p85α or p101 on Gβγ-induced activation of p110β and p110γ lipid kinase activity, respectively (Fig.1 C). In initial experiments we have confirmed that p110β copurified with p85α but not with p101, whereas p110γ showed the opposite association pattern to the non-catalytic subunits (data not shown and Ref. 31Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In addition, we ascertained that the type of tag fused to p110γ, i.e. GST or polyhistidine, did not affect the enzymatic activity of the catalytic subunit. p110γ as well as p110β were significantly stimulated by Gβγ irrespective of non-catalytic subunits (see Fig. 1 C, upper panel). In contrast, sensitivity to phosphotyrosyl peptides was seen only when p110β was complexed with p85α but not when p110γ was associated with p101 (see Fig. 1 C, lower panel). Accordingly, in the absence of p85α, costimulation of p110β by Gβγ together with phosphotyrosyl peptides showed no synergistic effect (data not shown). These findings provide unequivocal evidence that structural elements necessary for Gβγ-induced stimulation of PI3K isoforms are located on the catalytic subunits of PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ. Hence, p101 does not function as a p110γ-specific adaptor that is necessary for activation by Gβγs. This obviously contrasts with the role of p85 for tyrosine kinase-induced activation of PI3Ks. As another putative parallel between class IA and IB PI3Ks, the p101-binding site on p110γ was hypothesized to lie within a region analogous to the p85-binding site on class IA members, i.e. the amino terminus (16Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To examine this assumption we studied the binding of p101 to a GST-fused full-length or an amino-terminally truncated construct of p110γ (Δ1–97) by copurification from Sf9 cells (Fig.2 A). The specificity of this approach was proven by expression of p101 with or without GST as a control. p101 was bound equally well by both p110γ constructs suggesting that the non-catalytic subunit associates with regions of p110γ outside the amino terminus. Nevertheless, as an indication that p101 may be still involved in Gβγ-induced activation of p110γ, we confirmed that p101 bound much stronger to Gβγ than p110γ (Fig.2 B and Ref. 32Stephens L.R.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes of the RAD52epistasis group, viz, RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, MRE11, and XRS2, are required for genetic recombination and DNA double-strand break repair by recombination. Since genetic recombination is indispensable for the disjunction of homologous chromosomal pairs during meiosis I, mutational inactivation of the RAD52 group genes engenders severe meiotic defects, manifest as a failure to sporulate and spore inviability (1Bai Y.

The results from recent cloning studies have revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the RAD52group genes among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. A conceptual model concerning the mechanism of homologous recombination has been formulated based on genetic studies in S. cerevisiae (6Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). When S. cerevisiae cells enter meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks are formed at various chromosomal “hot spots” that exhibit a propensity to recombine. Subsequent to break formation, unidirectional nucleolytic end-processing of the break yields 3′ ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are:ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMMSmethyl methanesulfonateDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)BMHbis-maleimidohexane1The abbreviations used are:ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMMSmethyl methanesulfonateDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)BMHbis-maleimidohexane tails of a considerable length (7Cao L.

It is believed that nucleation of various recombination factors onto the ssDNA tails gives rise to a nucleoprotein complex that has the ability to conduct a search to locate a DNA homolog and to invade the homolog to form heteroduplex DNA. Concurrent and subsequent events include DNA synthesis to replace the genetic information eliminated during double-strand break processing, resolution of the DNA intermediates, and DNA ligation to complete the recombination process. The repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals very likely proceeds through the same mechanistic route, as the repair process shares the same requirement for the RAD52 epistasis group genes. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA methyl methanesulfonate dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) bis-maleimidohexane single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA methyl methanesulfonate dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) bis-maleimidohexane Extensive genetic evidence has indicated that the nucleolytic end-processing of DNA double-strand breaks during recombination processes is dependent on the RAD50, MRE11, andXRS2 genes.

Once the 3′ single-strand (ss) tail is generated by the end-processing reaction, it is believed that a number of recombination factors, including Rad51, Rad52, Rad54, Rad55, Rad57, Rdh54, the ssDNA binding factor RPA, and possibly Rad59, nucleate onto this ssDNA tail to form a nucleoprotein complex, which initiates a search to locate a DNA homolog. Invasion of the homolog by the nucleoprotein complex then leads to the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Rad51 protein is the eukaryotic equivalent of Escherichia coli RecA protein, which is central to recombination processes by virtue of its ability to mediate the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction that yields heteroduplex DNA (reviewed in Refs. 16Cox M.M.

These observations have suggested that perhaps another protein factor(s) functions to augment the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange activities of Rad51 protein to achieve the desirable level of efficiency of heteroduplex DNA formation during recombination processesin vivo. Among the RAD52group proteins required for heteroduplex DNA formation, Rad54 is of particular interest, as it is the only member of this class for which there does not appear to be a structural or functional homolog in prokaryotes. Rad54, a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of proteins which function in diverse chromosomal processes (reviewed in Refs. 33Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C.

Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Importantly, the addition of Rad54 to a homologous pairing reaction dramatically stimulates the pairing rate, elevating it to a level comparable to what can be achieved with the prokaryotic recombinases (35Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These results indicate that efficient homologous DNA pairing requires the cooperation between Rad51 and Rad54 proteins, and they provide an explanation as to the requirement for Rad54 in heteroduplex DNA formation during recombination processes. However, the manner in which Rad54 protein promotes heteroduplex DNA formation has remained completely unknown. Delineating Rad54 function is clearly of paramount importance for understanding the mechanism of heteroduplex DNA formation.

Here we present results from our biochemical and genetic studies which address the function of Rad54 in heteroduplex DNA formation. The RAD54 gene was placed under theGAL-PGKpromoter in the vector pPM231 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK) to yield plasmid pR54.1 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His-RAD54). Likewise, the rad54 K341A and therad54 K341R alleles, which were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and sequenced to ensure no mutation other than the intended ones had been introduced, were placed under the GAL-PGKpromoter to yield plasmids pR54.2 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His-rad54 K341A), and pR54.3 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His-rad54 K341R). These plasmids, pR54.1, pR54.2, and pR54.3, were introduced into strain BJ5464 for protein purification. For examining MMS sensitivity, the RAD54, rad54 K341A, andrad54 K341R alleles were placed under the ADCIpromoter in vector pTB326 (2μ, TRP1, ADCI) to yield plasmids pR54.4 (2μ, TRP1, ADCI-RAD54), pR54.5 (2μ, TRP1, ADCI-rad54 K341A), and pR54.6 (2μ, TRP1, ADCI-rad54 K341R), respectively. These plasmids, pR54.4, pR54.5, and pR54.6, along with the vector pTB326, were introduced into the rad54 deletion haploid strain LSY403 to examine restoration of resistance to MMS.

Oligos 2 and 4 were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then annealed to their complements, oligos 1 and 3. The resulting duplexes were purified from 10% polyacrylamide gels by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA). BJ5464 harboring pR54.1 was grown in galactose containing medium as described (35Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C until use. All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Extract was prepared from 400 g of yeast paste using a French Press in cell breakage buffer containing high salt (0.6 m KCl) and protease inhibitors, as described (42Sung P. Matson S.W. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The crude lysate (Fraction I) was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 120 min) and then treated with ammonium sulfate at 0.28 g/ml to precipitate Rad54 and about 30% of the total protein. The precipitated proteins were redissolved in 300 ml of K buffer (20 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and the same set of protease inhibitors as used in the cell breakage buffer) to give a conductivity equivalent to 150 mm KCl (Fraction II) and then applied onto a column of Q-Sepharose (2.6 × 8.5 cm; 45 ml total). The Q column flow (Fraction III) was applied directly onto an SP-Sepharose column (2.6 × 8.5 cm; 45 ml total), which was developed with a 300-ml gradient from 150 to 600 mm KCl in buffer K, collecting 50 fractions. The fractions containing Rad54, which eluted at about 350 mm KCl, were identified by immunoblotting, pooled (Fraction IV; 20 ml; ∼300 mm KCl), and mixed with 1 ml of nickel NTA-agarose beads for 3 h. The nickel NTA-agarose containing bound Rad54 protein was poured into a glass column with internal diameter of 0.6 cm, and the protein was eluted sequentially with 10 volumes of buffer K containing 10, 30, and 200 mm imidazole. The 200 mm imidazole eluate (Fraction V; 4 ml), containing the bulk (>85%) of the Rad54 protein, was fractionated in a column of Macro-hydroxyapatite (matrix purchased from Bio-Rad; 1 ml total packed in an HR5/5 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with a 20-ml 60 to 300 mmKH2PO4 gradient in buffer K. Rad54 protein eluted from hydroxyapatite at about 200 mmKH2PO4, and the peak fractions were pooled (Fraction VI; 3 ml), concentrated to 0.8 ml in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon) and then subject to sizing in a column of Sephacryl S300 (35-ml matrix) in buffer K containing 150 mmKCl. Rad54 protein elutes from S300 in a position expected for a monomeric protein, and the protein pool (Fraction VII; 3 ml) was chromatographed in a Mini S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a 5-ml 150 to 500 mm KCl gradient in buffer K. Rad54 protein elutes from Mini S at about 300 mm KCl, and the pool of which was concentrated to a small volume to 1.5 mg/ml (Fraction VIII) and stored in small portions at −70 °C. For the purification of the rad54 K341A and rad54 K341R mutant proteins, 400 g of yeast strain BJ5464 harboring pR54.2 and pR54.3 were used. Extract preparation and the column chromatographic steps were carried out as described for wild type Rad54 protein above. Rad51 protein was purified to near homogeneity from yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring the plasmid pR51.3 (2μ, PGK-RAD51) as described previously (22Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The RPA used in this study was purified either from a bacterial overexpression system (43He Z. Wong J.M.S. Maniar H.S. Brill S.J. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28243-28249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or from yeast strain BJ5464 harboring plasmids which overexpress the three subunits of RPA simultaneously; the latter yeast-based RPA overexpression system was a kind gift from Richard Kolodner. Chromatographic fractionation of bacterial and yeast extracts was done as described previously (26Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We have noticed no difference between RPA preparations obtained from bacteria or from yeast in their ability to promote Rad51/Rad54-mediated homologous DNA pairing. The sensitivity of various yeast strains to methyl methanesulfonate was examined as described previously (22Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rad54Δ yeast strain LSY403 harboring pTB326, pR54.4, pR54.5, or pR54.6 was grown in complete synthetic medium lacking tryptophan for 24 h to stationary phase, collected by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, and then resuspended in the same buffer to the density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. MMS (Aldrich; >99%) was added to the cell suspensions to 0.5% final concentration and after varying times at 25 °C, aliquots of the cell suspensions were withdrawn, treated with an equal volume of 10% Na2S2O3 to neutralize the MMS, and the cells were plated on complete synthetic medium lacking tryptophan after appropriate dilutions with distilled water. Colonies were counted after 5 days of incubation at 30 °C. Recombination rates were calculated according to the median method of Lea and Coulson (44Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1948; 49: 264-284Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) as described (45Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were streaked onto solid YEPD medium and grown at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Nine colonies from each strain were used for each fluctuation test. For the haploid strains, three strains of each genotype were subject to fluctuation tests. Rate determinations in diploid strains were done on two crosses of each genotype using fresh zygotes. Three zygotes from each cross were subject to fluctuation tests. The indicated amounts of Rad54 and mutant rad54 proteins were incubated at 37 °C with φX174 replicative form DNA (30 μm base pairs; 90% supercoiled form and 10% nicked circular form) in 10 μl of reaction buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm KCl), and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS to 1% final concentration. Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on PEI cellulose (46Randerath K. Randerath E. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 16: 111-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified in the PhosphorImager. The reaction was assembled as described previously (21Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 35Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.6 μg of Rad51 protein (6.6 μm) and 82 ng of φX174 viral (+) strand (20 μm nucleotides) were mixed in 10 μl of reaction buffer (35 mm potassium/MOPS, pH 7.2, 40 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and an ATP regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 28 μg/ml creatine kinase). After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, 1.6 μg of RPA (1.1 μm) was added, followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, and then the indicated amounts of Rad54 protein or rad54 mutant proteins, 50 ng of 32P-labeled ApaLI linearized φX174 dsDNA (12.3 μm nucleotides), and 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine were incorporated. The complete reaction mixture (12.5 μl) was incubated at 37 °C, and 6-μl portions were withdrawn at the indicated times and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis as described (35Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Oligo 2 or oligo 4 (23 μm nucleotides) and 3.3 μg of Rad51 (7.7 μm) were incubated in 8 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm potassium/MOPS, pH 7.2, 1.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 28 μg/ml creatine kinase, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) for 4 min at 37 °C. Rad54 protein, 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine, and the homologous 32P-labeled duplex (46 μmnucleotides) were incorporated to complete the reaction mixture (10 μl). After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, reaction mixtures were deproteinized and resolved in 12% polyacrylamide gels, which were dried onto a sheet of DEAE paper (DE81 from Whatman), and the reaction product was quantified in the PhosphorImager. The 83-mer duplex obtained by hybridizing oligo 1 to 5′ 32P-labeled oligo 2 was prepared as described above. The indicated amounts of Rad54 protein (18 to 108 nm) and the DNA substrate (7.6 μmnucleotides) were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in 10 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm potassium/HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 28 μg/ml creatine kinase, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 50 mm KCl) and DNA mobility shift was analyzed in 12% polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer at 4 °C. ATP was added to 1.5 mm final concentration as indicated. In the standard cross-linking reaction, wild type Rad54 or mutant rad54 protein, 2 μg (2 μm), was preincubated with or without 400 ng of DNA (61 μm base pairs) for 5 min at 25 °C in 10 μl reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl), followed by the addition of bis-maleimidohexane (BMH; purchased from Pierce) to the final concentration of 200 μm. After a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7.5% gels. For the sizing experiments, the protein cross-linking reactions were scaled up 10-fold to contain 20 μg of Rad54 protein in a reaction volume of 100 μl. After quenching the reaction with 2-mercaptoethanol, the volume of the mixtures was adjusted to 600 μl with buffer K containing 500 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, before it was filtered through a Sephacryl S300 column as described below. The content of Rad54 protein in various column fractions was determined by immunoblot analysis. In the experiment in Fig. 7 D, Rad54 protein, 30 ng (30 nm), was incubated with 5 ng to 2 μg of DNA (0.75 to 300 μm base pairs) in 10 μl of buffer and BMH, quenched with mercaptoethanol, and then subject to immunoblot analysis. All the sizing experiments were carried out at 4 °C. In the experiment described in Fig. 7 B, the sample containing Rad54 protein was filtered through a Sephacryl S300 column (1 × 44.5 cm; total 35 ml) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, collecting 4-min fractions. Portions of the column fractions were subject to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of the Rad54 protein. The molecular size markers used for calibrating t"
https://openalex.org/W1976082858,"Werner's syndrome is a human autosomal recessive disorder leading to premature aging. The mutations responsible for this disorder have recently been localized to a gene (WRN) encoding a protein that possesses DNA helicase and exonuclease activities. Patients carrying WRN gene mutations exhibit an elevated rate of cancer, accompanied by increased genomic instability. The latter features are also characteristic of the loss of function of p53, a tumor suppressor that is very frequently inactivated in human cancer. Moreover, changes in the activity of p53 have been implicated in the onset of cellular replicative senescence. We report here that the WRN protein can form a specific physical interaction with p53. This interaction involves the carboxyl-terminal part of WRN and the extreme carboxyl terminus of p53, a region that plays an important role in regulating the functional state of p53. A small fraction of WRN can be found in complex with endogenous p53 in nontransfected cells. Overexpression of WRN leads to augmented p53-dependent transcriptional activity and induction of p21Waf1 protein expression. These findings support the existence of a cross-talk between WRN and p53, which may be important for maintaining genomic integrity and for preventing the accumulation of aberrations that can give rise to premature senescence and cancer.

On the other hand, induction of WT p53 activity can lead to a variety of cellular outcomes, most notably cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.Biochemically, the most prominent feature of p53 is its ability to serve as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator (for general reviews on p53, see Refs. 4Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar, 5Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys.

This requires the specific binding of p53 to defined recognition elements within the DNA, triggering the subsequent activation of genes carrying such elements. The products of these genes mediate, to a great extent, the various biological effects of WT p53.One of the features often associated with cancer cells is acquisition of the potential to undergo an indefinite number of cell divisions. This feature, commonly described as cellular immortalization, requires the loss of molecular mechanisms that normally mediate the induction of cellular replicative senescence (reviewed in Refs. 8Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar and 9Smith J.R. Aging. 1997; 9: 437-438PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies suggest that p53 plays an important role in the orchestration of replicative senescence and may actually be required for this process to occur effectively. The specific DNA binding activity and transcriptional potency of p53 increase markedly, with or without a concomitant increase in overall p53 protein levels, when cells approach the end of their replicative life span (10Atadja P.

Replicative senescence can be substantially delayed by abrogation of endogenous p53 function through antisense or dominant-negative mutants (14Bond J.A. Blaydes J.P. Rowson J. Haughton M.F.

Furthermore, loss of p53, usually in combination with additional genetic alterations, is conducive to immortalization of cells in culture (16Harvey D.M. Levine A.J.

Finally, excessive WT p53 activity can impose an irreversible senescent phenotype upon cancer cells, providing an alternative mechanism for p53-mediated tumor suppression (19Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Unlike the recent rapid progress in understanding cellular replicative senescence, relatively little remains known about the molecular basis of aging in higher eukaryotes. A possible clue may be offered by human genetic disorders that result in premature aging. Werner's syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder (21Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine ( Baltimore ). 1966; 45: 177-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 22Martin G.M. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 356-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kipling D. Faragher R.G. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), is one such example. Werner's syndrome patients exhibit a wide array of features characteristic of premature aging, including arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, hair loss, cataracts, and many more. Of particular note, they are also highly predisposed to the emergence of benign and malignant neoplasms (24Goto M. Miller R.W. Ishikawa Y. Sugano H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1996; 5: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). A possible link between cellular replicative senescence and human aging is suggested by the fact that whereas normal human fibroblasts approach senescence in culture after >60 population doublings, this happens in their Werner's syndrome counterparts already after as little as 20 population doublings (25Faragher R.G.

The human WRN gene encodes a protein of 1432 amino acids with an N-terminal 3′–5′ exonuclease domain (28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The fact that mutations in WRN predispose to accelerated aging implies that the WRN protein plays a critical role in preventing premature aging. This conjecture gains further support from the observation that expression of WRN decreases in normal fibroblasts undergoing senescence in culture (33Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).A number of observations raise the interesting possibility that p53 and WRN may be functionally linked. As discussed above, defects in both genes strongly predispose to cancer. Moreover, like loss of p53, defects in WRN function also result in enhanced genomic instability (34Cheng R.Z. Murano S. Kurz B. Shmookler R.R. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Stefanini M. Scappaticci S. Lagomarsini P. Borroni G. Berardesca E. Nuzzo F. Mutat. Res. 1989; 219: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, physical and functional interactions exist between p53 and several DNA helicases, including the TFIIH subunits XPB, XPD, and CSB (36Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility of a cross-talk between the p53 and WRN proteins. We report here that p53 and WRN can form specific protein-protein interactions through their respective C-terminal domains. Overexpression of WRN results in elevated p53-dependent transcriptional activity. This suggests that some of the cellular activities of WRN may involve a cross-talk with p53, perhaps as a means for maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of irreversible genetic damage that may eventually lead to loss of replicative capacity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsExpression plasmids were constructed using pcDNA3FLAG as a backbone; pcDNA3FLAG is a derivative of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) modified to include a FLAG epitope (38Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To construct a p62 expression plasmid, HeLa cell mRNA was subjected to reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification with appropriate p62 primers. The PCR products and plasmid vector DNA were cleaved with the restriction enzymes KpnI and XbaI and ligated in frame to the FLAG epitope. pcDNA3FLAG Werner's syndrome protein (WRN) expression plasmids (WRN, WRN-M, WRN-N, and WRN-C) were similarly constructed by a reverse transcription-PCR-based approach using a basophilic leukemia cell line, KU812 (39Blom T. Huang R. Aveskogh M. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as the RNA source. The PCR products and the pcDNA3FLAG plasmid DNA were cleaved withKpnI and ApaI, followed by ligation in frame to the FLAG epitope. In some of the experiments, expression of full-length WRN protein was directed by plasmid pBRCMVPAWRNwt. This plasmid was constructed as follows. A DNA cassette containing the cytomegalovirus early enhancer/promoter, multiple cloning sites, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal was first integrated into the pBR322 vector. Wild-type WRN cDNA, containing the entire open reading frame, was reverse transcription-PCR-amplified from a normal lymphoblast cell line and cloned into this modified vector, giving rise to pBRCMVPAWRNwt.

The monoclonal antibodies PAb246 and PAb248 are specific for mouse p53. Purified murine monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The anti-p21 polyclonal antibody C-19 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal serum Ab3 was raised against a recombinant fusion protein encompassing GST followed in frame by residues 1223–1432 of human WRN.Protein ExtractionCell extracts were prepared by resuspending phosphate-buffered saline-washed cell pellets in 0.5–1 ml of Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1% aprotinin and 300 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following incubation on ice for 20 min, nonextractable material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the cleared supernatants were employed for further analysis.ImmunoprecipitationCell extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared as described above. In vitro translated proteins were synthesized in a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Samples containing the desired proteins were incubated in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer together with antibody and protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, bead pellets were washed two times with Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer or three times with buffer containing 5% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by one wash with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Bound proteins were released by resuspending the beads in 30 μl of protein sample buffer, followed by vigorous vortexing, boiling for 5 min, and centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 1 min. The cleared supernatants were taken for SDS-PAGE analysis. For [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, polyacrylamide gels were fixed for 1 h in 10% acetic acid and fluorographed in 1 m sodium salicylate for 30 min and then dried and exposed to x-ray film.In Vitro Binding AssaysTo determine the binding of radioactive polypeptides to nonradioactive recombinant GST fusion proteins, the tested polypeptides were produced by in vitrotranscription and translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT). The translation products were then incubated with the indicated GST fusion proteins, prebound to glutathione-agarose beads. Incubation was in 54K buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 4 °C. Bead pellets were washed as described above. Coprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as described above. To maintain an identical input of radioactivity in each binding reaction, the in vitro translation products were first analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and inputs were adjusted accordingly.Alternatively, in vitro translated polypeptides were mixed with the products of parallel in vitro translation reactions carried out in the presence of nonradioactive amino acids only. The mixture was incubated in 54K buffer for 2 h at 4 °C and then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above, employing antibodies against the nonradioactive protein. Coprecipitated radioactive proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as described above.Luciferase AssaysH1299 cells were transfected with reporter plasmid DNA together with the indicated expression plasmid combinations. 26 h later, cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in cell lysis buffer (Promega), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Insoluble material was spun down, and luciferase activity in the cleared supernatant was quantitated in the presence of luciferin (Promega) and ATP using a Turner Design Model 20 luminometer.RESULTSThe WRN Protein Binds p53 in VitroThe p53 protein can engage in a multitude of protein-protein interactions, some of which are known to modulate its activity in a variety of ways (reviewed in Refs. 4Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar, 5Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholarand 50Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility of a cross-talk between p53 and the WRN protein, we tested whether these two proteins can interact directly. Full-length WRN protein was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with recombinant GST-p53, consisting of a fusion between GST and human WT p53. As shown in Fig. 1, WRN bound much more efficiently to GST-p53 (lane 1) than to GST alone (lane 2). The preferential binding of WRN to p53 was even more prominent than that of p62 (lanes 5 and 6), a TFIIH subunit that binds p53 in vitro (51Leveillard T. Andera L. Bissonnette N. Schaeffer L. Bracco L. Egly J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 52Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Luciferase, serving as a negative control, bound to neither GST nor GST-p53 (lanes 3 and 4). Thus, WRN and p53 can engage in specific protein-protein interactions in vitro.To map the p53-binding domain(s) within WRN, human WT p53 was produced by in vitro translation in the presence of nonradioactive amino acids. This p53 was then incubated with an array of35S-labeled, in vitro translated polypeptides, including the pRB tumor suppressor protein, the p62 TFIIH subunit, luciferase, and various portions of the WRN open reading frame as indicated in Fig. 2 A. Radioactive polypeptides associated with the unlabeled p53 protein were co-immunoprecipitated with a mixture of the p53-specific monoclonal antibodies DO-1 and PAb421 and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As expected, p62 was efficiently coprecipitated with p53 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), whereas neither pRB (lane 1) nor luciferase (lane 3) exhibited significant binding to p53 under these conditions. Of note, prominent p53 binding was evident with the C-terminal part of WRN (WRN-C; lane 6), but not with the N-terminal part (WRN-N; lane 5) or the central part (WRN-M;lane 4). Hence, the p53-binding domain(s) resides within the C-terminal 419 residues of WRN.Figure 2p53 associates with the C-terminal portion of WRN. A, schematic representation of the human WRNmRNA and WRN protein. The various truncated forms of WRN employed in B are also depicted; numbers on the right refer to the amino acid residues retained in the corresponding truncated polypeptide. Exo, exonuclease domain;HR, helicase region; NLS, nuclear localization signal. B, in vitro binding assay. The indicated proteins were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. Equal amounts of each radioactive polypeptide were incubated with in vitro translated, nonradioactive human WT p53 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” p53 was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies PAb421 and DO-1, and associated radiolabeled polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Luc, luciferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)WRN Binds to the C-terminal Portion of p53To define the WRN-binding domain within p53, full-length WRN was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and reacted with a series of recombinant GST fusion proteins containing different segments of human WT p53 (Fig.3 A). Although the N-terminal part of p53 (residues 1–160) did not interact detectably with WRN (Fig. 3 B, lane 4), prominent binding was seen with a fragment encompassing the C-terminal part of p53 (residues 160–393; lane 1). Binding was further mapped to residues 318–393 (lane 3), whereas residues 160–318 were negative (lane 2). Hence, the WRN interaction domain is fully contained within the last 76 residues of p53. This region encompasses several important functional elements (Fig. 3 A), including the nuclear localization sequence (NLS), the oligomerization/tetramerization domain (OD), and a negative regulatory domain (NR) that down-regulates sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 (53Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To further narrow down the WRN interaction domain of p53, the WRN-C segment (Fig. 2 A), which binds p53 (Fig. 2 B), was cloned in frame downstream of a FLAG epitope and translated in vitro in the presence of nonradioactive amino acids. Several miniproteins, derived from mouse WT p53 (43Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), were each translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and tested for association with nonradioactive FLAG-WRN-C. In agreement with Fig. 3 B, the p53DD miniprotein comprising the last 89 residues of mouse p53 (Fig.3 C) bound efficiently to WRN-C (Fig. 3 D,lane 1). However, binding was completely abolished by removal of the last 30 residues of p53 (p53Dt360; lane 2). Hence, the interaction between p53 and WRN requires the extreme C-terminal part of p53. Interestingly, a derivative of p53DD carrying an internal deletion within the oligomerization domain (p53DΔSS; Fig.3 C) was markedly impaired in WRN-C binding (Fig.3 D, lane 3). The region deleted in p53DΔSS may be part of the actual WRN interaction domain; alternatively, WRN may associate preferentially with p53 oligomers rather than monomers. Of note, preferential binding to p53 oligomers has been documented for Mdm2, a cellular protein acting as a negative regulator of p53 (54Marston N.J. Jenkins J.R. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1709-1715PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, WRN and p53 can undergo a specific interaction in vitro, and this interaction requires the C-terminal portions of both proteins.Figure 3WRN associates with the C-terminal portion of p53. A, schematic representation of human p53. Indicated are the positions of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), the proline-rich domain (PR), the DNA-biding domain (DB), the nuclear localization signal (NLS), the oligomerization domain (OD), and the C-terminal negative regulatory region (NR).

This common feature of all three species of Yersiniais dependent on the presence of a 70-kilobase virulence plasmid, called pYV in Y. enterocolitica. The genes on the pYV plasmid encode (i) about 30 proteins that together form a type III secretion apparatus, (ii) about six proteins considered to be translocator Yops1, (iii) six proteins designated effector Yops (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of Yersinia to the surface of the eukaryotic target cell, the effector Yops are translocated in a polarized fashion into the cell cytoplasm through a complex machinery involving the type III secretion system and the translocator Yops (2Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The current idea is that once inside the host cell the effector Yops engage in signal transduction pathways with the aim to subvert host cell defense. In this regard it has been shown that important immune cell functions such as phagocytosis, superoxide anion production, and tumor necrosis factor-α production can be blocked by the effector Yops (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The six effector Yops of Y. enterocolitica known to date include YopM, YopH, YopO (called YpkA in Y. pseudotuberculosis), YopP (called YopJ in Y. pseudotuberculosis), YopE, and YopT. So far no cellular phenotype due to YopM has been reported. YopH is a tyrosine phosphatase that was shown to dephosphorylate p130Cas and FAK in HeLa cells leading to disruption of peripheral focal complexes (3Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fällmann M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). YopP/YopJ is crucial for Yersinia's ability to induce apoptosis in macrophages (5Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbouch P. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and works most probably by inhibition of NFκB activation in combination with inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (6Ruckdeschel K.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). YpkA/YopO shares extensive homology with mammalian serine/threonine kinases and, when overexpressed by Y. pseudotuberculosis, causes a contractile phenotype in HeLa cells (8Hakansson S. Galyov E.E Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Finally, YopE and YopT have been designated cytotoxins because ayopE mutant of Y. pseudotuberculosis lost its ability to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (9Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Rimpiläinen M. Bergmann T. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and a Y. enterocolitica mutant expressing only YopT, but not YopM, YopE, YopH, YopO, and YopP, was able to disrupt actin structures in HeLa cells (10Iriarte M. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Except for YopH, no target molecules have been reported for the effector Yops. A variety of bacterial exotoxins can disrupt the actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (11Aktories K.

Rho GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and CDC42Hs are central regulators of actin polymerization in all cells (12Hall A. Science. 1997; 279: 509-514Crossref Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). Rho is necessary for stress fiber formation, Rac regulates ruffles, and CDC42Hs produces filopodia/microspikes. To date known enzyme activities responsible for covalent modification and inhibition of Rho proteins are ADP-ribosyltransferases (C3 from Clostridium botulinum) (13Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S.

Another group of toxins, CNF1 from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or dermonecrotizing toxin from Bordetella bronchiseptica, deamidate glutamine residue 63 of Rho, which constitutively activates Rho (18Schmidt G.

In this study we addressed the question whether the intracellularly translocated Yersinia cytotoxins YopE or YopT act through modification of Rho. We demonstrate a specific modification and inactivation of RhoA by Y. enterocolitica YopT. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. For inactivation of YopT we employed the suicide plasmid pGP704, where the ampR gene was replaced by the catR gene giving pGPCAT.Table IY. enterocolitica strains used in this studyStrain and plasmidRelevant characteristic(s)Ref.WA-C(pYVO8)Serotype O8; clinical isolate WA-314 harboring virulence plasmid pYVO823WA-CPlasmid-cured derivative of WA-31423WA-C(pYV-515)Mutant strain, deficient in secretion of Yops; Tn5-insertional inactivation of lcrD, encoding LcrD required for Yop secretion24WA-C(pYVO8ΔT)Mutant strain deficient in YopT production, insertional inactivation of theyopT geneThis studyWA-C(pYVO8ΔT/+T)WA-C(pYVO8T) complemented in transwith pACYC184 plasmid encoding YopTThis studyWA-C(pYVO8ΔE)Mutant strain deficient for YopE production, TnMax insertional inactivation of the yopE geneThis study Open table in a new tab An internal polymerase chain reaction product of YopT (forward primer, GACTAGGTACCATGCTGGATAGAAAGT; reverse primer, GACTAGAGCTCAAATAAGCTTTGGCCC) was ligated into theKpnI/SalI-site of the suicide vector pGPCAT generating pGPCATT and transformed into E. coli strain SM10 λ pir. The suicide hybrid plasmid was integrated into theyopT gene of WA-C(pYVO8) after conjugation and homologous recombination, resulting in WA-C(pYVO8ΔT). Insertional inactivation of the yopT gene was checked by Southern blot analysis. AY. enterocolitica yopE mutant strain WA-C(pYVO8ΔE) was constructed by transposon mutagenesis using the TnMaxmini-transposon system as described previously (21Haas R. Kahrs A.F. Facius D. Allmeier H. Schmitt R. Meyer T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 130: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Y. enterocolitica pYVO:8 virulence plasmid cointegrated in vector pRK290 was mobilized in E. coli strain E131 to serve as target plasmid. Transposon mutagenesis was performed by using TnMax25, which transfers resistance to chloramphenicol. Transposition under control of the inducible Ptrc promotor was induced by growth in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Transposon-carrying target plasmids were separated by conjugation into the virulence plasmid-cured Y. enterocolitica strain WAC. We analyzed the pattern of Yops released by single colonies under Ca2+-deprived conditions to detect mutants that are defective in the secretion of YopE (22Heesemann J. Gross U. Schmidt N. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 54: 561-567Crossref Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria broth medium at 27 °C under antibiotic selection. COS-7 cells grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were seeded in 175-cm2flasks the day before the infection experiment to give a subconfluent monolayer. For infection, the medium was removed and replaced by prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were infected with the Yersiniae at a m.o.i. of 50 for 2 h. Cells were recovered by scraping, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (buffer A), and lysed with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared in buffer A using a Dounce homogenizer. Postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100 (Beckman) bench top centrifuge. The supernatant, containing the cytosolic fraction was removed, and the crude membrane fraction was once washed in buffer A and then dissolved in buffer A. The protein content in the membrane, cytosolic, or Triton X-100-soluble fraction was measured by the Bradford assay from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the ADP-ribosylation reaction, equal amounts (50 μg) of protein from the different fractions were incubated in a reaction buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmthymidine, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml C3 toxin (Calbiochem), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 μCi of [32P]NAD (final concentration) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding sample buffer before analysis by 15% SDS-PAGE. For the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we used an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) as described elsewhere (25Görg A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., New york1994: 231-242Crossref Google Scholar). In each experiment, 200-μg aliquots of cytosolic proteins were precipitated by 6 volumes of cold acetone, dissolved in two-dimensional sample buffer, and subjected to isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed as described previously (6Ruckdeschel K. Harb S. Roggenkamp A. Hornef M. Zumbihl R. Köhler S. Heesemann J. Rouot B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using the monoclonal antibody 26C4 raised against RhoA. The isoelectric point (pI) of RhoA was calculated after plotting the linear pH gradient of the gel strip versus length of the gel strip and determination of the position of the protein in the gel strip. All experiments were repeated at least three times and representative results are shown. Fluorescence staining with rhodamine phalloidin of HUVEC infected with different Yersinia strains was done exactly as described previously (26Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H.J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC grown on collagen coated glass coverslips were infected at a m.o.i. of 50. After 90 min cells were washed gently with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 5 min in cold acetone, and air-dried. Coverslips were then incubated for 20 min with rhodamine phalloidin and mounted in Mowiol containingp-phenylenediamine as antifading agent. In most reports, covalent modification of Rho by bacterial cytotoxins induces a change in the electrophoretic mobility of Rho (18Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 19Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To test whether the translocatedYersinia cytotoxins modify Rho, we infected COS-7 cells with different Y. enterocolitica strains (summarized in TableI). Thereafter, Triton X-100-soluble COS-7 cell extracts were prepared, and Rho proteins were labeled by addition of [32P]NAD and C3-transferase of C. botulinum. C3 transfers the [32P]ADP-ribosyl group of [32P]NAD to the asparagine residue 41 of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (13Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE and transfer, autoradiography showed appearance of a faster migrating form of32P-ADP-ribosylated Rho in cells infected with the virulence plasmid-carrying Y. enterocolitica O8 strain (WA-C(pYVO8)) (Fig. 1 A). Infection of cells with strain WA-C (plasmid-cured Y. enterocolitica O8) strain or a lcrD mutant deficient in Yop secretion (WA-C(pYV-515)) did not produce the faster migrating form of Rho. We next infected cells with a Y. enterocoliticamutant in which either the yopE gene (WA-C(pYVO8ΔE)) or the yopT gene was knocked out (WA-C(pYVO8ΔT)). The results clearly show that WA-C(pYVO8ΔT) was unable to produce the faster migrating form of Rho, whereas WA-C(pYVO8ΔE) behaved like WA-C(pYVO8). As expected, complemented strain WA-C(pYVO8ΔT/+T) restored the appearance of the faster migrating form of Rho. We also infected cells with wild type Yersinia containing single disruptions of the genes for YopP, YopO, YopM, or YopH (6Ruckdeschel K. Harb S. Roggenkamp A. Hornef M. Zumbihl R. Köhler S. Heesemann J. Rouot B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All of these strains were able to induce the increase in electrophoretic mobility of Rho, indicating that none of these effector Yops played a role in the YopT-dependent Rho modification (data not shown). Interestingly, incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose was consistently more efficient in WA-C(pYVO8) infected cells than in control cells, suggesting that the YopT-modified Rho protein was a better substrate for the C3-transferase or that the modification increased the amount of Rho available as substrate. Western blot of the32P-ADP-ribosylated proteins of Fig. 1 Adeveloped with a specific anti-RhoA antibody revealed that the32P-ADP-ribosylated protein bands were RhoA (Fig.1 B). In lysates of control cells or cells infected withYersinia strains unable to induce the RhoA modification, the antibody revealed an additional band migrating at higher mobility. This RhoA band was not 32P-ADP-ribosylated, presumably because it was protected by binding to another protein like the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of Rho, Rho-GDI. In agreement with this, the presence of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (a lipid known to dissociate Rho-GDI from Rho (27Bourmeyster N. Stasia M.J. Garin J. Gagnon J. Boquet P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12863-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) during the ADP-ribosylation reaction suppressed this additional immunoreactive band (data not shown). Interestingly, in all cell lysates containing YopT-modified RhoA this non-32P-ADP-ribosylated band was absent, further suggesting better accessibility of modified RhoA to the C3-transferase. Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against other Rho GTPases did not reveal any change in the electrophoretic mobility of CDC42Hs, RhoB or Rac upon cell infection with WA-C(pYVO8) (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate a specific modification of RhoA by the intracellularly translocated Yersinia cytotoxin YopT. The pI of a protein is chemically well defined by the charge of the amino acids in the protein in contrast to protein mobility in SDS-PAGE, which depends on less precisely defined structural determinants. We performed two-dimensional electrophoresis using an IPG in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension to further characterize the YopT-modified form of RhoA (Fig. 2). When cytosol of uninfected cells was subjected to 2D electrophoresis, anti-RhoA Western blot revealed one spot migrating at a pI value of 6.3. Consistently, a minor spot of RhoA could be detected migrating at a more acidic pI of 5.9. In lysates of cells infected with WA-C(pYVO8) or WA-C(pYVO8ΔE) two RhoA spots were detectable, which included the original spot at pI 6.3 and an additional spot at pI 5.9. The more acidic RhoA spot at pI 5.9 usually represented around 60–70% of total RhoA protein. This suggests that the band detected with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) is a mixture of modified and unmodified RhoA. In agreement with only partial modification of RhoA, when the YopT gene was cloned under the control of a stronger promoter and the YopT protein was transferred into target cells a complete shift of RhoA corresponding to the acidic form was detectable with the two-dimensional gel system. The migration behavior of this completely modified form was the same as the one observed in the Fig. 1 (data not shown). Not surprisingly, appearance of this acidic spot was abolished in cells infected with WA-C(pYVO8ΔT) and restored in cells infected with the YopT complemented strain. Furthermore, none of the known Rho-modifying toxins, C3-transferase ofC. botulinum, C. difficile toxin A or CNF ofE. coli, produced such an acidic shift of RhoA (data not shown). These data suggest a novel YopT-dependent modification of RhoA that converts RhoA to a more acidic form. In most cell types 80–90% of Rho is present in the cytosol complexed to Rho-GDI and the remaining Rho is bound to the plasma membrane. After activation of a cell surface receptor Rho is thought to dissociate from Rho-GDI, to bind GTP, and to translocate to the plasma membrane where it can activate specific signal transduction pathways (12Hall A. Science. 1997; 279: 509-514Crossref Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). To check whether the YopT-mediated modification changes the intracellular distribution of RhoA, we compared its content in cytosol and membranes of control and Yersinia-infected cells by Western blot (Fig.3). As expected, in control cells a minor but detectable part of RhoA was present in membranes with the remainder being located in the cytosol. In cells infected with WA-C(pYVO8) or WA-C(pYVO8ΔE), RhoA was released from membranes and concomitantly accumulated in the cytosol. However, membrane binding of Rho was unchanged in cells infected with WA-C(pYVO8ΔT). Again the YopT complemented strain WA-C(pYVO8ΔT/+T) behaved like WA-C(pYVO8). These data are consistent with the notion that the modification induced by the cytotoxin YopT is responsible for a shift of modified RhoA from the membrane to the cytosol. RhoA regulates formation of stress fibers and, consequently, cytotoxins that modify RhoA either form stress fibers when the modification is activatory or destruct stress fibers when the modification is inhibitory. To assess the functional consequence of the YopT-dependent modification of RhoA, we tested the effect of YopT on stress fibers after infection of HUVEC with WA-C(pYV-515), WA-C(pYVO8), WA-C(pYVO8ΔT), and WA-C(pYVO8ΔE). TheYersinia secretion mutant unable to translocate Yops WA-C(pYV-515) did not disrupt stress fibers in HUVEC (Fig.4 A). Conversely, WA-C(pYVO8), producing the two cytotoxins YopE and YopT, destructed stress fibers as well as grossly altered the cell shape from a polygonal spread-out form to an elongated irregular form (Fig. 4 B). When cells were infected with the YopT-mutant WA-C(pYVO8ΔT), a strain that still exhibits the cytotoxic activity of YopE, the change in cell shape was still apparent, although stress fibers were only slightly diminished and the majority of them were still visible (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, in cells infected with the YopE-mutant WA-C(pYVO8ΔE), a strain still expressing the cytotoxic activity of YopT, stress fibers were completely abolished and cells acquired an enlarged spread-out phenotype (Fig. 4 D). These results imply that cytotoxic alteration of cell shape and disruption of stress fibers are two distinct features of Yersinia-infected cells, the former mediated by YopE, the latter by YopT. The biochemical mechanisms by which Yersinia spp. resist the nonspecific immune defense of the host are poorly understood and most of the targets of effector Yops remain to be discovered. Here we investigated whether one of the known actin disrupting cytotoxins ofY. enterocolitica, YopE or YopT, works through inhibition of Rho GTP-binding proteins. YopE presents homology to the amino-terminal part of Exoenzyme S from P. aeruginosa, an ADP-ribosyltransferase modifying GTPases of the Ras family. Therefore it was speculated that YopE might act by ADP-ribosylating and inactivating Rho proteins (28Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, in a recent study the amino-terminal YopE-like domain and the carboxyl-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of ExoS were shown to act independently of each other on the host cell actin cytoskeleton (29Pederson K.J. Vallis A.J. Aktories K. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, actin disruption by the isolated YopE-like domain of ExoS could be overcome by pretreatment of cells with the Rho-, Rac-, and CDC42Hs-activating cytotoxin CNF, further suggesting involvement of Rho-GTPases in YopE function. However, our results presented here argue against a role of RhoA in YopE function. Neither by one- nor by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis could a change in the chemical property of RhoA be detected. Furthermore, Y. enterocoliticamutants expressing the YopE but not the YopT cytotoxin primarily affected endothelial cell shape and only secondarily and inefficiently disrupted stress fibers that are controlled by RhoA. In contrast, YopT mainly seems to exert it's effect on stress fiber stability of endothelial cells. Similarly to YopT we have shown recently in the same HUVEC that the specific Rho inhibitor C3-transferase completely abolishes stress fibers before any effect on cell shape becomes detectable (26Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H.J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that YopT mediates inactivation of RhoA by inducing a biochemical modification of RhoA. Infection of cells with wild type Yersinia strains induces both, an increase in SDS-PAGE mobility and an acidic shift in two-dimensional gels of RhoA. These effects are dependent on intracellular translocation of the cytotoxin YopT but not on any other known effector Yop. Modification by C3-transferase from C. botulinum or CNF from E. coli produces a decrease in SDS-PAGE mobility of RhoA as opposed to the increase in mobility seen in Yersinia-infected cells (13Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, neither C3, C. difficile toxin A, nor CNF produce an acidic shift of RhoA in isoelectric focusing (data not shown). In vivo only membrane-GTP-bound RhoA controls cellular processes. After Yersinia infection, RhoA is detectable only in the cytosol, further suggesting an inhibitory effect of YopT on cellular responses controlled by RhoA. None of the hitherto described bacterial cytotoxins were reported to release Rho from cellular membranes. Thus, we conclude that the YopT-mediated modification of RhoA represents a modification not previously ascribed to a bacterial cytotoxin. Among the known post-translational modifications of RhoA, phosphorylation has been implicated in releasing RhoA from membranes (30Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is also known to produce an acidic two-dimensional shift of proteins (31Immler D. Gremm D. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Presek P. Meyer H.E. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nevertheless afterY. enterocolitica infection of in vivo[32P]Pi-labeled COS-7 cells, no phosphorylated protein spot at the place of the acidic form of RhoA could be detected by two-dimensional gel analysis. Furthermore, treatment of cytosolic extract from Y. enterocoliticainfected cells with alkaline phosphatase was without any effect on the migration behavior of the modified RhoA in one- or two-dimensional gels (data not shown). Interestingly, inhibition of RhoA carboxyl methylation with methyltransferase inhibitors was also shown to produce an acidic shift of RhoA in two-dimensional gels (32Backlund P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33175-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although a different two-dimensional system was used in this study, the unmethylated acidic form of RhoA was calculated to have a pI of 5.9, similar to what we calculated for YopT-modified RhoA. It was reported that carboxyl methylation of Ras-related proteins increases in response to the chemoattractantN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in vitroand in vivo (33Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibitors of prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation effectively blocked neutrophil responses toN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, suggesting regulation of Ras GTP-binding protein activity by carboxyl methylation (33Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Like protein phosphorylation, methylation is reversible under physiological conditions and has been implicated in the control of membrane association of Ras GTP-binding proteins (34Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When we performed a saponification reaction with the cytosol of uninfected and infected cells, breakage of the methyl ester link at the COOH terminus did not induce the higher mobility form of RhoA (data not shown). Thus these two processes, phosphorylation or demethylation, are most likely not involved in the YopT-dependent RhoA modification, redistribution, and inactivation. Our study reveals for the first time that an intracellularly translocated bacterial modulin can lead to modification and inhibition of RhoA, a phenomenon reported previously only for exotoxins. The finding that a bacterial modulin translocated by a type III secretion system affects Rho signaling goes along with a recent work of Hardt et al. (35Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 29: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (659) Google Scholar) who discovered aSalmonella-encoded guanine nucleotide exchange factor which directly activates CDC42Hs and Rac. Given the propensity of bacterial toxins and modulins to alter Rho GTPase functions and to exploit the host cell cytoskeleton, it can be expected that additional Rho-GTPase modulatory principles are exploited by bacteria exhibiting secretion systems of various types.

Abe., submitted for publication. demonstrate that this locus is pleiotropic, affecting diverse systems and implying that it defines some fundamental process employed by many tissues. QKI, along with germ line-deficient (GLD-1) fromCaenorhabditis elegans and the mammalian cell signaling protein SAM68, defines a large, evolutionarily conserved, extended KH domain family of proteins called STAR (signaltransduction and activator of RNA) (1Ebersole T. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4Vernet C. Artzt K. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 479-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). STAR proteins also contain two new domains immediately flanking the KH domain, QUA1 and QUA2, for which no function has yet been assigned (Fig. 1). All of the STAR proteins studied have been shown to bind RNA (5Zorn A.M. Krieg P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2176-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 7Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar) and some to self-associate (5Zorn A.M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, to date, there is experimental evidence for a role in cell signaling only for SAM68 (9Taylor S. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10120-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This is implied for some other family members from sequence motifs such as proline-rich regions containing potential Src homology 3-binding sites and a carboxyl tail rich in tyrosine residues. Where mutants exist, the STAR proteins display many interesting phenotypes. The Drosophila qkI homologue how/whois involved in muscular function and larval development since some mutations are flightless and others are larval lethals (10Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E.

Some alleles of C. elegans gld-1 have an overgrowth of mitotic oocytes, whereas others have non-essential effects on male fate specification in the hermaphrodite germ line (13Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mammalian splicing factor 1 (SF1/ZMF1) is the homologue of Bbp1, the only STAR family member in yeast, which is a component of the pre-splicing complex (7Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar,14Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the rapidly growing STAR family, other members include several QKI homologs identified in frog (15Zorn A. Grow M. Patterson K. Ebersole T. Chen Q. Artzt K. Krieg P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 188: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), chicken (16Mezquita J. Pau M. Mezquita C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), zebrafish (17Tanaka H. Abe K. Kim C.-H. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and human (GenBank AL031781). Recently, two genes similar to SAM68 were cloned: étoile/T-STAR/slm-2 andslm-1 (18Venables J.P. Vernet C. Chew S.L. Cowmedow R.B. Wu J. Cooke H.J. Artzt K. Eperon I.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Di Fruscio M. Chen T. Richard S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, which has been studied by degenerate PCR, there are at least nine STAR family members (20Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E. Biochem. Genet. 1998; 36: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in C. elegans, where the sequence is complete, using BLAST, there are eight good matches to the STAR domain. The mouse qkI locus produces a diverse set of proteins by alternative splicing (21Kondo T. Furuta T. Mitsunaga K. Ebersole T.A. Shichiri M. Wu J. Artzt K. Yamamura K. Abe K. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The first three studied in any detail (QKI-5, -6, and -7) appear to have different roles in development. They are constructed with the same 311-amino acid body but have different carboxyl tails consisting of 30, 8, and 14 amino acids, respectively. QKI-5 is prominently expressed in early embryogenesis, and the abnormality of QKI-5enu is therefore believed to be responsible for the lethality of qk enu embryos around 9.5 days of gestation. In contrast, QKI-6 and -7 are only detectable by Northern blots in late development when myelination starts in earnest. Their very low expression in myelinating glia is believed to be responsible for the qk v phenotype (1Ebersole T. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Hardy R. Loushin C. Friedrich V. Chen Q. Ebersole T. Lazzarini R. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using antibodies specific for each carboxyl tail, Hardy et al. (22Hardy R. Loushin C. Friedrich V. Chen Q. Ebersole T. Lazzarini R. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that in mouse brain, all three isoforms are expressed in glial cells. Remarkably, QKI-5 is nuclear whereas QKI-6 and -7 are predominantly cytoplasmic (22Hardy R. Loushin C. Friedrich V. Chen Q. Ebersole T. Lazzarini R. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the only difference in these proteins is their carboxyl tail, the 30-amino acid QKI-5 tail might be responsible for nuclear localization, although there is no classical basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) (23Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 24Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). However, the localization study of Xenopus QKI (XQUA), which is 94% identical to QKI-5, showed some differences. Using a Xenopusoocyte injection assay, XQUA was shown to be present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (5Zorn A.M. Krieg P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2176-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, in the mouse embryo, it was found that in a subset of migrating neural progenitors that later differentiate into glial cells, QKI-5 was redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (25Hardy R.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, QKI-5 may function in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and may, in fact, shuttle between them. In this study, we investigated the dynamic localization of QKI-5 using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. Furthermore, the effects of self-interaction, RNA binding, and active transcription on its nuclear localization were also studied. The results show that the 30-amino acid carboxyl tail is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization and contained within it is a 7-amino acid novel nuclear localization sequence we name STAR-NLS. The same NLS is used by SAM68 and T-STAR/ETLE. However, using an interspecies heterokaryon assay, we find that, unlike T-STAR/ETLE, QKI-5 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription-dependent manner. The in vitro expression constructs pTkozQKI-5 and pTkozQKI-5kt4 were generated by inserting the entire coding region of QKI-5 or QKI-5kt4with a Kozak start sequence into the BglII/EcoRV sites of the in vitro expression vector pT7Ts (26Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The QKI-5 coding region was inserted in frame into theEcoRI/SalI site of pET28a+ (Novagen) to generate the clone pET28QKI-5 for bacterial expression. To generate the yeast two-hybrid assay constructs, the QKI isoforms and QKI-5kt4were inserted in frame into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pBTM116 (a kind gift from Dr. S. M. Hollenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) or NcoI/SacI site of pACTII (CLONTECH). The subsequent QKI deletion constructs were made by PCR and cloned into theEcoRI site of the vectors. The primers used are: STAR1 (CATGGTCGGGGAAATGGAA) and QKCT (ATAACACACCACTGGGTTC) for QKI-body; 5kb1 (CCGGTGCGGTGGCTACTAAAG) and 5kb2 (TGTTGCCGGTGGCGGCTC) for QKI-5tail. pBTM116-Lamin (kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Hollenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and pTD1–1 (pACTII-T-antigen) (CLONTECH) were used as negative control for yeast two-hybrid assay. To generate GFP fusion constructs, the QKI entire coding region and a series of mutated fragments: QKI-body, QKI-5kt4, and QKI-5tail, were cloned in frame into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). The fusion proteins have GFP at the NH2 terminus. The GFP-NLS fusion constructs were generated by annealing three sets of two oligos: NLS1 (AATTCCCGTGTCCATCCTTACCAAAGGG) and NLS2 (GATCCCCTTTGGTAAGGATGGACACGGG) for QKI-5-NLS; SAM68-NLS1 (AATTCCAGAGAGCATCCATATGGACGTG) and SAM68-NLS2 (GATCCACGTCCATATGGATGCTCTCTGG) for SAM68-NLS; ETLE-NLS1 (AATTCCAGAGACCAGCCATATGGCAGAG) and ETLE-NLS2 (GATCCTCTGCCATATGGCTGGTCTCTGG) for ETLE-NLS, and cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI site of pEGFP-C1. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate amino acids Y to F or R to A. GFP-QKI-5ΔΚΗ was made by PCR using the primer dKH1 (ATCAGGGTATTCTTTTACAGGCAC) and dKH2 (GAGGAGCAAAATAGAGGCAAGCCC) and pEGFP-QKI-5 as template. ETLE coding region was obtained by PCR from original cDNA and subcloned into the TA cloning vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). An ETLE-EcoRI fragment was inserted in frame into pEGFP-C1 vector. FLAG-QKI-5 was made by inserting QKI-5 coding region in frame into pCMV4 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). pcDNA3-myc-hnRNP-A1 and pcDNA3-myc-hnRNP C1 were kindly provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and described elsewhere (27Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pBTM116QKI and pACTIIQKI constructs were cotransformed in different combinations into yeast strain L40 (28Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), followed by 2 days of incubation at 30 °C on the selective plate lacking tryptophan and leucine. At least six independent colonies were restreaked on another plate, and the X-gal filter assay (29Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was used to determine the LacZ level of these transformants. Colonies turned blue within 2 h were considered positive. The bacterial expression construct pET28QKI-5 was transformed into Escherichia coliBL21 DE3 cells. A culture of 0.6 (A 600) was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. 2 h after induction, cells were collected and broken by French press in the purification buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen), washed extensively with purification buffer, and eluted with purification buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The 35S-labeled QKI proteins were produced by in vitro translation. The pTkozQKI-5 or pTkozQKI-5kt4 wasin vitro transcribed and translated using TNT coupled reticulocyte lysates system (Promega). One fifth of the reactions were mixed with 0.2 μg of His-tagged QKI-5 protein and mouse anti-6×His monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) in the IP buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight and precipitated by adding protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase was used as a negative control. After four washes with IP buffer, the precipitated proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by fluorography. HeLa (human epithelial carcinoma cell), COS7 (green monkey kidney cell), and NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell) cells were used in the study. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For microscopy, cells were grown in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) and were transfected with plasmid DNA using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) or Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instruction. The transcription inhibition assay was done as described elsewhere (30Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1991; 253: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The treatment conditions were 5 μg/ml actinomycin D along with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h. The same amount of cells or transfected cells (∼1 × 104) was suspended in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min, run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The primary antibody, rabbit anti-QKI-5 polyclonal antibody (22Hardy R. Loushin C. Friedrich V. Chen Q. Ebersole T. Lazzarini R. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used at a 1:5000 dilution. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were visualized with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Indirect immunofluorescence was used to show endogenous QKI-5, Surf-6 and transfected Flag-QKI-5, myc-tagged hnRNP A1, and hnRNP C1. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The fixed cells were then incubated with blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% fish gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, they were probed with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, 1:2000 for rabbit anti-QKI-5 polyclonal antibody, 1:100 for rabbit anti-mouse Surf-6 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. C. Magoulas, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom), 1:360 for mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and 1:10 for mouse anti-myc monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. J. Fisher, University of Texas, Austin, TX). Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector) was used as secondary antibody, and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin (Vector) was used to visualize the structure. Finally, cells were stained with 50 ng/ml DAPI or 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 15 min and observed on an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with a 40× plan-NeoFluar objective. To observe GFP fusion proteins, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h after the transfection of GFP constructs, then stained with DAPI (50 ng/ml) or Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml). Interspecies heterokaryons of HeLa and mouse NIH3T3 cells were formed as described elsewhere (31Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP constructs, pCMV4-Flag-QKI-5, pcDNA3-myc-hnRNP A1, or pcDNA3-myc-C1 for 24 h, followed by adding equal amount of untransfected mouse NIH3T3 cells. The co-culture was incubated for 2.5 h in the presence of 75 μg/ml cycloheximide and 30 min in 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. After being fused with 50% polyethylene glycol 3350 for 2 min, cells were washed and incubated in medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for another 4 h, followed by fixation and observation described above. The 30-amino acid QKI-5 tail, the last 23 amino acids of SAM68, and the last 23 amino acids of ETLE were used to search the current protein data base using BLASTP program (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The setting of expectation was 1000, and no filter was used. All other parameters used are default settings. Among the hits, significant similarities were selected by eye. QKIkt4 was the first of the four QKIenu mutations to have its molecular defect identified. It has a missense change from glutamic acid to glycine at position 48 in the QUA1 domain. However, the function of QUA1 domain and the molecular process that the mutation disrupts were unknown. The study of XQUA and mouse QKI-7 have suggested that QKI can form homodimers and that RNA binding is not necessary for its self-association (5Zorn A.M. Krieg P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2176-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear which domain is responsible for oligomerization. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to further study QKI protein interaction. QKI isoforms, deletion fragments, and QKI-5kt4 (Fig.1) were fused with either LexA DNA-binding domain or GAL4 activation domain, and then cotransformed into yeast in different combinations (Fig.2 A). The X-gal assay shows that all three QKI isoforms can interact with each other; in contrast, the QKI-5kt4 mutation cannot interact with any of the QKI isoforms. pBTM116-Lamin and pACTII-T-antigen were used as negative control. QKI-5kt4 was chosen for this analysis as opposed to QKI-6 or QKI-7 mutation because QKI-5 is the dominant form expressed in the embryo, and we were interested in the isoform prevalent in development. To confirm that QKI-5kt4 proteins have lost their self-interaction ability, we performed in vitrocoimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2 C). His-QKI-5 was expressed in E. coli and purified using a nickel column (Fig. 2 B). Equal amounts of in vitro translated35S-labeled QKI-5, QKI-5kt4, or luciferase as a negative control were mixed with purified His-QKI-5 protein. Mouse anti-6×His monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the mixture and the proteins were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel. The co-immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. QKI-5 coprecipitates with His-QKI-5, while QKI-5kt4 and luciferase do not. In vitrotranslated QKI-5 only was mixed with the antibody in the coimmunoprecipitation assay to show that it was specific (Fig.2 C, last lane). These two experiments demonstrate that QKI isoforms can interact with each other, but QKI-5kt4 has lost self-interaction ability; thus, the QUA1 domain probably is responsible for the self-interaction of QKI. To further test this hypothesis, one of the newly identified QKI isoforms, QKI-ΔKH (21Kondo T. Furuta T. Mitsunaga K. Ebersole T.A. Shichiri M. Wu J. Artzt K. Yamamura K. Abe K. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which contains only the QUA1 domain and part of the KH domain (residues 1–134) (Fig. 1), was used in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The result showed that QKI-ΔKH is sufficient to interact with the other QKI isoforms (Fig. 2 A). These data together strongly suggest that the QUA1 domain contains self-interaction function. It is also noteworthy that this result confirms a contemporary study using QKI-7 (33Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At the subcellular level, QKI-5 is localized predominantly in the nucleus, while QKI-6 and QKI-7 are mostly cytoplasmic (22Hardy R. Loushin C. Friedrich V. Chen Q. Ebersole T. Lazzarini R. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the only difference between the isoforms is the carboxyl tail, it must be responsible for the different subcellular localization. To further analyze the subcellular localization of QKI, we used GFP. As a first step, we analyzed endogenous QKI-5 and GFP-QKI-5 fusion protein expression in cultured cells. Using a Western blot assay, we found that all three cell lines studied, HeLa, NIH3T3 and COS7, express endogenous QKI-5 (Fig. 3 A). However, there is a relatively lower level in NIH3T3 cells. Because of the relative high transfection efficiency, COS7 cells were used to check the GFP-QKI-5 protein expression. pEGFP-QKI-5 construct was transfected into COS7 cells and the expressed protein migrated at approximately 70 kDa as expected (Fig. 3 A, first lane). In addition, Fig. 3 B shows that GFP-QKI-5 has the same localization pattern as the endogenous protein. In HeLa cells, indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-QKI-5 antibody reveals that the endogenous protein and GFP-QKI-5 are both nuclear but were excluded from nucleoli. GFP alone is evenly distributed throughout the cell. GFP is thus a suitable tag to study QKI localization. In NIH3T3 and COS7 cells, GFP-QKI-5 has an identical localization pattern as in HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus, HeLa cells were used in the further localization study. Using GFP, the effect of the QKI-5 tail was visualized. The 30-amino acid tail was deleted and the remainder QKI-body was fused to GFP. This pEGFP-QKI-body was then transfected into HeLa cells. Without the tail, the fusion protein is located predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig.4 C), similar to GFP-QKI-7 (Fig. 4 B). These experiments show that the carboxyl tail of QKI-5 is necessary for its nuclear localization. The next question was whether this tail alone could target the protein to the nucleus. When it was attached to the COOH terminus of GFP and transfected into HeLa cells, all the GFP is visualized in the nucleus (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the 30-amino acid QKI-5tail alone is also sufficient for its nuclear localization. Interestingly, in this experiment, it was evident that there are some concentrated dots within the nucleus that were later shown to be nucleoli (see below for discussion). Although the QKI-5 tail is both necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization, it does not contain a traditional cluster of basic amino acids or bipartite NLS (34Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Upon close examination and comparison of mouse and Drosophila QKI, we found a sequence of 7 conserved amino acids (Table I): RVHPYQR in mouse and REHPYQR in Drosophila. In addition, very similar sequences were located at the extreme end of SAM68 and ETLE/T-STAR. Previous work has shown that the last 23 amino acids of SAM68 containing these 7 amino acids are responsible for its nuclear localization (35Ishidate T. Yoshihara S. Kawasaki Y. Roy B.C. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, in T-STAR, disruption of the last 5 amino acids, which overlaps with these 7, causes the protein to relocate to the cytoplasm (18Venables J.P. Vernet C. Chew S.L. Cowmedow R.B. Wu J. Cooke H.J. Artzt K. Eperon I.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the 7-amino acid consensus RXhPYQ/GR is the NLS for these STAR proteins. To examine this, we made a construct which has only these 7 amino acids from QKI-5 (QKI-5-NLS) fused to GFP and transfected it into HeLa cells. Although the fusion protein is expected to be less than 30 kDa, almost all the GFP-QKI-5-NLS was detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4 E). In most of the cells, GFP-QKI-5-NLS is also concentrated in dots in the nucleus although they are not as strong as those in pEGFP-QKI-5tail transfected cells. Thus, these 7 amino acids constitute the nuclear localization signal of QKI-5.Table ISequence of STAR-NLS in STAR and non-STAR proteinsSequenceProteinLocalizationReferenceSTAR proteinsRVHPYQRaThis signal is embedded in the 30-amino acid carboxyl tail of QKI-5: GAVATKVRRHDMRVHPYQRIVTADRAATGN.Mouse QKI-5Nuclear(1Ebersole T.

https://openalex.org/W2032234148,"Novel biodegradable bacterial plastics, made up of units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids, are accumulated intracellularly by Pseudomonas putida U due to the existence in this bacterium of (i) an acyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by the fadD gene) that activates the aryl-precursors; (ii) a β-oxidation pathway that affords 3-OH-aryl-CoAs, and (iii) a polymerization-depolymerization system (encoded in the phalocus) integrated by two polymerases (PhaC1 and PhaC2) and a depolymerase (PhaZ). The complete assimilation of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically catabolize the phenylacetyl-CoA or the benzoyl-CoA generated from these polyesters through β-oxidation. Genetic studies have allowed the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the phalocus (phaC1, phaC2, and phaZ) as well as those related to the biosynthesis of precursors (fadD) or to the catabolism of their derivatives (acuA, fadA, and paa genes). Additional experiments showed that the blockade of eitherfadD or phaC1 hindered the synthesis and accumulation of plastic polymers. Disruption of phaC2 reduced the quantity of stored polymers by two-thirds. The blockade ofphaZ hampered the mobilization of the polymer and decreased its production. Mutations in the paa genes, encoding the phenylacetic acid catabolic enzymes, did not affect the synthesis or catabolism of polymers containing either 3-hydroxyaliphatic acids or 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as monomers, whereas the production of polyesters containing units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly reduced in these bacteria. Yield-improving studies revealed that mutants defective in the glyoxylic acid cycle (isocitrate lyase−) or in the β-oxidation pathway (fadA), stored a higher amount of plastic polymers (1.4- and 2-fold, respectively), suggesting that genetic manipulation of these pathways could be useful for isolating overproducer strains. The analysis of the organization and function of the pha locus and its relationship with thecore of the phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon is reported and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2068015571,"Vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are multisubunit enzymes that acidify compartments of the vacuolar system of all eukaryotic cells. In osteoclasts, the cells that degrade bone, V-ATPases, are recruited from intracellular membrane compartments to the ruffled membrane, a specialized domain of the plasma membrane, where they are maintained at high densities, serving to acidify the resorption bay at the osteoclast attachment site on bone (Blair, H. C., Teitelbaum, S. L., Ghiselli, R., and Gluck, S. L. (1989) Science 249, 855–857). Here, we describe a new mechanism involved in controlling the activity of the bone-resorptive cell. V-ATPase in osteoclasts cultured in vitro was found to form a detergent-insoluble complex with actin and myosin II through direct binding of V-ATPase to actin filaments. Plating bone marrow cells onto dentine slices, a physiologic stimulus that activates osteoclast resorption, produced a profound change in the association of the V-ATPase with actin, assayed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical colocalization of actin filaments and V-ATPase in osteoclasts. Mouse marrow and bovine kidney V-ATPase bound rabbit muscle F-actin directly with a maximum stoichiometry of 1 mol of V-ATPase per 8 mol of F-actin and an apparent affinity of 0.05 μm. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples confirmed the binding interaction. These findings link transport of V-ATPase to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during osteoclast activation.

Bone degradation entails the activation of osteoclasts to a highly polarized state, with formation of a specialized ruffled membrane at their bone attachment site that confers the ability to resorb bone. The osteoclast ruffled membrane is bounded by a ring of actin filaments and associated proteins on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, localized to the zone on the cell surface that is adherent to bone (2Lakkakorpi P.

The adherence zone forms a tightly sealed extracellular compartment that is acidified by densely packed proton-transporting V-ATPases1 in the ruffled membrane (1Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R.

In osteoclasts actively resorbing bone, most of the cellular V-ATPase is polarized to the ruffled membrane (1Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S.L. Science. 1989; 249: 855-857Crossref Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Polarization of V-ATPases to discrete plasmalemmal domains in epithelial cells is dependent on the microtubules in the cytoskeleton (9Brown D. Sabolic I. Gluck S. Kidney Int. 1991; 33 (suppl.): 79-83Google Scholar). The involvement of actin filaments in polarization is not yet clear, although actin filament binding to V-ATPase-dense vesicles has been observed in proton-transporting epithelial cells of toad urinary bladder (10Brown D. Gluck S. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1636-1648Google Scholar). When cultured in medium containing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3), mouse marrow cells develop into osteoclasts (11Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A.

Osteoclasts from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cultures plated on bone or dentine slices undergo a transformation to the activated phenotype, in which actin rings form, V-ATPase is polarized to the ruffled membrane, and bone is resorbed (1Blair H.C.

In contrast, osteoclasts from identical cultures placed on glass coverslips fail to form ruffled membranes and do not have physiologically detectable plasma membrane V-ATPase (14Zimolo Z. Wesolowski G. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Lehenkari P.P. Laitala-Leinonen T. Linna T.J. Väänänen H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that V-ATPase is associated with the cytoskeleton in osteoclasts cultured in vitro (16Nakamura I.

Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). V-ATPase was found in a detergent-insoluble (cytoskeletal) fraction of osteoclast-containing bone marrow cultures from normal mice (16Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, in osteoclasts from osteosclerotic (oc − /oc −) mice, which are unable to form ruffled membranes, the amount of V-ATPase in the detergent-insoluble fraction was reduced (16Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), prompting speculation that V-ATPase binding to the cytoskeleton might be involved in ruffled membrane formation. In addition, genetic studies from yeast point toward an association between V-ATPase and the actin cytoskeleton (18Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These authors (18Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) postulated that alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal processes caused by mutation of V-ATPase subunits are the result of indirect effects resulting, perhaps, from changes in intracellular pH affecting cytoskeletal organization. Here, we examine the interaction between the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton and V-ATPase in mouse marrow osteoclasts. We show that V-ATPase binds actin filaments directly and that the interaction varies in response to physiologic stimuli, implicating a role for the actin-V-ATPase complex in controlling the transport of V-ATPase to the ruffled membrane. All materials were obtained from the Sigma unless otherwise noted. Osteoclasts were generated from primary mouse marrow cultures (12Holliday L.S. Dean A.D. Greenwald J.E. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18983-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 8–20 g Swiss-Webster mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and femora and tibia were dissected free from adherent tissue. Marrow was removed by cutting both bone ends, inserting a syringe with a 25-gauge needle, and flushing the marrow using αMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (αMEM D10). The marrow was washed twice with αMEM D10 and then plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plates for 5 days in αMEM D10 plus 10−8m1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cultures were fed on day 3 by replacing half the media per plate and adding fresh 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. After 5 days in culture, multinucleated osteoclasts appeared. The osteoclast phenotype was verified by demonstrating staining of the multinucleated cells for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, high level V-ATPase expression, and bone-resorptive capacity. Mouse marrow cultures were grown for 5 days on tissue culture plates in αMEM D10 plus 10−8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. On day 6, the cells were scraped from the tissue culture plates with a tissue culture scraper and plated on dentine slices (a kind gift of the U. S. Department of Fisheries, San Diego, CA). After incubation for varying lengths of time in αMEM D10 plus 10−8m1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in HENAC (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) for 20 min, permeabilized with HENAC plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and incubated overnight with HENAC plus 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5 mm sodium azide (blocking solution) at 4 °C to block nonspecific binding. The slices were then incubated for 2 h in the anti-V-ATPase monoclonal antibody E11 (20Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in HENAC plus 10% BSA, washed 3 times with HENAC, and incubated for 1 h in Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Park PA), diluted 1:500 in HENAC plus 10% BSA. After an overnight wash in HENAC, the slices were stained with either rhodamine or fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml) in HENAC plus 10% BSA for 10 min and washed three times in HENAC. Samples were examined within 1 h using a Nikon epifluorescence microscope or Bio-Rad and Zeiss scanning laser confocal microscopes. Mouse marrow cultures were grown as described above, and mature osteoclast- containing cultures were scraped and plated on coverslips or dentine slices. After 2 days, cells were permeabilized with HENAC plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.01 mg/ml rhodamine phalloidin. After 10 min on ice, the extracted remnants were fixed in ice-cold 200 mm HgCl, 90 mm sodium acetate, and 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, quenched with Lugol's solution for 2 min, washed twice with sodium thiocyanate and then 3 times in HENAC. Samples were then incubated in blocking solution followed by E11 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody as described above. Specimens were examined by scanning laser confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). Six- to eight-day-old mouse marrow cultures were labeled overnight in 90% methionine- and cysteine-free culture medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm sodium azide, and protease inhibitors). Following a centrifugation at low speed (10 min at 20,000 ×g, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material, the extracts either were subjected to an additional spin at high speed (1 h at 200,000 × g, 4 °C) or were used directly for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by first incubating the extracts with protein A-Sepharose to remove any nonspecifically binding proteins. Extracts were then incubated with 10 μl of E11 ascites for 2 h at 4 °C, and with 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose for an additional 30 min. The immune complexes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, washed 3 times in NET-GEL buffer (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.44Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, treated with the fluorographic enhancer Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), and subjected to autoradiography and/or phosphorimetry. Immunoblots were performed by standard procedures as described previously (20Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed essentially as described previously (12Holliday L.S. Dean A.D. Greenwald J.E. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18983-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modifications to allow immunoprecipitations to be performed from bone resorptive cells. Mouse marrow cultures were grown to maturity in tissue culture plates, then scraped and loaded onto 8-cm2 dentine slices in 6-well plates. After 2 days on bone slices in αMEM D10 plus 10−8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, mouse marrow was labeled overnight in 90% methionine- and cysteine-free culture medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer (as described above). Following a centrifugation at low speed (10 min at 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material, the extracts either were subjected to an additional spin at high speed (1 h at 200,000 × g, 4 °C) or were used directly for immunoprecipitation as described above. After removal of cells dentine slices were washed for 10 min in 2% SDS, washed 3× with water, air-dried, affixed to aluminum stubs with carbon double-sided tape (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), sputter-coated with gold, and examined with a Hitachi H-400 scanning electron microscope. Bovine kidney V-ATPase was purified by methods previously described (21Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine kidney microsomes were prepared as described previously (22Gluck S. Al-Aqwati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1704-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) except for omission of the sucrose gradient step. All procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. 5 mg/ml microsomal protein was solubilized in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6% CHAPS, 1.5% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, and 10% glycerol. The mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1 h, and the clear supernatant containing solubilized V-ATPase was collected. Immunoaffinity purification of V-ATPase from bovine kidney was performed exactly as described (21Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar concentration of V-ATPase was estimated based on the initial concentration of V-ATPase determined by BCA assay (Pierce) and estimating the molecular weight of the V-ATPase to be 578 kDa. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder by standard methods (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Actin was further purified by two rounds of polymerization-depolymerization and gel filtration on a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The critical concentration of the purified rabbit muscle actin was determined by allowing its polymerization at a concentration of 70 μm in buffer G (Ref. 23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol) plus 100 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2. After diluting the samples to concentrations between 0.15 and 3.0 μm in the same buffer and incubating for 3 h to reach steady state, the actin mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min. The pellets and supernatants were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The proportions of actin in the supernatant and pellet were determined by the method of Fenner et al. (25Fenner C. Traut R.R. Mason D.T. Wikman-Coffelt J. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) except that the amount of 25% pyridine used to extract bands was reduced to 0.4 ml. The Coomassie-stained actin bands were cut out and extracted for 2 days in 25% pyridine, and the absorbance of the extract at 590 nm was determined. To determine whether gelsolin-shortened F-actin bound V-ATPase as well as long actin filaments (26Schwartz M.A. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), actin (70 μm), was polymerized in buffer G plus 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of gelsolin (Sigma) at 3.50 and 1.75 μm. The samples were then diluted into a V-ATPase solution in the same buffer to give final concentrations of 2.5 μm actin, 0.125 μm gelsolin (20:1), 0.0625 μm gelsolin (40:1), no gelsolin (control), or V-ATPase alone. The samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min. Determination of the stoichiometry of V-ATPase binding to F-actin required that actin concentrations below the critical concentration be used. To accommodate this, actin (70 μm) was polymerized in buffer G plus 100 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2, then diluted to 200 nm in the same buffer plus 20 nm V-ATPase, 10 μm phalloidin (Ref. 27Dancker P. Low I. Hasselbach W. Wieland T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar; to stabilize the filaments), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (to reduce nonspecific binding). After 2 h at room temperature and ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g, supernatants and pellets were collected, subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to Immobilon P, and probed with the mouse monoclonal anti-E subunit antibody E11. The ratio of E subunit in supernatants versuspellets was estimated by densitometry. To estimate the dissociation constant of the actin-V-ATPase interaction, varying concentrations of F-actin were added to 100 nm V-ATPase in buffer G plus 5 mmMgCl2 and 100 mm NaCl. Samples were incubated 1 h at room temperature and then subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min. Pellets and supernatants were collected; SDS-PAGE was performed, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The actin, and A, B, and E subunits of the V-ATPase were excised and quantified as described above (25Fenner C. Traut R.R. Mason D.T. Wikman-Coffelt J. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The proportion of the potential V-ATPase-binding sites actually bound by V-ATPase was determined from the amount of V-ATPase pelleting and calculating the maximal stoichiometry of binding to be 1 V-ATPase per 8 F-actin subunits (from Fig. 10). Data were plotted in a Haines plot where theK d was given by the negative of the xaxis intercept. Rabbit muscle actin (70 μm) was polymerized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 and diluted into the same buffer to 2.5 μm plus or minus 0.05 μm V-ATPase. The samples were then spun at 200,00 × g for 45 min, and the pellets were collected in the same buffer except with no detergent. 400 mesh Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids were used to collect samples that were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (28Holliday L.S. Roberts T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The specimens were examined using a Zeiss transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. To study the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating V-ATPase distribution during osteoclast activation, we examined the distribution of F-actin and V-ATPase in osteoclasts plated on coverslips and dentine slices using labeled phalloidin to detect actin filaments, and monoclonal antibody E11, against the E subunit, to detect V-ATPase (20Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In inactive osteoclasts on glass, V-ATPase colocalized with the loose network of actin filaments at the cell periphery and was concentrated in the actin ring (Fig. 1,A–C). The actin ring that forms in inactive osteoclasts is not associated with ruffled membrane formation and occurs at the periphery of cells. In contrast, in osteoclasts plated on dentine, the distribution of actin and V-ATPase varied with the state of the resorptive cycle of the cells. At the initial stage of the resorption cycle, before the formation of actin rings, actin patches formed near the cell surface, in which V-ATPase and actin were colocalized (Fig. 1,D–F, large arrow). At a later stage of the cycle, rings of actin formed surrounding the patches, and extensive colocalization of actin and V-ATPase occurred within the newly formed rings (Fig. 1, D–F, small arrow). In fully activated osteoclasts, most of the actin in the central patches had dissipated, leaving the actin rings intact, but V-ATPase remained localized in the interior of the ring (Fig. 1, G–I). To determine if the V-ATPase was associated with the Triton-insoluble actin-based cytoskeleton, we extracted osteoclasts on coverslips and dentine slices with 0.5% Triton X-100 containing fluorescein-phalloidin to stabilize microfilaments, and we fixed the samples for examination of V-ATPase distribution by immunocytochemistry. In osteoclasts on coverslips, V-ATPase staining was present throughout the cell in a distribution similar to that of the loose actin filament network (Fig. 2,A–C). The actin rings of the inactive osteoclasts were quite labile under these conditions and were never preserved. V-ATPase did not remain associated with actin from stromal cells in the culture. In osteoclasts plated on dentine slices, the true actin rings sometimes survived detergent extraction. Although the V-ATPase in the ruffled membranes was extracted, V-ATPase that colocalized with the loose filaments internal to the ring remained (Fig. 2, D–F). These observations suggested that the V-ATPase associates directly with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton during the process of osteoclast activation. To examine this possibility, we prepared detergent extracts of osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures, centrifuged the extracts at low speed (20,000 × g for 10 min) or high speed (200,000 × g for 1 h), then electroblotted and probed them for the presence of V-ATPase (Fig.3 A). In these experiments, the low speed supernatant contained cytoskeletal actin filaments and associated proteins, as well as detergent-soluble proteins; the high speed pellet removed all of the actin filaments and any actin-bound proteins. Although solubilized V-ATPase usually does not pellet under the conditions of the high speed centrifugation (21Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), half of the total E subunit was found in the high speed pellets (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the enzyme was present in a large molecular weight complex. To explore this further, radiolabeled V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated from the low speed supernatant (LSS), the high speed supernatant, and the high speed pellet (HSP) using Sepharose beads coated with antibody E11, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography (Fig. 3 B). The A, B, and E subunits of the V-ATPase were readily detected. Additional polypeptides with molecular masses of 205, 42, and 20 kDa also were recovered in immunoprecipitates from both the low speed supernatant and high speed pellet (Fig. 3 B). To determine if these proteins were bound specifically to the V-ATPase on the antibody beads, we tested whether the E11 cognate peptide (20Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited binding of both the V-ATPase and the additional proteins to E11 beads (Fig.3 C). E11 immunoprecipitates were incubated with peptide, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Incubation of the immunoprecipitates with cognate peptide removed nearly 100% of the bound V-ATPase and 70–90% of the 205-, 42-, and 20-kDa proteins from mouse marrow extracts (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, an irrelevant osteopontin-derived peptide had no effect on V-ATPase or the additional proteins. Since the unidentified 205-, 42-, and 20-kDa polypeptides corresponded in size to the cytoskeletal elements myosin heavy chain, actin, and myosin light chain, respectively, we analyzed unlabeled immunoprecipitates by immunoblot analysis, and we confirmed that the 205 and 42 kDa were myosin II heavy chain and actin (Fig.3 D). As discussed above, osteoclasts have a quiescent phenotype on glass coverslips but become actively resorptive cells when plated on bone slices. To determine whether the interaction of V-ATPase with the actin cytoskeleton might have a role in osteoclast activation, we examined whether the V-ATPase-actin complex differed in osteoclasts plated on glass coverslips or bone. In mature 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures plated on glass coverslips, 44.5% (range 37.0–54%) of the V-ATPase remained associated with the cytoskeleton, whereas only 12.7% (range 9.9–14.5%) of the V-ATPase was complexed with actin in the cultures on dentine slices (Fig.4 a). To confirm that osteoclasts on dentine were resorptive, slices used in the immunoprecipitation experiment were examined for the presence of resorption lacunae. Fig. 4, b and c, shows representative fields from a control dentine slice and a slice used for osteoclast attachment, demonstrating large numbers of resorption pits produced by osteoclasts in this experiment. To determine whether the V-ATPase binds to actin or myosin in the complex, we examined the effect of actin depolymerization on V-ATPase association with the cytoskeleton. Immunoprecipitations were performed on the low speed supernatants from 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated mouse marrow cultures, and the complexes were treated overnight with buffer G (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNase I, a potent actin monomer-sequestering protein (29Mannherz H.G. Leigh J.B. Leberman R. Pfrang H. FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation, the beads were washed free of DNase I and any other proteins that had dissociated overnight; the V-ATPase was eluted with the E11 cognate peptide, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Neither actin nor myosin II were associated with the V-ATPase after this treatment, indicating that depolymerization of actin was sufficient to dissociate the myosin II from V-ATPase, suggesting that myosin binds to V-ATPase indirectly through actin filaments. To confirm that V-ATPase bound actin rather than myosin II, solubilized mouse marrow cultures were subjected to high speed centrifugation, and E11 immunoprecipitations were performed from the supernatant. The beads were eluted with the E11 cognate peptide, and the samples were dialyzed overnight against buffer G. The dialyzed samples (Fig.6, lane 1) were centrifuged to remove any residual filamentous actin or aggregated V-ATPase. The remaining supernatant is shown in Fig. 6, lane 2. 4.5 μm purified rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin was added and was"

Sequence similarity searches indicated that the proteins encoded by ssuA,ssuB, and ssuC are likely to constitute an ABC type transport system, whereas ssuD and ssuEencode an FMNH2-dependent monooxygenase and an NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase, respectively (Eichhorn, E., van der Ploeg, J. R., and Leisinger, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 26639–26646). Synthesis of β-galactosidase from a transcriptional chromosomal ssuE′-lacZ fusion was repressed by sulfate or cystine and depended on the presence of a functional cbl gene, which encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the ssu promoter region and measurements of β-galactosidase from plasmid-encoded ssuE′-′lacZ fusions showed that full expression of the ssu operon required the presence of a Cbl-binding site upstream of the −35 region. CysB, the LysR transcriptional regulator for the cys genes, was not required for expression of a chromosomal ssuE′-lacZ fusion although the ssu promoter region contained three CysB-binding sites.

Staudenmann W. Kertesz M. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these sulfate starvation-induced (Ssi) proteins, the sulfate-binding protein (Sbp) andO-acetylserine lyase (CysK), are components of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway leading to cysteine (3Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 514-527Google Scholar). Two other proteins whose synthesis is completely repressed when sulfate is present in the growth medium have been identified as the TauD and TauA proteins, which are encoded in the tauABCD gene cluster required for the utilization of taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate) as a sulfur source (2van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by tauABC probably function as an ABC transporter for taurine, whereas TauD is an α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase which catalyzes the incorporation of oxygen into taurine and thereby leads to the liberation of sulfite (4Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23031-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). There is a clear difference between expression of the cysgenes, required for reduction of sulfate and biosynthesis of cysteine, and that of the tau genes. Whereas the tau genes are completely repressed by sulfate (5van der Ploeg J.R. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. Hryniewicz M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7671-7678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of thecys genes is only partly repressed (3Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 514-527Google Scholar). The cysgenes are positively regulated by the LysR-type (6Schell M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) transcriptional activator CysB and the inducer N-acetylserine (7Kredich N.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2747-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Expression of the tau genes requires CysB, but also Cbl, another LysR-type transcriptional activator with 41% amino acid sequence identity to CysB (8Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Hryniewicz M.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 166: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). cbl mutants are unable to utilize taurine as well as a range of other aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur source and many of the Ssi proteins were absent or present in reduced amounts in a cbl mutant grown under sulfate-starvation conditions (5van der Ploeg J.R. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. Hryniewicz M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7671-7678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl therefore appears to be a transcription activator for genes whose expression is induced by sulfate starvation. In this study we report the identification of the ssuEADCBgenes (for sulfonate-sulfurutilization), whose products include two of the remaining Ssi proteins, Ssi4 and Ssi6. It will be shown that the ssugenes require cbl for expression and that they encode a set of proteins that enables E. coli to utilize aliphatic sulfonates other than taurine as a sulfur source. All chemicals used as sulfur sources were of the highest quality available and were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), except for isethionate and lanthionine, which were purchased from Aldrich. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Strains of E. coli and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains were grown at 37 °C either in LB medium or sulfur-free minimal medium (2van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J.

When required, growth media contained ampicillin (100 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), or kanamycin (50 μg/ml).

Total DNA was isolated from E. coli MC4100 using the hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.E. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience, New York. 1987; Google Scholar) and digested with the restriction enzymes that had been used to create the E. coli chromosomal restriction map (11Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) with the exception of BglI. Restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC, and hybridized overnight to 100 pmol of digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide 2D6N at 45 °C in 10 ml of hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, 1% blocking reagent). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. Detection of the hybridized probe was performed with disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer. The sizes of the restriction fragments that hybridized to the probe were estimated and fitted to the physical restriction map of E. coli according to Heurgué-Hamard et al. (12Heurgué-Hamard V. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2801-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For localization of the gene encoding Ssi4, oligonucleotide 2D4N (5′-ATGCGIGTIAT(T/C)ACI(T/C)TIGCIGG-3′), derived from the N-terminal sequence of Ssi4 (MRVITLAG; see Ref. 1Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. Kertesz M. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was used in the same way as described above. For plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, and transformation, published procedures were used (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.E. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience, New York. 1987; Google Scholar). Plasmid pME4210, containing the complete ssuEADCB gene cluster plus 326 bp1 upstream of the ssuE start codon, was constructed as follows. Plasmid pME4204 consists of a 0.33-kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment obtained by PCR with primers JP12 and JP13 (see below). The 24-bp BamHI/MunI fragment from plasmid pME4204 was replaced by the 1.15-kb BamHI/MunI fragment from pME4180 to yield plasmid pME4206. Subsequently the 1.4-kbEcoRI/BamHI fragment from pME4206 and the 4.2-kbEcoRI/BamHI fragment from plasmid pME4180 were ligated to EcoRI-digested pBluescriptKS to yield pME4210. To replace two mutations present in the ssuEADCB sequence, the ClaI/SalI fragment was substituted by theClaI/SalI fragment from pME4281, which contains an insert generated by PCR amplification from total DNA from E. coli strain EC1250 (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Since pME4210 contained ClaI and SalI sites in the vector backbone, theSacI/HindIII fragment from pME4210 was cloned in pUC19 to give plasmid pME4220. The ClaI/SalI fragment from pME4281 was then used to replace theClaI/SalI fragment in pME4220, thereby yielding plasmid pME4221. The dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) was used to sequence DNA fragments cloned into pBluescript KS or pGEM7 using an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. Nucleotide and protein sequences were analyzed with GCG (Wisconsin Package Version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) and compared with the latest releases of the EMBL, Swiss-Prot, and TREMBL data bases. The nucleotide sequence described is deposited in the EMBL data base under accession number AJ237695. For the simultaneous construction of a deletion in ssuEADCB and a chromosomally encoded transcriptionalssuE′-lacZ fusion, the promoterless lacZYA genes from pRS415 (15Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) were recovered as a BamHI/StuI fragment and cloned in the BglII/StuI site of pME4210, yielding pME4230. The complete insert from pME4230 was subsequently cloned as NotI/SalI fragment in pKO3 (16Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pME4231, was transferred to strain EC1250 by electroporation. Colonies that appeared at 42 °C were suspended in LB medium and appropriate dilutions plated out on LB medium containing 5% sucrose. The resulting colonies were then replica-plated on LB plates containing chloramphenicol and sucrose. Chloramphenicol-sensitive colonies were selected and tested for growth on butanesulfonate and for expression of lacZ on minimal plates containing tryptophan, glutathione as a sulfur source, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. One such colony was purified and the strain was designated SE40. For the construction of ssuE′-′lacZ fusions, PCR was employed to amplify different fragments of the region upstream ofssuE and to introduce BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites in order to facilitate cloning in plasmid pRS552 (15Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The forward primers, whose positions at different regions upstream of the transcription start site are given in parentheses, were as follows: JP12 (−287), 5′-CTTCGTGAATTCGATAATGCC-3′; JP14 (−144), 5′-CGAGGAATTCATTGATTCAAC-3′; JP15 (−35), 5′-TTTGGAATTCTCTTGTCTCTCC-3′; JP18 (−98), 5′-TATGCGTGAATTCTAAAGCC-3′; JP21 (−211), 5′-ATACGAATTCCAATAAGTGA-3′; JP24 (−80), 5′-CCCTTTCTTTAGTTTGAATTCAG-3′; JP25 (−52), 5′-GATACACAGAATTCATATTTGG-3′ (the nucleotides changed to introduce restriction sites are underlined). The reverse primer used for all fusions was JP13 (+64), 5′-TGATGGGATCCATACTCTCT-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated to plasmid pRS552 which had been cut with the same enzymes. The inserts of all plasmids were sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced during the PCR. For the generation of plasmid pME4234, containing mutations in the IHF-binding site IHF1, PCR was performed with the primers IHF2 (−141) (5′-GTAATTCAAAGCTTCAACATC-3′) and T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) using pME4204 as a template. The product was digested with BamHI and HindIII. In a second PCR reaction, primers IHF1 (5′-ATGTTGAAGCTTTGAATTAC-3′, complementary to primer IHF2) and T3 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGG-3′) were used with template pME4204, and the product was digested with EcoRI andHindIII. Both fragments were combined and ligated toEcoRI/BamHI-digested pBluescriptKS to yield pME4234. The BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pME4234 was subsequently cloned in pRS552 to give pME4240. For construction of pME4232, containing mutations in IHF2, primers IHF3 (−181), 5′-ATTTAATCGATTCATGAATAT-3′, and IHF4, 5′-CATGAATCGATTAAATTAAG-3′ (partially complementary to primer IHF3), were used in the same way as described above for construction of pME4234 but by using ClaI instead ofHindIII for digestion of the PCR products. TheBamHI/EcoRI fragment from pME4232 was cloned in pRS552 to give pME4233. Plasmid pME4209, containing mutations in both IHF1 and IHF2, was constructed as described above for plasmid pME4232 but by using pME4234 as template DNA for PCR. Plasmid pME4291 was obtained by cloning the EcoRI/BamHI fragment from pME4209 in pRS552. For primer extension analysis, strain EC1250 was grown in minimal medium with sulfate or butanesulfonate as sulfur source to an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.8. Isolation of total RNA and primer extension analysis was according to Babst et al. (17Babst M. Hennecke H. Fischer H.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using primer JP19 (5′-CGCGCATATTCCAGCAAGGAGCTGGA-3′; 71 to 45 bp downstream from the translation start; Fig. 3 A) and about 100 μg of RNA. The products were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel together with a sequencing reaction done with the same primer and plasmid pME4181 (Table I) by using the fmol cycle sequencing kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activities were assayed in cells taken from late log-phase cultures according to the method of Miller (9Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. 1992; (ed) pp., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY: 268-274Google Scholar) with o-nitrophenylgalactoside as a substrate. DNA fragments containing various portions of the ssu promoter region were generated by PCR, 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), and purified by QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen). The primers used for PCR are described above. Proteins used were highly purified CysB from Salmonella typhimurium obtained from N. M. Kredich, partially purified Cbl from E. coli (6Schell M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), and highly purified IHF from E. coli (18Sirko A. Zehelein E. Freundlich M. Sawers G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from A. Sirko. Conditions for DNA-protein binding reactions and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as described previously (5van der Ploeg J.R. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. Hryniewicz M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7671-7678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation mixtures (20 μl) contained approximately 10 ng of labeled DNA fragment and 2 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA per ml to reduce nonspecific binding, in a buffer consisting of 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation with given protein (5 min at 37 °C), samples were separated on a 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (82:1) gel in 0.05 m Tris borate/EDTA buffer (pH 8.3) for 1.5 h at 10 V/cm. The genes encoding the proteins Ssi4 and Ssi6 were mapped to the chromosome of E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For both genes, the best fit to the restriction map of E. coli was obtained at 21.4 min downstream of pepN (results not shown). The genes encoding Ssi4 and Ssi6 were located on plasmid pJP30, which consists of a 22-kb chromosomal HindIII fragment cloned in pACYC184 (19Tommassen J. van der Ley P. van der Ende A. Bergmans H. Lugtenberg B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 105-110Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A 5.5-kb SspI/EcoRI fragment from pJP30 was cloned in pBluescript KS to yield plasmid pME4180 (Fig.1). We sequenced 4499 bp from theSspI site until the end of the pepN gene (20Foglino M. Gharbi S. Lazdunski A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 49: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which corresponds with the genome sequence of E. coli from 996,943 to 992,445 (21Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence indicated that immediately downstream and opposite to the direction of transcription of pepN five open reading frames were present (Fig. 1). The corresponding genes have been designated ssuE,ssuA, ssuD, ssuC, and ssuB. These genes have previously been designated ycbP,ycbO, ycbN, ycbM, and ycbE,respectively (21Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). The sequence established by us showed two differences with respect to the published sequence of theE. coli genome (21Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). The T residues at bp 2626 and at bp 2927 were C residues in the sequence of the E. coligenome. The amino acid sequence of SsuE showed similarity to the NADH-dependent FMN reductase MsuE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22Kertesz M.A. Schmidt-Larbig K. Wüest T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to SsuE from Pseudomonas putida, involved in utilization of methanesulfonate and aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources, respectively. It has been demonstrated recently that the purified SsuE protein from E. coli catalyzes the reduction of flavins by NADH or NADPH (13Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26639-26646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SsuD was similar in sequence to FMNH2-dependent monooxygenases involved in utilization of sulfonates as sulfur sources (22Kertesz M.A. Schmidt-Larbig K. Wüest T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23van der Ploeg J.R. Cummings N.J. Leisinger T. Connerton I.F. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 2P. Vermeij and M. A. Kertesz, unpublished observations. In addition, SsuD showed sequence similarity to a class of monooxygenases of diverse substrate range which require FMNH2 for their activity. The SsuD protein from E. coli has recently been purified and was found to act as an FMNH2-dependent oxygenase, liberating sulfite from a range of aliphatic sulfonates (13Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26639-26646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The sequences of SsuB and SsuC were similar to ATP-binding proteins and membrane components, respectively, of members of the ABC transporter superfamily (not shown; see Ref. 24Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sequences of the proteins encoded by ssuA, ssuB, andssuC were significantly similar to those of the proteins that constitute putative ABC transporters from E. coliinvolved in utilization of taurine (2van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from Bacillus subtilis involved in utilization of aliphatic sulfonates (SsuA, SsuB, and SsuC respectively; see Ref. 23van der Ploeg J.R. Cummings N.J. Leisinger T. Connerton I.F. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and from P. putida involved in utilization of aliphatic and aromatic sulfonates (SsuA, SsuB and SsuC respectively).2 Since the synthesis of both Ssi4 and Ssi6 is up-regulated when sulfate or cysteine are absent from the growth medium (1Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. Kertesz M. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it was likely that the ssuEADCB gene cluster is involved in utilization of sulfur sources other than cysteine or sulfate. To study the function and expression ofssuEADCB, the complete gene cluster was deleted and replaced by the promoterless lacZYA genes (Fig. 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting strain SE40 was unable to utilize a broad range of aliphatic sulfonates as a sulfur source, except for taurine. Sulfur sources that supported growth of the wild type strain EC1250 but not of the mutant SE40 included ethanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, butanesulfonate, pentanesulfonate, hexanesulfonate, ethanedisulfonate, octanesulfonate, decanesulfonate, isethionate, sulfoacetate, MOPS, HEPES, MES, and PIPES. Both the mutant and wild type strains were unable to use methanesulfonate, cysteate, dodecanesulfonate, or sulfosuccinate as sulfur source. We were therefore unable to confirm that E. coli utilizes methanesulfonate and cysteate as a source of sulfur (25Roberts R.B. Abelson P.H. Cowie D.B. Bolton E.T. Britten R.J. Sulfur Metabolism. 1955; (eds), pp., Carnegie Institution, Washington D.C.: 318-405Google Scholar, 26Uria-Nickelsen M.R. Leadbetter E.R. Godchaux III, W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutant strain was not affected in utilization of sulfur from sulfate, cysteine, cystine, lanthionine, methionine, glutathione, or taurine. The ssuEADCB gene cluster is hence required for utilization of aliphatic sulfonates as a sulfur source except for taurine, for which the desulfurization system is encoded by the tauABCDgene cluster (2van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pME4180, originating from pJP30 and supposed to contain the complete ssuEADCB operon plus 205 bp upstream of thessuE start, was unable to complement mutant SE40. We presumed that the inability to complement the mutant might be caused by the differences found between the ssuEADCB sequence originating from plasmid pJP30 and that from the E. coligenome. The mutation in ssuD at bp 2626 led to an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine, whereas the mutation inssuC at bp 2927 was silent."

These proteins behave as either activators or repressors and have begun to be classified into different subfamilies based upon the presence of conserved motifs outside the zinc finger domain. This classification predicts that different Sp1-like subfamilies share certain functional properties. TIEG1 and TIEG2 constitute a new subfamily of transforming growth factor-β-inducible Sp1-like proteins whose zinc finger motifs also bind GC-rich sequences. However, regions outside of the DNA-binding domain that differ in structure from other Sp1-like family members remain poorly characterized. Here, we have used extensive mutagenesis and GAL4-based transcriptional assays to identify three repression domains within TIEG1 and TIEG2 that we call R1, R2, and R3. R1 is 10 amino acids, R2 is 12 amino acids, and R3 is approximately 80 amino acids long. None of these domains share homology with previously described transcriptional regulatory motifs, but they share strong sequence homology and are functionally conserved between TIEG1 and TIEG2. Together, these data demonstrate that TIEG proteins are capable of repressing transcription, define domains critical for this function, and further support the idea that different subfamilies of Sp1-like proteins have evolved to mediate distinct transcriptional functions.

Together, these data demonstrate that TIEG proteins are capable of repressing transcription, define domains critical for this function, and further support the idea that different subfamilies of Sp1-like proteins have evolved to mediate distinct transcriptional functions. Sp1-like transcription factors have recently elicited significant attention because of their widespread participation in the regulation of mammalian cell homeostasis (1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Members of this family of proteins currently include Sp1–4, BTEB1, BTEB2/IKLF, TIEG1/MGIF, TIEG2, BKLF, EKLF, GKLF/EZF, LKLF, CPBP/Bcd, and AP2-rep, all of which are characterized by three highly conserved C2H2zinc finger DNA-binding domains at their C termini (2Kadonaga J.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sp1-like transcription factors share over 75% similarity within these three zinc finger domains. Because of this high similarity, it is not surprising that many of these proteins bind to similar GC-rich sequences within promoters (reviewed in Ref. 1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These GC-rich sequences contribute to the regulation of a large number of genes necessary for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (22Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, because of their participation in these functions, many Sp1-like proteins also function as key regulators of morphogenesis (1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). While the DNA-binding domain of the Sp1-like transcription factor family is highly conserved, the N-terminal regions of the proteins are more divergent. Interestingly, it is through this domain that many of these transcription factors regulate transcription (7Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

The founding member of this family, Sp1, for example, is a potent transcriptional activator that utilizes glutamine-rich sequences located within its N terminus to interact with proteins from the basal transcriptional apparatus to regulate gene expression (23Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In contrast, BKLF behaves as a transcriptional repressor through a distinct domain within its N terminus (30Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other members of the Sp1-like family, such as GKLF, can behave as either a transcriptional activator or a transcriptional repressor through two independent regulatory domains (19Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, for several of the Sp1-like family members, the domains responsible for transcriptional regulation have not yet been defined. TIEG1 is a widely expressed zinc finger transcription factor originally identified as the product of a TGFβ-inducible gene from osteoblastic cell populations (10Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have revealed that TIEG1 is a novel member of the Sp1-like family of transcription factors that inhibits the growth of epithelial cell populations (15Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. R. U. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies from other laboratories have demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of TIEG1 on cell growth is also observed in mesenchymal cells (31Tau K.R. Hefferan T.E. Waters K.M. Robinson J.A. Subramaniam M. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports have shown that TIEG1 is a target of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated signaling in neuronal cells (16Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Lee S.H. Hara Y. Mizuno K. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8657-8666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TIEG1 appears to be part of the molecular machinery that regulates the growth of cells from various lineages. As the result of a search for novel Sp1-like transcription factors, we have recently identified TIEG2, a protein structurally related to TIEG1 (17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These two proteins are 91% similar within the C-terminal DNA-binding domain and 44% similar throughout their N termini. Like TIEG1, TIEG2 is inducible by TGFβ signaling and inhibits epithelial cell growth. Thus, based upon their sequence similarity, TGFβ inducibility, and effect on epithelial cell proliferation, we have proposed that TIEG1 and TIEG2 form a distinct subgroup of Sp1-like transcription factors (17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). With the goal of better understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the function of TIEG1 and TIEG2, our laboratory has focused on defining the structural domains used by these proteins to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells. We and others have recently demonstrated that the zinc finger motifs of both TIEG1 and TIEG2 bind to GC-rich Sp1-like cis-regulatory sequences (16Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Lee S.H. Hara Y. Mizuno K. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8657-8666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The functional consequence of this interaction is the repression of promoters containing GC-rich sequences, and at least for TIEG2, the N-terminal region of this protein is sufficient to mediate repression (16Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Lee S.H. Hara Y. Mizuno K. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8657-8666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that the N terminus of TIEG1 also mediates repression, revealing that this region has a conserved transcriptional function in both TIEG proteins. More importantly, using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis together with transcriptional regulatory assays, we have defined three independent transcriptional repression domains conserved within TIEG proteins that we call R1, R2, and R3. R1 and R2 are 10- and 12-amino acids long, respectively, while R3 is a longer proline-rich sequence of approximately 80 aa. Interestingly, in contrast to several other members of the Sp1-like family, no transcriptional activation domain was found to be present in these transcription factors (7Sogawa K. Imataka H.

Together, these data strongly support the biochemical similarity between TIEG1 and TIEG2 and indicate that they primarily function to silence gene expression. Furthermore, these results expand our understanding of the repertoire of functional domains present in Sp1-like transcription factors for the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells. The importance of these results for extending the classification of Sp1-like proteins is discussed. TIEG2-GAL4 constructs were generated by amplifying various regions of TIEG2 by polymerase chain reaction and cloning these in frame with the pSG424 GAL4 DBD 1The abbreviations used are:DBDDNA-binding domainCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryaaamino acid(s) effector plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. N. J. Zeleznik-Le, University of Chicago, IL). TIEG1 constructs were generated in the same manner. All TIEG2 constructs were numbered by amino acid using the second in-frame methionine of the originally published sequence (the codon that best fits the Kozak consensus translational start site) as amino acid residue 1 (17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Site-directed proline mutagenesis of the R1 and R2 domains was performed by annealing overlapping mutant primers that span the region of interest. Mutagenesis of the R3 domain was performed using standard overlapping polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by sequencing. DNA-binding domain chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Chinese hamster ovary amino acid(s) GAL4-based transcriptional regulatory assays were performed as described previously (17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105 CHO cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected 48 h later with 3 μg of GAL4 effector plasmid DNA, 1 μg of GAL45tkCAT reporter (generously provided by Dr. N. J. Zeleznik-Le), and 1 μg of pHook-LacZ (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). As a control for basal transcriptional activity, the reporter construct was co-transfected with an effector plasmid carrying the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone. Co-transfection with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pHook-LacZ (Promega), was performed to control for transfection efficiency. Relative CAT activity was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). In all experiments, CAT activity was determined using the same amount of protein (50 μg), and the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Studies were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments with similar results. To ascertain expression levels of each GAL4 chimeric transcription factor used in these studies, electromobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (17Cook T. Gebelein B.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, concomitant with the transfection for the GAL4-based transcriptional regulatory assay, an additional 60-mm dish of CHO cells was co-transfected with 3 μg (or as indicated) of each effector plasmid and 2 μg of filler DNA (pcDNA3.1+; InVitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and pelleted at 3000 ×g for 5 min. Cells were then lysed in 35 μl of whole cell extract buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.5m KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), frozen at −80 °C, and thawed at 4 °C. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysates were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentrations were assayed using the BCA method (Pierce). 10 μg of whole cell extracts was incubated 10 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Promega, Madison, WI). A double-stranded GAL4 DNA-binding site, 5′-GGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG-3′ was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Promega, Madison, WI). 0.35 pmol of end-labeled GAL4 probe was then added to each reaction for an additional 20 min, and the reactions were loaded immediately onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Samples were run for 3 h at 120 V at room temperature, vacuum-dried, and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at room temperature. Several studies have recently revealed the existence of a novel subfamily of Sp1-like transcription factors, TIEG1 and TIEG2, that inhibit growth of epithelial cell populations (15Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. R. U. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These proteins share 91% similarity within their C-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding domain and 44% similarity within a proline-rich N terminus. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated that both of these proteins bind to GC-rich sequences and repress transcription of promoters containing these sites (16Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Lee S.H. Hara Y. Mizuno K. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8657-8666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of TIEG2, when tethered to DNA through a heterologous DBD, behaves as a potent transcriptional repression domain (17Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). To test whether the homologous region of TIEG1 has a similar function, in the current study, we fused the N and C terminus of TIEG1 to the GAL4 DBD and tested its ability to regulate a promoter carrying five GAL4 DNA-binding sites upstream of a CAT reporter gene. Indeed, Fig. 1 b demonstrates that the N-terminal regions of both TIEG1 and TIEG2 are able to repress transcription by over 95%, whereas the C-terminal regions display no transcriptional regulatory activity. Together, these results demonstrate that the N-terminal regions of the TIEG proteins display functionally conserved transcriptional repression activity. To identify domains utilized by TIEG proteins to regulate transcription, we generated a number of deletion and site-directed mutants as GAL4-TIEG chimeric constructs. The expression and the ability of each of these proteins to bind GAL4 DNA-binding sites was confirmed using gel shift assays as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 2delineate three distinct domains within TIEG2, R1 (aa 24–41), R2 (aa 151–162), and R3 (aa 273–351), that repress reporter activity by at least 75%. R1 and R2 are small peptides (17 and 12 aa, respectively), whereas R3 is a larger domain composed of approximately 80 aa (residues 273–351). Regions outside of the R1, R2, and R3 domains display no transcriptional regulatory activity (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, smaller deletion constructs within R1 (27Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Kojima S. Kobayashi A. Gotoh O. Ohkuma Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. J. Biochem.

Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar), R2 (158–160), and R3 (273–303 and 304–351) display a loss of repression activity, indicating that the domains defined using this analysis represent the minimal functional units necessary for transcriptional repression. To more precisely define the residues responsible for the transcriptional regulatory activity of R1, R2, and R3, we used extensive site-directed mutagenesis. Computer-based modeling studies of the R1 domain using SOPMA software (34Geourjon C. Deleage G. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar) (available on the Internet) predicts that this sequence is capable of forming an α-helical structure. Therefore, we generated sequential mutations along the R1 domain of TIEG2 using the helix-breaking proline residue as a mutagen (Fig.3 a). We then tested each of these mutants for their ability to maintain transcriptional repression. As shown in Fig. 3, mutations within the central core of the R1 domain, corresponding to amino acid residues 30–39 (AVEALVCMSS), resulted in a complete loss of transcriptional regulatory activity, while mutations outside of this core did not abolish repression. Additional results demonstrate that this decapeptide is also sufficient to repress transcription. Therefore, these results define a 10-aa core sequence that is required for the R1 domain to function. Using a similar approach, we characterized the R2 and R3 domains of TIEG2. Mutation of nine of the 12 residues that compose R2 did not significantly influence repression (Fig.4). In contrast, mutations in three consecutive residues, Val, Ile, and Arg (aa 158–160), resulted in a complete loss of repression activity by R2. However, these three residues alone (GAL4-VIR) were not sufficient to repress reporter activity. This result suggests that while the VIR peptide is essential for R2-mediated repression, the remainder of the R2 domain also contributes to its function. The R3 domain of TIEG2 contains two interesting features. First, R3 is relatively proline-rich (20%), a feature that is commonly found in activation and repression domains (35Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 36Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Second, the R3 domain contains a core sequence of approximately 20 aa (aa 311–328) that is highly conserved (67% similar) between TIEG1 and TIEG2 (see Fig. 6). Because of the high proline content of R3, we used serine mutants to characterize this domain (Fig.5 a). Three of these mutants involved changing clusters of proline residues near the beginning (aa 288–290), middle (aa 306–310), or end (aa 332–336) of this domain; an additional mutant changed seven of the central conserved residues (aa 317–323). As shown in Fig. 5 b, all of the proline-to-serine mutants were still able to repress transcription, indicating that these proline residues are not essential for the ability of R3 to repress transcription. In contrast, mutation of the conserved core abolishes the ability of R3 to repress transcription. Interestingly, one of the constructs used to define the R3 domain (304–351, Fig. 2) contains this conserved sequence but is only able to repress transcription by ∼42% versus 77% for the full R3 domain. This result suggests that the central core sequence is necessary but not sufficient for full R3-mediated repression activity.Figure 5Mapping of the residues involved in R3-mediated repression. a, four serine-based mutants were generated in the R3 domain of TIEG2. Mutants 1, 2, and 4 mutate prolines to serines, while mutant 3 changes a core of residues present within a conserved region between TIEG1 and TIEG2 (shaded). These mutant GAL4 DBD chimeric effector plasmids were tested for their ability to regulate transcription (b). Note that mutations in the proline residues do not affect the ability of the R3 domain to repress transcription (1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), while a mutation of the conserved region alleviates transcriptional repression (3Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important feature of the repression domains described above is that they share strong sequence homology between both TIEG proteins (65, 75, and 29% similar for R1, R2, and R3, respectively) (Fig.6 a). In addition, the central core of R3, a region that is required for repression, is 67% similar between TIEG1 and TIEG2. To determine whether these three domains are functionally conserved between the TIEG proteins, we tested the ability of the corresponding regions of TIEG1 to regulate transcription (Fig.6 b). Indeed, the R1, R2, and R3 regions of TIEG1 also repress transcription. Furthermore, the residues that are critical for TIEG2 repression share remarkable similarity (≥80%) between both TIEG proteins (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Interestingly, the data presented in Figs. 2 and6 also suggested that the R1, R2, and R3 domains exhibit different levels of repressor activity. To assess their differential strengths, we compared dose-response curves for R1, R2, and R3 from TIEG2. From these experiments, we find that all three domains display repression activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the R1, R2, and R3 domains exhibit different relative strengths: 92, 84, and 51% repression, respectively, at the highest dose tested. For this comparison, gel shift analysis of each GAL4-TIEG2 chimeric protein was performed to determine equal DNA binding activity (Fig.7 b). Together, these results reveal that the three distinct transcriptional repressor domains are not only structurally conserved but are also functionally conserved within the TIEG subfamily of Sp1-like proteins. Continuing with our studies on the functional characterization of novel members of the Sp1-like family of proteins, in this report we demonstrate that the presence of three conserved transcriptional repression domains is a defining biochemical property of TIEG proteins. Sp1-like proteins are characterized by the presence of three highly related C2H2 zinc finger DNA-binding motifs (1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Currently, at least 14 different members of the Sp1-like family of transcription factors have been shown to regulate promoters containing GC-rich sequences (1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these sequences are present in the promoters of more than 1000 different gene products (2Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 22Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev.

Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Therefore, a detailed analysis of the transcriptional regulatory properties of Sp1-like proteins will be critical for beginning to understand the complexity of gene expression in mammalian cells. Several laboratories are attempting to define distinct subgroups within the growing family of Sp1-like proteins based upon the presence of conserved regions located outside of the zinc finger motif. We and others have recently reported that this classification can help to predict biochemical and functional properties of novel proteins that are being added to this family of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies are providing useful information for understanding whether different members of the Sp1-like family of proteins display distinct or redundant functions. The Sp1-like subgroups that have been identified thus far include the SP (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4), BTEB (BTEB1 and BTEB2), KLF (EKLF, GKLF, and LKLF), CPBP (CPBP, Zf9, and UKLF), and TIEG (TIEG1 and TIEG2) proteins. The SP proteins contain glutamine-rich N-terminal transcriptional activation domains, the BTEB proteins activate transcription through a hydrophobic-rich domain, and the CPBP proteins encode an acidic activation domain (14Koritschoner N.P.

The KLF proteins are defined by the presence of two different types of conserved sequences that act as a nuclear localization signal and a putative proline-rich transcriptional regulatory domain, respectively (8Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M.

As demonstrated in this study, the TIEG proteins are defined by the presence of three conserved sequences that act as transcriptional repressors. Thus, together this information suggests that different subfamilies of Sp1-like proteins have evolved to mediate distinct transcriptional functions. Understanding the structure and function of distinct transcriptional regulatory motifs within transcription factor proteins constitutes an active field of research that has been helpful for understanding the control of gene expression. For instance, several activation domains have been recently identified on the basis of their amino acid compositions, including glutamine-, proline-, serine/threonine-, and acidic residue-rich domains (35Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 38Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Other activation domains, however, have recently been defined that do not fall into these categories, suggesting that a diverse array of domains can activate transcription. Emerging evidence indicates that many activation domains interact with specific co-activator proteins to regulate the basal transcriptional machinery or chromatin structure to increase transcription initiation. For example, the glutamine-rich regions of Sp1 activate transcription by binding to TAFII130 to recruit the RNA polymerase II-associated preinitiation complex to target promoters, while the proline-rich activation domain of EKLF specifically recruits E-RC1, a SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex, to allow transcriptional activation to occur (41Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 42Tanese N. Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Chen J.L. Admon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 43Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, different activation domains can initiate transcription through interactions with distinct co-activator proteins. Although far less understood than transcriptional activation, repression is also crucial for the regulation of gene expression and morphogenesis. Over the past few years, several distinct transcriptional repression domains have been identified in eukaryotic transcription factors (36Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 44Gray S. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Like activation domains, these domains can be loosely classified into families based on amino acid composition. Some repression domains, for example, are charged, hydrophobic, alanine-, or proline-rich, whereas others are unique in amino acid composition. In addition, repression domains can range in size from as little as four amino acids to hundreds of amino acids long. The short peptide sequence WRP(W/Y) found in the Hairy and Runt families of transcriptional repressors, for example, is sufficient to repress transcription through interaction with members of the Groucho family of transcriptional co-repressors (45Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, other repressor proteins, such as the thyroid hormone receptor, require the cooperative use of three large, less well defined, hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions in order to achieve full repressive activity (46Busch K. Martin B. Baniahmad A. Renkawitz R. Muller M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to the WRP(W/Y) motif, the R1, R2, and core of the R3 domain of TIEG1 and TIEG2 are short amino acid sequences necessary for repression and are well conserved among family members. These results suggest a conserved mechanism for regulating transcription for TIEG proteins. It is therefore likely that the conserved repression domains of TIEG1 and TIEG2 are used to contact either one or more co-repressor molecules. Noteworthy, however, is that all three of the repression domains identified in this study represent novel sequences, sharing no specific homology with other regulatory domains. Because of the novelty of these sequences, it is difficult to speculate as to the identity of these co-repressor proteins. Therefore, identification of potential R1, R2, and R3 interacting proteins and the detailed characterization of these interactions will further increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying TIEG-mediated transcriptional repression in mammalian cells. Three novel transcriptional repressor domains are a defining feature of the TIEG subfamily of Sp1-like proteins. The presence of these domains suggest that, in contrast to other Sp1-like proteins, the TIEG subfamily has evolved to silence gene expression in mammalian cells. These results, together with previous studies from other laboratories, are being used to generate a structural and functional classification of the growing family of Sp1-like zinc finger proteins. This classification will be useful for predicting common as well as distinct biochemical and functional properties of members of this family."
https://openalex.org/W2153870676,"Here we describe the isolation and partial characterization of a new muscle-specific protein (Melusin) which interacts with the integrin cytoplasmic domain. The cDNA encoding Melusin was isolated in a two-hybrid screening of a rat neonatal heart library using beta(1)A and beta(1)D integrin cytoplasmic regions as baits. Melusin is a cysteine-rich cytoplasmic protein of 38 kDa, with a stretch of acidic amino acid residues at the extreme carboxyl-terminal end. In addition, putative binding sites for SH3 and SH2 domains are present in the amino-terminal half of the molecule. Chromosomic analysis showed that melusin gene maps at Xq12.1/13 in man and in the synthenic region X band D in mouse. Melusin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles but not in smooth muscles or other tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Melusin is present in a costamere-like pattern consisting of two rows flanking alpha-actinin at Z line. Its expression is up-regulated during in vitro differentiation of the C2C12 murine myogenic cell line, and it is regulated during in vivo skeletal muscle development. A fragment corresponding to the tail region of Melusin interacted strongly and specifically with beta(1) integrin cytoplasmic domain in a two-hybrid test, but the full-length protein did not. Because the tail region of Melusin contains an acidic amino acid stretch resembling high capacity and low affinity calcium binding domains, we tested the possibility that Ca(2+) regulates Melusin-integrin association. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that interaction of full-length Melusin with detergent-solubilized integrin heterodimers occurred only in absence of cations, suggesting that it can be regulated by intracellular signals affecting Ca(2+) concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2051139405,"Synemin is a cytoskeletal protein originally identified as an intermediate filament (IF)-associated protein because of its colocalization and copurification with the IF proteins desmin and vimentin in muscle cells. Our sequencing studies have shown that synemin is an unusually large member (1,604 residues, 182,187 Da) of the IF protein superfamily, with the majority of the molecule consisting of a long C-terminal tail domain. Molecular interaction studies demonstrate that purified synemin interacts with desmin, the major IF protein in mature muscle cells, and with α-actinin, an integral myofibrillar Z-line protein. Furthermore, expressed synemin rod and tail domains interact, respectively, with desmin and α-actinin. Analysis of endogenous protein expression in SW13 clonal lines reveals that synemin is coexpressed and colocalized with vimentin IFs in SW13.C1 vim+ cells but is absent in SW13.C2 vim− cells. Transfection studies indicate that synemin requires the presence of another IF protein, such as vimentin, in order to assemble into IFs. Taken in toto, our results suggest synemin functions as a component of heteropolymeric IFs and plays an important cytoskeletal cross-linking role by linking these IFs to other components of the cytoskeleton. Synemin in striated muscle cells may enable these heterofilaments to help link Z-lines of adjacent myofibrils and, thereby, play an important role in cytoskeletal integrity.

Some classes of IF proteins, such as the type I and II keratins (3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, IFs containing type III proteins, such as desmin or vimentin, often are considered homopolymeric IFs (3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

Recent cloning and sequencing studies in our laboratory, however, demonstrate that both synemin and paranemin contain the ∼310-amino acid rod domain characteristic of IF proteins and, therefore, are members of the IF protein superfamily (25Becker B.

Our hypothesis is that synemin acts as a component of heteropolymeric IFs with vimentin and/or desmin and helps attach these IFs to other cytoskeletal structures. Based upon localization of IFs at the periphery of, and between, Z-lines of adjacent myofibrils (19Granger B.L. Lazarides E.

In this paper, we describe the complete sequence of synemin, which establishes it as a unique IF protein with a long C-terminal extension, which is not readily grouped with any of the well established IF protein types. Transfection of full-length synemin into SW13 clonal lines demonstrates that synemin requires another IF protein for assembly into IFs. We demonstrate specific molecular interactions between synemin and desmin, the major IF protein present in most mature muscle cells (18Bennett G.S. Fellini S.A. Toyama Y. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Granger B.L. Lazarides E. Cell. 1979; 18: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and between the large tail domain of synemin and α-actinin, an integral protein of myofibrillar Z-lines (30Yamaguchi M. Izumimoto M. Robson R.M. Stromer M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 621-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and costameres (31Imanaka-Yoshida K. Danowski B.A. Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In toto, the studies herein help establish synemin as an important member of the IF protein superfamily and one that likely functions as a component of heteropolymeric IFs that can interact with α-actinin and, thereby, enable IFs to link other components of the cytoskeleton. Initial cloning studies on synemin from our laboratory (25Becker B. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) described only sequence of the rod domain portion of synemin. Additional clones encoding parts of the full-length synemin cDNA were retrieved from the same λgt11 library, prepared from adult chicken gizzard, by hybridization screening. Sequencing of the entire length of both strands of clones 47, 108, 135 and 244, and multiple internal sites of all other clones shown in Fig. 1, was done on Applied Biosystems 373 and 377 sequencers at the Iowa State University Sequencing and Synthesis Facility. Confirmation of the 5′ end of the sequence was done by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (33Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) with a kit from Life Technologies, Inc., by using a primer (nucleotides 144–162) from the 5′ end of clone 108. The longest rapid amplification of cDNA ends clones produced start at the same nucleotide as the 244 clone. Computer analysis of the synemin cDNA sequence was carried out by using version 10 of the Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI, and the NCBI BLAST server (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar). Synemin polyclonal antibodies (pAb) 2856 were produced in rabbits injected with native purified protein essentially as described (35Knudson K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The pAbs were characterized by Western blotting, and they labeled only the 230-kDa synemin band present in fresh, avian whole muscle homogenates. Additionally, these antibodies labeled purified samples of both the expressed rod and C-terminal tail domains of synemin. Aliquots of these antibodies also were affinity purified by utilizing a column of purified, intact synemin coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma). Vimentin monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMF-17b (developed by Dr. A. B. Fulton) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Immunocytochemistry studies with SW13.C1 vim+ and SW13.C2 vim− cells were done similarly to those described in Hemkenet al. (26Hemken P.M. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32489-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but utilized synemin pAb 2856. For Western blotting, cell lysates of SW13.C1 vim+ and SW13.C2 vim− cells were separated into supernatant and pellet fractions to concentrate the cytoskeletal proteins in the pellets by the method of Athlan et al. (36Athlan E.S. Sacher M.G. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The resulting samples were analyzed by standard procedures (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44846) Google Scholar), using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and blot stripping according to the manufacturer's procedure described in the ECL Western blotting protocols guidebook (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was prepared from SW13.C1 vim+ and SW13.C2 vim− cells by the standard guanidine isothiocyanate method (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar), and blots were probed with avian cDNA probes corresponding to either the synemin rod or tail domain by using the GeneImages kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The kit instructions were followed, except that the gel transfer was carried out by using 50 mmNaOH as the transfer fluid, and the hybridization and final stringency washes were done at 47 °C. Studies were carried out essentially as described (26Hemken P.M. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32489-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the following changes. Full-length synemin cDNA was assembled from overlapping clones and inserted into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA construct was transfected into SW13.C2 vim− cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), utilizing an empirically determined ratio of 3 μl of transfection reagent to 1 μg of DNA for a 60-mm diameter dish. Proteins were visualized approximately 40 h after transfection by immunocytochemistry. All proteins purified from tissue were prepared from adult turkey gizzards quick frozen immediately postmortem to minimize proteolysis. Synemin, in particular, is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation (27Bilak S.R. Sernett S.W. Bilak M.M. Bellin R.M. Stromer M.H. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intact synemin (27Bilak S.R. Sernett S.W. Bilak M.M. Bellin R.M. Stromer M.H. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1980; 255: 6981-6989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α-actinin (39Craig S.W. Lancashire C.L. Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were purified by standard methods. The rod (nucleotides 138–1047) and tail (nucleotides 1048–4917) domains of synemin were produced by bacterial expression using pProEX HT vectors (Life Technologies, Inc.). The rod domain was expressed inEscherichia coli XL-I Blue (Stratagene) and purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in non-denaturing conditions. The tail domain was expressed in the protease-deficientE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and purified from inclusion bodies by dissolving the pellet fraction resulting from centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min) in 6m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and dialyzing into 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, before nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) chromatography. The interaction of purified intact synemin with purified desmin was tested by using three different sets of conditions as follows: 1) for soluble desmin, desmin and synemin were mixed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5; 2) for filament forming conditions, desmin and synemin were first mixed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and then the mixture was adjusted to IF-forming conditions by titrating the pH to 7.0 with addition of 2m imidazole HCl, pH 6.0, and by addition of MgCl2 and NaCl to 1 and 100 mm, respectively; 3) for pre-formed filaments, desmin by itself was first assembled into filaments in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm imidizole HCl, pH 7.0, and then the desmin filaments and synemin were mixed. For each of the three sets of conditions, an equal amount by weight (25 μg) of purified intact synemin and purified intact desmin were used in each sample. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) was added (10 μg) to each sample as an internal control. High speed centrifugation conditions (100,000 ×g for 20 min), chosen to sediment desmin filaments but not synemin alone, were used to sediment desmin IFs and any associated protein(s). The resulting supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Individual samples of desmin and of synemin, in each of the three sets of conditions, also were subjected to the same high speed centrifugation in order to test their sedimentation behavior in the absence of the other protein. The interaction of the synemin rod domain with desmin, under filament-forming conditions, also was tested as described for intact synemin. Highly purified samples of desmin, α-actinin, and synemin prepared from turkey gizzard, together with a sample of whole gizzard homogenate, were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar), which was then blocked by incubation in IF buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat milk powder. Blots were incubated with purified synemin or with bacterially expressed synemin domains, at 10 μg/ml in IF buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) non-fat milk powder, and then washed thoroughly with several fresh changes of the latter buffer. A control blot was treated identically but incubated with buffer containing no synemin. Protein interactions were detected with affinity purified synemin pAb 2856, diluted 1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk powder, and visualized by ECL. Several overlapping cDNA clones that encompass the complete cDNA sequence for avian muscle synemin were obtained (Fig. 1). The full-length sequence is 8,615 base pairs (GenBankTM accession numberU28143), which corresponds well with the 8.4-kb transcript size we have shown previously by Northern blot analysis of avian smooth muscle RNA with a synemin cDNA probe (25Becker B. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence reveals a single open reading frame followed by a long (3,330 base pairs) 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (Fig. 1). The open reading frame (4,812 base pairs) of the complete sequence codes for a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 182,187 Da. The sequence mass is smaller than that estimated (230 kDa) for synemin by SDS-PAGE (20Granger B.L. Lazarides E. Cell. 1980; 22: 727-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Bilak S.R. Sernett S.W. Bilak M.M. Bellin R.M. Stromer M.H. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This size difference may be explained, as it was for the IF protein paranemin (26Hemken P.M. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32489-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), by the acidic nature (pI = 4.85) of synemin, which has been shown for other proteins to repel SDS and result in a slower relative migration by SDS-PAGE (41Bryan J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 95-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As we reported in a preliminary study (25Becker B. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 2, the synemin sequence contains the conserved, ∼310 amino acid rod domain characteristic of IF proteins. Of the sequences in GenBankTM, this region has the highest sequence identity (∼31 to 33%) with the type III IF proteins desmin, vimentin, peripherin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is much lower than the >70% identity generally observed for IF proteins within the same “type” (3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Thus, synemin can not be classified as a specific type IF protein solely by cDNA sequence comparisons. The rod domain (304 amino acids) of synemin is flanked by a short N-terminal head domain of 10 amino acid residues, and a C-terminal tail domain of 1,290 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). This tail domain is extremely long for an IF protein and lacks significant homology with all other proteins. Other than the homology with the rod domains of other IF proteins, the sequence of synemin shows no significant homology/identity to other known proteins in GenBankTM. There are, however, notable regions of identity with a human EST sequence (gb_est24:AB077476) and with an unidentified human cDNA clone (GenBankTMaccession number AB002351). In order to determine the ability of synemin to assemble into IFs in vivo, the SW13 cell line was utilized. This cell line has been separated into specific clonal lines, including the SW13.C1 vim+, which has an endogenous vimentin IF network, and the SW13.C2 vim−, which lacks any cytoplasmic IFs (42Sarria A.J. Lieber J.G. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1593-1607PubMed Google Scholar). These clonal lines have been used in several studies (e.g. Refs. 26Hemken P.M. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32489-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 43Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2299-2311PubMed Google Scholar) to characterize assembly of transfected IF proteins into IFs in the presence and absence of the cytoplasmic IF protein vimentin. We first characterized the cell line before we used it for the transfection studies. Western blot analysis of lysates of these clonal lines (Fig. 3) showed, as expected, that synemin was absent in the SW13.C2 vim− cells (Fig. 3, panel A, lanes 4 and 5) but, surprisingly, that synemin was already present in the cytoskeletal protein-containing pellet fraction of SW13.C1 vim+ cells (Fig. 3,panel B, lane 3). Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA for synemin (∼9 kb) was present in SW13.C1 vim+ cells but absent in the SW13.C2 vim− cells. Thus, synemin has the same pattern of transcription as previously shown for the mRNA of vimentin in these clonal lines (42Sarria A.J. Lieber J.G. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1593-1607PubMed Google Scholar). Double label immunofluorescence of SW13.C1 vim+ cells, utilizing the same antibodies as for the Western blotting experiments, also show that they express synemin as a component of their vimentin-containing IF network (Fig.4, panels A and B). And, consistent with the Western and Northern blot analyses, immunofluorescence labeling of the SW13.C2 vim− cells, known to lack an endogenous vimentin IF network, with synemin pAbs showed no labeling of synemin (Fig. 4, panels C and D).Figure 4Immunofluorescence localization of synemin and vimentin in SW13 cells.

Note that synemin colocalizes with vimentin in SW13.C1 vim+ cells (panels A and B) but is absent from SW13.C2 vim− cells as is vimentin (panels C and D). Panels Eand F show immunofluorescent labeling of SW13.C2 vim− cells after transfection with full-length synemin cDNA.

Here, we investigate the role of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 in regulating Itk. Whereas Itk was activated in Jurkat T cells in response to CD3 cross-linking, Itk activation was defective in the ZAP-70-deficient P116 Jurkat T cell line. Itk responsiveness to TCR engagement was restored in P116 cells stably transfected with ZAP-70 cDNA. ZAP-70 itself could not directly phosphorylate the Itk kinase domain, indicating an indirect regulation of Itk activity. No role was found for ZAP-70 in regulating Itk recruitment to the plasma membrane, an event that has been suggested to be rate-limiting for the activation of Tec family kinases. Indeed, Itk was found to be constitutively targeted to the membrane fraction in both Jurkat and P116 cells. Lat, a prominent in vivosubstrate of ZAP-70 that mediates assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes at the plasma membrane of T cells was also found to be required for TCR-stimulated Itk activation. Itk could not be activated by CD3 cross-linking in a Lat-negative cell line, unless Lat expression was restored. Lat and Itk were observed to co-associate in response to CD3 cross-linking in Jurkat T cells, but not in P116 T cells. The Lat-Itk association correlated with Lat tyrosine phosphorylation, which was deficient in the P116 T cells.

The most receptor-proximal events initiated upon TCR stimulation are the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src, Syk, and Tec families (1Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev.

TCR signaling is initiated when the Src family PTKs Lck and Fyn phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the CD3 (γ, δ, and ε) and TCRζ subunits of the TCR/CD3 complex (3Iwashima M.

Med. 1996; 183: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The doubly phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs recruit the Syk family PTK ZAP-70 to the TCR via interaction with the tandem Src homology 2 domains of ZAP-70 (5Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recruitment to the TCR is required for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 (6Wange R.L. Isakov N. Burke Jr., T.R. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Watts J.D. Aebersold R.

ZAP-70 lies at a key point in the TCR signaling pathway, being required for the activation of calcium mobilization and Erk activation pathways, which are in turn required for interleukin-2 production and T cell proliferation (7Qian D.

This function is accomplished, in part, by regulating the formation of certain key multimolecular signaling complexes involved in these pathways, by catalyzing the phosphorylation of the hematopoietic-specific proteins SLP-76 and Lat (9Wange R.L.

Both of these proteins have been shown to be in vivo substrates of ZAP-70 (12Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J.

Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Lat, which is primarily resident in the glycolipid-enriched membrane (GEM) fraction of the plasma membrane, recruits PLCγ1, Grb2, and PI3-K to the GEMs (14Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The GEM membrane lipid rafts have been proposed to serve as platforms for signal transduction upon TCR engagement (18Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P.

Localization of PLCγ1 and PI3-K to the GEMs positions these enzymes near their shared substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, which is enriched in the GEM fraction, and may facilitate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1. Grb2/SOS recruitment to the GEMs also serves to position SOS in the vicinity of its substrate, Ras, which is constitutively targeted to the GEMs (20Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The Tec family tyrosine kinases have been implicated in antigen receptor signaling in a variety of hematopoietic cell types. Btk, a Tec family member primarily expressed in B cells and mast cells, is involved in B cell antigen receptor signaling and was found to be defective in the human and murine immunodeficiencies, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and X-linked immunodeficiency, respectively (21Rawlings D.J.

Itk, also known as Emt or Tsk, is expressed in T cells and NK cells (24Siliciano J.D. Morrow T.A. Desiderio S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 834-841PubMed Google Scholar); and has been implicated in thymocyte development and the activation of T cells through TCR and CD28 engagement. Mice engineered with a null mutation within the Itk gene have decreased numbers of mature thymocytes. Furthermore, T cells isolated from these mice are compromised in their proliferative response to allogeneic MHC stimulation, and to anti-TCR/CD3 cross-linking (30Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These T cells also exhibit defective PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation, inositol trisphosphate production, and Ca2+ influx in response to TCR cross-linking (31Liu K.Q. Bunnell S.C. Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). How Itk activity is regulated in response to TCR engagement is still poorly understood. Structural studies have shown that Itk forms intramolecular interactions between its Src homology 3 domain and the proline-rich region of its Tec homology domain, and it has been proposed that these associations may be involved in regulating its activity (32Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Experiments in Jurkat T cells lacking Lck have demonstrated a requirement for Lck in Itk activation in response to TCR engagement (28Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). Lck has also been shown to phosphorylate the critical activation loop tyrosine of Itk in vitro (33Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The activation of Itk by G protein βγ subunits has also been reported (34Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but it remains unclear whether this plays any role in TCR-stimulated Itk activation. Experiments involving overexpression of Itk and c-Src in COS-7 cells demonstrated a requirement for PI3-K in recruiting Itk to the plasma membrane, where it became phosphorylated and activated by c-Src (35August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Likewise, in A20 B cells, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PI3-K was demonstrated to synergize with Btk, Itk, or Tec overexpression in stimulating IP3 production and the rise of [Ca2+]i in response to B cell antigen receptor cross-linking (36Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These latter studies by August et al. (35August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and Scharenberget al. (36Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) are consistent with the recently proposed model that Tec family kinases possessing pleckstrin homology domains (Itk/Tsk/Emt, Btk, and Tec) are regulated by changes in their subcellular localization. This model holds that receptor engagement activates PI3-K, which raises the plasma membrane concentration of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which is a high affinity binding site for the Tec family pleckstrin homology domain (37Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This results in recruitment of Tec family kinases to the plasma membrane, where they are phosphorylated and activated by membrane-resident Src family kinases. Most of the evidence supporting this model has been gathered by study of Btk regulation (36Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J.

Testing this model in Jurkat T cells, we found no evidence for TCR-stimulated Itk recruitment to the plasma membrane. Indeed, Itk was found to be constitutively present in the membrane fraction. In unstimulated Jurkat T cells, Itk could be recovered from both the GEM and bulk membrane fractions, and neither fraction exhibited any change in the Itk level upon TCR stimulation, arguing against redistribution of Itk to the plasma membrane as a mechanism for activation in Jurkat T cells. We also examined the role of ZAP-70 in Itk activation by measuring Itk activation in the ZAP-70-deficient P116 T cell line. We found that ZAP-70 is required for phosphorylation of Itk and activation of its kinase activity. However, ZAP-70 was unable to directly phosphorylate the kinase domain of Itk, suggesting that the role of ZAP-70 in regulating Itk tyrosine phosphorylation and activation is indirect. We also report the TCR-stimulated association of Itk with Lat, which was only observed in ZAP-70 replete cells. This association occurs with the same kinetics as Itk tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, and seems to be required for Itk activation in response to CD3 cross-linking, because OKT3-induced Itk activation was markedly reduced in Lat-deficient JCaM2.5 cells. The ZAP-70 deficient Jurkat T cell line, P116, has been previously described (8Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell.

Samelson, unpublished results. have been described and are the kind gifts of A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and L. Samelson (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The JCaM2.5 cells show intact early signaling events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 chains and tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70, indicating that the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn function normally in these cells (43Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Bayer), and 2 mm glutamine. The OKT3 monoclonal antibody to human CD3 and polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for human ZAP-70 and Lck have been described (6Wange R.L. Isakov N. Burke Jr., T.R. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 944-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for human Itk was used to immunoprecipitate Itk and was kindly provided by G. Mills (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Itk was immunoblotted with the monoclonal antibody 2F12 directed against the N-terminal 26 amino acids of Itk, which was the gift of L. Berg (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). The cytosolic domain of band III protein (cdb3) was prepared as described previously (44Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing the kinase domain of either Itk or Lck were the kind gift of J. Watts and R. Aebersold (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and have been previously described (45Watts J.D. Brabb T. Bures E.J. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once, and resuspended in cold RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. After equilibration to 37 °C for 10 min, the cells were stimulated with OKT3 (1:50 ascites) for the indicated duration. Stimulation was terminated by addition of 5 volumes of 4 °C lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). After a 30-min incubation on ice, postnuclear lysates were prepared by a 10-min centrifugation at 4 °C, 21,000 × g. The lysates were either directly analyzed by Western blotting or subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting or kinase assay. In some experiments, when indicated, a Brij 96 lysis buffer was used (1% Brij 96, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The postnuclear whole-cell lysates were incubated with protein A-agarose beads and corresponding antibodies for 2–16 h at 4 °C. In some of the anti-Itk immunoprecipitations, ZAP-70, Lck, and other TCR-associated proteins were depleted from the lysates by three rounds of OKT3 and/or anti-Lck immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates that were to be analyzed by immunoblotting were washed three times with the above lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Whole-cell lysates and immunoprecipitates to be analyzed by Western blotting were denatured by heating to 100 °C in Nu-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed on either 4–12% Nu-PAGE gradient or 6% Tris-glycine gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane according to manufacturer's instructions (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The blots were developed with the ECL system of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and autoradiographed on BMR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Itk-associated tyrosine kinase activity was assessed by immune complex kinase assay. Anti-Itk immunoprecipitates from lysates depleted of CD3 (and CD3-associated proteins) and Lck were washed twice with lysis buffer + 150 mm NaCl, twice with 4 °C LiCl wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl) and twice with 4 °C dH2O. To each sample of washed beads 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of RR-SRC substrate peptide (Sigma) were added. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 15 min with frequent mixing, then terminated by addition of acetic acid to 30% of the total volume. The reactions were centrifuged briefly and supernatants were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose discs (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4–6 washes with 75 mm phosphoric acid, the 32P incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation. In some assays, the kinase activity was normalized to the relative amount of Itk recovered in the anti-Itk immunoprecipitates. The relative amount of Itk was measured by densitometric analysis of x-ray films using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health). The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× reducing sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. The GST fusion proteins containing the kinase domains of either Itk or Lck were purified from recombinant insect cells as described previously (45Watts J.D. Brabb T. Bures E.J. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Itk-KD was cleaved away from the GST fusion partner by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin, and the GST fragment removed. Several of the preparations of Itk-KD prepared in this manner were found to have low intrinsic kinase activity, although they migrated normally on the gel. One of these low activity preparations was used as a substrate in the assay. The use of cdb3 as a ZAP-70 substrate has been described (6Wange R.L. Isakov N. Burke Jr., T.R. Otaka A. Roller P.P.

The ZAP-70 enzyme used in this assay was immunoprecipitated from activated (3 min at 37 °C with 1:100 OKT3) Jurkat whole-cell lysates that were depleted of Lck by three rounds of preclearing with antiserum recognizing Lck. The Lck enzyme used in the assay was the GST-Lck-KD fusion protein, which has been previously described (45Watts J.D. Brabb T. Bures E.J. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells (2.5 × 107) were centrifuged quickly in cold phosphate-buffered saline after OKT3 stimulation and resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold hypotonic lysis solution (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell suspension sat on ice for 30 min, followed by cellular disruption with 10 passes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was rinsed with cold hypotonic lysis buffer and solubilized in 1.5 ml of the membrane solubilization solution (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. This supernatant was taken as the membrane fraction. Cells (1 × 108) were centrifuged quickly in cold phosphate-buffered saline after OKT3 stimulation. The pellets were then lysed on ice in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in TNEV buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4), with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose made with TNEV buffer. After transfer of the lysate to the centrifuge tube, 2 ml of 30% sucrose in TNEV buffer was overlaid, and then 1 ml of 5% sucrose in TNEV was overlaid. After centrifugation for 17 h at 200,000 × g in a Beckman SW55Ti, 0.4-ml gradient fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, in which the third fraction contained GEMs. To study the importance of ZAP-70 in Itk activation during TCR signaling, the human T cell line Jurkat and its ZAP-70-deficient mutant P116 were stimulated by CD3 cross-linking. As has been shown previously (28Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 33Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and in thetop panel of Fig.1 A, Itk was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon OKT3 stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected within 45 s and returned to basal level by 15 min. In contrast, there was comparatively little increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk in ZAP-70-negative cells receiving the same stimuli. The difference in Itk tyrosine phosphorylation in the two cell lines was not due to differences in Itk recovery, as the immunoprecipitates contained comparable amounts of Itk (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). In the same experiment, we also examined whether or not ZAP-70 could regulate increased Itk kinase activity in response to TCR cross-linking. We compared the Itk kinase activity in both Jurkat and P116 cells, as measured by 32P incorporation into the substrate RR-SRC in an in vitro, immune-complex kinase assay (Fig. 1 B). OKT3 stimulation induced a rapid increase in the kinase activity recovered from Itk immunoprecipitates from Jurkat cells, but not in Itk immunoprecipitates from similarly treated ZAP-70-deficient P116 cells. Equal amounts of Itk were detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Although one group has reported that RR-SRC is not a good substrate for recombinant Itk (33Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), others have reported the peptide to be a suitable substrate (28Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar), and we find RR-SRC to be a good substrate for both immunoprecipitated and recombinant (not shown) Itk. In particular, it is unlikely that the kinase activity measured in this assay is subject to interference from ZAP-70 or Lck, because RR-SRC is not a ZAP-70 substrate under the assay conditions used, and depletion of Lck from the lysates had no effect upon the OKT3-mediated activation of kinase activity recovered in Itk immunoprecipitations (not shown). To test whether the failure of tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent kinase activation of Itk in P116 cells following TCR stimulation is due to the absence of ZAP-70, we examined the phosphorylation and activation of Itk in P.WT18 cells. This stable transfectant of P116 has been characterized previously, and expresses ZAP-70 at levels comparable to those observed in Jurkat (Fig.2 B, top panel, and Refs. 41Griffith C.E. Zhang W.

https://openalex.org/W2014790415,"Recent evidence suggests the expression of a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) in vascular endothelial cells. To elucidate the functional role of endothelial NCX, we studied Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+)-dependent activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at normal, physiological Na(+) gradients and after loading of endothelial cells with Na(+) ions using the ionophore monensin. Monensin-induced Na(+) loading markedly reduced Ca(2+) entry and, thus, steady-state levels of intracellular free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in thapsigargin-stimulated endothelial cells due to membrane depolarization. Despite this reduction of overall [Ca(2+)](i), Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS was facilitated as indicated by a pronounced leftward shift of the Ca(2+) concentration response curve in monensin-treated cells. This facilitation of Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS was strictly dependent on the presence of Na(+) ions during treatment of the cells with monensin. Na(+)-induced facilitation of eNOS activation was not due to a direct effect of Na(+) ions on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the enzyme. Moreover, the effect of Na(+) was not related to Na(+) entry-induced membrane depolarization or suppression of Ca(2+) entry, since neither elevation of extracellular K(+) nor the Ca(2+) entry blocker 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazol e hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) mimicked the effects of Na(+) loading. The effects of monensin were completely blocked by 3', 4'-dichlorobenzamil, a potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, whereas the structural analog amiloride, which barely affects Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, was ineffective. Consistent with a pivotal role of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange in Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS, an NCX protein was detected in caveolin-rich membrane fractions containing both eNOS and caveolin-1. These results demonstrate for the first time a crucial role of cellular Na(+) gradients in regulation of eNOS activity and suggest that a tight functional interaction between endothelial NCX and eNOS may take place in caveolae."

H19 andIGF2 are oppositely imprinted with only the maternal and the paternal alleles expressed, respectively. In Wilms tumor, a childhood renal neoplasm, loss of the H19/IGF2imprinted expression pattern results in silencing of H19and biallelic expression of IGF2. This was shown to be associated with biallelic methylation of the H19 promoter in the tumor and the adjacent kidney tissue suggesting that epigeneticH19 silencing is an early event in Wilms tumorigenesis. An imprinting mark region characterized by paternal allele-specific methylation has been suggested to reside in a GC-rich region of 400-base pair direct repeats starting at −2 kilobase pairs (kb) relative to the H19 transcription start and extending upstream. The upstream boundary of the potential paternal methylation imprint of the H19 gene has yet to be defined. We sought to define this upstream imprint boundary and investigate whether Wilms tumors with loss of imprinting are biallelically methylated in this imprinting mark region. The analysis of 6.6 kb of new upstreamH19 sequence determined in this study identified a series of the direct 400-base pair repeats that extends to approximately −5.3 kb relative to the transcription start. DNA methylation analyses indicated that the upstream boundary of the potential imprint may coincide with the 5′ end of the direct repeats. We found that Wilms tumors with loss of imprinting are biallelically methylated in theH19 upstream repeat region, and we suggest that pathological methylation in this region is the epigenetic error that initiates H19 silencing.

The molecular mechanisms that determine the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes are to date not fully understood. However, it is a widely accepted concept that parental allele-specific DNA methylation plays an important role in the process. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19genes are located in a cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 11p15.5 that is syntenic with the mouse distal chromosome 7. The maternally imprinted IGF2 gene is transcribed only from the paternal allele in most normal human tissues except for adult liver, choroid plexus, and leptomeninges (1Ohlsson R. Nystrom A.

Ekstrom T.J. Development. 1994; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, theH19 gene is paternally imprinted hence maternally transcribed (3Bartolomei M.S. Zemel S. Tilghman S.M.

Schneider T. de Groot N. Hochberg A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This reciprocal expression pattern is frequently lost in Wilms tumor, a childhood renal neoplasm, and in the overgrowth syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, that predisposes to Wilms tumor either by maternal loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 11p15 or by loss of imprinting (LOI)1(6Weksberg R. Shen D.R. Fei Y.L. Song Q.L. Squire J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). LOI of IGF2 in Wilms tumor was first described by Rainier et al. (7Rainier S. Johnson L.A. Dobry C.J. Ping A.J. Grundy P.E. Feinberg A.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar)and Ogawa et al. (8Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Since then several groups have shown that LOI of IGF2 in Wilms tumor and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with transcriptional repression and hypermethylation of the maternalH19 allele (9Steenman M.J.

These findings led to the hypothesis that early in embryonal development the maternal allele ofH19 becomes silenced by DNA methylation which then relaxes maternal IGF2 silencing in cis thereby conferring a growth advantage to the affected cell. Strong evidence supporting this idea came from mouse studies in which biallelicIgf2 expression was observed following maternal transmission of deletions at the H19 locus (15Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 16Ripoche M.A. Kress C. Poirier F. Dandolo L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). More recently Cui et al. (17Cui H. Hedborg F. He L. Nordenskjold A. Sandstedt B. Pfeifer-Ohlsson S. Ohlsson R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that loss ofH19 expression occurs frequently in Wilms tumors and their precursor lesions irrespective of whether or not IGF2 is mono- or biallelically expressed. At present, it is therefore not clear whether loss of H19 and gain of IGF2 expression from the maternal allele in Wilms tumors are independent processes or not. Differential DNA methylation of particular sites or regions is thought to provide an epigenetic or imprinting mark that distinguishes the parental alleles of imprinted genes (18Surani M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 309-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). DNA methylation analyses of the mouse H19 gene have identified a region of paternal allele-specific methylation that is maintained throughout murine development and may therefore function as an imprinting mark (19Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 20Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A genomic deletion of 1.6 kb within this region has been shown to abrogate allele-specific H19 and Igf2expression highlighting the importance of this region inH19/Igf2 imprinting control (21Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The human H19 gene and its 5′-flanking region are also methylated on the silent paternal allele, whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated (22Zhang Y. Shields T. Crenshaw T. Hao Y. Moulton T. Tycko B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 113-124PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jinno Y. Sengoku K. Nakao M. Tamate K. Miyamoto T. Matsuzaka T. Sutcliffe J.S. Anan T. Takuma N. Nishiwaki K. Ikeda Y. Ishimaru T. Ishikawa M. Niikawa N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A candidate region for a paternal methylation imprint of the human H19 gene has been proposed that contains several unique 400-bp direct repeat sequences starting at −2 kb and extending further upstream (23Jinno Y. Sengoku K. Nakao M. Tamate K. Miyamoto T. Matsuzaka T. Sutcliffe J.S. Anan T. Takuma N. Nishiwaki K. Ikeda Y. Ishimaru T. Ishikawa M. Niikawa N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A number of HpaII and HhaI sites in this region were shown to be methylated in sperm and on the paternal alleles in somatic cells, and this methylation was found to be preserved in pooled 8–32 cell stage embryos. An evolutionary conserved sequence within these potential imprinting mark regions of mouse and human which may be involved in the control of H19 and IGF2 imprinting was recently identified in our laboratory (24Frevel M.A. Hornberg J.J. Reeve A.E. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 216-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous investigations of H19 methylation in Wilms tumor examined only the promoter, gene body, and 3′ flank of H19, thereby solely relying on the usage of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. The potential imprinting mark region has not yet been investigated in Wilms tumors. In the present study we have therefore analyzed H19 methylation in Wilms tumors at several new upstream locations including the imprinting mark and the promoter region using Southern blotting and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Our analysis delineated the upstream boundary of the imprinting mark to approximately −5.3 kb. The bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis revealed highly variable methylation patterns in the H19 promoter region in Wilms tumors and adjacent kidneys regardless of their imprinting status. In contrast, the potential imprinting mark region showed very consistent paternal specific methylation. Wilms tumors with LOI were hypermethylated at the imprinting mark region consistent with the hypothesis that an epigenetic error in this region may initiate H19silencing. The upstream H19 sequence used in this study is available from GenBankTM accession numberAF125183. The Wilms tumors used in this study were previously typed in our laboratory for 11p15 LOH using polymorphic markers in the H19/IGF2 region. In non-LOH cases mono- or biallelic expression of IGF2 was determined as described (8Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Digests were performed withRsaI (8 units/μg), MspI (10 units/μg), andHpaII (13 units/μg). Southern blots contained 6 μg of DNA per lane. Hybridization was at 65 °C for 16 h. Probes were obtained from plasmid clones containing H19 5′ sequence by restriction digest and purification of the appropriate size fragment. To control for incomplete HpaII digestion, the Southern blots were hybridized with a probe for mitochondrial DNA. All samples showed a single HpaII fragment indicating complete digestion (data not shown). Prior to bisulfite treatment 4 μg of genomic DNA were digested for 16 h at 37 °C withPstI (40 units) or with PstI (40 units) andHpaII (40 units) in combination. The digested DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 40 μl of H2O. The bisulfite treatment was carried out as described by Clark et al. (25Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar) with the following alterations. The bisulfite reaction under mineral oil was performed at 60 °C for 16 h in 525 μl of total volume containing 2.4 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) and 123 mm hydroquinone (Sigma). Reactions were desalted using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted in 50 μl of H2O, incubated with 5 μl of 3 mNaOH for 15 min at 37 °C, neutralized with ammonium acetate (final concentration of 3 m), and ethanol-precipitated. The bisulfite-treated DNA was then resuspended in 50 μl of H2O and stored at −20 °C. To obtain the PCR products bis1 and bis2, nested PCRs were performed using 5 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA in the first amplification (25 μl total volume) and 5 μl of this PCR product as template in the second amplification (50 μl total volume). All reactions contained 0.6 μm primers, 0.2 mmdNTPs, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PWO DNA polymerase (1 units) was added during the second amplification to obtain blunt-ended product for DNA cloning. The following primer pairs were used under the given conditions. For bis1, outer primers 1133 (5′-TGATGGTGGTAGGAAGGGGTTTTTTGTGTT) and 1134 (5′-CTCCTCCAACACCCCATCTTCCCCTAATTA), 0.75 mmMgCl2, 57 °C annealing temperature (AT); inner primers 1143 (5′-GGTATGGTGTTTTTTGAGGGGAGAT) and 1144 (5′-CATCCCACCCCCTCCCTCACCCTA), 1 mm MgCl2, 53 °C AT. For bis2, outer primers 1093 (5′-GAGATGAGAGGAGATATTTGGGGGATAGTGAAG) and 1099 (5′-CCAAACATTATAAAAAAAACTAACACAAAATCC); inner primers 1096 (5′-GTAGGGTTTTTGGTAGGTATAGAG) and 1091 (5′-CACTAAAAAAACAATTATCAATTC), both pairs at 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 °C AT. The PCRs were performed on a Peltier Thermal Cycler-200 (MJ Research) using the following programs: first round of amplification: 1 time at 95 °C for 13 min, 5 times at 94 °C for 1 min, AT for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and 25 times at 94 °C for 30 s, AT for 2 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 1 time 72 °C for 6 min; second round of amplification: 1 time at 95 °C for 13 min, 5 times at 94 °C for 1 min, AT for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, 18 times at 94 °C for 30 s, AT for 2 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, hold on 4 °C to add 1 unit of PWO DNA Polymerase to every reaction, 10 times at 95 °C for 30 s, AT for 2 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 1 times 72 °C for 6 min. The PCR products bis1 and bis2 obtained from the second round of amplification were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified fragments were cloned into the EcoRV site of the pBluescript SK− vector. Ligations were for 12 h at 16 °C and contained circular pBluescript:insert at a molar ratio of 12:1, 200 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), 20 units ofEcoRV, and ligation buffer (New England Biolabs) in 10 μl total volume. Plasmid clones were sequenced with the T3 primer using the ABI sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). The previous analysis of 3.4 kb of H19 upstream sequence by Jinno et al. (23Jinno Y. Sengoku K. Nakao M. Tamate K. Miyamoto T. Matsuzaka T. Sutcliffe J.S. Anan T. Takuma N. Nishiwaki K. Ikeda Y. Ishimaru T. Ishikawa M. Niikawa N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) identified a 400-bp direct repeat that is reiterated 3.5 times. These repeats were suggested to harbor the paternal methylation imprinting mark of the human H19 gene. To determine the extent of this repeat motif, we obtained an additional 6.6 kb of sequence 5′ of H19 (Fig. 1, GenBankTM accession number AF125183). The subsequent analysis of the resulting 10 kb of 5′ H19 sequence identified two repeat units (1 and 2) that each consist of anH19 proximal 450-bp direct repeat (A1 and A2) followed by several 400-bp repeats (B1–7), two of which are incomplete (B4 and B7). Repeat Unit 2 extends to −5.3 kb upstream of the H19transcription start and is separated from Repeat Unit 1 by 387 bp of unique sequence. The 450-bp motifs A1 and A2 are 85.4% identical. The 400-bp motifs B1, B2, and B3 of Repeat Unit 1 as well as B5 and B6 of Repeat Unit 2 show a remarkable 85–91% identity to each other. Further upstream we found two complete Alu elements, one incomplete retroviral long terminal repeat, four MLT1 elements, and a 29-bp GC-rich repeat. If an epigenetic error was the cause of H19silencing in Wilms tumor, then this error would most likely occur in the potential imprinting mark region that controls the establishment of imprinted H19 expression. The maternal hypermethylation found at the H19 promoter and sequences further downstream might then be a secondary event that occurs after the maternal allele has acquired a paternal epigenotype at the imprinting mark. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the allele-specific methylation in the respective H19upstream regions. We examined pairs of tumor and corresponding normal kidney tissue samples from Wilms tumor patients that have retention ofIGF2 imprinting (ROI), loss of IGF2 imprinting or maternal loss of chromosome 11p15.5 (LOH) in the tumor tissue, and a sperm DNA sample from a healthy donor. The bisulfite genomic sequencing method (26Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) was used to analyze a 327-bp fragment (bis1) in theH19 promoter region and a second fragment (bis2) of 504 bp located within the potential imprinting mark region (Fig. 1). Polymorphisms were identified within both fragments, which allowed us to distinguish between maternal and paternal alleles in heterozygous samples. A second objective of this study was to find the upstream boundary of differential H19 methylation. To do this Southern blots ofRsaI/HpaII double-digested Wilms tumor, corresponding kidney, and sperm DNA were hybridized to the four 5′H19 probes indicated in Fig. 1. Regions of differential methylation were identified in this analysis by comparing the intensity ratio of a larger RsaI fragment (derived from methylated paternal alleles) to a smaller HpaII fragment (derived from unmethylated maternal alleles) in kidney tissue and ROI Wilms tumor samples. Wilms tumors with maternal 11p15 LOH showed only the paternal methylation pattern, whereas LOI Wilms tumors with hypermethylation of the 5′ H19 region displayed a shift in signal intensity toward the larger RsaI fragment that was proportional to the number of cells in the sample that are methylated at the addressedHpaII sites on the maternal alleles. The methylation data obtained in the Southern blotting analysis have been summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of H19 methylation analysis in Wilms tumor, adjacent kidney, and sperm4aSignal intensities on Southern blots were also quantified by densitometry to calculate a Methylation Index (MI) for each sample and probe.

Southern blots were hybridized with probe 1 to determine the methylation status of HpaII sites 43 and 44 (H43and H44 in Fig. 1) in the promoter region (blotsin Fig. 2 and the legend in Table I). TheRsaI/HpaII-digested samples showed three prominent fragments (indicated R7-R8, R7-H46, andH43-H44 in Fig. 2, a and b). Fragments R7-R8 and R7-H46 corresponding in size to the respective restriction digest fragments (Fig. 1) were of paternal origin since they appeared in all tumor and kidney samples including the LOH cases. This indicated that HpaII site 46 (H46) was paternally unmethylated in a high proportion of cells in Wilms tumors and in kidneys regardless of the IGF2/H19 imprinting status. We can therefore conclude that H46 does not show strict paternal-specific methylation. The five ROI Wilms tumors and the corresponding normal kidney tissues showed the expected 1:1 ratio of the maternal fragment H43-H44 (Fig.2 a) compared with the paternal fragments R7-R8 and R7-H46. In contrast, four of six LOH Wilms tumors lacked the HpaII fragment indicating that the paternal alleles were methylated at sites H43 and H44 (Fig. 2, a and b) in agreement with previous reports (9Steenman M.J. Rainier S. Dobry C.J. Grundy P. Horon I.L. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Okamoto K. Morison I.M. Taniguchi T. Reeve A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5367-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, LOH Wilms tumors 47 and 55 displayed weak HpaII fragments (Fig. 2 b) indicating that the paternal alleles were unmethylated at H43 and H44 in a minor proportion of cells in these tumors. This was unlikely to be caused by contaminating normal tissue considering the high purity of the tumors. The LOI Wilms tumors were hypermethylated to different extents in the promoter region (Fig. 2 b). HpaII fragments were absent in LOI cases 30, 31, and 65, hence both parental alleles were fully methylated (except H46 as described above) (Fig. 2 b). The corresponding kidneys also contained a high proportion of hypermethylated maternal alleles implied by the stronger intensity of fragments R7-R8 and R7-H46 compared with H43-H44 (Fig. 2 b). Hypermethylation in the adjacent kidney tissue of LOI Wilms tumors has previously been shown and has led to the conclusion that epigenetic changes at the H19 locus are an early event in Wilms tumorigenesis (14Okamoto K. Morison I.M. Taniguchi T. Reeve A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5367-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The LOI Wilms tumors 43 and 49, however, were hypermethylated to a lesser extent at H43 and H44 indicated by the presence of HpaII fragments of different intensities (Fig.2 b). Sperm DNA (Fig. 2 a) was unmethylated at both sites consistent with previous reports (9Steenman M.J. Rainier S. Dobry C.J. Grundy P. Horon I.L. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis of the 12 CpGs closest to the H19 transcription start (bis1,Fig. 1) gave detailed methylation patterns from single clones of paternal and maternal alleles (Fig. 3). Sperm DNA was unmethylated at nearly all 12 CpGs concordant with the Southern blotting results for H43 and H44. The predominant observation for all Wilms tumors and kidneys examined was the variability of methylation patterns in the H19promoter. Although paternal alleles were significantly more methylated than maternal alleles, none of the 12 CpGs examined was found to be consistently methylated on all paternal or unmethylated on all maternal alleles. The extent to which the paternal alleles were methylated varied from 1/12 to 12/12 CpGs. Equally surprising were the maternal methylation patterns in that the presumably normal maternal alleles of normal kidneys and ROI Wilms tumors that were expected to be fully unmethylated also harbored methylation. This was particularly obvious for heterozygous ROI Wilms tumor and kidney 110 that contained up to 7 methylated CpGs on a single maternal allele. LOI Wilms tumors 30, 31, and 43 showed hypermethylation of the maternal alleles consistent with previous methylation analyses atHpaII sites. The corresponding kidneys also contained hypermethylated maternal alleles consistent with a previous study from our laboratory (14Okamoto K. Morison I.M. Taniguchi T. Reeve A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5367-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the extent and distribution of methylation on the paternal and maternal alleles was strikingly variabl"

We recently isolated the first epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor (ESE-1). Here we describe the characterization of ESE-2, a second epithelium-restricted ESE-1-related Ets factor. Like ESE-1, ESE-2 is induced during keratinocyte differentiation. However, whereas ESE-1 is expressed in the majority of epithelial cell types, ESE-2 expression is restricted to differentiated keratinocytes and glandular epithelium such as salivary gland, prostate, mammary gland, and kidney. In contrast to ESE-1, full-length ESE-2 binds poorly to DNA due to the presence of a negative regulatory domain at the amino terminus. Furthermore, although ESE-1 and the amino-terminally deleted ESE-2 bind with similar affinity to the canonical E74 Ets site, ESE-2 and ESE-1 differ strikingly in their relative affinity toward binding sites in the c-MET and PSMA promoters. Similarly, ESE-1 and ESE-2 drastically differ in their ability to transactivate epithelium-specific promoters. Thus, ESE-2, but not ESE-1, transactivates the parotid gland-specific PSP promoter and the prostate-specific PSA promoter. In contrast, ESE-1 transactivates the keratinocyte-specific SPRR2A promoter Ets site and the prostate-specific PSMA promoter significantly better than ESE-2.

Our results demonstrate the existence of a unique class of related epithelium-specific Ets factors with distinct functions in epithelial cell gene regulation. Normal epithelial cell development, proliferation, and differentiation are induced by mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and involve cell-cell interactions, extracellular matrix, and soluble growth and differentiation factors. These interactions trigger the activation or expression of a distinct set of transcription factors leading to a specific pattern of gene expression along a tightly controlled pathway. Abnormalities in this process due to deregulated gene expression can lead to the development of benign adenomas or malignant carcinomas that make up the majority of solid tumors. In order to understand tumor development, it is therefore critical to understand normal epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. Whereas rapid progress in understanding immune system development and gene regulation has led to the discovery and characterization of a whole set of genes involved in leukemia and lymphoma development, relatively little is known about epithelial cell differentiation and organ development and the mechanisms involved in solid tumor formation. Most of the genes involved in chromosomal translocations in leukemias and lymphomas encode transcription factors that under normal physiological conditions coordinate the correct spatial and temporal expression of genes (1Look A.T. Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). We therefore postulate that similar mechanisms of oncogenesis play a role in epithelium-derived tumors as well. It is thus surprising that many aspects of epithelium-specific gene expression have not been explored in detail up to now, and very few distinctly epithelium-specific transcription factors have been identified.

Most other tissues containing epithelial cells including, among others, prostate, mammary gland, liver, kidney, pancreas, and skin also express high levels of ESE-1, suggesting that ESE-1 is expressed in both simple and stratified epithelium. Expression of ESE-1 is differentially regulated during differentiation of various epithelial cells. Thus, undifferentiated keratinocytes both in vitroand in vivo express very little ESE-1; however, expression of ESE-1 can be induced in cultured keratinocytes that are induced to differentiate in the presence of calcium (4Andreoli J.M.

ESE-1 appears to play a similarly important role during mammary gland and prostate development. ESE-1 is expressed in the pregnant mammary gland, but expression is extinguished during lactation and reappears during involution, suggesting that ESE-1 is involved in remodeling of the mammary gland (30Neve R.

We report here the identification and characterization of a second ESE-1-related epithelium-specific Ets factor, ESE-2, with an even more restricted expression pattern than ESE-1. We demonstrate that ESE-2 is functionally distinct from ESE-1 in terms of both its DNA binding specificity and transactivation of epithelium-specific promoters, indicating that a unique set of related Ets factors might play critical but distinct roles in epithelial cell gene regulation and differentiation. CV-1 (green monkey kidney), A431 (human vulvar carcinoma), HaCAT (keratinocyte line), A549 (lung carcinoma), C-33A (human cervical carcinoma), U-937 (human monocytic), NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblasts), HUVEC (human endothelial), A-20 (murine mature B), EL-4 (murine T), and HeLa cells were grown as described (31Libermann T.A.

HSG (human submandibular ductal epithelium) and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Raji (human B) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. LNCaP (human prostate cancer) cells were grown in T-medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. To search for novel members of the Ets family, a human EST cDNA data base was searched for sequences homologous to known Ets members as described (13Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C.

The translated amino acid sequence of one 0.4-kb cDNA clone from a human colon carcinoma cDNA library demonstrated significant protein sequence homology to the Pointed domain shared by other Ets factors including Fli-1, ESE-1, and Tel. The 0.4-kb cDNA clone contained an open reading frame throughout, suggesting that part of the 5′- and 3′-end were missing. To determine the 5′- and 3′-end of ESE-2, we used the RACE method using human adult prostate cDNA ready for 5′-RACE (CLONTECH) and nested primers specific for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the partial ESE-2 cDNA as described (13Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

The sequence of the ESE-2 cDNAs was confirmed by repeating amplification using primers specific for both ends of the longest RACE products obtained in the first two rounds of PCR amplification. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated as described by Libermann et al. (32Libermann T.A. Friesel R. Jaye M. Lyall R.M. Westermark B. Drohan W. Schmidt A. Maciag T. Schlessinger J.

Northern blots and dot blots containing poly(A)+-selected mRNA derived from different human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with random prime-labeled ESE-2, ESE-1, and GAPDH cDNA in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) as described (13Oettgen P.

Each PCR used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, a 4 ng/μl concentration of each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), a 150 μm concentration of each dNTP, 3 mm of MgCl2, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl and were covered with mineral oil. The sequences of the ESE-2 primers were as 5′-CTGCCTTCTCTTGCCTTGAAAGCC-3′ (sense) and 3′-ATTGAAAGTACAGGTACTCGCCGC-3′ (antisense) with an expected size of 400 bp. The sequences of the ESE-1 primers were 5′-CTGAGCAAAGAGTACTGGGACTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCATAGTTGGGCCACAGCCTCGGAGC-3′ (antisense) with an expected amplification product of 188 bp. The sequences of the primers for ELF-1 were 5′-ATGGCTGCTGTTGTCCAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′CCTGAGTGCTCTCCCCAT-3′ (antisense) with an expected amplification product of 800 bp. The sequences of the primers for GAPDH were 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ (antisense) with an expected amplification product of 200 bp. The sequences of the primers for the ESE-2a- and ESE-2b-specific isoforms were 5′-GCCTCTGATTTGTGTGACACTGA-3′ (ESE-2a sense), 5′-TGGACCTAGCCACCGCTGCC-3′ (ESE-2b sense), and 5′-GGACTGATGTCCAGTATGA-3′ (ESE-2a and -2b antisense) with expected amplification products of 318 and 180 bp for ESE-2a and ESE-2b, respectively. RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler 480 as follows: 20–30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 15 min at 72 °C. Lower numbers of cycles were used to verify linearity of the amplification signal. 10 μl of the amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Full-length ESE-2a cDNA encoding the whole open reading frame was inserted downstream of the T7 promoter into the pCRII TA cloning vector (InVitrogen). The ESE-2a Δ42 deletion mutant was generated by fusing aScaI–SalI fragment of ESE-2a that deletes the amino-terminal 42 amino acids in frame with an optimized ATG translation initiation site into the SmaI–SalI site of the pBS/ATG vector downstream of the T7 promoter. The pBS/ATG vector had been generated by inserting the followingXbaI–BamHI-flanked double-stranded initiation codon oligonucleotide encoding an optimal ATG translation initiation site downstream of the β-globin UTR into theXbaI-BamHI sites of pBS KS+. 5′­CTAGATTGCAGAAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAACTTTGGCAGATCTACCATG¯GG­3′3′­TAACGTCTTCGAGTCTTATTTGCGAGTTGAAACCGTCTAGATGGTACCCCTAG­5′ SEQUENCE1 Coupled in vitro transcription/in vitrotranslation reactions were performed (Promega) as described (12Lopez M.

Because previous work has shown a fertilization-dependent association between the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of phospholipase Cγ and a Src family kinase, we examined whether a Src family kinase was required for Ca2+ release at fertilization. To inhibit the function of kinases in this family, we injected starfish eggs with the SH2 domains of Src and Fyn kinases. This inhibited Ca2+ release in response to fertilization but not in response to injection of IP3. We further established the specificity of the inhibition by showing that the SH2 domains of several other tyrosine kinases (Abl, Syk, and ZAP-70), and the SH3 domain of Src, were not inhibitory. Also, a point-mutated Src SH2 domain, which has reduced affinity for phosphotyrosine, was a correspondingly less effective inhibitor of fertilization-induced Ca2+ release. These results indicate that a Src family kinase, by way of its SH2 domain, links sperm-egg interaction to IP3-mediated Ca2+ release at fertilization in starfish eggs.

In echinoderm eggs, the IP3 is produced by phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), as indicated by the inhibition of Ca2+ release by microinjection of the PLCγ Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (7Carroll D.J.

Because PLCγ is activated by phosphorylation that occurs when its SH2 domains interact with a specific binding site on a tyrosine kinase (9Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), a tyrosine kinase is a likely upstream regulator. Consistently, tyrosine kinase activity in sea urchin eggs increases by 15 s post-insemination (10Ciapa B. Epel D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein delays Ca2+ release at fertilization (11Shen S.S. Kinsey W.H. Lee S.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In starfish eggs, an increase in tyrosine kinase activity associating with PLCγ SH2 domains in vitro occurs by 15 s post-insemination (12Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Src family is among the several tyrosine kinase families thought to participate in activation of PLCγ, based on studies using cells from mice deficient in the Src family kinase Fyn (13Melford S.K.

Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Evidence that a Src family kinase might activate PLCγ at fertilization is provided by the finding that a Src family protein in starfish eggs associates with PLCγ SH2 domains in vitro by 15 s post-insemination (12Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Progress in understanding the cellular functions of Src family kinases has been limited by the lack of convincingly specific inhibitors. However, it was recently shown that serum stimulation of cell division in fibroblasts was partially inhibited by injection of recombinant SH2 domains of Fyn (18Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Injection of SH2 domains of three unrelated enzymes had no effect, indicating that SH2 domain injection is likely to be a specific way to inhibit Src family kinases. In the present study, we establish the specificity of the inhibitory action of Src family kinase SH2 domains and use them to demonstrate a requirement for this kinase family in initiating Ca2+ release at fertilization in starfish eggs. GST fusion proteins of SH2 domains from various tyrosine kinases were synthesized in bacteria as described previously (7Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the indicated amino acids was obtained as follows. For wild-type chicken cSrc SH2, amino acids 148–246 were amplified from a full-length cSrc cDNA (provided by S. A. Courtneidge, Sugen, Inc., Redwood City, CA) using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotides that introduced the restriction sitesBamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′). Amplification products were then cloned in-frame into pGEX2. For the chicken c-Src SH2 R175K mutant, arginine 175 of the SH2 domain was mutated to lysine by primer-mediated mutagenesis using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Chicken cSrc SH3 (amino acids 82–167) and chicken Fyn SH2 (amino acids 148–251) were provided by K. Vuori (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Murine cAbl SH2 (amino acids 120–220) was from B. J. Mayer (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA); human ZAP-70 SH2 (two tandem SH2 domains, amino acids 1–263) was from L. E. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); and rat Syk SH2 (two tandem SH2 domains, amino acids 1–269) was from R. P. Siraganian (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Sequences of all DNA constructs were confirmed by double-strand cycle sequencing by the Iowa State sequencing facility (Ames, IA). Experiments were performed as described previously (7Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using oocytes and sperm from the starfishAsterina miniata. To measure calcium, the oocytes were injected with calcium green 10-kDa dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). See Ref. 38Kiehart D.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for a description of procedures used for quantitative injection. Calcium green fluorescence was measured with a photodiode (71182; Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT) or imaged with a confocal microscope (MRC600; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). SH2 domain GST fusion proteins were mixed with calcium green dextran, and oocytes were injected with 90 picoliters (3% of their 3100-picoliter volume) to give the indicated cytoplasmic protein concentrations and 10 μm calcium green. 1–5 min later, the oocytes were treated with 1 μm 1-methyladenine to induce meiotic maturation. 50–75 min after injection, when the eggs were at first metaphase, they were inseminated with a 1:20,000 dilution of the sperm suspension from the testis. All experiments were performed at 18 °C. In other experiments (not shown), injections of the Src SH2 protein were made after oocyte maturation, 10–30 min before insemination, with similar results to those shown in Table I.Table ICalcium release in starfish eggs injected with SH2 domainsInjectionDelayPeak amplitude (% increase over unfertilized egg)No. of eggssCalcium green dextran8 ± 1117 ± 317Src SH2, 1 mg/ml200 ± 54*35 ± 4*21Src SH2, 0.1 mg/ml21 ± 1*76 ± 8*5Src SH2 R175K, 1 mg/ml30 ± 2*52 ± 4*12Src SH3, 1 mg/ml8 ± 1107 ± 45Fyn SH2, 1 mg/ml397 ± 182*33 ± 11*4Fyn SH2, 0.1 mg/ml42 ± 18*85 ± 6*3Abl SH2, 1 mg/ml8 ± 1114 ± 45Syk SH2, 1 mg/ml7 ± 1136 ± 95ZAP SH2, 1 mg/ml7 ± 1124 ± 46Values for delay indicate the time between the rise of the action potential and the time at which the fluorescence versus time trace started its second rise.

GST fusion proteins comprising the SH2 domains of chicken Src and other vertebrate tyrosine kinases (Fig.1) were injected into starfish eggs, and fertilization-induced Ca2+ release was monitored using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, calcium green dextran. Fertilization of eggs injected with calcium green dextran alone or with control proteins resulted in a small transient Ca2+ rise around the cell cortex, because of the opening of voltage-dependent plasma membrane Ca2+ channels at the time of sperm-egg fusion (Figs.2 A and3 A; see Ref. 19McCulloh D.H. Chambers E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 137-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ action potential was followed ∼8 s later by a much larger rise in Ca2+ , which propagated across the egg in a wave, as a result of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the egg's endoplasmic reticulum (Figs. 2 A and3 A, Table I; see Ref. 7Carroll D.J.

Increasing Ca2+ is displayed in pseudocolor:green < yellow < red. The second image in each sequence shows the Ca2+ action potential, which appears as a red rim at the egg surface.Scale bar = 100 μm. In A, the action potential is followed immediately by a propagating wave of Ca2+ release. In B, the action potential is followed by a return to baseline Ca2+ ; 160 s later, Ca2+ rises slightly, as indicated by the red color at the upper right. Small rises in Ca2+ are also seen in subsequent images. Quicktime movies corresponding to these still images show Ca2+ release in control and Src SH2-injected eggs at 30× real time. Each movie is composed of confocal images taken at 5-s intervals (played back at 6 frames/s). For the control, the total duration is 2 min; for SrcSH2, the total duration is 6 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, fertilization of eggs injected with the SH2 domains of Src at an intracellular concentration of 1 mg/ml (25 μm) resulted in a Ca2+ action potential, but the subsequent Ca2+ release was delayed for an average of 3.3 min and reduced in amplitude (Figs. 2 B and 3 B, Table I). When these eggs were imaged with confocal microscopy, two of six showed a Ca2+ wave that propagated over the entire cell, but this occurred with an increased delay after the Ca2+ action potential. In three of six of these eggs, the Ca2+ action potential was followed by local Ca2+ rises only (Fig.3 B), and in one of six eggs, Ca2+ release after the action potential was not detected. Five of five control eggs showed a normal Ca2+ action potential and Ca2+ wave (Fig. 3 A). Eggs that were fertilized after injection of 1 mg/ml Src SH2 domains showed multiple pronuclei in their cytoplasm, indicating that they were polyspermic (data not shown). The multiple sperm entries may correspond to the multiple rises seen in the Ca2+ traces (Fig.2 B) and the multiple sites of local Ca2+increase seen in the confocal images (Fig. 3 B). The inhibition of Ca2+ release by Src SH2 domains was concentration-dependent; weaker inhibition was seen with 0.1 mg/ml (2.5 μm) of the Src SH2 domains (Table I). No inhibition of Ca2+ release was seen in eggs injected with 1 mg/ml (25 μm) of the SH3 domain of Src (Table I). To test whether the inhibition of Ca2+ release at fertilization required the presence of an active phosphotyrosine binding region in the Src SH2 domain, we injected eggs with a point-mutated form of the Src SH2 domain, in which arginine 175 in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket was changed to lysine. This mutation reduces the in vitro association of the v-Src SH2 domain with phosphotyrosyl proteins to 35% of the wild-type SH2 domain (20Tian M. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Correspondingly, eggs injected with 1 mg/ml R175K Src SH2 domains showed weaker inhibition of Ca2+ release at fertilization compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 C and Table I). These results indicate that the inhibition of Ca2+ release by Src SH2 domains requires the ability to bind phosphotyrosine. Similar concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ release at fertilization was observed in eggs injected with SH2 domains of another Src family kinase, Fyn (Fig. 2 D and Table I). This finding was as expected, because Src and Fyn SH2 domains have similar binding preferences for peptide sequences containing phosphotyrosine (21Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In starfish eggs, 2.5 μm Src and Fyn SH2 domains was sufficient to delay Ca2+ release at fertilization and reduce its amplitude. The concentration of Fyn SH2 domains that was used to inhibit serum stimulation of cell division in mammalian fibroblasts is not known precisely but has been estimated to be in a similar range of about 1–2 μm (Ref. 18Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and footnote 2). 2S. Roche, personal communication. Injection of 1 mg/ml SH2 domains of three non-Src-family tyrosine kinases (Abl, Syk, and ZAP-70) did not inhibit Ca2+ release (Fig. 2 E and Table I). Like Src and Fyn, Abl has a single SH2 domain, whereas Syk and ZAP-70 have two tandem SH2 domains. All of these SH2 domains are structurally similar (22Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 23Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Compared with Src and Fyn, the SH2 domains of Abl, Syk, and ZAP-70 share some but not all preferences for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (21Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The lack of any effect on Ca2+ release of these control SH2 domains indicates that the inhibition of Ca2+ release at fertilization is specific for the SH2 domain of Src-family kinases. These results are consistent with the finding that injection of sea urchin eggs with SH2 domains of Fyn, but not Abl, results in polyspermy. 3W. H. Kinsey, personal communication. To determine whether the inhibition of Ca2+ release at fertilization was upstream or downstream of IP3 production, we tested whether Src or Fyn SH2 domains inhibited Ca2+ release in response to injection of IP3. These experiments showed no inhibition of IP3-induced Ca2+ release (Fig.4) even when using an IP3concentration close to the minimum needed to cause Ca2+release (24Chiba K. Kado R.T. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This result indicates that a Src family kinase acts on an early step in the fertilization signaling pathway, upstream of IP3 production. We have used the SH2 domains of Src family kinases to specifically inhibit the cellular function of these kinases and to demonstrate a requirement for their function in initiating Ca2+ release at fertilization of starfish eggs. Evidence for the specificity of the inhibitory action of the SH2 domains is as follows. 1) Src and Fyn SH2 domains have similar effects, as expected from their similar phosphopeptide binding specificities. 2) The SH2 domains of three other tyrosine kinases with similar protein structure but different phosphopeptide binding specificities (Abl, Syk, ZAP-70) have no effect. 3) A point-mutated Src SH2 domain with reduced ability to bind phosphotyrosine has a correspondingly reduced inhibitory effect. 4) Injection of a downstream component of the pathway (IP3) bypasses the inhibition. Based on our results, Src family SH2 domains are among the best characterized means available to investigate the requirement of these proteins for cellular functions. Although our results demonstrate that a Src family kinase is required for Ca2+ release at fertilization, it is not known which particular Src family kinase is involved and whether the function of the Src family protein depends on its kinase activity. The function of Src family proteins does not always depend on their kinase activity (25Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that in some cases they function as adapter proteins. In sea urchin eggs, the kinase activity immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against mammalian Fyn was found to increase by 5 min post-insemination (28Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). No significant increase was detected at earlier time points preceding Ca2+ release, but local activation of a kinase at the site of fertilization might produce only a small increase, below the limit of the method of detection. Alternatively, the primary role of the kinase activity associating with these particular antibodies may occur in later events. Only one Src family kinase present in echinoderm eggs has been cloned and sequenced (29Onodera H. Kobari K. Sakuma M. Sato M. Suyemitsu T. Yamasu K. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Characterization of which Src family kinases are present in echinoderm eggs will allow determination of which if any are activated within the first minute after fertilization. Directly or indirectly, the target of the Src family kinase in the signaling pathway at fertilization is very likely phospholipase Cγ, because PLCγ is necessary for Ca2+ release at fertilization in starfish and sea urchin eggs (7Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R.

Development. 1999; 126: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because PLCγ is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (9Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In vitro, PLCγ SH2 domains associate with a 58-kDa protein in fertilized starfish egg lysates, which is recognized by a vertebrate Src family kinase antibody (12Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This association is not seen in unfertilized egg lysates but is detected by 15 s post-insemination. A Src family kinase might activate PLCγ by directly phosphorylating it (16Nakanishi O. Shibasaki F. Hidaka M. Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10754-10759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or alternatively, the Src family kinase might be coupled to PLCγ activation by intermediate kinases and/or adapter proteins as in T cell receptor signaling (30Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As noted above, the Src family kinase might itself be an adapter protein (25Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As in echinoderms (11Shen S.S. Kinsey W.H. Lee S.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinase inhibitors also inhibit or delay Ca2+ release at fertilization in vertebrate eggs (31Dupont G. McGuinness O.M. Johnson M.H. Berridge M.J. Borgese F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,32Glahn D. Mark S.D. Behr R.K. Nuccitelli R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, only general chemical tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used, for which the specificity is uncertain. Signaling at fertilization of mammalian eggs appears to differ somewhat from that in echinoderms, because although the IP3 receptor is required for Ca2+ release (4Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), the Ca2+ release is not inhibited by PLCγ SH2 domains (33Mehlmann L.M. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). What upstream events in starfish fertilization might involve the SH2 domain of a Src family kinase? One possibility is suggested by findings in other cells that receptor cross-linking can lead to Src activation; this can occur by way of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak family kinases, which provides a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src (34Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Similarly, receptor cross-linking at the site where the sperm contacts the egg surface could result in an SH2-dependent activation of a Src family kinase at fertilization. Alternatively, because sperm and egg cytoplasm and membranes intermix following fusion, signaling components might interact in novel ways. Components from sperm can cause Ca2+ release when injected into eggs (35Dale B. DeFelice L.J. Ehrenstein G. Experientia. 1985; 41: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Kyozuka K. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Miyazaki S. Development. 1998; 125: 4099-4105PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a factor in sperm might activate an egg Src family kinase, leading to PLCγ activation and initiation of Ca2+ release. Identification of molecules in eggs or sperm that associate with Src family SH2 domains during fertilization will help to elucidate how the contact and fusion of eggs and sperm initiates embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W2043576061,"We have shown earlier that, in cells expressing the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), a protein phosphatase (PP) 1alpha mutant (T320A) resistant to inhibitory phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) causes G(1) arrest. In this study, we examined the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of PP1alpha in vivo using three different antibodies. PP1alpha was phosphorylated at Thr-320 during M-phase and again in late G(1)- through early S-phase. Inhibition of Cdk2 led to a small increase in PP1 activity and also prevented PP1alpha phosphorylation. In vitro, PP1alpha was a substrate for Cdk2 but not Cdk4. In pRB-deficient cells, phosphorylation of PP1alpha occurred in M-phase but not at G(1)/S. G(1)/S phosphorylation was at least partially restored after reintroduction of pRB into these cells. Consistent with this result, PP1alpha phosphorylated at Thr-320 co-precipitated with pRB during G(1)/S but was found in extracts immunodepleted of pRB in M-phase. In conjunction with earlier studies, these results indicate that PP1alpha may control pRB function throughout the cell cycle. In addition, our new results suggest that different subpopulations of PP1alpha regulate the G(1)/S and G(2)/M transitions and that PP1alpha complexed to pRB requires inhibitory phosphorylation by G(1)-specific Cdks in order to prevent untimely reactivation of pRB and permit transition from G(1)- to S-phase and/or complete S-phase."

In order to understand the protein-protein interaction between Fd and these two different enzymes, 10 acidic surface residues in maize Fd (isoform III), Asp-27, Glu-30, Asp-58, Asp-61, Asp-66/Asp-67, Glu-71/Glu-72, Asp-85, and Glu-93, were substituted with the corresponding amide residues by site-directed mutagenesis. The redox potentials of the mutated Fds were not markedly changed, except for E93Q, the redox potential of which was more positive by 67 mV than that of the wild type. Kinetic experiments showed that the mutations at Asp-66/Asp-67 and Glu-93 significantly affected electron transfer to the two enzymes. Interestingly, D66N/D67N was less efficient in the reaction with FNR than E93Q, whereas this relationship was reversed in the reaction with SiR. The static interaction of the mutant Fds with each the two enzymes was analyzed by gel filtration of a mixture of Fd and each enzyme, and by affinity chromatography on Fd-immobilized resins. The contributions of Asp-66/Asp-67 and Glu-93 were found to be most important for the binding to FNR and SiR, respectively, in accordance with the kinetic data. These results allowed us to map the acidic regions of Fd required for electron transfer and for binding to FNR and SiR and demonstrate that the interaction sites for the two enzymes are at least partly distinct.

Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Fd and each Fd-dependent enzyme form a 1:1 protein-protein complex, and this specific interaction is considered to be important for efficient electron transfer between the two proteins. The sites involved in the interaction between Fd and its complementary electron transfer partners have been studied in several laboratories, although the actual geometry of the complex has not been established. Among the physical and chemical forces involved in protein interactions, such as hydrophobic packing interaction, electrostatic forces, and hydrogen bonding, several lines of evidence from chemical modification experiments (10De Pascalis A.R.

Science. 1991; 251: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) indicate that the complex is mainly formed as a result of electrostatic forces through the negative charges of Fd and the positive charges of each enzyme. Ionic strength affects the transient kinetics of electron transfer from Fd to FNR also indicating that complementary electrostatic charges influence complex formation (20Walker M.C. Pueyo J.J. Navarro J.A. Gomez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to identify and compare the binding sites in Fd for two Fd-dependent enzymes, FNR and SiR, by site-directed mutagenesis of maize Fd (isoform III) (21Hase T. Kimata Y. Yonekura K. Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FNR is a 35-kDa, soluble flavoprotein containing one noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide, and it catalyzes the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH with two electrons from reduced Fd. SiR found in higher plants is a 64-kDa, soluble protein containing one [4Fe-4S] cluster and one siroheme, and it catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide. Acidic residues (Asp and Glu) located at eight different sites in maize Fd, Asp-27, Glu-30, Asp-58, Asp-61, Asp-66/Asp-67, Glu-71/Glu-72, Asp-85, and Glu-93 were chosen as targets of substitution, to be replaced by the corresponding amide residues. Although the three-dimensional structure of maize Fd is not known, the structure could be superimposed on those of the three plant-type Fds (Fig. 1), because about 60–70% of the amino acid sequence of maize Fd is identical to those of the three Fds. The spatial orientation of the side-chains of the acidic residues corresponding to those altered through mutagenesis in maize Fd is considered to be similar among the plant-type Fds (Fig.1). We examined the ability of each of the resulting Fd mutants to bind to FNR and SiR and their capacity for electron transfer. The binding ability was successfully analyzed by gel filtration of a mixture of Fd and each enzyme. Affinity chromatography on Fd-immobilized resins was also applied to evaluate the interaction of the two proteins. We report here that certain acidic residues are indeed crucial for the interaction with FNR and SiR and furthermore that the distribution of such residues in the three-dimensional structure of Fd is partly distinct for the two enzymes. The insert DNA in the region from the NcoI site to the XhoI site of pSMmFD3, a maize Fd III expression plasmid (22Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) originally constructed using the vector pKK233–2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was ligated into theNcoI/XhoI cloning site of another expression vector, pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain pSMmFD3–1. For construction of D66N/D67N and D66K/D67K, cassettes of two complementary oligonucleotides (Table I) were inserted into the BamHI and PstI sites of pSMmFD3–1. Other mutant Fds were constructed by an overlap extension method by two-step polymerase chain reaction (23Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R., K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar, 24Good L. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using a combination of two terminal primers and a pair of two mutagenic primers as listed in TableI. The terminal primers were designed to produce NcoI andXhoI sites at the ends of each amplified fragment, and the fragments with the mutation site were easily inserted into the corresponding region of pSMmFD3–1. All mutation sites and the sequence integrity of the entire coding region of Fd were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and an automated DNA sequencer (model 370A; Applied Biosystems).Table IA list of oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesisItalic letters show the nucleotide changed by mutagenesis.

Escherichia coli strain JM105 cells transformed with various mutant Fd genes were grown in 8 liters of Luria broth medium supplemented with 100 μm FeSO4 and 50 μg/ml ampicillin for 2 h at 37 °C after inoculation with an overnight seed culture at 1% volume. Isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cultivation was continued for a further 8–12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and stored at −30 °C until use. Fd was extracted and purified essentially according to a published method (22Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Nakano R. Kimata Y. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The purity of the Fds was checked by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a gel with a linear gradient of 15–25% acrylamide as described previously (26Kimata Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Fd was determined spectrophotometrically based on a molar extinction coefficient of 9.68 mm−1 cm−1 at 422 nm (27Tagawa K. Arnon D.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Maize leaves were broken into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a Waring blender and homogenized in an extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) with 10% (w/v) Polyclar AT. Thereafter, the homogenate was roughly filtered through several layers of cheesecloth, and the leaf extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. FNR and SiR were recovered in the fraction from 40–70% saturation and were separated by chromatography on DE-52 (Whatman), developed with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 400 mmin 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Both enzymes were separately purified by successive chromatographic steps on columns of Sephacryl S-200, Blue-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Fd-immobilized resin essentially according to published procedures (28Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Ashikari T. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Hase T. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentrations of FNR and SiR were determined spectrophotometrically based on molar extinction coefficients of 9.40 mm−1 cm−1 at 459 nm (29Pueyo J.J. Gomez-Moreno C. Prep. Biochem. 1991; 21: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar) and 18.0 mm−1 cm−1 at 587 nm (30Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry of Fds was carried out using a BAS-50W electrochemical analyzer with a poly-l-lysine modified In2O3electrode as described previously (31Taniguchi I. Miyahara A. Iwakiri K. Hirakawa Y. Hayashi K. Nishiyama K. Akashi T. Hase T. Chem. Lett. 1997; 1997: 929-930Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fds were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl at a concentration of 50 μm, and voltammetric responses were measured at a scan rate of 2 mV/s under anaerobic conditions, purged with nitrogen gas. Catalytic reactions of FNR and SiR through the reduction of Fds on the electrode were measured in a mixture consisting of 0.25 μm FNR or SiR, 50 μm Fd in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl with 0.3 mm NADP+ or 0.6 mmNa2SO3, respectively, as the substrate. CD spectra of mutant Fds were measured with a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter. Fd was dissolved in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl at a final concentration of 45 and 4.5 μm for the measurements in the visible and UV regions, respectively. Complex formation between Fd and SiR and between Fd and FNR was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography using the Smart system with a μpeak Monitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A mixture (30 μl) of Fd and SiR at certain concentrations was loaded on a small column of Superdex 75 (PC3.2/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl at a constant flow rate of 40 μl/min at 15 °C. Fd and SiR were monitored by the absorbance at 330 nm derived from the prosthetic groups of the proteins. For chromatography of the mixture of Fd and FNR, all conditions were the same as above except that 10 mm NaCl was omitted from the elution buffer. One mg of Fd was immobilized on 0.5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the method recommended by the supplier. A small column (HR 5/2; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed with 200 μl of the Fd-immobilized resin was mounted in the Smart system. After equilibrating the column with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 μl of 1.5 μm FNR or SiR was loaded and a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 400 mm was applied as eluent at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Elution of the enzymes was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. FNR activity was assayed by monitoring the photoreduction of NADP+ with thylakoid membranes of spinach chloroplasts in the presence of various concentrations of Fd (0–40 μm) essentially according to the method described previously (22Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SiR activity was assayed by monitoring the coupling reaction with cysteine synthase according to a published method (28Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Ashikari T. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Hase T. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture consisted of 100 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNa2SO3, 12.5 mm O-acetyl-l-serine, an excess amount of cysteine synthase, 20 nm SiR, and various concentrations of Fds (0–10 μm). The reaction was started by addition of Na2S2O4 at a final concentration of 8 mm, and the amount of cysteine formed in 30 min at 30 °C was determined by an acid-ninhydrin reaction. All mutant Fds isolated fromE. coli cells were assembled with the [2Fe-2S] cluster and showed absorption spectra comparable to that of wild type Fd, with the value of the A 422/A 276ratio being greater than 0.48 (data not shown). Each migrated as a single band during nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their mobilities were slower than that of the wild type Fd in accordance with their net charge differences, suggesting that the mobility shift was mainly due to the surface charge change introduced by mutation (Fig. 2). The redox potentials of the wild type and mutant Fds were measured by cyclic voltammetry (TableII). The wild type Fd had a redox potential of −321 mV (versus a normal hydrogen electrode), and only the value in the case of E93Q was shifted to a significantly higher value by 67 mV. All other mutations had little effect on the redox potential. The shift in the case of E93Q seemed not to be due to any large conformational change in the backbone or any structural perturbation of the cluster, because the CD spectra of E93Q in both the ultra-violet and visible regions were essentially the same as those of the wild type Fd and D66N/D67N as shown in Fig.3.Table IIElectron transfer activity of wild type and mutated Fds in interaction with FNR and SiR and the redox potential of these FdsFd formActivity ofE mFNRSiR%mV (δ)Wild type100100−321D27N12295−316 (+5)E30Q10081−324 (−3)D58N92102−317 (+4)D61N8488−321 (0)D66N/D67N3169−325 (−4)D66K/D67K1664−326 (−5)E71Q/E72Q94117−321 (0)D85N10598−323 (−2)E93Q5034−254 (+67)Electron transfer activity was measured with 10 μm Fd as an electron donor in the present of FNR or SiR under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and relative values for mutated Fds are shown with the level of activity displayed by the wild type Fd taken as 100%.

Open table in a new tab Electron transfer activity was measured with 10 μm Fd as an electron donor in the present of FNR or SiR under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and relative values for mutated Fds are shown with the level of activity displayed by the wild type Fd taken as 100%. The redox potential (E m) values given are those obtained against a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The numbers in parentheses are differences from theE m values of wild type Fd. Mutant Fds were tested to assess the ability to transfer electrons to two different Fd-dependent enzymes, FNR and SiR. As summarized in TableII, significant variation in electron transfer ability was found. Among all of the mutant Fds, the mutations at Asp-66/Asp-67 and Glu-93 caused the largest decrease in electron transfer to FNR and SiR, respectively. It is noteworthy that mutations in two acidic regions had different effects on the electron transfer activity; D66N/D67N and D66K/D67K each had lower activity in electron transfer to FNR than in electron transfer to SiR, whereas E93Q had the reverse effect. Kinetic analyses revealed that the mutations caused an increase in K mvalues and a decrease in V max values (TableIII). The subtle difference inK m values between the two mutant Fds implies that Asp-66/Asp-67 and Glu-93 may differentially contribute to the affinity of Fd for FNR and SiR.Table IIIKinetic parameter values for FNR and SiR in interaction with wild type Fd, or the mutant Fd, D66N/D67N, or E93QFd formFNRSiRK mV maxK mV maxμmμmol/min · mg chlμmμmol/minWild type1.7aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.1.3aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.1.7aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.2.6aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.D66N/D67N7.3bA maximum of 40 μm Fd was used in the assay.0.7bA maximum of 40 μm Fd was used in the assay.2.0aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.1.9aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.E93Q4.0bA maximum of 40 μm Fd was used in the assay.0.6bA maximum of 40 μm Fd was used in the assay.4.2aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.1.0aA maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.a A maximum of 10 μm Fd was used in the assay.b A maximum of 40 μm Fd was used in the assay. Open table in a new tab In addition to the biochemical assay of the mutant Fds, electron transfer from D66N/D67N and E93Q to FNR and SiR was measured by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 4, a catalytic reduction current was observed due to the continuous oxidation of the wild type Fd in the presence of FNR and NADP+, or SiR and sulfite. This catalytic current was largely decreased when either D66N/D67N or E93Q was used as an electron carrier from the electrode to the enzymes. In the case of SiR, the extent of the decrease was found to be larger with E93Q than with D66N/D67N, in agreement with the results obtained in the biochemical assay as described above. When a mixture of Fd and SiR in a molar ratio of 1:1 was loaded onto a Superdex G-75 column equilibrated and developed with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, these proteins were eluted as a single peak at a retention time earlier than that of Fd or SiR applied singly (Fig.5 A). Upon addition of 100 mm NaCl to the elution buffer, the two proteins in the mixture were separately eluted, indicating that the complex of Fd and SiR was formed mainly by electrostatic interaction (Fig.5 B). Titration of Fd in binding to SiR showed that the two proteins were bound with 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5 C). The ability of each of the mutant Fds to bind to SiR was examined by gel filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig.6 B, E93Q and E30Q were unable to form the complex with SiR, and D66N/D67N and D61N were inferior to the wild type Fd. The other mutant Fds, D85N, D58N, D27N, and E71Q/E72Q, each showed complex-forming ability comparable to that of the wild type Fd. These results show a good correlation with those obtained by the enzymatic assay (Table II); E93Q, E30Q, D66N/D67N, and D61N with decreased binding ability showed 30–80% of the activity of the wild type Fd, whereas the other mutant Fds retained essentially wild type activity. The same chromatographic assay of the mutant Fds was applied to examine complex formation with FNR. As shown in Fig. 6 A, D66N/D67N could not form the complex with FNR, D61N, E71Q/E72Q, D27N, and E30Q each had less binding ability than the wild type Fd, and D85N, E93Q, D58N retained the same or similar ability. Although mutant Fds with lowered binding tended to show decreased electron transfer to FNR (Table II), there seems to be no good correlation between them as seen with SiR, because E71Q/E72Q, D27N, and E30Q, which displayed a diminished capacity for complex formation compared with the wild type Fd, still retained the full electron transfer activity. It is noteworthy that E93Q showed different characteristics compared with the other mutants. This mutant, which was able to form a stable complex with FNR, but not with SiR, showed considerably lowered electron transfer ability toward both enzymes. This phenomenon seems to be due to the large positive shift in the redox potential. Binding of FNR and SiR to the wild type Fd, D66N/D67N, and E93Q was further examined using Fd-immobilized Sepharose columns. As shown in Fig.7 A, FNR was not retained on the D66N/D67N column, whereas FNR became bound to the E93Q column and was eluted with a gradient of NaCl in a manner similar to that in the case of the wild type Fd column. SiR was eluted from the three Fd-affinity columns in the following order, E93Q, D66N/D67N, and wild type Fd (Fig. 7 B). The differential binding of FNR and SiR to D66N/D67N and E93Q observed by Fd-affinity chromatography was in good agreement with the results obtained by gel filtration chromatography described in the above section. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of acidic residues located on the surface of maize Fd was successfully applied to map the regions involved in complex formation with FNR and SiR. Fig.8 summarizes these results and shows the acidic residues contributing to formation of the complex with each of these enzymes. Regarding the sites involved in the interaction between Fd and FNR, the results of the present work are comparable to previous data obtained by chemical modification and computer modeling. By differential chemical modification of spinach Fd with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethyl-aminopropyl] carbodiimide/taurine in the presence and absence of spinach FNR, Asp-26, Glu-29, Glu-30, Asp-34, Asp-65, and Asp-66 (Asp-27, Glu-30, Thr-31, Asp-35, Asp-66, and Asp-67 in maize Fd) were protected from modification only when Fd was present as a complex with FNR (10De Pascalis A.R.

Computer modeling of the complex ofSpirulina Fd and spinach FNR (3Fukuyama K. Ueki N. Nakamura H. Tsukihara T. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggested that Asp-28 and Glu-31 in the Fd (Asp-27 and Glu-30 in maize Fd) are close to Lys-300, Arg-301, Lys-304, and Lys-305 of the FNR, Asp-67 (Asp-66 in maize Fd) is close to Lys-33 and Lys-35, and Asp-62 (Asp-61 in maize Fd) is close to Lys-153. As shown in Fig. 8, most of these acidic residues in maize Fd are involved in the interaction with FNR. A cross-linking study of the complex of Fd and FNR indicated that the acidic residues at positions 92–94 in spinach Fd (93–95 in maize Fd) are the sites cross-linked to spinach FNR (17Zanetti G. Morelli D. Ronchi S. Negri A. Aliverti A. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3753-3759Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Aliverti A. Livraghi A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The present data, however, do not support the view that Glu-93 in maize Fd is the main site involved in binding to FNR. It seems that the cross-linked acidic residues may not necessarily contribute to electrostatic interaction in the Fd-FNR complex. The degree of static interaction with FNR dose not show a clear correlation with the activity in electron transfer to FNR in the case of some Fd mutants. In the complex formation and electron transfer of Fd and FNR from spinach and Anabaena, transient kinetic measurements have suggested that the static interaction plays differing roles in controlling electron transfer between the two redox partners; one is stabilization of the Fd-FNR complex and the other is structural rearrangement within the transient complex, which optimizes the intracomplex electron transfer (20Walker M.C. Pueyo J.J. Navarro J.A. Gomez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The interaction measured by chromatographic techniques in this study do not necessarily reflect the ability of mutant Fds for such rearrangement of transient complex formation. Short range of forces, such as hydrophobic packing, van der Waals contact, and hydrogen bonding, on the top of the electrostatic force, also contribute to fine structural turning of the two redox partners. Although present data suggest some of acidic residues of maize Fd contribute mainly in an ensemble of loose interaction with FNR, but not in the fine interaction productive for the efficient electron transfer, the precise explanations for this matter require further study. However, the results of mutation at positions 66/67 were very straightforward; the negative charges in this region are crucial for both complex formation and electron transfer to FNR. Of these two acidic residues, Asp-66 seems to be physiologically important for the interaction with FNR. Among the maize Fd isoproteins, Fd I, Fd II, and Fd III, only Fd II has Asn at position 65 (corresponding to 66 in Fd III), and the K m of FNR for Fd II was considerably higher than that for Fd I, whereas there was no substantial difference in V max between the two Fds (33Matsumura T. Kimata-A Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Murata H. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the N65D mutant of Fd II showed increased activity, a level comparable to Fd I (33Matsumura T. Kimata-A Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Murata H. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The electrostatic interaction between Fd II and FNR was found to be weaker than that in the case of the other Fd isoproteins (data not shown). These data also support the view that the negative charge at this site is crucial for electron transfer between Fd and FNR. The present data demonstrate that the sites in Fd involved in binding to SiR are partly different from those for FNR; Glu-93 is the most important site for binding to SiR but not for binding to FNR. De Pascalis et al. (11De Pascalis A.R. Schürmann P. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also proposed that there are different sites in Fd for binding to FNR and Fd-thioredoxin reductase as determined by chemical modification. Asp-34, Asp-65, Glu-92, Glu-93, and Glu-94 in spinach Fd (Asp-35, Asp-66, Glu-93, Gly-94, and Asp-95 in maize Fd) were shown to be close to the contact sites in the complex with spinach Fd-thioredoxin reductase, but not in the complex with spinach FNR. Comparing these findings with the present results, the sites involved in binding of Fd for Fd-thioredoxin reductase appear to be similar to those for SiR. The common sites in binding of Fd to FNR and SiR are mostly positioned around the [2Fe-2S] cluster. This suggests that although Fd may have a unique site for interaction with each Fd-dependent enzyme, the route of electron transfer from the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Fd to each of these enzymes is the same. Regarding electron transfer to SiR, the static Fd-SiR interaction showed a good correlation with the kinetic activity in the case of most Fd mutants. This suggests that formation of the complex for electron transfer between Fd and SiR is largely dependent on electrostatic forces. E93Q was found to be an inefficient electron carrier for transfer to both FNR and SiR, although this mutant interacts with FNR as well as the wild type. Recently, this glutamic acid residue at the same position was shown to be important for the reaction with a few Fd-dependent enzymes in the case of Fds from spinach (34Piubelli L. Aliverti A. Bellintani F. Zanetti G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar),Anabaena (35Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H.

E92Q, E92A, and E92K of spinach Fd and E94Q and E94K of Anabaena Fd showed a 60–90 mV positive shift in redox potential as observed in the case of the mutant E93Q of maize Fd. Thus, the change in redox potential appears to be the major factor responsible for the decrease in electron transfer ability. The negative charge at position 93 may be important to maintain the low redox potential of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, because the E94D mutant ofAnabaena Fd showed a redox potential nearly equal to that of the wild type and because the mutant E94K with a positively changed side-chain showed a greater increase in redox potential than a mutant with a neutral side-chain (35Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Medina M. Gomez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). According to the three-dimensional structure of the AnabaenaFd (38Holden H.M. Jacobson B.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G.

Biomembr. 1994; 26: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the side-chain of Glu-94 was proposed to play a role in stabilizing the [2Fe-2S] cluster binding loop of the polypeptide backbone through a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Ser-47 (Ser-46 in maize Fd). The crystal structure of mutant E94K ofAnabaena Fd, which lacks the hydrogen bond, indicates that this mutation caused only a minor perturbation in the vicinity around the [2Fe-2S] center (39Hurley J.K. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Benning M.M. Thoden J.B. Vanhooke J.L. Holden H.M. Chae Y.K. Xia B. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Martinez-Julvez M. Gomez-Moreno C. Schmeits J.L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11100-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We are also currently studying the x-ray structure of S46G mutant of maize Fd, which shows about 180 mV positive shift (31Taniguchi I. Miyahara A. Iwakiri K. Hirakawa Y. Hayashi K. Nishiyama K. Akashi T. Hase T. Chem. Lett. 1997; 1997: 929-930Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the preliminary data suggest that only a local configuration of the [2Fe-2S] cluster binding loop is perturbed in this mutant. 2G. Kurisu, M. Kusunoki, and T. Hase, unpublished data. These combined data suggested that at least two factors, a small change in the conformation around the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the introduction of neutral and positively charged side-chains at position 93, which may result in stabilization of the [2Fe-2S] cluster with an overall negative charge, should induce significant redox changes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the ability of Fd to transfer electrons to two Fd-dependent enzymes, FNR and SiR, is decreased by lowering the ability of Fd to form a stable complex with each of the enzymes by mutagenesis of specific acidic residues. We have also found that Fd has electrostatic interaction sites both common and unique to each enzyme. This specific Fd-enzyme interaction site might be an important factor in regulating the distribution of electrons among several Fd-dependent enzymes in various metabolic pathways of chloroplasts."

The physiological significance of co-expression of multiple isoforms of the InsP3R within a given cell is not clear, but it has been generally thought to confer release channels that were functionally heterogeneous, differentially regulated, and differentially targeted or a combination of all three possibilities. Recent investigations, from this laboratory and others, have defined the intrinsic calcium channel properties for all three isoforms of the receptor (4Perez P.J. Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A.

These studies reveal that the three isoforms of InsP3R have channels with remarkably similar permeation properties. All channels have similar Ca2+ conductances (∼60 pS) and almost identical reversal potentials using Cs+ or Ca2+, indicating similar ionic selectivity. Despite the similarities observed at the single channel level, the individual receptor types appear to be differentially regulated by calcium and InsP3. These studies demonstrated that the type-1 isoform from cerebellum is modulated by calcium in a biphasic manner, whereas the type-2 and type 3 isoforms are not (5Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A.

The type 2 receptor Ca2+ channel from cardiac myocytes activates at a lower calcium concentration and sustains this activity over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Similar results were observed with the type 3 receptor from rat insulinoma cells (RIN-5F) (8Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition to the differences in calcium sensitivities observed between the type 1 and 2 receptors, the type 2 homologue exhibits approximately a 3-fold increased efficacy to a similar dose of InsP3. Together, these results imply that the intrinsic calcium channels between isoforms are very similar, yet they appear to be regulated quite differently and may help explain the heterogeneity observed in calcium release events in cells and tissue expressing multiple forms of the receptor. The InsP3R channel protein is a tetrameric structure resulting from the homo- or hetero-oligomerization of the receptor isoform subunits. Each subunit can be divided into three principle domains consisting of an amino-terminal ligand binding region, a carboxyl-terminal channel domain, and a central coupling or regulatory domain (3Südhof T.C.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Within the carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors there are numerous arrays of hydrophobic amino acids that form membrane-spanning helices that are thought to form the receptor's intrinsic calcium channel. The role of these multiple membrane-spanning domains in the oligomerization and membrane targeting of the receptor were demonstrated in mutagenesis studies. These studies revealed that the elimination of residues 2205–2225 encompassing the putative membrane-spanning regions resulted in the expression of soluble, monomeric protein that binds InsP3 with similar affinity and specificity as that of full-length native or recombinant receptor (10Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Studies using a green fluorescent protein chimera with amino-terminally truncated receptor confirmed these results and proposed that the membrane spanning domains confer reticular targeting and oligomerization.

The number and topological organization of the transmembrane-spanning regions of the InsP3R subunit has been difficult to determine. A six-transmembrane-helix model has emerged from numerous computer predictions and sequence homology comparisons, which are supported by immunological and N-linked glycosylation studies (13Takei K.

The details regarding the receptor's intrinsic calcium channel structure and organization are limited. The calcium channel pore is thought to form as a result of subunit monomer assembly into tetramers. Thus, a detailed analysis of the components involved in tetramerization and topological organization of the membrane-spanning sequences should provide new insights into the formation of the receptors intrinsic calcium release channel. In this study, we use type 1 InsP3R expression constructions containing differing numbers and combinations of putative membrane-spanning sequences with or without the carboxyl terminus in a mammalian expression system to evaluate the elements involved in subunit oligomerization. In addition, these expression plasmids were used to determine the topological orientation of the membrane-spanning helices through the endoplasmic reticulum using detergent and streptolysin-O permeabilization/immunofluorescence analysis. These experiments confirm the six-membrane-spanning hypothesis of the receptors topological orientation. We show that the oligomerization of the receptor is dependent upon several unique, yet additive determinants. We find that InsP3R mutants expressing the first two transmembrane sequences are sufficient to form high molecular weight complexes and that when coupled to the carboxyl-terminal 145 amino acids, the assembly is enhanced. In addition, a construction lacking the first four transmembrane regions, possessing only the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning helices and the intervening luminal loop, is very efficient at forming tetramers.

In these cases, amplified product was digested withBstBI/BglII and inserted into a similarly digested intermediate plasmid spanning nucleotides 6659–9467. These plasmids were digested with BstBI/XbaI, and the resulting fragments were inserted into the full-length type 1 receptor (pCMVI-9/pInsP3R-T1) at theBstBI/XbaI sites. The 5′ oligonucleotide primer, corresponding to nucleotides 6945–6968 (GAATCGAAACTTCGAATATATTAC), was constant, and the 3′ antisense primers were as follows: TMR 1 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTTCCTCCTCTCACTCC); TMR 2 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTGCCATGGGGCTTGGGCAG); TMR 3 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTGGTCCCACAGTTGCC); TMR 4 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTATAGAAAAACTCATGTACGAAGAGGCC); TMR 5 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTCAAGATAAAGTCATCCTT); and TMR 6 (ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTCAGGTCAGCAAAGGTGTC). The construct lacking all membrane spanning sequences (TMR0+C) was described previously and is analogous to pIP3RΔ2225–2604 (10Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructions containing membrane-spanning regions 3 and 4 and regions 5 and 6 were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs GCGCCATGGTTCGAATATTTTCAGTTGGATTACAGCCC/ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTATAGAAAAACTCATGTACGAAGAGGCC and GCGCCATGGTTCGAAGTGTCACCCGCAATGGACGGCCC/ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTCAGGTCAGCAAAGGTGTC, respectively. The amplification products were digested withBstBI/BglII and inserted into similarly digested intermediate plasmid-spanning nucleotides 6659–9467. The resulting plasmid was digested with BstBI/XbaI, and the TMR-containing fragments were ligated intoBstBI/XbaI-digested full-length receptor. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with InsP3R plasmid DNA using the DEAE-dextran method. Sheared salmon sperm DNA was used to mock transfect COS-1 cells and served as a negative control. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48–72 h prior to harvesting for biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis. Transfected COS-1 cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection, and microsomes were prepared as described previously (15Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells were washed with PBS; harvested by scrapping into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF; and lysed by 40 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Membranes were pelleted by a 20-min centrifugation (289,000 × g av), resuspended in buffer, and either used immediately or frozen at −80 °C. Microsomal fractions were solubilized in 50 mmTris-HCl pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 1% CHAPS on ice for 1 h. Insoluble fractions were eliminated by a 10-min centrifugation at 289,000 × g av, and the supernatant containing solubilized receptor was fractionated through 5–20% sucrose (w/v) gradients. Sucrose gradients (2 ml) were centrifuged for 5 h, 4 °C at 166,320 ×g av using a Beckman TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor. Following centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated into 25 80-μl aliquots, and InsP3R protein(s) were detected by immunoblotting. Gradient performance and resolution were evaluated by applying standard proteins of known molecular weight and/or sedimentation coefficients. The standard proteins were bovine serum albumin (65 kDa, 4.36 S), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 7.4 S), β-amylase (200 kDa), catalase (250, 11.3 S), and β-galactosidase (540 kDa, 16 S). In addition, CHAPS-solubilized cerebellar microsomes were applied to control gradients as a source of native InsP3R and RyR (30 S) (16Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,17Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) sedimentation controls. Standard proteins were detected using Coomassie staining and immunostaining. COS cell microsomes and sucrose gradient fractions were analyzed by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously (15Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting using chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transiently transfected COS cells were harvested by brief trypsinization followed by plating onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Following an attachment interval, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and/or streptolysin-O as described below. Transfected COS-1 cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 15 min at 25 °C. The coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min with solution A (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.45m NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1.0% goat serum). The Triton X-100 was removed by washing with PBS, and the cells were blocked in solution B (20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 0.45m NaCl) containing 10% goat serum and stored at 4 °C until use. Selective permeabilization using SLO was performed by the methods described by Otto and Smith (18Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected COS-1 cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 15 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with streptolysin-O (200 units/ml) that had been preactivated by a 5-min, 0 °C incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol in PBS. Unbound streptolysin-O was removed by washing, and the coverslips were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in PBS containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The coverslips were washed in PBS, blocked in solution B (20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.45 m NaCl) containing 10% goat serum and stored at 4 °C until use. Coverslips were incubated (45 min at room temperature) with primary antibody diluted in solution A (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.45 m NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1.0% goat serum) for Triton X-100-permeabilized cells and solution C (1.0% goat serum in PBS) for SLO-treated cells. The cells were washed with solution B (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.45 m NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (12.5 μg/ml) diluted into solution A (for Triton X-100-permeabilized cells) and solution C (for SLO permeabilization) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with solution B, and the coverslips were fixed to microscope slides using Fluoromount-G. Coverslips were analyzed with a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope and photographed using T-Max 400 ASA film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The InsP3R-specific amino-terminal (T1NH) and carboxyl-terminal (T1C) polyclonal antibodies were generated against residues 308–326 of the type-1 SIb alternatively spliced isoform and the 19 C-terminal amino acids, respectively (6Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The luminal loop antipeptide antibody (V753) is directed against residues 2463–2476 of the type-1 receptor (13Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proton pump tag antibody is directed against the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of the 116-kDa subunit of the proton pump (15Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

The secondary antibody used in immunofluoresence staining was a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Organon Teknika). Cotransfected COS-1 cells were harvested, and microsomes were prepared as described above. A small amount of the microsomes representing total expression products was removed and added to SDS-PAGE buffer. The remaining microsomes were solubilized by stirring on ice for 2 h in Buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmPMSF, and 2% bovine serum albumin). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 106,120 × g av for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and mixed with 2 μl (∼2 μg), 1:250 dilution, of the immunoprecipitating antibody (T1C) directed against the carboxyl terminus of the InsP3R. The samples were incubated on ice for 4 h. Samples were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g av) at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were retained. To each supernatant fraction, 20 μl of a 10% protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) slurry was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. The antigen-IgG-protein A-Sepharose conjugates were pelleted by 10-s centrifugation at 16,000 ×g av. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each in 0.5 ml of Buffer B (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm PMSF), two times in Buffer C (1% Triton X-100, 300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm PMSF), and once briefly in Buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm PMSF). Bound antigen was released from the protein A beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE buffer and boiling for 3 min. It is well established that the multiple membrane-spanning sequences of the InsP3R that reside near the carboxyl terminus are involved in the targeting and assembly of receptor subunits into functional tetrameric calcium release channels (10Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Sayers L.G. Miyawaki A. Muto A. Takeshita H. Yamamoto A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In experiments designed to study the role of these transmembrane sequences as well as other components in the oligomerization and topology of the type-1 InsP3R, a series of expression plasmid mutations were constructed (Fig.1). In the initial mutation series, plasmids encoding carboxyl-terminally truncated InsP3R proteins containing increasing numbers of putative membrane-spanning sequences were prepared in a cytomegalovirus promoter-based mammalian expression plasmid. These truncations were transiently expressed in COS cells followed by analysis of oligomerization by sedimentation on 5–20% sucrose gradients. The density gradients were fractionated, and the migrations of receptor proteins through the gradient were detected by immunoblotting. The chimera in which no membrane-spanning sequences were present (TMR0-C) was soluble (Fig. 2) and sedimented to a position on the gradients consistent with that of a monomeric protein (Figs. 3 and4, upper panel) (10Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A construct containing only the first membrane-spanning sequence was not efficiently targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a significant amount (∼50%) of the expressed protein was soluble (Fig.2). The reasons for the lack of efficient targeting to the ER is not clear, since an amino-terminally truncated protein containing similar transmembrane sequences, when expressed in an in vitroassay, was reported to be targeted to the pancreatic microsomes (12Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All of the additional expression products containing two or more putative transmembrane sequences encoded proteins that were efficiently targeted to the ER (Fig. 2).Figure 3Sedimentation of monomeric and tetrameric InsP3R proteins on sucrose gradients. Microsomes from transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing TMR0±C and TMR1–6±C were solubilized with 1% CHAPS (in the case of TMR0±C, cytosolic proteins were used) and applied to 5–20% linear sucrose gradients (2 ml) to evaluate gradient performance.

https://openalex.org/W2092715066,"Nuclear factor (NF) κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor whose function is regulated by the cytoplasmic inhibitor protein, IκBα. We have previously shown that IκBα activity is diminished in ventricular myocytes expressing Bcl-2. (de Moissac, D., Mustapha, S., Greenberg, A. H., and Kirshenbaum, L. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23946–23951). In view of the growing evidence that the conserved N-terminal BH4 domain of Bcl-2 plays a critical role in suppressing apoptosis, we ascertained whether this region accounts for the underlying effects of Bcl-2 on IκBα activity. Transfection of human embryonic 293 cells with full length Bcl-2 resulted in a significant 1.9-fold reduction in IκBα activity (p < 0.006) with a concomitant increase in DNA binding and 3.4-fold increase in NFκB-dependent gene transcription (p < 0.022) compared with vector transfected control cells. In contrast, no significant change in IκBα activity was detected with either a BH4 domain deletion mutant (residues 10–30) or BH4 domain point substitution mutants, I14G, V15G, Y18G, K22G, and L23G (p = 2.77). However, a small 0.60-fold decrease (p < 0.04) in IκBα activity was noted with the BH4 mutant I19G, suggesting that this residue may not be critical for IκBα regulation. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated delivery of an IκBα mutant to prevent NFκB activation impaired the ability of Bcl-2 to suppress apoptosis provoked by TNFα plus cycloheximide in ventricular myocytes. The data provide the first evidence for the regulation of IκBα by Bcl-2 through a mechanism that requires the conserved BH4 domain that links Bcl-2 to the NFκB signaling pathway for suppression of apoptosis.

Although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie programmed cell death in mammalian cells is poorly defined, there is considerable evidence that the bcl-2 gene family may play a critical role in this process (reviewed in Refs.7Reed J.C.

Bcl-2 can delay or prevent apoptosis provoked by a variety of death- promoting signals, suggesting that it likely impinges on more that one component of the death signaling pathway. Structural analysis studies of Bcl-2 have identified several key domains with putative anti-apoptotic properties (10Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell.

In particular, the N terminus of Bcl-2, which encompasses an amphipathic α-helical loop designated the BH4 domain, has been suggested to play a crucial role in the prevention of apoptosis. This is substantiated by studies in which the deletion or mutation of this region was shown to render Bcl-2 defective for suppression of apoptosis (10Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell.

The mechanism by which the BH4 domain confers protection against apoptosis is unknown but may reside in its ability to modulate the activity of certain factors involved in the apoptotic process. The BH4 domain of Bcl-2 has been shown to bind to and sequester the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin (15Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F.

This has led to the suggestion that TNFα is sufficient to activate both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways with the anti-apoptotic signals, mediated through the NFκB, dominating to suppress death promoting signals and apoptosis (30Wu M.

We have recently shown that adenoviral-mediated gene delivery of Bcl-2 to ventricular myocytes increased NFκB activity and prevented apoptosis mediated by TNFα plus cycloheximide (33de Moissac D.

This was attributed to Bcl-2-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα at residues Ser-32 and Ser-36 followed by IκBα degradation by the proteasome (33de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A.

Because NFκB has been suggested to play a protective role in the suppression of apoptosis, we ascertained in the present study whether the N-terminal BH4 domain of Bcl-2 accounts for the underlying effects of Bcl-2 on NFκB activity. In this report, we show that activation of NFκB by Bcl-2 is mediated by the degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor protein IκBα through a mechanism that involves the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. We further show that Bcl-2 utilizes an NFκB-dependent pathway to suppress apoptosis mediated by TNFα. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Tissue Type Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as previously reported (33de Moissac D.

Cells were transfected with the CMV-driven eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA 3 (In Vitrogen) lacking the cDNA insert for all transfection controls. To control for potential differences in transfection efficiency among cell cultures, luciferase reporter activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as fold increase. Following transfection, cells were washed and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Data were obtained from at least n = 3 independent cultures with three replicates for each condition. Results were compared by Scheffe's multiple comparison test for analysis of variance and the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, using a significance level of p < 0.05. For immunodetection of IκBα protein, 293 cells were harvested in 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (RIPA buffer). Cell lysates (50 μg) were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at 140 V for 4 h and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidiene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics). For detection of IκBα protein, the polyvinylidiene difluoride filter was incubated for 3 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed toward human IκBα/MAD-3 protein clone C21 (1 μg/ml Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% Tween-20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin.

Immunoprecipitates were washed twice and mixed with 2× SDS Laemmeli loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to gel electrophoresis as described above. Bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against mouse or hamster IgG using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts of cells were prepared as described previously by McKinsey et al.(28McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

A 32P-radiolabeled duplex oliogonucleotide probe with NFκB consensus binding sites 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCGCAGGC-3′ was used as a template for the gel shift experiments (27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

DNA binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) were carried out on ice and contained 10 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of double-stranded probe, poly(dI-dC), (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol. NFκB super shift experiments were conducted with a murine antibody directed toward the p65 subunit of NFκB clone C20 (1 μg/ml Santa Cruz). Nuclear-protein complexes were resolved on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris-Borate EDTA, pH 8.0, and detected by autoradiography (33de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A.

To visualize apoptotic nuclei in cardiac myocytes in situ, ventricular myocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, and subjected to terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay (6Kirshenbaum L.A. de Moissac D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,38Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar). In brief, myocytes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in TdT buffer containing 140 mm sodium cocodylate, 1 mm cobalt chloride, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 units of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase and 1 nmol of fluorescein-conjugated dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following the TdT reaction, myocytes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides as previously reported (6Kirshenbaum L.A. de Moissac D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Data were obtained from at least three independent cell cultures with three replicates for each condition using ≥200 cells for each condition. Results were compared by Scheffe's multiple comparison test for analysis of variance and the unpaired two-tailed Student'st test, using a significance level of p < 0.05. Genomic DNA was isolated from ventricular myocytes for nucleosomal DNA fragmentation by gel electrophoresis as described previously (33de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To establish whether Bcl-2 could lead to activation of NFκB, 293 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene containing putative binding sites for NFκB (27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of Bcl-2. A 3.4-fold increase (p < 0.022) in luciferase reporter gene activity was observed in cells expressing Bcl-2 compared with control cells transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 alone (Fig.1). Similar effects were observed in TNFα-stimulated cells that served as a positive control for induction of NFκB gene activation. In contrast, however, cells transfected with a Bcl-2 cDNA lacking the N-terminal BH4 domain failed to activate NFκB-dependent gene transcription (p = 0.31) compared with cells transfected with wild type Bcl-2. Electromobility shift analysis of nuclear extract prepared from 293 cells revealed a significant increase in DNA binding activity of NFκB in cells expressing the wild type Bcl-2 but not the ΔBH4 deletion mutant of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus lane 4) compared with control cells (lanes 1 and6). A similar increase in the nuclear binding activity of NFκB was also observed in cells stimulated by TNFα (lane 5). Competition binding assays with 100-fold excess cold probe (lane 7) as well as supershift experiments with antibodies directed toward the p65 subunit (lane 8) confirmed that the migrating complex contained NFκB/p65. Because NFκB activity is largely influenced by IκBα, which sequesters NFκB in the cytoplasm, we determined whether the observed increase in nuclear NFκB binding activity and gene expression in the presence of Bcl-2 was due to a reduction in IκBα protein levels. Protein extracts of 293 cells expressing Bcl-2 and FLAG-tagged IκBα proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with a murine antibody directed toward IκBα. As shown in Fig.3, IκBα levels were significantly suppressed in cells expressing the wild type Bcl-2 but not the ΔBH4 mutant of Bcl-2 compared with vector transfected control cells. To confirm the notion that the conserved N-terminal BH4 domain of Bcl-2 is responsible for the underlying effects on IκBα activity, we utilized point substitution mutations of the BH4 domain that had been previously shown to disrupt the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 (14Lee L.C. Hunter J.J. Mujeeb A. Turck C. Parslow T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23284-23288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to cells transfected with wild type Bcl-2 that displayed a 1.9-fold reduction (p < 0.006) in IκBα activity compared with vector transfected control cells, cells transfected with the BH4 domain point mutants, with the exception of the I19G mutant, were not statistically different from vector transfected control cells (p = 2.77; Fig. 4,A and D). Interestingly, a small 0.60-fold reduction (p < 0.04) in IκBα activity was observed with the I19G BH4 mutant. To verify that the observed differences between wild type Bcl-2 and BH4 domain mutants on IκBα activity were not due to discrepancies in protein loading, the filter was stained with Ponceau S dye, which confirmed equivalent protein loading (Fig. 4 B). In addition, Western blot analysis of these samples revealed that the wild type and BH4 domain mutants were expressed to comparable levels (Fig.4 C), ruling out the possibility that the noted differences in IκBα activity were due to discrepancies in Bcl-2 protein expression. Furthermore, consistent with our Western blot data for IκBα, electromobility shift analysis for NFκB revealed that each of the point mutants tested with the exception of the I19G mutant were defective for directing NFκB-dependent DNA binding and were not significantly different from vector transfected control cells (Fig. 5). The fact that the I19G BH4 mutant had an intermediate effect on NFκB DNA binding compared with wild type Bcl-2 suggests that this residue may not be critical for directing IκBα degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 activated NFκB and suppressed apoptosis of ventricular myocytes provoked by TNFα plus cycloheximide (33de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because NFκB has been reported to be important for suppressing apoptosis in mammalian cells, we tested functional significance of our observations by determining whether a block to NFκB activation, would impair the ability of Bcl-2 to rescue TNFα-mediated apoptosis. For these studies we generated a recombinant adenovirus that encodes a mutant version of the IκBα molecule that contains serine to alanine point substitutions at amino acids 32 and 36, respectively. This renders IκBα defective for phosphorylation and degradation, thereby preventing NFκB activation (27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by gel shift analysis (Fig.6), the IκBα mutant prevented the increase in NFκB nuclear DNA binding activity mediated by Bcl-2, confirming that the IκBα mutant was functionally active in these cells. Furthermore, expression of the IκBα mutant impaired the ability of Bcl-2 to suppress apoptosis triggered by TNFα plus cycloheximide, demonstrated by the increased TUNEL positive nuclei (Fig. 7 A) and nucleosomal DNA laddering (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7NFκB activation is required for Bcl-2-mediated suppression of apoptosis in ventricular myocytes. A, histogram represents the percentage of apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotide nick-end-labeling TUNEL assay. 24 h after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Bcl-2 and IκBα mutant S32/36A (IκBMT) proteins to ventricular myocytes, cells were stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (CHX, 5 μg/ml) and assessed for evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay. In the absence of cycloheximide, TNFα does not provoke apoptosis of ventricular myocytes, (percent apoptosis; control (CNTL)versus TNFα; 5.6 ± 0.84% versus 7.5 ± 1.1%, p = 0.36). However, the combination of TNFα plus cycloheximide provokes apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated control cells or those stimulated with TNFα, (percent apoptosis; control versus TNF + cycloheximide, 5.6 ± 0.85%versus 38 ± 5.7%, p < 0.0002; TNFαversus TNFα + cycloheximide, 7.5 ± 1.1%versus 38 ± 5.7%, p < 0.0004). Bcl-2 reduced the incidence of apoptosis provoked by TNFα plus CHX, (percent apoptosis; TNFα + cycloheximide versus TNFα + cycloheximide + Bcl-2, 38 ± 5.7% versus 16 ± 2.3%, p < 0.002), consistent with our earlier data (33de Moissac D.

Inhibition of NFκB activation by IκBα S32/36A (IκBMT) impairs the ability of Bcl-2 to suppress apoptosis provoked by TNFα plus cycloheximide in ventricular myocytes (percent apoptosis; TNFα + cycloheximide + Bcl-2 versus TNFα + cycloheximide + Bcl-2 + IκBMT, 16 ± 2.3% versus 65 ± 9.8%,p < 0.001).

In the present study, we provide evidence for the regulation of IκBα activity by Bcl-2 through a mechanism that requires the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Precedence for cellular factors other than NFκB to be regulated by Bcl-2 has been documented (40Ivanov V.N. Deng G. Podack E.R. Malek T.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the mode by which the BH4 domain modulates IκBα activity is unknown, we have previously demonstrated that Bcl-2 leads to the phosphorylation of IκBα and degradation by the proteasome (33de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, our studies indicate that Bcl-2 does not directly interact with IκBα. 2D. de Moissac and L. A. Kirshenbaum, unpublished data. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that Bcl-2 modulates IκBα activity by interacting with one or more cellular factors that directly or indirectly activate NFκB. Alternatively, the BH4 domain could influence the activity of IκBα by interacting with one of the IκB kinases (41Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 42Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in view of the growing evidence that the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 is critical for the prevention of apoptosis, our finding that inhibition of NFκB activation impairs the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2 provides compelling evidence that links Bcl-2 to the NFκB signaling pathway for the suppression of apoptosis. A current model for the operation of Bcl-2 proposes that the BH4 domain binds to and sequesters factors leading to caspase activation and apoptosis. In this regard, the physical interaction of BH4 domain with mitochondrial Apaf-1 has reportedly been shown to inhibit association of Apaf-1 with cytochrome c and caspase 9, preventing the subsequent processing of caspase 3 (18Hu Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relationship between Bcl-2 and the NFκB signaling pathway becomes even more profound, given that activated caspase 3 can directly cleave the N-terminal segment of IκBα, resulting in a peptide fragment that inhibits NFκB activation (31Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 35Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl-2 may in part operate through a mechanism that intersects the activation of caspases and of NFκB for the suppression of apoptosis. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the regulation of IκBα by Bcl-2 through a mechanism that requires the conserved BH4 domain and links Bcl-2 to the NFκB signaling pathway for the suppression of apoptosis.

Nevertheless, both GRK2-like and GRK4-like GRKs are capable of phosphorylating agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors. In the case of rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor, many individual sites of GRK phosphorylation by GRK2 and GRK5 are the same (8Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Premont R.T. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15294-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), indicating that these distinct kinases can exert similar effects on the receptor. However, it is also evident that GRK2-like and GRK4-like GRKs can have distinct functional effects on other G protein-coupled receptors (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Review Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). We have cloned the cDNAs encoding mouse GRKs 4, 5, and 6, and the genes for mouse GRK5 and 6. In this paper, we show that GRK4 alternative splicing is not conserved across species, whereas GRK6 alternative splicing is conserved in several species. Further, the conservation in gene organization within the GRK4 subfamily strongly supports the functional classification of these GRKs into a distinct subgroup. However, the amino acid sequences of the three individual GRKs in this subgroup appear to be evolving at vastly different rates. Restriction enzymes and thermostable polymerases were from Promega. TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen. Random-prime label reagents were from New England Biolabs. Nucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and radioisotopes from NEN Life Science Products. General laboratory chemicals were from Sigma. A mouse 129/SVJ genomic library in λFIXII vector was obtained from Stratagene. 1.2 × 106 plaques were hybridized with full-length human GRK4, bovine GRK5 and human GRK6 cDNA probes under standard conditions (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phage were sorted into three classes based on relative signal intensity with the three full-length GRK cDNA probes and were further sorted by hybridization to amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal region probes. XbaI-digested phage insert fragments were subcloned into pBS II for sequencing. Fragments were ordered using restriction mapping and Southern blotting, DNA sequencing, or polymerase chain reaction amplification of the phage DNA from primers derived from partial sequences of subcloned fragments, in which caseXbaI junctions were confirmed by direct sequencing of the resulting DNA bands. In addition, some intron regions were amplified from phage templates using flanking exon primers, and the resulting DNA bands were subjected to DNA sequencing directly. Amplification reactions were performed for 15 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min using reagents as described below. Internal regions were sequenced from specific primers, and all regions were sequenced on both strands of DNA. Sequencing was performed using dye terminator cycle sequencing using ABI Prism AmpliTaq FS reagent (Perkin-Elmer), and reactions were visualized on ABI 373 or ABI 377 instruments. Raw sequence data were edited using EditView and AutoAssembler software (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed using GeneWorks (Intelligenetics). Mouse GRK cDNA sequences were obtained by amplification of mouse tissue first strand cDNA using degenerate oligonucleotide primers (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA was synthesized from mouse brain and testis poly(A) RNA (CLONTECH) as described previously (11Premont R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amplification reactions were performed in 100 μl of volume containing 1× polymerase buffer (Promega), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, 500 nm of each primer, and 10 ng of first strand cDNA. Reactions were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and initiated by addition of 2.5 units of polymerase to each tube, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The polymerase used was a mixture ofTaq and Tli polymerases (Promega), mixed 40:1 by units. The amino-terminal and catalytic domain sequences were obtained using a forward primer (5′-CGAGGCCATGGARCTIGARAAYATIGTIGC) 2Degenerate nucleotide codes in oligonucleotide primers are: S = C and G, W = A and T, R = A and G, Y = C and T, I = inosine. Restriction sites in primers are underlined. based on the highly conserved amino acid sequence MELENIVA at the extreme 5′ end of GRKs 4, 5, and 6, whereas the reverse primer (5′-GCCCTTCTCGAGGACYTCIGGIGCCATRWAICC) was based on the conserved catalytic domain sequence of all known GRKs, GYMAPEV (5Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate size products were subcloned and sequenced. Brain cDNA yielded GRK5 and GRK6 sequences, whereas testis cDNA yielded the GRK4 sequence. The extreme 5′ coding region and 5′-untranslated region sequences of GRK5 and GRK6 were obtained by two rounds of amplification from nested gene-specific antisense primers and the CLONTECH RACE anchor primer (5′-CTGGTTCGGCCCACCTCTGAAGGTTCCAGAATCGATAG) using mouse brain 5′ RACE-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as template. The GRK5 primers used were: 1° rxn, 5′-CTTTGGAGTGAGGTACTTGGTCAT, and 2° rxn, 5′-CACTAAGTCCAGGAACTGAATGTA. The GRK6 primers were: 1° rxn, 5′-CGTGTGGCTCAGAAAGTTCTGCAT, and 2° rxn, 5′-CACCCCATCCAGGGAGGCAGTACA. DNA bands were subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The carboxyl-terminal coding regions were obtained using gene-specific forward primers (GRK5, 5′-AAGTTCTCCGAGGAGGCCAAG, and GRK6, 5′-GATCTAAAGCCAGAGAATATCCTT), and reverse primers were based on the carboxyl-terminal sequences of bovine GRK5 (5′-AGGCCAGTCGACTCACTAGCTGCTTCCGGTGGAGTTTGA) and of human GRK6 (5′-TCGGGCGAATTCCTAGAGGCGGGTGGGGAG). The 3′-untranslated region sequences were obtained by amplification using primers based on partial sequences deposited in the EST data base (GRK4, EST AA110341, 5′-ACCAAGTCTAGACTCTGTGGTCTGCACAGTGAATGG; GRK5, EST W91298, 5′-CCAGAGTCTAGACTAGC-TGCTTCCAGTGGAGTTTGA; GRK6(A/B), ESTAA244873, 5′-CCAGTGGCTGAGGAACGGAGGACA; GRK6(C), EST AA103881, 5′-CTCTGTCCATCCCCCTGGACAGAC). EST sequences were obtained using BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) to identify sequences with similarity to known GRKs. All DNAs were sequenced on both strands as described above and also were compared with genomic exon sequences. Mouse multiple tissue and whole embryonic Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Total RNAs were isolated from mouse testes at various ages after birth (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5 μg of testes total RNAs were separated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH), and washed at high stringency following the manufacturer's protocol. Amino-terminal probes (200–300 bp) for each of mouse GRKs 4, 5, and 6, as well as a GRK6C-specific 3′-untranslated region probe, were amplified from mouse cDNAs and subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Insert DNAs were gel purified and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Equivalent amounts of probe were used for each blot. Genomic localization was determined by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (13Orita M. Iwahana H. Kanazawa H. Hayashi K. Sekiya T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (3402) Google Scholar) using genomic DNAs from the European Collaborative Interspecific Mouse Backcross panel (14Breen M. Deakin L. MacDonald B. Miller S. Sibson R. Tarttelin E. Avner P. Bourgade F. Guenet J.L. Montagutelli X. Poirier C. Simon D. Tailor D. Bishop M. Kelly M Rysavy F Rastan S. Norris D. Shepherd D. Abbott C. Pilz A. Hodge S. Jackson I.

The primer pair for GRK4 (5′-GGTTTCTATTGCTACCAAGAGACAT; 5′-TGCACCAAACCCTGGACTAAGCAT) amplified a 410-bp region within intron F. The primer pair for mouse GRK5 (5′-ACCTATGCCTCCCTTTCTATTCTC; 5′-TTACAACTTCTCCCATCCCAGTGT) amplified a 174-bp region of intron D. The primer pair for mouse GRK6 (5′-CACATTCGGATCTCGGACCTGGGA; 5′-CTCACAGGCCCACCCAGTCCTAGG) amplified a 350-bp region including exon IX and intron K which contains a GT repeat. 10 ng of individualMus musculus (C57Bl/6) × Mus spretusbackcross mouse genomic DNA (14Breen M.

Polymerase chain reaction products were denatured and separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 10% glycerol. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film, and polymorphic bands were scored for species origin. Polymorphisms were analyzed, and locus order was determined using the Map Manager program (15Manly K.F. Elliott R.W. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Absolute map positions on mouse chromosomes as well as nearby mouse genes and syntenic human chromosome regions were identified using the chromosome maps of the mouse genome data base through the Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome at the Jackson Labs. Protein sequences corresponding to all known mammalian GRKs, and to those from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, were obtained from the GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases using BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) and aligned using ClustalX. The resulting alignment was used as the framework to align the cDNA sequences encoding these protein sequences. These two alignments were then used for subsequent inferences of phylogenetic relationships. For proteins, trees were calculated using the NJ method (with bootstrap resampling of 1000 subreplicates) and, independently, using maximum parsimony (PROTPARS) in the PHYLIP (16Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) suite of programs. For DNA sequences, the alignment was used directly in the NJ method, a maximum likelihood method (DNAML), and was also used to calculate a distance matrix (DNADIST), which was used in the Fitch-Margoliash least squares methods (with and without clock assumptions). All of the trees produced were unrooted. Tree topologies were drawn with DRAWGRAM. Pairwise identities between proteins or nucleic acid sequences were computed during multiple alignment. To examine the GRK4 subfamily in a single species, the mouse GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 cDNA and gene sequences were determined. The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 are shown in Fig.1 A. Mouse GRK4 is 574 amino acids in length, with a predicted mass of 66.8 kDa. This mouse GRK sequence is only 77% identical to human GRK4, a degree of homology low enough to raise the possibility that this might represent a novel GRK4-like sequence. However, gene mapping and Northern blotting experiments (see below) indicate that this sequence does represent the mouse GRK4 homolog. Mouse GRK4 retains a single carboxyl-terminal domain cysteine residue (Cys560) as a potential site for palmitoylation, in contrast to the two potential sites in human GRK4 (6Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6403-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Human GRK4 mRNA and protein has been shown to exist in four forms, which arise from the alternative splicing of exons II and XV (6Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6403-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas rat GRK4 has been reported to undergo distinct alternative splicing of exons VI, VII, and XIV (17Virlon B. Firsov D. Cheval L. Reiter E. Troispoux C. Guillou F. Elalouf J.-M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2784-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Amplification of the amino-terminal, central, and carboxyl-terminal domains of the GRK4 cDNA from mouse testis cDNA and isolated mouse germ cell cDNA yielded only single product bands (data not shown), evidence that alternative splicing of the mouse GRK4 mRNA is not prominent. Mouse GRK4 appears to exist as only a single form, equivalent to the longest (α-variant) of human and rat GRK4 (6Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J.

Elalouf J.-M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2784-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mouse GRK5 is 590 amino acids in length, with a predicted size of 67.6 kDa. This mouse GRK5 sequence is 99% identical to rat and 95% identical to human and bovine GRK5. Mouse GRK5 retains the major autophosphorylation sites (Ser503-Thr504) localized in bovine and human GRK5 (5Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the presumed protein kinase C sites (Ser566 and Ser572) found in human GRK5 (19Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mouse GRK5 contains an amino-terminal phosphatidylinositol binding polybasic region (K22RKGKSKK) (7Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), as well as a carboxyl-terminal region rich in basic and serine residues (5Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRK6 has recently been reported to exist as two splice variants in the rat, called GRK6A and GRK6B (20Firsov D. Elalouf J.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat GRK6A and B differ in the sequence of the extreme carboxyl-terminal region, where the addition of 2 bp in the type B mRNA leads to a shift in the reading frame. Amplification of mouse GRK6 cDNA sequences using both an extreme carboxyl-terminal primer and a 3′-untranslated region primer led to the identification of these two variants of the mouse GRK6 cDNA as well (Fig. 1 B). In addition, searches of the GenBankTM EST data base confirmed the presence of mouse EST sequences encoding GRK6A and B variants, as well as a third GRK6 variant we call GRK6C (Fig. 1 B). Mouse GRK6C appears to arise from the use of a novel last exon (see below) that encodes only a single amino acid, arginine, before the termination codon. Mouse GRK6A has 576 residues and a predicted size of 65.9 kDa, mouse GRK6B has 589 residues and a size of 67.0 kDa, and mouse GRK6C has 560 residues and a calculated size of 64.2 kDa. The mouse GRK6 sequences are 99% identical to rat and 97% identical to human GRK6. All variants of mouse GRK6 retain the Thr504 residue in the autophosphorylation region, although this site appears not to autophosphorylate in human GRK6 (21Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the mouse GRK6A carboxyl-terminal region (17 residues) is identical to those of rat and human and contains the three carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues that are the sites of palmitoylation (22Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the GRK6B variant carboxyl-terminal region (30 residues) has only one conservative difference with that of rat (Arg570 to Lys) and has five differences with the equivalent region of human GRK6B (Fig.1 B). Mouse GRK6B contains a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site at Ser573, which is also conserved in rat and human sequences. Like mouse GRK6C, rat and human GRK6C also end with a single arginine residue (Fig. 1 B). The type C variant has a truncated carboxyl-terminal region compared with GRK6 A or B and lacks both the sites of palmitoylation in GRK6A and the consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase site found in GRK6B. Because of the quite low similarity of the mouse GRK4 sequence with human GRK4, we were unsure whether this represented a novel GRK4-like kinase. Therefore, we documented the pattern of the expression of this mRNA in adult tissues and during embryonic development in the mouse, along with those of the more highly conserved GRK5 and GRK6 homologs (Fig.2 A). Hybridization of mouse Northern blots with probes specific for each of GRKs 4–6 shows the distinct patterns of expression for each previously described in other species (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Review Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). GRK6 is widely expressed at high levels, GRK5 is highly expressed in the heart and lung with widespread low expression, and GRK4 expression is quite high but confined to the testis, as expected from the distribution of human GRK4 mRNA (6Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Further, probing the mouse tissue Northern blot with a human GRK4 probe revealed hybridization only to a testis mRNA species of the same size (data not shown). In the developing embryo, GRK6 mRNA is highly expressed at all stages of development. GRK4 mRNA expression is not detected in the developing embryo. Finally, although it appears that GRK5 mRNA is most prevalent in the day 7 embryo, these samples contain placenta, 3Dr. Patricia Whaley, personal communication. a tissue that has previously been shown to express high levels of GRK5 (25Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the GRK4 mRNA is readily apparent in testis RNA from adults but is not detected in whole embryo RNA, RNAs isolated from mouse testes at various ages after birth were blotted and hybridized to mouse GRK4 probe (Fig. 2 B). No GRK4 hybridization is apparent until after post-partum day 16. GRK4 mRNA is expressed at high levels from day 18 after birth, and expression continues through adulthood. In contrast, GRK2 mRNA is present at a low level in the testis at all times examined (data not shown). In the development of the testis in mouse, day 18 marks the first appearance of secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids (26Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). From the timing of the onset of GRK4 mRNA accumulation, it appears that GRK4 gene transcription is initiated in the developing male germ cells during the late pachytene stage in spermatocytes, just prior to the first meiotic division (26Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 27Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. SinhaHikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar). The GRK4 protein has been reported to be present in mature sperm cells, and the GRK4 mRNA has been observed in a spermatogonial cell line by Northern blotting and in spermatocytes and spermatids by RNA in situ hybridization (17Virlon B. Firsov D. Cheval L. Reiter E. Troispoux C. Guillou F. Elalouf J.-M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2784-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Sallese M. Mariggio S. Collodel G. Moretti E. Piomboni P. Baccetti B. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10188-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of mRNA encoding the GRK6C variant was examined using a probe specific for this form (Fig. 2 C). Specific hybridization to a 3.8-kb mRNA band was observed in all tissues, but at a quite low level that required a much longer exposure compared with the “common” GRK6 probe (compare Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the levels of GRK6C mRNA appear relatively high in the day 11 and day 15 mouse embryo, suggesting that this variant may be developmentally regulated. Because of the overlapping nature of exons 16A and 16B (Ref. 20Firsov D. Elalouf J.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and see below), mRNAs encoding the GRK6A and B variants cannot be distinguished by Northern blotting. To further confirm that the mouse GRK4 sequence represents the homolog of human GRK4, this gene was mapped to 20 centimorgans from the centromere of chromosome 5, near the D5MIT75 marker (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the known location of the GRK4 gene, because GRK4 was identified by positional cloning at human chromosome band 4p16.3 in the search for the Huntington's disease locus, and the GRK4 gene lies immediately adjacent to the Huntington's disease gene in both the human and mouse genomes (24Ambrose C.

https://openalex.org/W2042670071,"In this study, the ability of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to prime rat and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse islets for interleukin-1 (IL-1)-stimulated expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) has been examined. IL-1-induced iNOS expression by rat islets is concentration-dependent with maximal expression occurring in response to 1.0 unit/ml. Individually, neither 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 nor 150 units/ml IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression or nitrite production by rat islets. However, a 30–60-min pulse of rat islets with IFN-γ, followed by washing to remove the cytokine and continued culture with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 for 40 h, results in iNOS expression and nitrite production to levels similar in magnitude to the individual effects of 1.0 unit/ml IL-1. A 1-h pulse with IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced islet degeneration that is mediated by the expression of iNOS and increased production of nitric oxide. IFN-γ also primes for IL-1-induced iNOS expression and nitrite formation by NOD mouse islets. The priming actions of IFN-γ appear to be selective for β-cells, as IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced nitrite formation by primary β-cells and RINm5F insulinoma cells, but not primary α-cells. The priming actions of IFN-γ for IL-1-induced iNOS expression do not requirede novo protein synthesis as preincubation of RINm5F cells with cycloheximide does not inhibit iNOS mRNA accumulation under priming conditions. The priming actions of IFN-γ on IL-1-induced iNOS expression persists for extended periods of up to 7 days and are associated with persistent signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 activation. A 30-min pulse of rat islets with IFN-γ stimulates STAT1 phosphorylation, and STAT1 remains phosphorylated for up to 7 days following IFN-γ removal. In addition, STAT1 remains nuclear for up to 7 days after IFN-γ removal. These results indicate that IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced islet degeneration via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. These findings also provide evidence that the priming actions of IFN-γ for IL-1-induced iNOS expression by islets are associated with the prolonged phosphorylation and activation of STAT1. In this study, the ability of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to prime rat and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse islets for interleukin-1 (IL-1)-stimulated expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) has been examined. IL-1-induced iNOS expression by rat islets is concentration-dependent with maximal expression occurring in response to 1.0 unit/ml. Individually, neither 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 nor 150 units/ml IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression or nitrite production by rat islets. However, a 30–60-min pulse of rat islets with IFN-γ, followed by washing to remove the cytokine and continued culture with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 for 40 h, results in iNOS expression and nitrite production to levels similar in magnitude to the individual effects of 1.0 unit/ml IL-1. A 1-h pulse with IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced islet degeneration that is mediated by the expression of iNOS and increased production of nitric oxide. IFN-γ also primes for IL-1-induced iNOS expression and nitrite formation by NOD mouse islets. The priming actions of IFN-γ appear to be selective for β-cells, as IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced nitrite formation by primary β-cells and RINm5F insulinoma cells, but not primary α-cells. The priming actions of IFN-γ for IL-1-induced iNOS expression do not requirede novo protein synthesis as preincubation of RINm5F cells with cycloheximide does not inhibit iNOS mRNA accumulation under priming conditions. The priming actions of IFN-γ on IL-1-induced iNOS expression persists for extended periods of up to 7 days and are associated with persistent signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 activation. A 30-min pulse of rat islets with IFN-γ stimulates STAT1 phosphorylation, and STAT1 remains phosphorylated for up to 7 days following IFN-γ removal. In addition, STAT1 remains nuclear for up to 7 days after IFN-γ removal. These results indicate that IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced islet degeneration via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. These findings also provide evidence that the priming actions of IFN-γ for IL-1-induced iNOS expression by islets are associated with the prolonged phosphorylation and activation of STAT1. interleukin-1β interferon-γ aminoguanidine inducible nitric-oxide synthase signal transducers and activators of transcription nonobese diabetic Janus kinase gamma-activated sequence interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein fluorescence-activated cell sorting cycloheximide Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease characterized by an inflammatory reaction in and around pancreatic islets followed by selective destruction of insulin-secreting β-cells. Cytokines such as IL-11 and IFN-γ, and the free radical nitric oxide, have been implicated as effector molecules that participate in the initial destruction of β-cells leading to the development of disease. Southern et al. first demonstrated that treatment of rat islets with IL-1 results in the inhibition of insulin secretion that is attenuated by co-incubation with the iNOS inhibitor, N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (1Southern C.

The inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on islet function and viability are mediated, in part, by the ability of nitric oxide to target and inhibit the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, including aconitase and the electron transport chain complexes I and II (2Welsh N.

IL-1 has also been shown to reduce islet cellular levels of ATP and to inhibit glucose oxidation in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (2Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S.

Transgenic mice expressing IFN-γ under control of the insulin promotor develop insulitis and diabetes (13Sarvetnick N. Liggitt D. Pitts S.L. Hansen S.E. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Also, IFN-γ mRNA expression correlates with the development of insulitis and diabetes in the NOD mouse, and antiserum specific for IFN-γ attenuates the development of diabetes in these mice (8Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Sorenson O. Bleaklet R.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Campbell I.L. Kay T.W.H. Oxbrow L. Harrison L. J. Clin.

Autoimmun. 1991; 4: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have shown that IFN-γ reduces the concentration of IL-1 required to stimulate iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by rat islets, primary β-cells, and insulinoma RINm5F cells by 10-fold from 1.0 to 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Individually, IFN-γ and 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 do not induce iNOS expression or nitric oxide formation; however, in combination, IFN-γ and 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 potently inhibit insulin secretion and induce islet degeneration in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In 1990, Baquerizo et al. (16Baquerizo H. Rabinovitch A. J. Autoimmun. 1990; 3 Suppl. 1: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a short pulse of islet-cell monolayers with IFN-γ sensitizes or primes islet-cells for IL-1-induced cytolysis as determined by a modified 51Cr release assay. The priming effect was observed only when the islet cells were pulsed with IFN-γ, not IL-1, and persisted for up to 3–6 days following the removal of IFN-γ. The mechanism by which IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced cytotoxicity, however, is not known. In this study, we have examined the mechanism by which IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced islet degeneration. IFN-γ activates a family of transcription factors known as the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (reviewed in Ref. 17Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). In response to IFN-γ, STAT1 is recruited to the IFN-γ receptor where it is tyrosine phosphorylated by Janus kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Thus activated, STAT1 homodimers translocate to the nucleus and activate new gene transcription by binding to consensus gamma-activated sequences (GAS sites). The 5′-untranslated region of the mouse iNOS gene contains three GAS sites (18Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that a 30-min pulse of islets with IFN-γ followed by removal of IFN-γ by washing and further incubation with submaximal concentrations of IL-1 (0.1 unit/ml) results in islet degeneration that is mediated by iNOS expression and increased nitric oxide production. The priming actions of IFN-γ persist for extended periods of up to 7 days and appear to be associated with increased phosphorylation and activation of transcription factor STAT1. These findings suggest that prolonged activation of STAT1 may be one mechanism by which IFN-γ primes islets for IL-1-induced iNOS expression and islet degeneration.

Islets were isolated from male Sprague Dawley rats or NOD mice by collagenase digestion as described previously (19Colca McDaniel ML J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following isolation, islets were cultured overnight in complete CMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 containing 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Prior to each experiment, islets were washed three times in complete CMRL-1066, counted, and then cultured for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Experiments were initiated by incubating islets for 30–60 min (pulse) with IFN-γ or IL-1, washing three times with complete CMRL to remove the cytokine, and then culturing the islets for 0–7 days in complete CMRL as indicated. IL-1 or IFN-γ was then added as indicated, and the islets were incubated for an additional 24–40 h. Isolated rat islets were pulsed for 1 h with 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ, washed three times with complete CMRL-1066, and then dispersed into individual cells by treatment with trypsin (1.0 mg/ml) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 37 °C for 3 min as described previously (20Ono J. Takaki R. Fukuma M. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1977; 24: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dispersed islet cells were then counted and plated (200,000 cells/200 μl of complete CMRL-1066) into 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 24 h with or without IFN-γ, IL-1, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) as indicated. Islets, isolated from 12 rats, were cultured overnight (∼1, 200 islets/3 ml) in complete CMRL-1066 media under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Islet degeneration was determined in a double-blind manner by phase-contrast microscopic analysis. Islet degeneration is characterized by the loss of islet integrity, disintegration, and partial dispersion of islets as described previously (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

Detection of iNOS and STAT1 were by ECL according to manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat islets (50/400 μl of complete CMRL-1066) were pulsed for 30 min with IFN-γ, washed three times with complete CMRL, and cultured as indicated in 24-well microtiter plates in the absence of cytokine. The islets were isolated and dispersed into single cells by trypsin treatment as described above. The cells were isolated (400 × g, 2 min), washed three times with 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and transferred to Superfrost/Plus microscope slides by cytospin. The slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and immunohistochemistry was performed as described (26Stout L.R. Svensson A.M. Sorenson R.L.

RINm5F cells (5 × 106 cells/3 ml of complete CMRL-1066) or rat islets (1000 islets/3 ml of complete CMRL-1066) were pulsed for 1 h with IFN-γ, washed three times with complete CMRL-1066, and cultured for 6 and 12 h at 37 °C with IL-1 and cycloheximide (CHX) as indicated. After culture, total RNA was isolated from the cells and islets, and iNOS mRNA accumulation was determined by Northern blot analysis as described previously (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described previously (27Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp.

Rat islets (500 islets/ml of complete CMRL-1066) were pulsed with 150 units/ml IFN-γ for 30 min, washed three times in complete CMRL-1066, and then cultured for 8 or 24 h in complete CMRL-1066. The islets were then dispersed into single cells by trypsin treatment as described above. Nuclear proteins were isolated and gel shift analysis was performed as described (28Heitmeier M.R.

The STAT1 probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image, Version 1.59, using a COHU high performance CCD camera (Brookfield, WI). Densities were determined using NIH Image, Version 1.59, software. Phosphoimaging analysis of mRNA accumulation was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImagerTM and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Software, Version 3.3. Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (29Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between treatment groups were evaluated using a Scheffe's F-test post hoc analysis. The priming actions of IFN-γ on nitrite formation were examined by incubating rat islets for 1 h with 150 units/ml IFN-γ, the cytokine was removed by washing, and the islets were incubated for an additional 40 h with or without 0.1 or 1.0 unit/ml IL-1. Under IFN-γ pulse conditions, both 0.1 and 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 stimulate ∼3-fold increase in nitrite production that is similar in magnitude to the levels produced in response to a 40-h continuous culture with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 or 150 units/ml IFN-γ + 0.1 unit/ml IL-1. Importantly, neither 150 units/ml IFN-γ nor 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 stimulate nitrite production by rat islets, and islets pulsed with 0.1 (data not shown) or 1.0 unit/ml IL-1, followed by stimulation with 150 units/ml IFN-γ also do not produce nitric oxide (Fig.1 a). To examine the time-dependent effects of IFN-γ priming for IL-1-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation, rat islets were pulsed for 1 h with 150 units/ml IFN-γ, the cytokine was removed by washing, and the islets were further incubated for 6 or 12 h in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml IL-1. Under these pulse conditions, iNOS mRNA accumulation is maximal following a 6-h incubation and reduced to background levels following a 12-h exposure (Fig. 1 b). These results are in contrast to the effects of 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 on iNOS expression, in which maximal mRNA accumulation occurs following a 6-h incubation and persists for periods up to 12 h (Fig. 1 b). Alone, neither 150 units/ml IFN-γ nor 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 stimulates iNOS mRNA accumulation by rat islets (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), nor does a 1-h pulse of rat islets with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 followed by a 6- or 12-h incubation with 150 units/ml IFN-γ (data not shown). Although the levels of iNOS mRNA which accumulate in response to 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 following a 6 h exposure are ∼5-fold higher than the levels which accumulate under priming conditions, the levels of iNOS protein that accumulate under both conditions are similar. As shown in Fig. 1 c, a 1-h pulse of rat islets with 150 units/ml IFN-γ followed by a 40-h incubation with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 results in the expression of iNOS to levels that are similar in magnitude to the levels observed in response to a 40-h continuous incubation with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1. Importantly, neither 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 nor 150 units/ml IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression, nor does a 1-h pulse with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 followed by a 40-h incubation with IFN-γ (Fig. 1 c). These findings indicate that IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced nitrite formation and iNOS mRNA and protein expression by rat islets. The priming actions of IFN-γ on iNOS expression by NOD mouse islets were examined because: 1) IFN-γ appears to play a primary role in the development of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice (5Heitmeier M.R.

Mikhael A. Shimizu J. Frederick K. Misko T.P. McDaniel M.L. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8992-8995Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Rabinovitch A.

Histochemical J. 1997; 29: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In these experiments, isolated NOD mouse islets were pulsed for 1 h with 150 units/ml mouse IFN-γ, washed, and then incubated for an additional 40 h with 15 units/ml IL-1. As shown in Fig. 2, a pulse of NOD mouse islets with mouse IFN-γ followed by incubation with IL-1 results in an ∼6-fold increase in nitrite formation and high levels of iNOS expression (inset). Under these priming conditions, the levels of iNOS expressed and nitrite produced are similar in magnitude to the effects of a 40-h continuous incubation of NOD mouse islets with IFN-γ + IL-1 (Fig. 2, compare lanes C and F, respectively). Importantly, IL-1 does not prime NOD mouse islets for IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression or nitrite formation (Fig. 2,lane E); and NOD mouse islets treated for 40 continuous h with IL-1 or IFN-γ alone do not produce nitrite (Fig. 2). These results indicate that IFN-γ primes for IL-1-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide formation by NOD mouse islets. Incubation of rat islets for 96 h with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1, or 150 units/ml IFN-γ + 0.1 unit/ml IL-1, results in islet degeneration, an effect that is attenuated by the iNOS inhibitor, AG (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Alone, 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 and 150 units/ml IFN-γ do not induce islet degeneration following a 96-h incubation; however, a 1-h pulse of rat islets with 150 units/ml IFN-γ followed by washing to remove the cytokine and further incubation for 96 h with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 results in the degeneration of ∼70% of the islets (Fig. 3). AG prevents islet degeneration under these priming conditions, indicating that the destructive effects of this treatment are mediated by nitric oxide. A 1-h pulse with 150 units/ml IFN-γ, followed by incubation for 96 h in the absence of cytokine, or a 1-h pulse with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1, followed by incubation for 96 h in the presence of 150 units/ml IFN-γ, does not induce islet degeneration. These findings indicate that IFN-γ primes islets for IL-1-induced islet degeneration and that the destructive effects are mediated by the production of nitric oxide. Because β-cells are the islet cellular source of iNOS in response to IL-1 (30Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and the cell type selectively destroyed during the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the effects of IFN-γ priming on iNOS expression by this cell type were examined. Treatment of β-cells purified by FACS with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 or 150 units/ml IFN-γ + 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 stimulates high levels of iNOS expression following a 40-h incubation (Fig.4, lower panel). Alone, neither 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 nor 150 units/ml IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression by primary β-cells. However, β-cells pulsed for 1 h with 150 units/ml IFN-γ, followed by washing and a 40-h incubation with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1, express iNOS to levels similar in magnitude to the effects of a 40-h continuous incubation with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 or 150 units/ml IFN-γ + 0.1 unit/ml IL-1. A 1-h pulse of primary β-cells with 150 units/ml IFN-γ followed by washing and a 40-h incubation with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 results in iNOS expression that slightly exceeds the levels induced in response to 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 or 150 units/ml IFN-γ + 0.1 unit/ml IL-1; however, the levels of nitrite that accumulate under these conditions are similar (data not shown). In addition, similar results have been obtained in the insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. A 5-min pulse of RINm5F cells with 150 units/ml IFN-γ followed by washing and a further 24-h incubation with 0.1 unit/ml IL-1 results in iNOS expression and nitric oxide formation to levels similar in magnitude to those observed in response to a 24-h incubation with 1.0 unit/ml IL-1 alone (33.6 pmol/2000 cells under priming conditions, 40.1 pmol/2000 cells for IL-1 treated versus 1.3 pmol/2000 cells for control untreated RINm5F cells). The priming actions of IFN-γ appear to be specific for β-cells, as this cytokine"

In order to understand more precisely the molecular mechanisms by which α-actinin might contribute to the formation and maintenance of the contractile apparatus within muscle cells, we performed a screen to identify novel α-actinin binding partners present in chicken smooth muscle cells. In this paper, we report the identification, purification, and characterization of a 36-kDa smooth muscle protein (p36) that interacts with α-actinin. Using a variety of in vitro binding assays, we demonstrate that the association between α-actinin and p36 is direct, specific, and saturable and exhibits a moderate affinity. Furthermore, native co-immunoprecipitation reveals that the two proteins are complexed in vivo. p36 is expressed in cardiac muscle and tissues enriched in smooth muscle. Interestingly, in skeletal muscle, a closely related protein of 40 kDa (p40) is detected. The expression of p36 and p40 is dramatically up-regulated during smooth and skeletal muscle differentiation, respectively, and p40 colocalizes with α-actinin at the Z-lines of differentiated myotubes. We have established the relationship between p36 and p40 by molecular cloning of cDNAs that encode both proteins and have determined that they are the products of a single gene. Both proteins display an identical N-terminal PDZ domain and an identical C-terminal LIM domain; an internal 63-amino acid sequence present in p36 is replaced by a unique 111-amino acid sequence in p40. Analysis of the sequences of p36 and p40 suggest that they are the avian forms of the actinin-associated LIM proteins (ALPs) recently described in rat (Xia, H., Winokur, S. T., Kuo, W.-L., Altherr, M. R., and Bredt, D. S. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 139, 507–515). The expression of the human ALP gene has been postulated to be affected by mutations that cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy; thus, the characterization of ALP function may ultimately provide insight into the mechanism of this disease. α-Actinin is required for the organization and function of the contractile machinery of muscle.

Locomotion depends on the ability of skeletal muscle to contract rapidly, blood circulation depends on cardiac muscle contraction, and involuntary movements such as peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract depend on smooth muscle function. In skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, the contractile apparatus is organized into functional units called sarcomeres, each of which is bordered by a structure known as the Z-disc. The Z-discs serve to anchor the actin filaments at the ends of the sarcomere. In smooth muscle cells, the actin- and myosin-rich contractile machinery is organized quite differently; rather than appearing in semicrystalline sarcomeric arrays, the contractile elements are obliquely organized. The smooth muscle contractile apparatus exhibits no Z-discs but instead has two other structures, dense bodies and dense plaques, that are thought to anchor and integrate the actin filaments within the muscle cells (2Small J.V. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Z-discs, dense bodies, and dense plaques thus appear to play parallel, central roles in muscle cytoarchitecture and function. Perhaps not surprisingly, given their similar roles in different muscle types, Z-discs, dense bodies and dense plaques are all enriched in α-actinin, a major structural protein present in all muscle cells (3Masaki T. Endo M. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1967; 62: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Geiger B. Dutton A.J. Tokuyasu K.T. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 614-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). α-Actinin is an actin filament cross-linking protein that exists as an antiparallel homodimer in muscle and nonmuscle cells (5Burridge K. Feramisco J.R. Nature. 1981; 294: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Endo T. Masaki T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 92: 1457-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In nonmuscle cells, α-actinin is found periodically along the actin stress fibers, where it is thought to be involved in bundling actin thin filaments into stress fibers (7Lazarides E. Burridge K. Cell. 1975; 6: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Nonmuscle α-actinin is also present at the ends of the stress fibers, in focal adhesions, where it binds the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β1 subunit, an observation that suggests a molecular mechanism by which α-actinin might link microfilaments to the cell membrane (8Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). α-Actinin also appears to play a key role in organizing the actin machinery in muscle; for example, high resolution electron microscopic analyses have illustrated that, in the Z-discs of striated muscle, α-actinin forms cross-links that anchor actin filaments (10Cheng N. Deatherage J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1761-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Deatherage J.F. Cheng N. Bullard B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have clarified substantially the central role of α-actinin in muscle structure and function. In Drosophila, α-actinin loss-of-function mutations perturb Z-disc integrity and disrupt myofibrillar attachments to tendon cells (12Fyrberg E. Kelly M. Ball E. Fyrberg C. Reedy M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Roulier E.M. Fyrberg C. Fyrberg E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These structural abnormalities are associated with reduced muscle function and lead to progressive paralysis and larval lethality (12Fyrberg E. Kelly M. Ball E. Fyrberg C. Reedy M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Certain weaker α-actinin alleles affect the morphology and function of thoracic muscles, leading to a flightless phenotype (12Fyrberg E. Kelly M. Ball E. Fyrberg C. Reedy M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It appears that, in Drosophila, α-actinin is not absolutely required for the assembly of the contractile machinery during development, since embryogenesis proceeds normally. Rather, α-actinin appears to play a critical role in anchoring and stabilizing the contractile filaments against the forces of muscle contraction. α-Actinin-rich structures also perform critical functions in muscle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans, actin filaments of the body wall muscle cells are attached to the plasma membrane through α-actinin-rich structures called dense bodies (14Francis G.R. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1532-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The function of the dense bodies resembles that of the Z-lines and the dense plaques of the vertebrate striated and smooth muscles, respectively. Although mutations in the C. elegans gene encoding α-actinin have not been described, mutations that affect other dense body constituents have been characterized. For example, nematode dense bodies contain vinculin and worms that lack vinculin function display disorganized muscle and are paralyzed (15Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, a defect in the organization of the α-actinin-rich dense bodies compromises muscle cytoarchitecture and function. Despite the well established and apparently universal importance of α-actinin-rich structures for the subcellular organization and function of diverse muscle types, little is known about other proteins that cooperate with α-actinin in the establishment and maintenance of the contractile machinery. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism by which α-actinin participates in the stabilization of the contractile elements during muscle contraction, we sought to identify novel α-actinin-binding partners. Here we report the identification, purification, and characterization of a 36-kDa α-actinin-binding partner (p36) that is expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle. By a variety of binding studies, we demonstrate that the association of p36 with α-actinin is direct, specific, and saturable. We have also identified a higher molecular weight isoform, called p40, that is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle and is colocalized with α-actinin at the Z-lines. Furthermore, the expression of both p36 and p40 is induced upon muscle differentiation, raising the possibility that these cytoskeletal PDZ-LIM proteins play a critical role in the organization of actin filament arrays within muscle cells. Characterization of the domain structures of p36 and p40 has revealed the presence of an N-terminal PDZ domain (16Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal LIM domain (17Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) in each protein. Sequence analysis revealed that the proteins described here are likely to be the avian homologues of the actinin-associated LIM protein (ALP),1 a candidate for the protein affected in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (1Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.-L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Frozen chicken gizzards were used to extract avian smooth muscle proteins as described previously (18Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins present in the extract were precipitated with increasing amounts of ammonium sulfate: 0–15%, 15–27%, 27–34%, 34–43%, and 43–61% saturation. α-Actinin was purified from the 27–34% ammonium sulfate precipitate (19Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The 36-kDa α-actinin-binding partner, called p36, was purified from the 15–27% ammonium sulfate precipitate. All the different purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer B10 (20 mmTris acetate, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed overnight against buffer B10. The mixture of proteins was loaded on an 11 × 2-cm DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer B10. The proteins that fail to bind the matrix were applied to a 9 × 2-cm CM-cellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated in buffer B10. The bound proteins were eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–300 mm KCl prepared in buffer B10. Purified p36 was electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Ponceau S-stained, excised p36 bands were prepared and subjected to proteolytic cleavage using trypsin according to the procedure described by Fernandez et al.(20Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The proteolytic peptides were resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography using a reverse phase C-18 column (Waters Chromatography Division, Milford, MA). Sequence analysis of intact p36 or individual peptides was performed on a 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Purified α-actinin was radiolabeled using Na125I (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) as described previously (19Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The purity of the radioiodinated protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Blot overlay assays were performed using the method described previously (19Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the nitrocellulose strips were incubated for 4 h in the presence of 250,000 cpm/ml of [125I]α-actinin. In the competition experiment using radioiodinated α-actinin, a 2,000-fold molar excess of competing protein (α-actinin or BSA) was added to the blot overlay buffer. Nitrocellulose membranes were then subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C with an intensification screen. Protein fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) except with a bisacrylamide concentration of 0.13%. 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels were used in this paper. For Western immunoblotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against chicken p36 (K55) or chicken α-actinin (provided by K. Burridge) were used, followed by horseradish peroxidase linked to protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunodetection was enhanced using chemiluminescent techniques (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Solid-phase binding experiments were performed in removable microtiter wells as described previously (21Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), except that the wells were coated with purified chicken p36 at 0.1 mg/ml. The [125I]α-actinin used in these experiments was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 23.5 × 106 cpm/μg. A constant amount of [125I]α-actinin (0.09 pmol) was incubated for 2.5 h in p36-coated wells with increasing amounts of competing proteins, unlabeled α-actinin, or BSA. After washes, the bound counts were determined using a Packard Multi-Prias 1 γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co. Inc., Meriden, CT). The Stokes' radius of the purified chicken p36 was estimated by calibrated gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein or the gel filtration standards were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 m × 1.2 cm), equilibrated in buffer B+ (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The gel filtration standards used to calibrate the column were albumin (3.55 nm), ovalbumin (3.05 nm), and myoglobin (1.91 nm) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The relative sedimentation coefficient of the purified chicken p36 was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (18Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sucrose gradients were prepared in buffer B+. The standard proteins used in these experiments were albumin (4.3 S), ovalbumin (3.6 S), and carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S) from Bio-Rad. The native molecular mass and the frictional ratio of p36 were calculated as described by Siegel and Monty (23Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 112: 346-362Crossref Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) using a value of 0.711 cm3/g for the partial specific volume; the partial specific volume of p36 was calculated based on the protein's amino acid sequence described below. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The C2C12 myogenic cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum (growth medium). C2C12 differentiation was induced by transferring the cells into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium). The rabbit polyclonal antibody, K55, was raised against purified chicken p36. Double label indirect immunofluorescence of CEF cells was performed as described previously (24Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CEF cells were cultured either on glass coverslips for 24 h (spread cells) or on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips for 15 min (spreading cells). For immunostaining, we used the anti-p36 polyclonal antibody (K55) followed by an FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and an anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) followed by a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). C2C12 cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 6 days in differentiation medium, and immunocytochemistry was performed as described by Arber et al. (25Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P. Cell. 1994; 79: 221-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The same primary and secondary antibodies used for immunostaining of the CEF cells were used for the C2C12 cells, except that α-actinin was detected with a monoclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (Sigma). Cells were observed on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) with an optical section height of 1 μm. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (21Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, CEF cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% deoxycholate, 0.02% SDS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml phenantholine) and scraped off the dish. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 2 min at 2,000 rpm. The supernatant was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either 3 μl of the anti-p36 antibody (K55) or 3 μl of the corresponding preimmune serum, followed by a 1.5-h incubation with protein A-agarose beads. The beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Protein extracts were obtained from chicken embryo tissues as described previously (24Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Louis H.A. Pino J.D. Schmeichel K.L. Pomiès P. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27484-27491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Protein samples from 19-day-old chicken embryos were used in the tissue distribution experiment, whereas arteries from 11-, 13-, 15-, and 18-day old chicken embryos were used in the developmental time course experiment. Briefly, 5 ml of distilled H2O plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used to homogenized 1 g of each tissue (wet weight). Samples were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the DNA was sheared. Samples were then boiled for 4 min, and 10 μl of each were loaded onto a gel. mRNA was isolated from CEF cells using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Quiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). First strand cDNAs were generated from the CEF mRNAs using the T-Primed First-Strand kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two degenerate primers were synthesized based on two peptide sequences, GIDFNQ (aa 20–25) and FKPIGTA (aa 112–118), obtained by microsequencing of the purified chicken p36. These degenerate primers were used to amplify a 296-bp DNA fragment from the cDNAs. Bases on the sequence of this fragment, two new primers (CCAGCCTTTGATCATAACCAGG and GCTTGAATTCCTGTGGTTCAGC) that corresponded to internal sequence were synthesized and were used to amplify a 269-bp DNA fragment from the 296-bp fragment. Using the 269-bp DNA fragment, we screened 1,000,000 recombinant phage from a total chicken embryo cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and obtained five positive clones. Two of the five positive plaques were isolated, purified, and sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis reveals that the two cDNAs encode proteins that are identical, except in a central region of the proteins; we conclude that the two cDNAs encode the p36 and p40 isoforms that we have detected immunologically. In order to understand more precisely the cellular mechanisms involved in the assembly of the actin-based cytoskeleton during myogenesis, we have initiated an effort to identify α-actinin-binding partners in muscle cells using a blot overlay assay. Proteins extracted from avian smooth muscle were fractionated by precipitation with increasing amounts of ammonium sulfate (0–15, 15–27, 27–34, 34–43, and 43–61% saturation). Proteins present in each of these fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). A similar gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with radioiodinated α-actinin (Fig. 1 B). The radioiodinated α-actinin interacts directly with two proteins. The 23-kDa protein present primarily in the 34–43% ammonium sulfate precipitate (Fig.1 B, lane 4′) is CRP1, a LIM protein that we have previously characterized as a binding partner for α-actinin (21Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Crawford A.W. Pino J.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A second polypeptide identified in the screen is present in the 15–27% precipitate (Fig. 1 B,lane 2′) and migrates at a molecular mass of 36 kDa (hereafter called p36). The purity of the α-actinin probe used in this experiment is shown in Fig. 1 C. In an effort to analyze the specificity of the α-actinin-p36 interaction, we performed a competition experiment. The smooth muscle-derived proteins contained in the 15–27% precipitate were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 D). Similar gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the nitrocellulose strips were incubated with radioiodinated α-actinin in the absence of competing protein (Fig. 1 E) or in the presence of an excess of unlabeled α-actinin (Fig. 1 F) or BSA (Fig. 1 G). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the radioiodinated α-actinin interacts directly with p36. Furthermore, the binding of [125I]α-actinin to p36 is effectively eliminated in the presence of unlabeled α-actinin but not in presence of an equimolar amount of BSA. Taken together, these experiments show a direct and specific interaction between the actin-binding protein, α-actinin, and a 36-kDa protein expressed in smooth muscle cells. In order to characterize the properties of p36 in greater detail, we developed a method for purifying native protein from smooth muscle. A 15–27% ammonium sulfate precipitate from an avian smooth muscle extract, which is enriched in p36 (see Fig. 1), was used as starting material for the purification of p36. Briefly, proteins present in the 15–27% ammonium sulfate precipitate (Fig.2 A, lane 1) were applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, and the proteins that fail to bind this matrix (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) were subjected to chromatography on CM-cellulose. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl, and the fractions containing p36 were pooled (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). The p36 was purified to apparent homogeneity at this stage. To verify that the 36-kDa protein obtained after these conventional chromatographic techniques was the α-actinin-binding protein we sought, we performed a blot overlay assay using radioiodinated α-actinin. A similar gel to that shown in Fig. 2 A was transferred to nitrocellulose, and the nitrocellulose was incubated with [125I]α-actinin. The autoradiograph revealed that the radioiodinated α-actinin bound to the purified 36-kDa protein. Starting with 400 g of chicken gizzards, this protocol allowed us to obtain 3–4 mg of purified p36. In order to determine whether p36 exists in a monomeric or multimeric state, we characterized some of the biophysical properties of the purified protein (Table I). The Stokes' radius of the purified avian smooth muscle p36 was estimated by calibrated gel filtration chromatography (28Nozaki Y. Schechter N.M. Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments revealed a Stokes' radius of 3.1 ± 0.1 nm (mean ± S.E.) for p36 at physiological ionic strength (140 mmNaCl). We have also performed the gel filtration assay in 20 mm NaCl and have obtained similar results (data not shown). A relative sedimentation coefficient of 2.1 ± 0.1 S (mean ± S.E., n = 3) was determined for p36 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (29Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method of Siegel and Monty (23Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 112: 346-362Crossref Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) was employed to estimate a native molecular mass of 25.5 kDa for p36. This value suggests that under our conditions p36 is monomeric. The experimentally determined frictional ratio (f/f 0) of 1.6 suggests that p36 is an asymmetric protein.Table IBiophysical properties of purified p36Partial specific volume0.711 cm3/gStokes' radius3.1 ± 0.1 nmRelative sedimentation coefficient2.1 ± 0.1 SNative molecular mass25,500 DaFrictional ratio (f/f 0)1.6 Open table in a new tab In order to calculate the dissociation constant of the α-actinin-p36 interaction we used a solid-phase binding assay to characterize the interaction under nondenaturing conditions. Briefly, purified p36 was immobilized in microtiter wells and was then exposed to a constant amount of radioiodinated α-actinin in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled α-actinin or BSA as competing proteins. The amount of bound [125I]α-actinin was determined by γ-counting. As can be seen in Fig.3 A, unlabeled α-actinin but not an equivalent molar amount of BSA is able to compete with the radioiodinated α-actinin for binding to p36. From this competition experiment showing the specificity of the interaction under nondenaturing conditions, we were able to plot the moles of bound [125I]α-actinin against the moles of free [125I]α-actinin (Fig. 3 B). This curve corresponds to an interaction between two proteins at a single binding site, and in this particular experiment half-maximal binding occurs at 0.20 μm free ligand. An average K d of 0.18 ± 0.04 μm (mean ± S.E.) corresponding to a moderate affinity interaction between α-actinin and p36 was calculated from three independent experiments. As shown above, we have demonstrated a high specificity, moderate affinity interaction between α-actinin and p36 in vitro. If these proteins also interact with each other in vivo, we should observe a colocalization of these two proteins in cells. In order to examine this possibility, we have generated polyclonal antibodies against purified smooth muscle p36. As shown in Fig.4 B, by Western immunoblot analysis the polyclonal antibodies specifically recognize p36 in a CEF cell lysate (Fig. 4 B, lane 1′), in an avian smooth muscle extract (Fig. 4 B, lane 2′), and after purification (Fig. 4 B,lane 3′). No signal was detected using the preimmune serum under the same conditions (Fig. 4 C). We used the specific anti-p36 antibody to compare the subcellular localizations of α-actinin and p36 in CEF cells. Double-label indirect immunofluorescence reveals that p36 and α-actinin colocalize extensively along the actin stress fibers (Fig.5, A–C), consistent with th"

Since lymphocytes must interact with a constantly changing environment, we hypothesized that lymphocytes would express unique MDC proteins. To identify MDC proteins expressed in human lymph node, a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with degenerate oligonucleotide primers was employed. We report here the identification of MDC-L (ADAM 23), a novel member of the MDC protein family. The results obtained from cDNA cloning and Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from various lymphoid tissues indicate that a 2.8-kilobase mRNA encoding a transmembrane form, MDC-Lm, and a 2.2-kilobase mRNA encoding a secreted form, MDC-Ls, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. MDC-L mRNA was shown to be predominantly expressed in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph node, spleen, small intestine, stomach, colon, appendix, and trachea. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining with an anti-MDC-L antibody demonstrated that cells with typical lymphocyte morphology are responsible for expression of the MDC-L antigen in these lymphoid tissues. MDC-Lm was found to be expressed on the surface of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and transformed B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines as an 87-kDa protein. Thus, we have identified a novel lymphocyte-expressed MDC protein family member.

The prototypical MDC protein comprises pro, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, EGF, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The metalloprotease domain is homologous to the reprolysins, members of the zinc binding metzincin superfamily that also includes the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), the astacins, and serralysins (3Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.-X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The prodomain regulates the activity of the metalloprotease by blocking access to the zinc ion; removal of the prodomain or inactivation of a conserved cysteine thiol group results in a gain of proteolytic activity. The disintegrin domains of MDC proteins are homologous to small nonenzymatic peptides isolated from the venom of snakes. Snake venom disintegrin peptides interfere with platelet aggregation by inhibiting binding of fibrinogen to the integrin αIIbβ3 (4Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar). The functions previously attributed to the individual domains suggests roles for MDC proteins in cell adhesion and the proteolysis of extracellular proteins. The first mammalian MDC proteins identified were the fertilins (5Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). These proteins function in the attachment and fusion of the sperm and egg during fertilization. A similar cell fusion function for the MDC protein meltrin-α (MDC-12) was shown for the formation of multinucleated myotubes (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y.-i. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These MDC proteins have, in addition to the domains described above, a fusion peptide-like sequence not found in all members of the MDC protein family. However, the interaction of the fertilin disintegrin domain on the sperm surface with the integrin α6β1 on the surface of the egg is also required for membrane adhesion and fusion (7Myles D.G. Kimmel L.H. Blobel C.P. White J.M. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4195-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Yuan R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J.

Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the functionality of the disintegrin domain comes from studies using recombinantly expressed metargidin (MDC-15) disintegrin domain, which was shown to specifically interact with the integrin αvβ3 (10Zhang X.-P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-Mclaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, the disintegrin domains of MDC proteins appear to be a new family of integrin ligands. More recently, MDC proteins have been shown to function in ectodomain shedding of several cell surface proteins. Tissue necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE; MDC-17) was the first mammalian MDC protein shown to have secretase activity (11Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L.

Additionally, meltrin-γ (MDC-9) is involved in ectodomain shedding of membrane anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and considerable evidence supports the proteolytic processing of notch by theDrosophila MDC protein Kuzbian (14Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 15Rooke J. Pan D.

Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Many other proteins are shed from cell surfaces by metalloproteases, implicating other MDC proteins in proteolytic processing (18Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Thus, MDC proteins may function in a variety of processes. First, they may control the release of ligands from the cell surface as in the case of tissue necrosis factor-α. Second, MDC proteins may rapidly regulate adhesive events by cleaving receptors or counter receptors from the cell surface, such as in the shedding of l-selectin (19Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Freehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Third, the similarity between membrane-bound MMPs and MDC proteins suggests a role in extracellular matrix proteolysis. Finally, MDC protein themselves may function as ligands for integrin receptors. The work presented here describes MDC-L, a novel member of the MDC protein family, expressed by lymphocytes in the tissues examined. Two transcripts, one encoding a prototypical MDC protein and the other encoding a secreted form, demonstrated tissue specific regulation. The transmembrane form of MDC-L was expressed as an 87-kDa protein on the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes and both B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines. We hypothesize that MDC-L may play a role in the adhesive and proteolytic events that occur during lymphocyte emigration or function in ectodomain shedding of lymphocyte proteins such as FasL, CD40L, or an as yet unidentified lymphocyte protein (21Tanaka M. Itai T. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 22Pietravalle F. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Blasey H. Aubry J.-P. Elson G. Edgerton M.D. Bonnefoy J.-Y.

Fickenscher (Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany) and cultured in 45% RPMI 1640, 45% AIM-V, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) containing 100 units/ml IL-2 (23Fickenscher H. Bokel C. Knappe A.

The Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphocyte cell line RD105U was provided by Dr. W. Hildebrand (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK) and cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 1%l-glutamine, containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The T-lymphocyte cell line Hut78 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 20% FCS, 4 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3. Manipulation of recombinant DNA was by standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taqpolymerase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. The degenerate oligonucleotide primers used were B1 (GARGGNGARGAYTGYGAYTG), B2 (GGNGARGAYTGYGAYTGYGG), C1 (CARTAYTCNGGNARRTCRCA), and C2 (TAYTCNGGNARRTCRCAYTC) in which N signifies any deoxynucleotide, R signifies either A or G, and Y signifies either T or C (25Weskamp G. Blobel C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2748-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nested PCR was performed as follows. For reaction 1, 500 ng of human lymph node cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was combined with 0.5 μg of primers B1 and C1 in a hot start PCR using the AmpliWax (Perkin Elmer) protocol. The PCR products were then separated from the oligonucleotides by centrifugal filtration. For reaction 2, the reaction 1 products were combined with 0.5 μg of primers B2 and C2 in a hot start PCR protocol. The PCR products obtained from reaction 2 were subcloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the nucleotide sequence of both strands determined. A 190-bp EcoRI fragment from a pCRII-TOPO MDC-L subclone was electroeluted from a 5% polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random primer method. After removal of the unincorporated nucleotides, the radiolabeled 190-bp EcoRI fragment was used to probe a λgt10 human lymph node cDNA library (CLONTECH). Positive plaques were isolated, plated at a lower density, and probed until all the plaques on a plate were positive. The cDNA from the positive phage were subcloned into pCRII-TOPO vector after PCR of a phage lysate with λgt10 forward and reverse primers (26Herrmann J. Lee P. Saya H. Nakajima M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of both strands was determined using universal and gene specific primers. The 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as recommended by supplier with the primers AP1 and the gene-specific primer MET12 (CTGTCCATCCCGATGTATGGGGC). The PCR products obtained were separated from the primers by centrifugal filtration and subjected to a second PCR with the primers AP2 and MET12. The 600-bp product obtained was subcloned into pCRII-TOPO and both strands sequenced using universal and gene-specific primers. The multiple tissue northern and mRNA dot blot were purchased from CLONTECH. Hybridization of the mRNA dot blot was performed with the same probe used for cDNA cloning. The MDC-Lm-specific probe was a 790-bpBamHI/SalI (vector site) fragment from the 3′ end of MDC-Lm cDNA that had been extracted from an agarose gel. The MDC-Ls-specific probe was a HindIII fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of MDC-Ls cDNA. All probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method to a specific activity greater than 1 × 109 cpm/μg. Polyadenylated RNA transferred to nylon membranes were hybridized with the specified probe as described (27Verca G.D. Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Widera G. Broome S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 370-371PubMed Google Scholar). The nylon membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 3 days. After exposure of the nylon membranes to film, the bound probe was stripped by heating at 95 °C for 10 min in 0.5% SDS, rinsing in H2O, and storing at −20 °C. RT-PCR was carried out using the mRNA capture kit and Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the specified gene-specific primers. Primers used for RT-PCR of human lymph node mRNA were L1 (CGGGATCCGTTCAGGAACATGAG), Lm1 (GTCATCGCAGTCGGGAGGGATCC), and Ls1 (GTTTATGATCTTAGTAGGGTTGCC). Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated by incubating fresh normal human blood with either anti-CD2, CD19, CD14, and CD16 monoclonal antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), then adding sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway), and separating the cells with a magnet. The isolated cells were quantitated, and 1 × 105 cells were used for RT-PCR. Primers used for leukocyte RT-PCR were L2 (TCTGGTCCTGGATAATGGTGAGTT), Lm2 (CACACTCATTCCCTGCAAAGCAAA), Ls2 (TGGTTTTAGGGTTGCTAGATTTAG), Actin1 (GGCATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCCC), and Actin2 (CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCC). Nested PCR was performed using a standard 30-cycle PCR reaction with 2 μl of the initial RT-PCR reaction as template and the primers L3 (TCCATTGCCTACAGATATCATATCC) and L4 (CCCCACAGCTCTGTCCACTGC). The products were verified by gel electrophoresis and cleavage with the restriction enzymes BamHI, HindIII, andDraI. The MDC-L disintegrin domain (residues Gly418–Glu476) was PCR-amplified from the λgt10 subclone 2.2.5 with the oligonucleotides MDC-01 (CGGGATCCGGTGAGGACTGCGACTGCGGG) and MDC-02 (AACTGCAGTTATTCAGGCAGGTCGCACTC), digested with BamHI andPstI, subcloned into the hexahistidine (H6) expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and transformed intoEschericia coli M15[pREP4]. Cells harboring the pQE30 MDC-L disintegrin domain recombinant plasmid were grown in SB media plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to anA 600 nm of 0.5–0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cell culture was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −80 °C. The thawed cell suspension was sonicated, centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant diluted 1:3 in sonication buffer, and affinity-purified on Ni-NTA agarose. Material bound to the Ni-NTA-agarose was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and then eluted with the same buffer at pH 4.0. The purified fusion protein was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and examined by 15% Tris-Tricine PAGE. The correct amino acid composition was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. The MDC-Lm EGF domain (residues Thr627–Ser666) was PCR amplified from the λgt10 subclone 4.2.2 with the oligonucleotides MDC-E1 (TCAGAATTCACCAATTGCTCATCCAAG) and MDC-E2 (CAATCTAGACTAGGAGAAGTGGAAGACCAC), digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and subcloned into the malE gene fusion vector pMALc2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Maltose-binding protein-MDC-L fusion proteins were purified and analyzed as described (28Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of polyclonal antibodies, two rabbits were hyperimmunized with either purified H6-MDC-L disintegrin domain or maltose-binding protein-MDC-L EGF domain fusion proteins following standard techniques (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Purified immunoglobulin was obtained by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity-purified anti-MDC-L disintegrin domain antibody was obtained by incubating 5 mg of purified immunoglobulin with the disintegrin domain affinity resin overnight at 4 °C, washing extensively with PBS, and eluting with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, 0.5 m NaCl. Eluted antibody was immediately neutralized with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed in PBS. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed by the transfer of SDS-PAGE separated proteins to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA), blocking in 2% Blotto, and incubating with polyclonal antiserum at a 1:10,000 dilution. The bound antibody was detected by subsequent incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody, incubation with avidin-conjugated peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from normal donors by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating saline-washed cell pellets in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-octyl-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 mm leupeptin, 1 mg/ml ethylmaleimide). Immunoprecipitations were performed by surface biotinylation of 2 × 107 cells with 0.5 mg of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 2 h. The cells were then washed three times in PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, 100 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose pre-armed with the specified antiserum for 1 h on ice. The resin was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, centrifuged, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated proteins detected as described above. Human tissues were obtained from either normal portions of surgical specimens or from autopsy specimens at University Hospital and Children's Hospital of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and were procured according to institutional guidelines. Tissues were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde, processed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned using conventional techniques. Snap-frozen tonsil and stomach were used to evaluate possible antigen loss when studying paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Tissue sections were treated as described (31Laszik Z. Jansen P.J. Cummings R.D. Tedder T.F. McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 3010-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were treated with 1.25% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Immunohistochemical staining for MDC-L antigen was performed using standard strepavidin biotin peroxidase methodology at room temperature. The slides were incubated with PBS containing 5% swine serum to inhibit nonspecific antibody binding, followed by addition of the primary affinity-purified antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Biotin-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied for 20 min, followed by strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase(Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine (Sigma) was used as chromogen. Hematoxylin was used for nuclear counterstaining. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). The MDC-L disintegrin domain affinity column was generated by cross-linking 2.6 mg of H6-MDC-L disintegrin domain in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl to 0.3 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose. The affinity matrix was then incubated in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl for 2 h at room temperature, washed several times with alternating 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, 0.5 m ,NaCl and 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and stored in PBS at 4 °C. Data base searches were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's BLAST sequence similarity searching program. Molecular modeling were performed using the SWISS-MODEL protein modeling server (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). To determine whether lymphocytes express any MDC protein family members, human lymph node cDNA was subjected to two consecutive rounds of PCR with two sets of internally nested degenerate oligonucleotide primers. These degenerate primers were based on the coding sequence of conserved regions within the disintegrin domains of MDC proteins (25Weskamp G. Blobel C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2748-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 165–171-bp product was obtained after the secondary PCR (Fig. 1 a). The PCR products were subcloned and the nucleotide sequences determined. Identified among the PCR subclones were sequences encoding the disintegrin domains of human MDC-9 (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and MDC-20 (35Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene ( Amst.). 1998; 206: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 b). However, 8 of the 10 inserts examined possessed an open reading frame encoding a unique polypeptide with significant homology to many of the cellular and snake venom disintegrins (Fig.1 b). Data base searches using GenBank BLAST (33Madden T.L. Tatusov R.L. Zhang J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 131-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that this novel disintegrin domain was greater than 60% identical to the disintegrin domains of human sperm maturation-related glycoprotein GP-83 and the macaque epididymal apical protein I (GenBank accession nos. AF090327 and X66139, respectively). These results suggest that a novel MDC family member, which we have designated MDC-L (ADAM 23), may be expressed within the human lymph node. Using the isolated cDNA encoding the putative MDC-L disintegrin domain as a probe, a human lymph node cDNA library (6 × 105 plaques) was screened and 29 positive phage were isolated. The cDNA from eight phage that contained inserts larger than 1 kb were subcloned and the nucleotide sequence determined. None of these overlapping partial cDNAs contained the 5′ end of the MDC-L cDNA. Therefore, the missing MDC-L cDNA was acquired by 5′-RACE reactions using human lymph node cDNA. The cDNA clones obtained resulted in the reconstruction of two distinct full-length cDNAs with identical 5′ nucleotide sequences through bp 1608; however, the two cDNAs diverged beyond this point (Fig. 2). Neither cDNA sequence was found in data base searches using GenBank BLAST. The 2,786-bp cDNA form contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with the typical domain structure of other MDC family members, including a signal peptide, as well as pro, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, EGF, and transmembrane domains (1Blobel C.P.

The 2,087-bp cDNA form contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with a signal peptide, pro, metalloprotease, and disintegrin domains identical to the deduced MDC-Lm protein; however, the cysteine-rich domain differed in sequence and contained a stop codon midway through (Fig. 2).The putative secreted form of this protein has been designated MDC-Ls (Fig. 3). Both MDC-L cDNA forms contain consensus Kozak (38Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar) and polyadenylation signal sequences (39Fitzgerald M. Shenk T. Cell. 1981; 24: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), suggesting that these mRNAs are synthesized and translated (Fig.2).Figure 3Two forms of MDC-L. Comparison of the domain structures of MDC-Lm and MDC-Ls. The signal sequence (black), prodomain (white), metalloprotease (hatched), disintegrin domain (diagonal stripes), cysteine-rich domain (dots), EGF domain (horizontal stripes), transmembrane domain (diamonds), and cytoplasmic domain (vertical stripes) are depicted. Also shown are the putative zinc binding site (Zn) and integrin recognition site (AKDE).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examination of the deduced MDC-L amino acid sequences revealed that the metalloprotease domain has the sequenceH339EMGHNFGMFHD350and C361VMDK365, which fits the consensus sequences for zinc binding, catalytic activity, and the structurally important Met turn motif (3Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.-X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling demonstrated that the histidines required for zinc ion coordination, catalytic glutamic acid, and Met turn could all be placed correctly within the tertiary structure (data not shown). The prodomain also possessed a “cysteine switch” pattern,S167TCGM171, typically found in MMPs (40Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The sequence K195DRK198exists at the predicted boundary between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain. This sequence does not fit with the furin-like enzyme cleavage site identified in some MDC and MMP family members (40Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The disintegrin domain has the sequence K469DEC472 within the putative integrin recognition loop (2Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Additionally, the deduced MDC-Lm protein has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites, while the MDC-Ls form has three potential N-linked glycosylation sites"
https://openalex.org/W2034124003,"Differences in glycolipid expression between species contribute to the tropism of many infectious pathogens for their hosts. For example, we demonstrate that cultured human and monkey urinary epithelial cells fail to bind a canine Escherichia coli uropathogenic isolate; however, transfection of these cells with the canine Forssman synthetase (FS) cDNA enables abundant adherence by the same pathogen, indicating that addition of a single sugar residue to a glycolipid receptor has marked effects on microbial attachment. Given the contribution of glycolipids to host-microbial interactions, we sought to determine why human tissues do not express Forssman glycolipid. Query of the GenBankTM data base yielded a human sequence with high identity to the canine FS cDNA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting demonstrated the presence of FS mRNA in all tissues examined. A human FS cDNA was characterized, revealing identities with the canine FS gene of 86 and 83% at the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively. In contrast to the canine FS cDNA, transfection of COS-1 cells with the human FS cDNA resulted in no detectable FS enzyme activity. These results suggest that variability in glycolipid synthesis between species is an important determinant of microbial tropism. Evolutionary pressure from pathogenic organisms may have contributed to diversity in glycolipid expression among species.

These results suggest that variability in glycolipid synthesis between species is an important determinant of microbial tropism. Evolutionary pressure from pathogenic organisms may have contributed to diversity in glycolipid expression among species. Co-evolution of microbial pathogens with their eucaryotic hosts has resulted in a remarkable degree of specificity in their interaction. As a consequence, pathogenic organisms are typically restricted in their ability to cause disease to a limited number of species. An early stage in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases is microbial adherence to host cells (1Beachey E.H. Giampapa C.S. Abraham S.N. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1988; 138: 45-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the capacity for adherence is a major determinant of the host range available to a given pathogen. Interestingly, glycolipids are the initial attachment site for several pathogenic organisms (2Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Strömberg N. Thurin J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Karlsson K.-A. Strömberg N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Illness caused by such diverse agents as bacteria, viruses, and bacterial toxins are known to recognize host glycolipids as their initial attachment site (2Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G.

Viewed from the host perspective it appears that susceptibility to infectious diseases is impacted greatly by factors regulating glycolipid synthesis.Glycolipids consist of a variable carbohydrate moiety attached to a ceramide backbone and are a component of virtually all eucaryotic cells. Hundreds of distinct glycolipids have thus far been described (9Basu M. De T. Das K.K. Kyle J.W. Chon H.C. Schaeper R.J. Basu S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Variability in glycolipid structure occurs primarily in the carbohydrate moiety due to differences in the number, type, or anomeric linkage between sugar residues (10Stults C.L. Sweeley C.C. Macher B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 167-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Each cell type, however, expresses glycolipids containing a limited repertoire of all possible carbohydrate structures. This cell lineage-specific pattern of glycolipid expression is tightly regulated during cellular differentiation and development and varies between species (11Hakomori S. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 41: 873-886PubMed Google Scholar, 12Monner D.A. Muhlradt P.F. Immunobiology. 1993; 188: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Sadahira Y. Yasuda T. Kimoto T.

Unlike many other mammalian species, human cells do not normally produce Forssman glycolipid but produce the precursor glycolipids globotriaosylceramide and globoside (GbO4). In some species, including humans, these precursors serve as an attachment site for bacteria, viruses, and toxins (15Keusch G.T. Jacewicz M. Mobassaleh M. Donohue-Rolfe A. Rev. Inf. Dis. 1991; 13 Suppl. 4: 304-310Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Jacewicz M.S. Mobassaleh M.

In other species it is likely that modification of these glycolipids (such as by the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine to create Forssman glycolipid) alters adherence of pathogenic organisms, directly affects microbial ecology, and modifies host susceptibility to infectious diseases. It is in this context that we sought to elucidate the mechanisms controlling Forssman glycolipid expression in human cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsT24 (human bladder epithelium) and Vero (monkey kidney) cells were obtained from ATCC and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and following stable transfection were maintained in geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 600 (Vero) or 200 μg/ml (T24). Escherichia coliHB101 containing plasmid pRS-1 (encoding the class III P-pilus operon) was kindly provided by Staffan Normark. Anti-Forssman antibody was concentrated from hybridoma M1/22.21 (ATCC) tissue culture supernatant. A human substantia nigra λgt10 cDNA library and a panel of human tissue λgt10 cDNA libraries (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA) were kindly provided by Jonathan Gitlin. Human multiple tissue RNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by random priming using reagents from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs were from Life Technologies, Inc. Glycolipid substrates and standards were purchased from Sigma. UDP-[3H]galactose and UDP-[3H]N-acetylgalactosamine were purchased from American Radiochemicals.Stable Transfection of Human and Monkey Uroepithelial Cells with Canine FS cDNAThe canine FS cDNA from pFS-10 (22Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was ligated into neomycin-selectable plasmid pCR3.1 to create pFS-35. A truncated (non-functional) FS cDNA was created by deleting a 400-bpApaI fragment from pFS-35 to create plasmid pFS-36, used as a transfection control. T24 and Vero cells were transfected with plasmids pFS-35 and pFS-36 using LipofectAMINE reagent as described previously (22Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Forty eight hours after transfection neomycin was added to the media, and resistant clones were allowed to proliferate. After 10 days, the clones were pooled, and the 5% of pFS-35-transfected cells reacting most strongly with anti-Forssman antibody were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and further expanded in the presence of neomycin. As we found that serial passage resulted in a decrease in the percentage of FS-expressing cells over time, the cells were resorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for anti-Forssman reactivity prior to performing bacterial adherence assays.Bacterial Adherence Assays and Immuno-Thin Layer ChromatographyIn order to examine the binding of E. coli pRS-1 to monolayers of FS-transfected cells, each cell line was seeded onto slide chambers, allowed to attach overnight, and then were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and overlaid with a suspension of E. coli:pRS-1 at approximately 1 × 109 bacteria/ml. The slides were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed 5 times with cold PBS. Following another incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, cells were stained with Geimsa (Diff. Quick, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and visualized by light microscopy.For immunologic detection of Forssman glycolipid and examination of bacterial adherence to cellular glycolipids, a crude lipid extract was prepared from 1 × 107 pFS-36- or pFS-35-transfected cells by resuspending cell pellets in an equal volume of methanol (approximately 100 μl) and vortexing vigorously. An equal volume of chloroform was added; the cells were vortexed, and then methanol was added dropwise until organic and aqueous phases resolved into a single phase. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 ×g), and the organic supernatant was removed and evaporated under reduced pressure. The lipid residue was resuspended in chloroform:methanol:water and spotted onto TLC plates. Glycolipids were separated in organic solvent (chloroform:methanol:water, 65:35:8); the plates were air-dried and then blocked with bovine serum albumin (5% in PBS). Plates were then overlaid either with monoclonal anti-Forssman antibody (M1/M22.21) or bacteria that had been metabolically radiolabeled as described previously (23Haslam D. Borén T. Falk P. Ilver D. Chou A. Xu Z. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plates were washed and then subjected either to secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (anti-Forssman glycolipid) or directly to autoradiography (radiolabeled bacteria).PCR Amplification of Human FS cDNATwo oligonucleotide primers (MFS-4, 5′-CCCCACCATAATAGAAGTCCC-3′, and MFS-7, 5′-GCACCCATCGTCTCCGAGGGAACC-3′) that span intron VI in the human FS gene were used to PCR-amplify this region from individual λgt10 human tissue cDNA libraries. PCR was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermal cycler using 1 μl (approximately 1 × 109plaque-forming units) of λgt10 library lysate, 200 μmeach dNTP, 25 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed using the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light.Northern Blotting of Human RNAA 589-bp fragment from exon VII of the human FS gene was PCR-amplified from 1 μg of human genomic DNA using primers FS-26 (5′-TTCRTCCAGYMCTTCCTGGAGTC-3′) and FS-28 (5′-CAGAGGTA-CTCRGGGGACAGC-3′) under the conditions described above. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) to create plasmid pHFS. The plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and the insert was gel-purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used as probe for Northern blots. 50 ng of purified β-actin DNA (CLONTECH) was similarly labeled. Human multiple tissue RNA blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in RapidHyb solution (CLONTECH) and then hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in the same solution containing 1 million cpm per ml of probe. Filters were washed at 68 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film at −70 °C.Isolation and Characterization of FS cDNAA human λgt10 substantia nigra cDNA library was plated on NZCY media, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized overnight with radiolabeled pHFS insert at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 10 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Filters were washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then exposed to autoradiography film. Several hybridizing plaques were identified. Three were purified to homogeneity. One such clone, λHFS-3, contained the entire FS coding region and an unspliced intervening sequence between exons VI and VII.Nucleotide SequencingTwo EcoRI restriction fragments obtained from λHFS-3 were subcloned into plasmid pCR3.1 to create plasmids pHFS-1.2 and pHFS-1.8. Cycle sequencing was performed using RC and T7 (Invitrogen) or gene-specific primers, fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide dye terminators (BigDye), andTaq polymerase using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of both inserts was determined in forward and reverse directions. Additional sequencing reactions were performed to resolve ambiguous nucleotide designations. Nucleotide sequencing of the inserts in the FS expression constructs was performed in a similar manner.Generation of Human, Chimeric, and Epitope-tagged FS Expression VectorsTo generate a eucaryotic expression vector containing the entire human FS coding region and intron VI, plasmid pHFS-1.2 was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated intoBglII/XbaI-digested plasmid pHFS-1.8 to create plasmid pHFS. A chimeric human:dog cDNA expression vector was generated by PCR amplifying nucleotides −41 to 357 (encoding amino acid residues 1–119) of the human FS cDNA from plasmid pHFS-1.8 using primers MFS-20 (5′-TTCCCTGCGAAGGGACAGCC-3′) and MFS-8 (5′-CCCCACGGCAAACAC-SGTGACSCC). Nucleotides 334–1273 (encoding residues 111–347, the stop codon, and 3′-untranslated DNA) from the canine FS cDNA were amplified from plasmid pFS-10 with primers MFS-31 (5′- GGGGTCACGGTGTTTGCCGTGGG-3′) and FS-9 (5′-CTCTACAGTGTACGAAGGCC-3′). Five microliters of each PCR product were mixed and brought to 100 μl in 1× PCR buffer containing primers MFS-20 and FS-9, 200 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit ofTaq DNA polymerase. Twenty five additional cycles of PCR were performed, and the 1.2-kb product was directly subcloned into pCR3.1 to create plasmid pHD. Primer MFS-31 changed residue 113 in the canine FS from leucine to valine to match the human FS at residue 113, and since residues 120–122 are identical between human and canine FS proteins, this chimera matches the human FS from residues 1 to 122 and matches the canine FS from residues 123 to 347.A dog:human chimeric cDNA was similarly generated by PCR amplification from the plasmid polylinker to nucleotide 431 of the canine FS cDNA (encoding residues 1–136 of the canine FS except that residue 134 was changed from glutamine to glutamate to match the human FS) using primers T7 and MFS-32 (5′-GAAGAACTCCTC-GGCTGACTCCAGG-3′). Nucleotides 1298–1966 of the human cDNA (encoding residues 129–347 and the stop codon) were amplified with primers MFS-33 (5′-CCTGGAGTCAGCCGAGGAGTTCTTC-3′) and MFS-27 (5′-CCGTGGTCAGCTCC-TCAGGC-3′). The PCR products were mixed and subjected to a further 25 cycles of PCR using primers T7 and MFS-27. The chimeric PCR product was subcloned directly into pCR3.1 to create plasmid pDH, which matches the canine FS from residues 1 to 127 and the human FS from residues 128 to 347 (Fig. 8 A).In order to remove exon VI from the human FS expression plasmid, overlapping PCR was performed in a similar manner to that described above. Nucleotides −41 to 359 plus nucleotides 5′ to the splice site of the human FS cDNA were amplified from plasmid pHFS-1.8 using primers MFS-20 and MFS-40 (5′-GGACTGGATGAA-ATGAGTGTACTTCCCCACGGCAAACACCGTG-3′). Nucleotides spanning the splice site of the human FS were amplified from plasmid pHFS-1.2 using primers MFS-39 (5′-CACGGTGTTTGCCGTGGGGAAGTACACTCATTTCATCCAGTCC-3′) and MFS-27. Primers MFS-39 and MFS-40 were designed to contain complementary and overlapping regions that flank intron VI, such that these ends prime extension in both directions when the two products anneal and delete intron VI. Following five rounds of amplification without flanking primers, the entire coding region was amplified with primers MFS-20 and MFS-27. The resulting product was ligated into plasmid pCR3.1 and its sequence fidelity verified by nucleotide sequence determination.Addition of an amino-terminal HA epitope tag (consisting of amino acids MGYPYDVPDYASG) to the human and dog FS cDNAs was accomplished by amplification of either the human or dog FS cDNA, respectively, with primers HA-2 (5′-ATGGGCTATCCTTATGACGTGCCTGACTATGCCTCAGGCATGCGCTGCCGCAGACTG-3′) with FS-9 or HA-3 (5′-ATGGGCTATCCTTATGACGTGCCTGACTATGCCTCAGCCATGCATCGCCGGAGACTGGCC-3′) with MFS-27. The resulting products were ligated into plasmid pCR3.1, and fidelity of the inserts was determined by nucleotide sequencing.FS Enzyme AssaysCOS-1 cells transfected with plasmid DNA were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mm MES, pH 6.7, and disrupted by sonication. Nuclei were removed by sedimentation for 5 min at 6000 × g. The supernatants were brought to a final concentration of 20 mmMnCl2 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The aggregated membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 6000 ×g and then were resuspended in 250 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm MES and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Insoluble material was removed by sedimentation for 5 min at 6000 × g. Enzyme reactions were performed in a 150-μl volume containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.7, 10 mm MnCl2, 50 μl of membrane extract (approximately 0.5 mg/ml protein), 5 μm3H-labeled UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (1000 cpm per pmol; American Radiochemicals), and 20 μmol of glycolipid substrate (globoside; Sigma). After incubating at 37 °C for 2 h, reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice- cold water. Glycolipid products were separated from unincorporated nucleotide sugar by passing over a reverse phase C18 column, washing with 5 ml of water, 3 ml of 20% methanol in water, and then eluting with 1.5 ml of 100% methanol. The eluted samples were evaporated under reduced pressure, resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1), and then spotted onto TLC plates along with a lane of glycolipid standards (5 μg each). After developing in chloroform:methanol:water (65:35:8), the plates were air-dried, the lane of glycolipid standards was cut off, and the plates were sprayed with En3Hance and exposed to Kodak XAR film. Glycolipid standards were visualized with orcinol.Control reactions detecting UDP-galactose:globoside galactosyltransferase activity endogenous to COS-1 cells (unaffected by transfection with the FS cDNA) were performed to ensure approximately equal amounts of cellular extract in each reaction (22Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The control reactions were identical to FS enzyme assays except that3H-labeled UDP-galactose (5 μm, 1000 cpm per pmol; American Radiochemicals) was substituted for UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine as the sugar nucleotide donor.Detection of Epitope-tagged FS Proteins by Western BlottingCOS cells transfected with epitope-tagged canine or human FS, or untransfected cells, were harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS. Half of the cells (approximately 4 × 105) were utilized for enzyme assays as described above. The remaining cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended directly in 100 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. After heating to 94 °C for 5 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS for 30 min, primary antibody (HA-11, Babco) was added at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing and incubating in a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence.RESULTSBacterial Adherence to Cells Expressing Forssman SynthetaseCanine uropathogenic bacteria commonly produce adhesive fibers terminating with the class III PapG adhesin (24Strömberg N. Marklund B.-I. Lund B. Ilver D. Hamers A. Gaastra W. Karlsson K.-A. Normark S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2001-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of E. coli HB101 harboring plasmid pRS-1, encoding the class III adhesin, to adhere to wild-type and FS-transfected uroepithelial cells. Bacteria were overlaid on monolayers of human or monkey kidney cells transfected with pFS-36 (control; WT) or pFS-35 (canine FS; + FS). Adherence was examined by light microscopy. Whereas no bacterial adherence was seen to cells transfected with the truncated FS cDNA (wild-type cells), numerous bacteria bound to cells expressing the full-length FS cDNA (Fig. 1).Figure 1Adherence of E. coli:pRS-1 to primate epithelial cells. Cell lines T24 (Human) or Vero (Monkey) stably transfected with the canine expression plasmid pFS-35 (+ FS) or a control plasmid pFS-36 (WT) were overlaid with E. coli expressing the class III P-pilus adhesin. After washing, cell monolayers were fixed, stained, and visualized by light microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bacterial Adherence to Glycolipids Extracted from Uroepithelial CellsIn order to demonstrate that bacterial adherence was to Forssman glycolipid in transfected cells, extracts were prepared from pFS-36- (WT) and pFS-35 (+ FS)-transfected human and monkey uroepithelial cells and examined for the presence of Forssman glycolipid and the ability to mediate bacterial adherence. Immuno-thin layer chromatography demonstrated an intense band of anti-FG reactivity comigrating with authentic FG in lipid extracts of human and monkey cells transfected with plasmid pFS-35, whereas no reactivity is seen to extracts of cells transfected with a truncated FS cDNA (Fig. 2 A). Bacterial adherence to glycolipid extracts demonstrated a faint band of adherence to the precursor glycolipid (GbO4, globoside) in extracts from all four cell lines (23Haslam D. Borén T. Falk P.

An intense band of bacterial binding to FG was seen in extracts of FS-transfected cells (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Detection of Forssman glycolipid in extracts of transfected cells by anti-FG antibody (A) and adherence by FG-specific bacteria (B). Lipid extracts were prepared from T24 (Human) and Vero (Monkey) cells stably transfected with pFS-36 (WT) and pFS-35 (+ FS). Lipid extracts and a lane of purified Forssman glycolipid were spotted onto TLC plates and developed in organic solvent. Forssman glycolipid was detected using anti-Forssman glycolipid antibody (A) or radiolabeledE. coli HB101 transformed with plasmid pRS-1 (B) as described in the text.

In order to determine whether absent Forssman glycolipid synthesis in humans had a genetic basis, we characterized the human FS gene. GenBankTM and dEST data bases were queried with the canine FS nucleotide sequence using the program BLAST, yielding human genomic cosmid sequences from chromosome 9q34 (GenBankTM accession numbers AC002319 and AC001643). Overall, the nucleotide sequence identity was 86% to the canine FS cDNA. Highest sequence identity was seen between nucleotides 725 and 1050 of the canine cDNA which resides in the putative catalytic domain and is located in a single large exon in the human cosmid sequence. The human FS gene is separated into at least seven exons spanning more than 8 kb of DNA (Fig.3). Genomic organization of the human FS gene is very similar to the highly homologous α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase and ABO transferase loci (25Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Kim D. Van den Eijnden D.H.

In humans each of these related glycosyltransferase genes are located on chromosome 9q34, further supporting the suggestion that this family of glycosyltransferases arose by gene duplication and subsequent divergence (22Haslam D.B.

Primers were designed to amplify specifically a 590-bp product from within exon VII of the FS cDNA. A single band of the expected molecular weight was amplified from cDNA prepared from all tissues tested, suggesting that the FS gene was transcribed in each of these tissues (Fig.4 A). In order to exclude the possibility that the PCR product represented amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, primers spanning intron VI were utilized. Genomic DNA or incompletely processed cDNA was expected to yield a product of approximately 1.5 kb, whereas processed message was expected to yield a product of 528 bp. Brain and kidney cDNA libraries were subjected to PCR with these primers and yielded the expected ≈530-bp product, indicating the presence of spliced transcripts in these cDNA libraries (Fig. 4 B).

These channels are involved in a variety of important processes, such as control of insulin secretion from pancreatic islet beta cells, the response of cardiac and cerebral cells to ischemia, regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone, and modulation of transmitter release at brain synapses. The pharmacologic characteristics of KATP channels include blockade by the sulfonylurea class of agents, such as glibenclamide (1Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev.

Both subunits are required, as individually neither intact subunit is able to produce a functional KATP channel and assemble as an octamer in a 4:4 stoichiometry (4Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K.

The SURx is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Characteristic of this family is the presence of two conserved nucleotide binding folds (NBF), each with Walker A and B subsequences forming the nucleic acid binding pocket (5Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J.

Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Alignment of SURx sequences with other ATP-binding cassette family members reveals the greatest similarity with members of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) group (8Tusnady G. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to the MRP and SUR genes, this group includes the yeast cadmium factor YCF1, the liver canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, and the rabbit epithelial basolateral chloride conductance regulator genes (8Tusnady G.

Disease phenotypes have not yet been assigned to the other KATPchannels. However, based on their importance in the physiology of cardiac and smooth muscle and neurons, one can speculate that abnormalities of them may contribute to disease states. Conservation of several channel types, but not the KATPchannel, has been demonstrated in invertebrate species. The study ofDrosophila has been an effective approach for the identification and characterization of the structure, function, and gene regulation of other potassium channels (16Papazian D.M. Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1987; 237: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 17Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Schwarz T.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel member of the SURx family, Dsur, and thereby demonstrate conservation of glibenclamide-sensitive potassium channel activity in a lower organism. Dsur is expressed specifically in the developing Drosophila dorsal vessel and tracheal system during embryogenesis. The implication of Drosophila as a model system for structural and functional studies of the KATP channel is discussed. Three expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that contained novelDrosophila ABC transporter NBF-2 region motifs were identified. Gene-specific primers were used to amplify 400–500-base pair fragments located at the 5′ end of each EST clone to create probes for library screening. Approximately 106 phage plaques from a Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cDNA library were screened (5′-STRETCH cDNA library, CLONTECH) using standard methods. The full-length SUR homolog was isolated using a combination of several rounds of overlapping library and PCR screening. The 5′ end of the cDNA was isolated using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The final sequence was confirmed as a single message by the sequencing of full-length cDNA products amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from Drosophila embryonic mRNA. Sequence analyses, comparison, and alignments were performed using the BCM Search Launcher interface (19Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Lasergene software. Low stringency conditions included a hybridization and wash temperature of 55 °C, wash buffer of 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and a final wash of 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The probe was located between nucleic acids −131 and 763, relative to the ATG translation initiation codon. Stage V–VI Xenopus laevisoocytes were isolated and injected with RNA as described previously (20McNicholas D.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used, and recordings were obtained from currents elicited by 20-ms test pulses from −100 to 40 mV in 20-mV increments (V hold = −65 mV). Microelectrode pipettes (Kimax-51, Kimble Products) typically had resistances of 0.5–2.0 m (when filled with 3m KCl solution). Oocytes were bathed with a control solution containing (in mmol/liter): 105 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The initial experimental protocol was used to determine whether the current generated was a barium (Ba2+)-sensitive potassium current. It consisted of a 10-min equilibration period in control solution, impalement of the cell, a 5-min control period, a 3-min exposure to 2 mmBa2+, wash in control solution, and a recovery period. In subsequent experiments, the protocol consisted of a 10-min equilibration in control solution, impalement of the cell, a 5-min control period, a 15-min exposure to 500 μm glibenclamide in control bath solution followed by a 3-min exposure to 2 mm Ba2+-containing bath solution, and a 5-min wash in control solution. Oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution ((in mmol/liter): 220N-methylglucamine, 220 aspartic acid, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, room temperature) and allowed to shrink for 2–5 min to aid removal of the vitelline membrane. Following an equilibration period, conventional patch clamp techniques were used to record single-channel currents from cell-attached and inside-out patches expressing Dsur cRNA. Solutions included standard pipette solution (in mmol/liter): 150 KCl, 1.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, and 5.0 HEPES, pH 7.4, which was used throughout the entire study, and bath solution (in mmol/liter): 150 KCl, 5.0 EDTA, and 5.0 HEPES, pH 7.4. Glibenclamide (Sigma) was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO and EtOH (volume ratio, 1:2) and diluted in the appropriate bath solution. Single-channel currents were recorded with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA), low pass filtered at 1 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, and stored on videotape after pulse code modulation (PCM-501ES, Sony). For analysis, data were redigitized (4 kHz) and transferred to a personal computer and analyzed using pCLAMP 6.04 (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Filter copies of the arrayed P1 library were obtained (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) and hybridized with a DsurcDNA-specific probe, which had been proven to be single copy in the genome by genomic Southern blot. To confirm the result obtained by hybridization against the array, the identified P1 clones were obtained (Genome Systems) and prepped, and the presence of each gene was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers previously demonstrated to be Dsur-specific. Direct sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons confirmed the presence of the Dsur sequence. Preparation, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry of whole-mount embryos were performed as described (21Lehman R. Tautz D. In Situ Hybridization to RNA.in: Goldstein L. Gyrberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized in vitro according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 1.2 kilobases of Dsur template that extended from 5455 base pairs through the 3′-noncoding region. Probe detection was performed through use of an alkaline phosphatase enzyme conjugated to anti-digoxigenin antibody. Homozygous mutant embryos were identified by the absence of β-galactosidase enzyme staining, which was carried on a balancer chromosome lacZ insert. We used an approach based on computer searching of the EST data base to identify a Drosophila gene that is highly related to the vertebrate SUR family. Three novel ESTs were identified. However, only one retained consistent homology with SUR sequences through its 5′ end, and we named this gene Dsur. The full-length Dsur cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2167 amino acids (Fig.1), with a predicted molecular mass of 241,858 daltons. Northern analysis performed on Drosophilaembryonic mRNA revealed a message size of approximately 6.5 kilobases, supporting the hypothesis that the full-length cDNA had been isolated (data not shown). The methionine chosen as the translation start site met the Kozak criteria for having the ATG codon flanked by a favorable context for initiation, stop codons in all three reading frames 5′ to this location, and no strong upstream ATG codons in any frame (22Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 23Cavener D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). A consensus polyadenylation site (AATAAA) is located 205 base pairs after the stop codon. Similar to its vertebrate counterparts, Dsur contains structural features characteristic of the ABC transporter family, including the presence of two NBF regions each with a Walker A and B consensus sequence, the ABC signature sequence, and the NBF-2 TIAHRL motif (Refs. 5Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 7Decottinges A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). A computer sequence search of public data bases, using the BLASTP with BEAUTY enhancement program (19Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), reveals that the full-lengthDsur sequence shares greatest homology with vertebrateSUR sequences, whereas further alignments reveal that it fits into the MRP subfamily of ABC transporters (Ref. 8Tusnady G. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar; Fig.2). The similarity of Dsur to members of the vertebrate MRP group is greater than that to otherDrosophila ABC transporter sequences. For example, within the NBF2 region, Dsur was 77% homologous and 51% identical to the rat SUR1/SUR2 genes but 42% homologous and 27% identical to the Drosophila MDR49 gene (24Wu C.T. Budding M. Griffin M.S. Croop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3940-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Dsur is predicted to contain 15 membrane-spanning regions, in a nine + six pattern, with the two cytoplasmic NBF regions each following a transmembrane group (25Rost B. Casadio R. Rariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the structure predicted for the MRP subfamily of ABC transporters (8Tusnady G. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Two regions of hydrophilic sequence that flank the transmembrane region between the NBF domains are present in Dsur but not in either vertebrate SUR or other ABC transporter sequences (Fig. 1). These unique regions of sequence are contained within theDsur transcript and do not represent either cloning artifacts or retained intronic sequences. This was demonstrated by amplification and sequencing of the full-length DsurcDNA from Drosophila mRNA template and determination of genomic organization upon comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences. A computer search of public sequence data bases with these unique portions of Dsur does not reveal significant homology with any known sequence, including potassium channel pore sequences. These two regions of unique sequence are responsible for the difference in size of 585 codons between the vertebrate and DrosophilaSUR molecules. To assess the complexity of the Drosophila KATPchannel system, we sought other SUR isoforms and an inward rectifier subunit. Neither was detected by computer search of theDrosophila EST data base, PCR screening ofDrosophila genomic DNA template using degenerate primers against conserved channel pore regions, or low stringency screening ofDrosophila libraries. Southern blot analysis ofDrosophila genomic DNA, using a Dsur cDNA probe and low stringency conditions, revealed only fragments consistent with Dsur (Fig. 3). Because we were unable to isolate an inward rectifier subunit sequence fromDrosophila and Dsur contains additional sequences beyond that present in vertebrate SUR family members, we postulated that Dsur would be sufficient to generate KATP channel activity. Two microelectrode voltage clamp techniques were used to measure outward whole cell currents fromXenopus oocytes injected with Dsur, humanSUR1, or human Kir6.2 cRNA (Fig.4). In oocytes expressingDsur, average current was 224 ± 5 nA (n = 12) (Fig. 4 A), which is significantly different from the average current of 57 ± 5 nA found in control noninjected oocytes (n = 11, p = 0.001) (Fig. 4 D). To determine the amount of whole cell current that was sensitive to sulfonylureas, the oocytes were perfused with a solution of glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea agent and prototypical inhibitor of the KATP channel (1Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). 96.4 ± 0.6% of this Ba2+-sensitive potassium current was found to be irreversibly inhibited by glibenclamide (n = 10). The residual glibenclamide-insensitive current was not different from the base-line current found in uninjected cells (n = 10,p = 0.12) and was neither Ba2+- nor amiloride-sensitive. No statistically significant increase in whole cell current was observed in those oocytes expressing either humanSUR1 (n = 8) or Kir6.2(n = 3) (Fig. 4, B and C). Average whole cell current for oocytes expressing humanSUR1 was 87.8 ± 4.5 nA, and for those expressingKir6.2, the whole cell current was 77.3 ± 7 nA. Measurement of single-channel currents from inside-out patches, made from Xenopus oocytes expressing the full-lengthDsur cRNA, confirmed the whole cell current studies (Fig.5). In excised patches in the absence of ATP, a low conductance inwardly rectifying potassium channel was observed (n = 3). This channel activity was inhibited by glibenclamide. To determine the embryonic expression pattern of Dsur, whole-mountin situ hybridization was performed using a specific cDNA probe (Fig. 6). The very early embryonic expression is consistent with remnant maternal messages. Specific embryonic expression was noted beginning at stage 10 in the dorsal vessel, the Drosophila homolog of the heart and circulatory system, and beginning at stage 15 in the tracheal system (including tracheal pits, trees, and placodes), posterior spiracles, and salivary glands. Once initiated, expression remained present throughout embryogenesis. Dsur is expressed in the larval and adult stages, as demonstrated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA isolated from wild-typeDrosophila (data not shown). Using the arrayed P1 library generated by the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project, we demonstrated that P1 clones DS07249, DS04407, and DS05801 contain the Dsur sequence, placing it in the 31B1–2 region of the second Drosophilachromosome. Chromosomal deficiencies Df(2L)J2 and Df(2L)J1 span this region (26Clegg N.J. Whitehead I.P. Brock J.K. Sinclair D.A. Mottus R. Stromotich G. Harrington M.J. Grigliati T.A. Genetics. 1993; 134: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As assessed by in situ hybridization, animals with homozygous mutants for either genotype or heterozygous mutants for both genotypes lack the Dsur message, confirming the chromosomal localization of Dsur (data not shown). We have isolated a novel member of the SUR family,Dsur, from the Drosophila genome. Sequence analysis places Dsur into the MRP group of ABC transporters. In general, ABC transporters of various types exhibit the greatest homology in the characteristic and conserved NBF regions. Little or no homology may be present in other regions of the molecules, although the membrane topology is anticipated to be similar (7Decottinges A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between Dsur and vertebrate SUR family members is not limited to the NBF regions but rather extends the length of the molecule to the amino terminus. Together, sequence analysis results and electrophysiologic characterization support the assignment ofDsur into the SUR family of ABC transporters. These data support the hypothesis that Dsur encodes a glibenclamide-sensitive potassium channel with inward rectification characteristics like those of I K(ATP) generated by the complex of SURx and Kir6.2 subunits (3Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar).Dsur appears novel among SUR family members because expression of it alone in Xenopus oocytes results in measurable channel activity. We cannot discount the possibility that an endogenous protein present in Xenopus oocytes may interact with Dsur and confer the ability for production of channel activity. However, heterologous expression of mammalian SUR alone inXenopus oocytes, HEK 293 cells, and COS cells has not demonstrated such an event, making this possibility seem remote (Refs.2Aguilar-Bryan L.

Gonoi T. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1996; 4: 177-190Google Scholar; Fig. 4 B). We speculate that the unique ability of Dsur to generate potassium channel activity when expressed alone stems from those regions of the sequence that are present in Dsur but not other SUR family members. Detailed electrophysiological characterization of engineeredDsur mutants might provide additional information in this regard. Our results reveal that isolation of Dsur providesDrosophila as a unique model system for structural definition and functional analysis of the KATP channel in a relatively simple system that lacks gene redundancy. The increase in size and complexity of the mammalian genome, which is estimated to be four to six times larger than that of Drosophila, is attributed to the duplication of ancestral genomes. However, the core number of biochemical pathways and signaling mechanisms is predicted to be similar between Drosophila and mammals (28Miklos G. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 521-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The embryonic expression pattern of Dsur implies a potential role for the sulfonylurea receptor family in cell migration, as the tracheal system is undergoing directed cell migration but not cell division during the developmental stages of Dsur expression (29Manning G. Krasnow M.A. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 609-687Google Scholar). Indeed, our preliminary analysis of deletion mutants in the region of Dsur reveals normal tracheal cell specification but marked abnormalities in the architecture of the tracheal system, which can be attributed to aberrant cell migration. Branched tubular epithelial structures like the Drosophila tracheal system are common in nature (29Manning G. Krasnow M.A. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 609-687Google Scholar) and include the cardiovascular system, lung, and pancreas. Therefore, additional understanding of upstream regulators, downstream effectors, and physiological function ofDsur gained from the study of the Drosophilamodel system may have much broader implications.

Met-mediated invasive growth requires autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosines located in the kinase activation loop (Tyr1234–Tyr1235) and in the carboxyl-terminal tail (Tyr1349–Tyr1356). We report that peptides derived from the Met receptor tail, but not from the activation loop, bind the receptor and inhibit the kinase activity in vitro. Cell delivery of the tail receptor peptide impairs HGF-dependent Met phosphorylation and downstream signaling. In normal and transformed epithelial cells, the tail receptor peptide inhibits HGF-mediated invasive growth, as measured by cell migration, invasiveness, and branched morphogenesis. The Met tail peptide inhibits the closely related Ron receptor but does not significantly affect the epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activities. These experiments show that carboxyl-terminal sequences impair the catalytic properties of the Met receptor, thus suggesting that in the resting state the nonphosphorylated tail acts as an intramolecular modulator.

Both Met and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, although their expression is confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, respectively. Signaling via this ligand-receptor pair triggers a unique biological program in target cells leading to “invasive cell growth.” The latter results from the integration of multiple biological responses to HGF such as cell proliferation, survival, motility, invasion of extracellular matrices, and formation of tubular structures (branched morphogenesis) (3Stoker M.

During mouse development the coordinated control of the invasive growth program by the HGF/Met pair is essential, since knock-out experiments involving either the ligand or the receptor result in embryonic lethality due to defects in migration of myoblasts, implantation of placenta, and liver development (7Bladt F.

Binding of growth factors has been shown to induce receptor dimerization and is associated with autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues both within and outside the catalytic domain in the receptor dimer (15Ullrich A.

Whereas the former are required for catalytic activity (catalytic tyrosines), the latter can serve as high affinity binding sites (docking tyrosines) for effector or adaptor molecules that recruit signal transducers to the receptor (18Cantley L.C.

As for other tyrosine kinase receptors, activation of Met results in autophosphorylation of both “catalytic” and “docking” tyrosines. The major Met phosphorylation site is represented by tyrosines Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 (21Ferracini R. Longati P. Naldini L. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are located within the activation loop of the kinase domain and are part of a three-tyrosine motif (Tyr1230, Tyr1234, and Tyr1235) conserved in other kinase receptors. Both Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 are essential for full activation of the enzyme (22Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of these residues, the enzymatic activity of the Met kinase is up-regulated in an autocatalytic fashion (21Ferracini R. Longati P. Naldini L. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Naldini L. Vigna E. Ferracini R. Longati P. Gandino L. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When the Met receptor is activated, in addition to phosphorylation of the catalytic tyrosines, two other tyrosines (Tyr1349-Tyr1356) located in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor become phosphorylated (24Ponzetto C.

Selective inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptors can be useful to study their activation mechanisms, to dissect their signaling pathways, and to interfere with their biological effects. A number of receptors (fibroblast growth factor receptor, Ret, epidermal growth factor receptor, Kit/Steel, Met) are directly involved in human diseases including cancer, skeletal, and other developmental disorders (34Muenke M. Schell U. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Pasini B. Ceccherini I. Romeo G.

Druker B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 217-248PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of molecules capable of selective inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptors has a number of potential applications. In the current study we sought to identify peptides capable of blocking both the kinase activity and the biological properties of the Met receptor. Previous kinetic and crystallographic studies suggest that receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e. IR, fibroblast growth factor receptor) can be inhibited by sequences corresponding to autophosphorylation sites located in the kinase activation loop (38Shoelson S.E. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7831-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A.

Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In view of these observations we exploited the use of sequences derived from the activation loop to interfere with the biochemical and biological properties of the Met receptor. Unexpectedly, we found that activation loop peptides do not act as Met inhibitors. We reasoned that sequences containing autophosphorylation sites of the carboxyl-terminal tail could be an alternative approach to modulate receptor activity. Accordingly, we show that a tail peptide inhibited Met kinase activity in vitro, blocked ligand-dependent phosphorylation and signal transduction, and impaired Met-induced invasive growth in transformed epithelial cells. The Met tail peptide does not significantly affect the EGF, PDGF, or VEGF receptor activities, demonstrating that the inhibitory mechanism is selective. These data provide evidence that peptides containing carboxyl-terminal sequences can efficiently work as inhibitors of the Met tyrosine kinase, and suggest that in the resting state the carboxyl-terminal domain may act as an intramolecular modulator of this receptor.

Cultures of mammalian cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI supplemented with 10% serum (Sigma) (or 20% in the case of human endothelial cells cells) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, air. 200 μg of each peptide were incubated in 0.01 m NH4HCO3, pH 9.0, at a final concentration of 200 μm in the presence of 100 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature. Efficiency of fluoresceination was verified by 22% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-fluorescein antibodies. To assess cell permeability of peptides, fluoresceinated peptides were added to culture medium at a final concentration of 20 μm, and after 2 h, cells were fixed and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To calculate the intracellular concentration of Antennapedia peptides, cells were incubated with the Ant-Tyr1234–1235- and Ant-Tyr1349–1356-fluoresceinated peptides for 1 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed. Total lysates were analyzed by 22% SDS-PAGE. The presence of the fluoresceinated peptide in the lysate was revealed directly using the Fluorimager system (Molecular Dynamics). The concentration of the peptide was evaluated by comparison with lysates containing known amount of fluoresceinated peptide. The Met or the Tpr-Met tyrosine kinase were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met antibodies from GTL-16 or from transfected COS cells lysates in the absence of sodium orthovanadate to allow dephosphorylation. After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to autophosphorylation in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 20 μm peptide, 10 μm cold ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) for 20 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding boiling Laemmli buffer, and samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. In kinetic experiments, 5 μm myelin basic protein (Sigma) was also included in the reaction as a substrate together with increasing concentrations of peptides, 40 μm cold ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample). The reaction was performed at 4 °C for 25 min and stopped by adding Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by 8–12% SDS-PAGE followed by analysis with the PhosphorImager STORM (Molecular Dynamics). The intensity of bands corresponding to phosphorylated Met and myelin basic protein was quantitated using the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). A549 cells were lysed in EB buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) including 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with 20 μmpeptide for 1 h; heparin-Sepharose was then added for 2 h to allow peptide binding to heparin. Samples were washed extensively with EB buffer including 1 m LiCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Met antibodies. Alternatively, peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 10, an activated affinity support from Bio-Rad, by incubation in Me2SO for 4 h at 4 °C. 100 mm ethanolamine was added to block any other active groups, and interaction with the receptor was assayed as above. The binding of immobilized peptides with the Met catalytic domain was detected using lysates from Sf9 cells expressing the isolated Met kinase domain. A549 cells were starved in serum-free medium for 48 h; MLP-29 cells were maintained in 2% serum for 3 days and then starved for 16 h in serum-free medium; human endothelial cells cells were starved for 12 h in serum-free medium with the addition of 2% bovine serum albumin. After starvation, cells were treated with peptides at the indicated concentrations for the indicated time and stimulated with the appropriate factor (80 ng/ml HGF, 100 ng/ml macrophage-stimulating protein, 100 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml PDGF, 20 ng/ml VEGF) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in EB buffer including sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the appropriate antibodies, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting as indicated. To evaluate MAP kinase phosphorylation, 100 μg of total lysates/sample were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-active MAP kinase antibodies. 3.5 × 103 cells/well (24 well cluster: Costar) were seeded in medium containing 2% serum. Cells were pretreated for 2 h with peptides at a final concentration of 20 μm and incubated with HGF (20 ng/ml) in the presence of peptides. After 12 h, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde (11% in phosphate-buffered saline) and stained with crystal violet. 105 cells were seeded in medium containing 10% serum on the upper side of a porous polycarbonate membrane (8.0-μm pore size) coated with 1.2 mg/ml artificial basement membrane, Matrigel® (Collaborative Research, Waltham, MA) containing laminin, collagen type IV, proteoglycans, and growth factors. Cells were treated with 20 μm peptides for 2 h and incubated with 20 ng/ml HGF in the presence of peptides. After 24 h of incubation, cells on the upper side of the filters were mechanically removed. Cells that had invaded the Matrigel® and migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed with glutaraldehyde (11% in phosphate-buffered saline) and stained with crystal violet. The crystal violet was solubilized with 10% acetic acid, and the concentration was evaluated as absorbance at 590 nm. Invasive growth in collagen was assessed in tridimensional collagen gels as described (47Medico E. Mongiovı̀ A.M. Huff J. Jelinek M.A. Follenzi A. Gaudino G. Parsons J.T. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 105 cells/ml were suspended on ice in gel solution containing eight parts type I collagen 2 mg/ml stock solution (G Collagen, Seromed), 1 part 10× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 1 part Hepes, 0.5 m, pH 7.4. The cold mixture was placed into microtiter plate wells and allowed to polymerize for 15 min at 37 °C before adding 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% serum. Cells were cultured for 24–36 h until they formed spherical structures, then treated with 20 μm peptides for 2 h and incubated with 20 ng/ml HGF in the presence of peptides. Cells were cultured for 5 days and examined under a phase-contrast microscope. Activation of the Met receptor results in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues located both in the kinase activation loop (Tyr1234–Tyr1235) and in the carboxyl-terminal tail (Tyr1349–Tyr1356) (21Ferracini R. Longati P. Naldini L. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). A number of peptides were synthesized corresponding to the Met autophosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). All peptides contained the Antennapedia internalization domain at the amino terminus (41Joliot A. Pernelle C. Deagostini-Bazin H. Prochiantz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). This sequence has been shown to freely translocate across biological membranes with minimal cell toxicity (42Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). An unphosphorylable version of the Tyr1349–Tyr1356 peptide was obtained by substituting the tyrosines with phenylalanine residues (Ant-Phe1349–1356). Two additional peptides were synthesized including the Antennapedia control peptide (Ant), a shorter version of the Tyr1349–Tyr1356 peptide lacking tyrosine 1356 (Ant- Tyr1349), and a scrambled Tyr1349–Tyr1356 peptide (Ant-scrambled). We investigated the possibility that peptides derived from the activation loop and the carboxyl-terminal tail could be used as inhibitors of the Met receptor. Peptides including Tyr1234–Tyr1235 and Tyr1349–Tyr1356 were compared for their ability to inhibit the receptor kinase activity in autophosphorylation assays performed in vitro. The Met receptor was immunopurified from GTL16 cells and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated peptide. We observed that the tail peptide efficiently inhibited Met autophosphorylation whereas the activation loop peptide had little effect (Fig. 2, panel A and B). To exclude a nonspecific effect of the tail peptide, either a scrambled Tyr1349–Tyr1356peptide version or a truncated peptide lacking Tyr1356 was included in the experiments. These peptides had little effect on the kinase activity of the Met receptor, showing that inhibition by the tail peptide depends on its primary amino acid sequence. The effect of the Tyr1349–Tyr1356 peptide could be due to ATP depletion (resulting from progressive peptide phosphorylation) or to direct inhibition of the kinase reaction (resulting from interaction of the peptide substrate with the catalytic active site). To test this, a nonphosphorylable peptide analogue was designed by replacing the tyrosine with phenylalanine residues unable to accept kinase-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer from ATP. The Phe-containing tail peptide inhibited Met autophosphorylation in vitro as efficiently as the parental Tyr counterpart, suggesting that direct binding to the active site could be responsible for the Tyr1349–Tyr1356 inhibitory potential (Fig. 2,panel A and B). The effect of peptides on substrate phosphorylation was next measured using myelin basic protein. At low peptide concentrations, only the Tyr1349–Tyr1356 and the Phe1349–Phe1356-containing peptides inhibited the reaction. As expected, at higher concentrations the competitive effect of the Tyr1234–Tyr1235 derivative was also detected (Fig. 2, panel B). These experiments show that peptides containing carboxyl-terminal sequences efficiently inhibit the Met kinase activity in vitro through a mechanism that does not rely on substrate competition. The possibility that the carboxyl-terminal domain may interfere with the kinase activity by interacting directly with the kinase domain of the receptor was evaluated. Peptides were immobilized on heparin-Sepharose that has been shown previously to bind the Antennapedia moiety (43Perez F. Joliot A. Bloch-Gallego E. Zahraoui A. Triller A. Prochiantz A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing the Met protein were incubated with the immobilized peptides, and the associated receptor was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Met antibodies. Fig. 3 shows that the carboxyl-terminal peptides bind the Met receptor most likely by interacting with its catalytic region. To verify this hypothesis, we performed similar experiments using the isolated catalytic domain (amino acid 1044–1347) lacking the juxtamembrane domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail docking sites. The isolated Met kinase domain, containing a polyhistidine tag, is catalytically active and constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated when expressed in Sf9 cells (data not shown). Immobilized tail peptides were incubated with lysates containing the catalytic domain. The associated kinase domain protein was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Ptyr antibodies (Fig. 3, panel C). To further characterize the interaction mechanism, we performed the same experiment with tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. The phosphorylated tail peptide interacts with the Met catalytic domain with a slightly increased efficiency when compared with its unphosphorylated counterpart (data not shown). Oncogenic forms of the Met receptor have been described including Tpr-Met and Met-PRC mutants. In Tpr-Met the extracellular domain of Met is replaced by Tpr sequences, which provide two strong dimerization motifs. Dimerization causes constitutive activation of the Tpr-Met kinase, which acquires transforming and metastatic properties (10Cooper C.S. Park M. Blair D.G. Tainsky M.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M.

Recently CK2 has been reported to catalyze phosphorylation of the yeast nucleolar immunophilin Fpr3 at a tyrosyl residue (Tyr184) fulfilling the consensus sequence of Ser/Thr substrates (Wilson, L.K., Dhillon, N., Thorner, J., and Martin, G.S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12961–12967). Here we show that, by contrast to other tyrosyl peptides fulfilling the consensus sequence for CK2, a peptide reproducing the sequence around Fpr3 Tyr184(DEDADIY184DEEDYDL) is phosphorylated by CK2, albeit with much higher K m (384 versus 4.3 μm) and lower V max (8.4versus 1,132 nmol·min−1·mg−1) than its derivative with Tyr184 replaced by serine. The replacement of Asp at position n + 1 with alanine and, to a lesser extent, of Ile at n − 1 with Asp are especially detrimental to tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with serine phosphorylation, which is actually stimulated by the Ile to Asp modification. In contrast the replacement of Glu at n + 3 with alanine almost suppresses serine phosphorylation but not tyrosine phosphorylation. It can be concluded that CK2 is capable to phosphorylate, under special circumstances, tyrosyl residues, which are specified by structural features partially different from those that optimize Ser/Thr phosphorylation.

Issinger O.-G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the crystal structure of CK2 α subunit from Zea mays, 70% identical to its human counterpart (6Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), has disclosed the structural features that account for some unusual properties of this kinase, notably high basal activity and ability to use GTP, besides ATP as phosphate donor. Another striking feature of CK2 is its terrific pleiotropy. The list of its substrates includes more than 160 proteins, many of which are implicated in signal transduction, gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell division and proliferation. Consistent with this wide spectrum of physiological targets is the subcellular localization of CK2, which is found in nearly all the subcellular compartments, including the outer side of the plasma membrane (7Walter J. Schnolzer M. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. Kübler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and with the possible exception of the Golgi apparatus (8Lasa M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although it is especially abundant in nuclei (9Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in the soluble cytosol (2Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A common denominator of CK2 substrates is the presence of highly acidic phosphoacceptor sites in them, almost invariably fulfilling the consensus S/T-x-x-E/D, but generally including several additional negatively charged side chains (either carboxylic or phosphorylated residues) in addition to or, in few instances, instead of the crucial one at position n + 3 (10Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of these acidic clusters for optimal phosphorylation efficiency has been clearly outlined by systematic studies with peptide substrates (11Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Chessa G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14576-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and a number of unique basic residues responsible for the binding of individual specificity determinants (with special reference to those at positions n + 3 and n + 1) have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis of CK2α (15Sarno S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11717-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies on CK2 specificity, some clues were provided that tyrosyl residues might bind to the active site instead of serine and threonine; thus random polymers including tyrosine and glutamic acid are much more powerful inhibitors than just poly-Glu (18Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and pseudosubstrate peptides in which tyrosine has been replaced for serine inhibit CK2 more efficiently than their counterparts where serine had been replaced by alanine (1Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Consequently the peptide EEEEEYEEEEEEE is a powerful inhibitor (19Vaglio P. Sarno S. Marin O. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) whose binding to CK2 is closely reminiscent to that of a canonical substrate (20Sarno S. Vaglio P. Cesaro L. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither in the case of this peptide nor in that of poly(Glu4Tyr), however, could any significant phosphorylation of tyrosine be detected, supporting the view that CK2 is a bona fide Ser/Thr-specific protein kinase unable to catalyze phosphate transfer to tyrosyl resides once these are bound in its active site. Recently, however, a yeast nucleolar protein, immunophilin Fpr3, has been found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated (21Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although inSaccharomyces cerevisiae bona fide tyrosine kinases are lacking (22Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); the kinase responsible for this event was shown to be CK2 (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl residue phosphorylated in Fpr3 either in vivo or in vitro by CK2 (Tyr184) is embedded in a very acidic cluster (DEDEDADIYDSEDYD) and fulfills the optimal sequence for CK2 phosphorylation for including in addition to the crucial acidic determinant at n + 3 several other acidic residues nearby. Consequently a peptide substrate reproducing this sequence was also phosphorylated by CK2 at Tyr184. Such a phosphorylation was improved by previous phosphorylation of the seryl residue at position n + 2 or by its replacement with a glutamic acid, suggesting that in this special case the determinant at position n + 2 might play a relevant role. The relevance of the other residues nearby, however, was not assessed nor was the phosphorylation of the tyrosyl peptide compared with that of canonical seryl peptide substrates of CK2. Here we show that the phosphorylation efficiency of the Fpr3 tyrosyl peptide is very low compared with that of its seryl counterpart, both in terms of V max and K m and depending on structural features that are partially distinct from those determining the phosphorylation of canonical substrates. DEAE-cellulose filters (NA45) were from Schleicher & Schuell. P81 phosphocellulose papers were from Whatman. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were from Sigma. Native CK2 was purified from rat liver cytosol as described previously (24Meggio F. Donella Deana A. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11958-11961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant forms of CK2 either wild type or its mutants defective in substrate recognition were obtained as described elsewhere (16Sarno S. Vaglio P. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10595-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl peptides DEDADIYDEEDYDL, DEDADIYDS(p)EDYDL, DEDADIYAEEDYDL, DEDADIYDAEDYDL, DEDADIYDEADYDL, DEDADDYDEEDYDL, DEDADIFDEEDYDL, and RRRADDYDDDDD as well as their seryl analogues DEDADISDEEDYDL, DEDADISAEEDYDL, DEDADISDEADYDL, and DEDADDSDEEDYDL were synthesized by an automated peptide synthesizer ABI 431-A (Applied Biosystems) on 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxymethylcopolystirene-1% divinylbenzene resin (1.04 mmol/g). The synthesis of the peptides EEEEEYEEEEEEE and PEGDYEEELE was described previously (19Vaglio P. Sarno S. Marin O. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A.

Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole protocol (27Marin O. Meggio F. Sarno S. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in a 0.05 mmol scale. The incorporation of phosphate into the Ser residue has been performed according to a building block approach using Fmoc-Ser(PO(benzyl))OH (from Novabiochem) during the synthesis. Cleavage of peptides from the resin and side chain deprotection was carried out by treatment of the peptidyl resin with trifluoroacetic acid/anisole/ethanedithiol/ethylmethylsulfide (95:3:1:1). In the presence of the benzyl protecting group on phosphoserine a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid /triisopropylsilane/water (95:2.5:2.5) was preferred. The crude peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a preparative reverse phase column Prep Nova-Pak HR C18, 6 μm, 25 × 10 mm (Waters). The analytical HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of the purified peptides showed a correct sequence and a ≥95% purity. Synthetic peptide substrates (0.5 mm) were phosphorylated by incubation in a medium (25 μl final volume) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity 500–1,000 cpm/pmol) unless otherwise indicated. The reaction was started with the addition of the enzyme (0.23 μg of either native or recombinant CK2) and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.25m EDTA and cooling in ice. Phosphorylation of Fpr3-derived synthetic peptides was evaluated according to the procedure described by Wilson et al. (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by using DEAE-cellulose filters. Phosphorylation of RRRADDSDDDDD and of its tyrosyl derivative was quantitated by the phosphocellulose paper procedure (28Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Control experiments were also performed with both types of peptides by determining phosphate incorporation after conversion of [γ-32P]ATP into Pi and phosphomolybdic complex extraction as described previously (29Meggio F. Donella A. Pinna L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The peptide DEDADIYDEEDYDL, previously phosphorylated by CK2 as described above, was loaded onto a SuperPac Pep-S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) C2/18 (5 μm) column (4.6 × 250 mm). Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 40% for 30 min and then from 40 to 100% for 10 min. The effluent was monitored by absorbance measurements at 220 nm. The radioactivity of the fractions collected (1 ml) was determined by counting in a liquid scintillation apparatus (Canberra-Packard). Calculations were made on an Indy R4000 (Silicon Graphics) workstation. For human CK2α subunit modeling, the crystal structure of Zea mays CK2α was used (Protein Data Bank number 1A6O). The two sequences were aligned using the Insight II package (Molecular Simulation Inc.) with the protein homology tools. For elaboration of the model of human CK2α, the program Modeler (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar) was used. Five structures were obtained from Modeler, and the one with the highest structural homology with respect to maize CK2α was used further. The backbone of the central part of the Fpr3 peptide (DIYDEE) has been shaped using as a template the equivalent sequence of protein kinase inhibitor bound to the catalytic subunit of PKA (Protein Data Bank number 1atp). The peptide was manually placed in CK2α catalytic pocket avoiding physical interference with residues of the kinase. The obtained structure was minimized using the Discover module of Insight II package until the energy reached a minimum. The time courses for CK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of the Fpr3 peptide with Glu at position n + 2 relative to Tyr184 instead of serine and of its derivative where Tyr184 was replaced by serine are compared in Fig.1 A. It can be seen that the phosphorylation of the tyrosyl peptide is negligible as compared with that of its seryl counterpart, especially after short incubation times. By prolonging incubation the phosphorylation of the seryl peptide reaches a plateau when ATP is nearly exhausted, whereas the phosphorylation of the tyrosyl peptide slowly increases up to 2 h of incubation. By increasing ATP concentration (1 mm) over that of the peptides (0.5 mm) a stoichiometric phosphorylation of the seryl peptide was attained after 30 min of incubation, whereas the phosphorylation of the tyrosyl peptide was still far from stoichiometric (around 0.03 mol/mol) after 2 h (not shown). Albeit slow, the phosphorylation of the Fpr3 tyrosyl peptide was quite significant especially if compared with that of another tyrosyl peptide featured after the optimal peptide substrate routinely used for assaying CK2 (Fig. 1 B). In this case, no detectable phosphorylation of the tyrosyl peptide could be observed, although that of its seryl counterpart was even faster than that of the seryl derivative of the Fpr3 peptide. The stoichiometry of the Fpr3 tyrosyl peptide phosphorylation was confirmed by HPLC where the phosphoderivative can be resolved from the nonphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2), thus allowing their relative quantitation (∼3% versus 97%).Figure 2HPLC separation of tyrosine-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the Fpr3-derived peptide DEDADIYDEEDYDL.

This latter includes a glutamic acid at position n + 3, which is the main determinant for CK2 recognition (13Marchiori F. Meggio F. Marin O. Borin G. Calderan A. Ruzza P. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and an aspartic acid at positionn + 1 where also an acidic residue is very important (17Sarno S. Vaglio P. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Ruffato K. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11717-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Position n + 2 is occupied in the wild type peptide by a serine, whose primary phosphorylation by CK2 is believed to improve subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine, because its replacement by alanine, but not by glutamic acid, was detrimental (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); thus it appeared that a negatively charged side chain at n + 2, a position rather unimportant for serine phosphorylation (13Marchiori F. Meggio F. Marin O. Borin G. Calderan A. Ruzza P. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), might be crucial for tyrosine phoshorylation. In contrast, positionn − 1 in the Fpr3 site is occupied by isoleucine, a rare feature in CK2 sites, where an acidic residue was shown to be preferred and is actually found in about 50% of the natural substrates (10Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore decided to check how much the substitution of this Ile by Asp, of Asp (+1) by Ala, of Glu (+2) by Ala or phosphoserine, and of Glu (+3) by Ala might affect phosphorylation by CK2. As shown by the time courses in Fig. 3, the most detrimental substitution (a part of Tyr184, confirming that this one and not the other tyrosine, Tyr189 undergoes phosphorylation) is that of alanine instead of glutamic acid atn + 1, followed by aspartic acid instead of isoleucine atn − 1, whereas the replacement of the most important acidic determinant in canonical CK2 substrates, i.e. Glu atn + 3, by alanine is in this case much better tolerated. In contrast to a previous report (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the replacement of Glu atn + 2 by alanine has no effect, whereas a phosphoserine in this position significantly improves phosphorylation (Fig. 3). As shown in Table I, the differences in phosphorylation outlined by the time courses of Fig. 3 are variably accounted for by changes inV max and/or K m. Especially remarkable is the drop in phosphorylation efficiency due to both a dramatic decrease of V max and an increase ofK m promoted by the Ala for Asp substitution atn + 1. In comparison, the effect of a similar substitution at the “crucial” n + 3 position, due to just a 2-fold increase in K m, is negligible. The detrimental effect of replacing Ile at n − 1 with Asp (see Fig.3), appears to be be exclusively due to a drop inV max (Table I). Table I also highlights the striking superiority of the seryl derivative of the Fpr3 peptide over the tyrosyl peptide both in terms of V max (>130-fold higher) and ofK m (almost 90-fold lower), and it corroborates the view that the specificity determinants are different with the two peptides. In fact the replacement of Ile at n − 1 by Asp, far from being detrimental, is actually improving the phosphorylation efficiency of the seryl derivative and the replacement at position n + 3 is more detrimental than that atn + 1. The particularly crucial role of the acidic determinant at positionn + 1 as opposed to that at position n + 3 in determining tyrosine phosphorylation was also confirmed by experiments with CK2 mutants, which are defective in the recognition of individual determinants. As shown in Fig. 4, mutant K198A with reduced ability to bind the determinant at position +1 (17Sarno S. Vaglio P. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Ruffato K. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11717-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is much more defective toward the tyrosyl peptide than it is toward its seryl derivative. The opposite applies to another mutant, K74A/K77A, which is unable to recognize the determinant at n + 3 (16Sarno S. Vaglio P. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10595-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To gain further information about the mode of binding of Tyr184-containing peptides to CK2 active site a modelization analysis has been performed using as a template a structure of human CK2α derived from 70% identical maize CK2α crystallized in the absence of phosphoacceptor substrate (6Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The central part of the parent Fpr3 peptide (-DIY184DEE-) shaped after the pseudo-substrate peptide bound to the catalytic subunit of PKA (31Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-h. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) has been placed into the active site of CK2α. After energy minimization, a model was obtained (Fig.5) that is largely consistent with experimental observations. It should be noted in particular that the tyrosyl residue protrudes into the active site with its hydroxyl group in the proximity of two crucial elements of catalysis, namely the catalytic base Asp156 (homologous to PKA Asp166) and Lys158, homologous to PKA Lys168 believed to bridge the phosphate to the peptide during the catalytic event (32Trafny Madhusudan E.A. Xuong N.-h. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The distances between the phosphoacceptor hydroxyl group of tyrosine and either Asp156 (2.67 Å) or Lys158 (2.89 Å) are comparable with those found in the complex between PKA and a seryl peptide substrate (2.7 and 3.0 Å, respectively) (32Trafny Madhusudan E.A. Xuong N.-h. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The only evident interaction with peptide substrate side chains is the one between the carboxylate of aspartate at position n + 1 and positively charged groups in the loop p + 1 (Lys195 and Lys198). In contrast, the side chain of glutamate at position n + 3 is far away from the 74–77 basic cluster, which is responsible for tight interaction with the n + 3 determinant of seryl peptides (17Sarno S. Vaglio P. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Ruffato K. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11717-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with the relatively modest effect of replacing Glu (n + 3) as compared with the dramatic drop of efficiency promoted by Asp (n + 1) substitution (see Table I). In our model, the side chain of Ile (n − 1) protrudes outside the surface of the kinase. This, however, is likely to be an artifact of modelization where the water surrounding CK2α, expected to repel the hydrophobic side chain of isoleucine, is not considered. It should be finally outlined that the Tyr versus Ser/Thr specificity of CK2 appears not to be affected by a number of effectors and/or experimental conditions, which are known to impinge on CK2 activity. In particular CK2 catalytic activity toward the Frp3 tyrosyl and seryl peptides is equally stimulated by association with the β subunit (about 3-fold) and by addition of 336 nm polylysine to the holoenzyme (about 2-fold) and displays similar activation curves by either Mg2+ or Mn2+. With both peptides, GTP can replace ATP as phosphate donor and the K m with respect to ATP (33 μm) is not modified by replacing one peptide with the other (data not shown). Nearly all members of the huge eukaryotic protein kinase family fall into two categories, Ser/Thr- and Tyr-specific enzymes, respectively (33Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). In most instances the borderline between these two groups, empirically drawn using substrates of the two sorts, is quite sharp and clear-cut, being also based on differences in primary structure motifs (34Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). In a few instances, however, protein kinases may display a dual specificity in that they are able to phosphorylate both Ser/Thr and Tyr residues (35Lindberg L.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The only known sensu strictodual specificity protein kinases are probably those of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family, which are highly dedicated kinases that catalyze the simultaneous phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr in a conserved sequence, T-x-Y present in the activation loop of mitogen-activated protein kinases. In several instances, however, bona fide Ser/Thr protein kinases have been reported to display tyrosine kinase activity as well under certain circumstances, detectable either as autophosphorylation or toward trans substrates. In general the latter is negligible compared with that observed toward canonical Ser/Thr sites. The list of these Ser/Thr kinases exhibiting low Tyr kinase activity as well includes among others phosphorylase kinase (36Yuan C.-J. Huang C.-Y.F. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and Spk1 (37Stern D.F. Zheng P. Beidler D.R. Zerillo C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), CK1 (38Hoekstra M.E. Dhillon N. Carmel G. DeMaggio A.J. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Kuret J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Pulgar V. Tapia C. Vignolo P. Santos J. Sunkel C.E. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), CK2 (40Chardot T. Shen H. Meunier J.C. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1995; 318: 937-942PubMed Google Scholar), and even PKA (37Stern D.F. Zheng P. Beidler D.R. Zerillo C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Conversely it should be noted that also a classical tyrosine kinase like Src can phosphorylate aliphatic as well as aromatic alcohols in a stretch of peptide (41Lee T.R. Niu J. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5375-5380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is likely therefore that in several instances this hardly detectable “dual” specificity ofbona fide Ser/Thr protein kinases is a mechanistic curiosity devoid of practical consequences. That this may not always be the case, however, is supported by the observation that in lower eukaryotes, like yeast, where bona fide tyrosine kinases are absent, tyrosine-specific protein phosphatases are nevertheless present (22Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins other than kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family has been reported to take place. It is tempting therefore to assume that tyrosine phosphorylation by bona fide Ser/Thr kinases is a physiologically relevant event in these cases. A notable example of this situation is provided by immunophilin Fpr3, an abundant nucleolar protein, a member of the FK506-binding subfamily of immunophilins (42Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is a substrate of S. cerevisiaeprotein-tyrosine phosphatase Ptp1. Phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation by Ptp1 prevents nucleolar accumulation of Fpr3 in vivo (21Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl residue phosphorylated in Fpr3 was identified as Tyr184, residing in a highly acidic sequence fulfilling optimal conditions for CK2 catalyzed phosphorylation, and indeed CK2 was shown to be responsible for Tyr phosphorylation of Fpr3 and to be able to phosphorylate in vitro a tyrosyl peptide reproducing the sequence around Tyr184 (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This observation would include CK2 in the growing list of sensu lato dual specificity protein kinases, despite the previous failure to demonstrate any activity of CK2 toward tyrosyl peptides fulfilling its consensus sequence. This prompted us to undertake a study of the structural features underlying tyrosine phosphorylation by CK2 and to compare this activity with that toward canonical Ser/Thr substrates. The main outcomes of this investigation are the following. 1) The phosphorylation of Fpr3-derived tyrosyl peptide, albeit quite significant, is negligible compared with that of an identical peptide where tyrosine is replaced by serine. This shows that even in this case serine is by far preferred over tyrosine by CK2. The superiority of the seryl peptide is due to both much lower K m and much higher V max. The low V maxof the tyrosyl peptide suggests that its phosphorylated product leaves the active site of the kinase very slowly, a situation that could give rise to remarkable product inhibition. Also, consistent with this interpretation would be the low phosphorylation stoichiometry of the tyrosyl peptide (<5%). It is possible that in vivo the kinetics of Tyr184 phosphorylation are improved either by features intrinsic to the full-length Fpr3 protein conformation or by the fast translocation of phospho-Fpr3 to separate compartment(s). In this respect a comparison between the kinetic constants of Tyr184 peptides and those of full-length Fpr3 would be misleading since Tyr184 is just a minor Fpr3 phosphoacceptor site (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); consequently the parameters calculated with Fpr3 would mainly reflect the phosphorylation of residues other than Tyr184. It is worth noting, however, that a significant phosphorylation of Tyr184 by CK2 is observable under conditions where GST-Fpr3 is about 1 μm (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although at this concentration the phosphorylation of the best peptide substrate, whose K m is 370 μm, would be flatly undetectable. It is likely therefore that indeed the phosphorylation efficiency of Tyr184 is improved by features that are lacking in the peptides used in our study. On the other hand the reason for the discrepancy between our data and that reported by Wilsonet al. (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where a 1 to 1 phosphorylation stoichiometry of the same peptide is reported to occur after less than 2 h of incubation with recombinant human CK2, is not clear. It should be noted, however, that the stoichiometry reported in that paper is not consistent with the experimental conditions used, where ATP and the peptide are 100 and 580 μm, respectively, allowing at best a 20% phosphorylation stoichiometry. 2) CK2 activity ratio toward the tyrosyl versus the seryl derivative of the Fpr3 peptide is not significantly affected by either the subunit composition of CK2 (catalytic subunit versusholoenzyme), or the addition of polycationic stimulators, or the nature of the phosphate donor (GTP versus ATP) and of the activatory cation (Mn2+ versusMg2+). This last outcome is worth noting, because in the case of phosphorylase kinase, Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ is required to see tyrosine-phosphorylating activity (36Yuan C.-J. Huang C.-Y.F. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) Ability to phosphorylate tyrosine is not a general feature of CK2 toward any kind of substrate fulfilling its consensus sequence, because the replacement of serine (or threonine) by tyrosine in several outstanding peptide substrates of CK2 different from the Fpr3-derived peptide rendered their phosphorylation undetectable. 4) Among the local structural determinants favoring tyrosineversus serine phosphorylation, the isoleucine at positionn − 1 and the acidic residue at position n+ 1 appear to play a prominent role. Interestingly, hydrophobic residues are only sporadically found in CK2 substrates at positionn − 1, where instead acidic residues are quite frequent (10Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently the replacement of Ile by Asp at this position in the seryl derivative of the Fpr3 peptide increases its phosphorylation efficiency, but it is detrimental in the tyrosyl peptide. The molecular basis for such an opposite behavior is presently unclear. The favorable effect of an acidic residue at positionn + 1, on the other hand, is a well known feature of all CK2 phosphoacceptor sites, including Ser/Thr (10Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the latter case, however, the n + 1 acidic determinant is generally less important than the one at n + 3 (10Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the opposite applies to the Fpr3 tyrosyl peptide where the replacement of the n + 3 Glu by alanine is exceptionally well tolerated. Computer-aided modelization (Fig. 5) corroborates the concept that in the case of Fpr3-derived tyrosyl peptide the acidic determinant atn + 1 is much more important than the one at n + 3 in making contacts with the enzyme. The replacement of glutamate atn + 2 with phosphoserine improves 2–3-fold theV max and phosphorylation efficiency of the peptide, consistent with the knowledge that phosphoserine is a better determinant than Glu especially at positions n + 1 andn + 2 (14Perich J.W. Meggio F. Reynolds E.C. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); it is quite possible therefore that, as suggested by others (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of Fpr3 in vivo is enhanced by a hierarchical effect where previous phosphorylation of Ser186 will improve subsequent phosphorylation of Tyr184. The replacement of Glu atn + 2 with Ala, however, has only a modest effect, similar to that caused by the same substitution in canonical seryl peptide substrates of CK2 (12Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). therefore, it seems unlikely that the phosphorylation of Tyr184 in the Fpr3 peptide is entirely dependent on the presence of a negatively charged side chain atn + 2, as suggested by others (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The reasons why the same peptide, DEDADIYDAEDYDL, which in our hands is nearly as good as the parent peptide with Glu instead of the underlined Ala (see Fig. 3 and Table I), was not phosphorylated at all (23Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) is unclear to us. 5) The different mode of binding of tyrosyl versus seryl peptide substrates was also corroborated by experiments with CK2 mutants with a reduced ability to recognize individual determinants. Especially remarkable is the behavior of the mutant K198A, which is much more defective toward the Fpr3 tyrosyl peptide as compared with its seryl derivative. In conclusion, CK2 can be legitimately included in the list ofsensu lato dual specificity protein kinases. Clearly, however, its ability to phosphorylate tyrosine in peptide substrates is very modest as compared with its canonical Ser/Thr kinase activity and, more important, it depends on structural features that are partially different from those determining Ser phosphorylation. Among these the most striking are the absolute requirement for the acidic determinant at position n + 1 as opposed to the tolerance toward the replacement of the one at position n + 3, and the preference for a hydrophobic over an acidic residue at position n− 1."

They occur in plants as well as in animals. Lectins mediate cellular recognition in the immune system, fertilization, cancer, infections, embryogenesis, and transport and targeting of glycoproteins (1Gabius H.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For plant lectins, a variety of different physiological functions have been proposed (2Sharon N. Lis H. Lectins. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1989: 26-34Crossref Google Scholar). They defend the plant against herbivorous animals (3Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 35-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of many plant lectins have revealed how they specifically recognize their carbohydrate ligands (7Lis Sharon H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The structural basis of carbohydrate specificity is best understood for the legume lectins. These form a group of proteins with a conserved subunit structure and spanning a wide range of carbohydrate specificities (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The legume lectins recognize their ligands via a conserved monosaccharide-binding site and several distinct carbohydrate-binding subsites (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the different quaternary structures that are adopted allow for the selection of multivalent ligands with different characteristic distances between their epitopes, adding an extra dimension to their specificity. This results, for example, in the formation of highly ordered and homogeneous cross-linked lattices between the lectin and multivalent carbohydrates (9Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol.

In this work, we describe the interactions of Man(α1–6)Man(α1-O)Me and Man(α1–3)Man(α1-O)Me, the two dimannoside parts of the highly specific ConA epitope Man(α1–3)[Man(α1–6)]Man(α1-O)Me, with ConA. The M3M and M6M disaccharides are the epitopes recognized on the α1–3- and α1–6-linked arms, respectively, of certain high mannose and bisected hybrid-type sugars that are bivalent or monovalent for ConA (16Bhattacharyya L. Ceccarini C. Lorenzoni P. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The M3M and M6M moieties of these sugars can be expected to bind in the same way as M3M and M6M in the crystal structures presented here. The M3M and M6M binding modes can, in principle, also occur for the trimannose M3M6M if its normal binding mode would be impaired. This is the case when a bisectingN-acetyl-d-glucosamine residue is β-linked to O-4 of the reducing mannose (17Bhattacharyya L. Haraldsson M. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

We discuss the atomic interactions between the sugars and the lectin as we observe them in the crystal structure in relation to the measured enthalpic and entropic contributions to the binding. ConA was purified by affinity chromatography on Sephadex as described for pea lectin (27Van Driessche E. Smets G. Dejaegere R. Kanarek L. Bøg-Hansen T.C. Lectins: Biology, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry. Walter De Gruyter, New York1982: 729-741Google Scholar). M6M and M3M were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals and Sigma, respectively. Crystals of the complex of ConA with M6M were obtained in hanging drops after equilibration of a 10-μl drop composed of 5 μl of a ConA/sugar solution (7 mg/ml ConA and 2.75 mm M6M) and 5 μl of the bottom solution (7% Jeffamine M-600, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mm NH4COOH, 5 mmMgCl2, and 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) against 0.5 ml of the bottom solution. Diamond-shaped crystals of the complex of ConA with M3M were obtained in hanging drops composed of 5 μl of the protein/sugar solution (5 mg/ml ConA and 5 mmM3M) and 5 μl of the bottom solution (14% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 35 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8) against 0.5 ml of the bottom solution. All data were collected on a MAR image plate using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source. Processing of x-ray data and subsequent scaling were done with the HKL package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab From a single M6M·ConA crystal, a total of 143° were recorded. The molecular replacement solution was found using AMoRE (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) (correlation coefficient = 0.36, R cryst = 0.56) using the ConA tetramer from Protein Data Bank entry 1ENQ. X-PLOR was used to refine the model (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1: A System for Crystallography NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). A random 10% reflection test set was kept separate from the reflections used for refinement for cross-evaluation by R free. Rigid body refinement reducedR cryst to 0.35 with anR free of 0.34. Throughout the refinement, a bulk solvent correction was applied. For model building, the program TURBO-FRODO was used. After the positioning of the first monosaccharide unit in the monosaccharide-binding site and addition of the metal ions, positional and individual B-factor refinement led to a drop in R cryst to 0.24 and inR free to 0.27. At this stage, electron densities were inspected, and the metal ions were added to the structures. No metal–ligand bond distance restraints were employed, and the metal ions were given zero charge. Water molecules were added only if 1) the water had at least one hydrogen-bonding partner; 2) theF o − F c density level was higher than 3 ς; and 3) after refinement, the electron density of the putative water reappeared in the 2F o −F c map at a level of at least 1. From two crystals of the M3M complex, a total of 264° of data were recorded. The molecular replacement solution was found using the tetramer of the M6M·ConA structure. The initial correlation coefficient was 0.46, and R cryst was 0.50 after rigid body refinement with AMoRE. After a simulated annealing refinement using the slow-cool protocol, R crystdropped to 0.25 and R free to 0.30. Further model building and refinement proceeded as for M6M·ConA. In total, 33 water molecules were added for M3M·ConA and 386 for M6M·ConA. The final refinement statistics for M6M·ConA and M3M·ConA are given in TableI. Accessible surface areas were calculated using the program NACCESS. For all the superpositions of ConA structures, only the main chain atoms of Tyr-12, Asn-14, Leu-99, Tyr-100, Asp-208, and Arg-228 of the carbohydrate-binding site of ConA were used. The water structure in the carbohydrate-binding site was analyzed in a large set of sugar-free and sugar-containing ConA structures, including all subunits in the asymmetric unit (see TableIV). A water molecule was considered conserved among the multiple subunits of a crystal structure or among different structures when, after superposition of the structures, the 1) waters were not separated more than 2 Å, and 2) they share at least one contact with the protein. A water molecule was considered to be replaced by a sugar atom or vice versa when their mutual distance after superposition of the binding sites did not exceed 1.5 Å. Less conservative replacement, where this distance is between 1.5 and 2.0 Å, is still mentioned in Table IV. For a distance larger than 2 Å, the sugar atom expels the water molecule upon binding of the sugar, rather than replacing it.Table IVExpulsion and conservation of water in the carbohydrate-binding site of ConAM3M6MM6MMeManSugar-freeProtein ligands of sugar/waterNamesPart I.

Both the M6M·ConA and M3M·ConA structures each contain one classical ConA tetramer (subunits A, B, C, and D) in the asymmetric unit. The ConA monomer consists of 237 amino acid residues and folds into a β-sandwich structure containing two sheets of six and seven β-strands, respectively, as well as a small third β-sheet (8Loris R.

There are no relevant structural changes outside the carbohydrate recognition sites in either of the two complexes. Residues 118 and 119, 150 and 151, and 161 and 162 in M6M·ConA and residues 118–121 and 205 in M3M·ConA are less clearly determined by the electron density. The overall crystallographic B-factors of the two structures as well as the B-factors of the main chains, the side chains, the waters, and the sugars separately are presented in TableI. The electron densities of M3M and M6M bound in the carbohydrate recognition site of ConA are shown in Fig.1. The conformations of the M6M glycosidic linkages deviate slightly from the conformation observed in the complexed trimannose M3M6M (TableII). This results in a less tight binding of the O-6-linked mannose (Fig. 2) and fewer interactions with the protein (Fig.3 b). The conformations around the glycosidic linkages of M3M are very similar to what is seen in the M3M6M·ConA complex (Table II). The M3M φ and ϕ angles enclose in the 2- or 3-kcal energy window of the energetically favorable region for the free disaccharide, but are a little outside the allowed predicted values for the M3M·ConA complex (33Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is probably due to the approach for docking the disaccharide in the carbohydrate-binding site of ConA, which did not allow for small structural adjustments in the protein.Table IICarbohydrate conformationM3MAverageM3M6Mϕ (°)6466626464 ± 266 ± 3ψ (°)121128126126125 ± 4125 ± 6M6MAverageM3M6Mϕ (°)7676706872 ± 466 ± 3ψ (°)−166−174−178−176−174 ± 8−170 ± 4ω (°)−61−57−54−59−58 ± 4−45 ± 6The glycosidic torsion angles ϕ and ψ are as follows: ϕ = θ(O-5–C-1–O-1–C′-X) and ψ = θ(C-1–O-1–C′-X–C′-X+1); and for the α1–6-linkage, ω = θ(O-1–C′-6–C′-5–O′-5) as defined (50Imberty A.

Protein-carbohydrate distances are indicated. The positions of the key hydroxyls of Man(α1–3)[Man(α1–6)]Man in the site are invariably occupied by a water molecule in the absence of the carbohydrate. The conserved water 06 replaces O-4 of the mannose on the α1–3-linked arm of the specific epitope Man(α1–3)- [Man(α1–6)]Man(α1-O)Me. Three water molecules (waters 1–3) are conserved in the MeMan and Man(α1–6)Man(α1-O)Me structures and increase the complementarity between the monosaccharide-binding site and the sugar, rather than serve as hydrogen-bonding partners.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The glycosidic torsion angles ϕ and ψ are as follows: ϕ = θ(O-5–C-1–O-1–C′-X) and ψ = θ(C-1–O-1–C′-X–C′-X+1); and for the α1–6-linkage, ω = θ(O-1–C′-6–C′-5–O′-5) as defined (50Imberty A.

The values in the last column are the average values for the four crystallographically independent trimannosides in complex with ConA (Protein Data Bank entry 1CVN) with its variation. The hydrogen bonds formed in the complexes of M3M6M, M6M, and M3M with ConA are presented schematically in Fig. 3. M6M and M3M bind with their O-1-linked mannose in the monosaccharide-binding site. This was expected because both the O-3 and O-6 sugar hydroxyl groups are involved in strong interactions in the monosaccharide binding of ConA (12Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The second mannose units of M3M and M6M bind in different subsites of the carbohydrate-binding site. Thereby, they approximately maintain the α1–6- and α1–3-glycosidic angles as found in the complex of ConA with M3M6M (Table II). The binding pattern of M6M is comparable to what is seen in the M3M6M complex (Figs. 2 and 3). The O-6-linked mannose binds in the same subsite as the reducing mannose of M3M6M (TableIII). However, the O-6-linked mannose lies farther from the protein surface than its counterpart in bound M3M6M (Fig. 2). This deviation is caused by the differences in the glycosidic angles of M6M, especially ω, compared with bound M3M6M (Table II). Consequently, M6M makes a hydrogen bond only via O-4, whereas in the M3M6M·ConA complex, both O-2 and O-4 of the reducing mannose make hydrogen bonds with Asp-16 O-δ1 and Tyr-12 OH, respectively. Furthermore, a structural water molecule (water 1 (12Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar)) that makes hydrogen bonds with the carbohydrate ligand residues Arg-228, Asn-14, and Asp-16 and that is conserved in all sugar-bound structures of ConA is also present in the M6M structure. However, O-2 of the O-6-linked mannose and water 1 are within hydrogen-bonding distance (within 3.5 Å) in only one of the four sugar-binding sites of the asymmetric unit of M6M·ConA.Table IIIvan der Waals contacts (within 4.5 Å) of the O-3-linked mannose of M3M and the O-6-linked mannose of M6MM3MM6MC-1–Tyr-12 OHC-3–Tyr-12 C-ζ, OHO-1–Leu-99 C-β, C-γ, C-δ2O-3–Tyr-12 C-ε2, C-ζ, OHO-1–Tyr-100 C-ε2C-4–Tyr-12 C-ε2, C-ζ2, OHC-7–Leu-99 C-δ2O-4–Tyr-12 C-ε1, C-ε2, C-ζ, OHC-7–Tyr-100 C-ε2, C-ζ, OHO-4–Tyr-100 C-δ2, C-ε2C-2–Tyr-12 C-ζ, OHC-5–Leu-99 C-β, C-γ, C-δ2O-2–Tyr-12 C-ζ, OHC-6–Leu-99 C-δ2C-3–Leu-99 C-β, C-δ2C-4–Leu-99 C-δ2O-4–Leu-99 C-δ2C-5–Leu-99 C-γ2 Open table in a new tab In the complex of ConA with M3M, the O-3-linked mannose covers the hydrophobic subsite neighboring the sugar-binding site (involving Tyr-12, Leu-99, and Tyr-100), in which also the aglycons of 4′-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside, 4′-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (34Kanellopoulos P.N.

Biol. 1997; 118: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) bind (Fig.4 a). The binding of the O-3-linked mannose of M3M involves no extra polar interactions compared with the monosaccharide, but depends merely on hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions (Table III). The electron density indicates that water 1 is also present in the M3M structure. Prior to complexation, the polar groups of both the carbohydrate-binding site and the carbohydrate are extensively hydrated (36Lemieux R.U. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 373-380Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Waters have to be released from both surfaces to allow the complex to form. In the absence of the sugar, waters can take in the positions of the sugar atoms and make the same hydrogen bonds with the protein (37Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.K. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In this way, they can contribute directly to the properties of the protein by influencing its interaction with the sugar. In this context, Naismithet al. (10Naismith J.H. Emmerich C. Habash J. Harrop S.J. Helliwell J.R. Hunter W.N. Raftery J. Kalb Gilboa J. Yariv J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

https://openalex.org/W1984611669,"We have identified cDNA and genomic clones encoding a homologue of pancreatic trypsin, termed TESP4, as a candidate protein involved in the sperm penetration of the egg zona pellucida in mouse. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that TESP4 is 90% identical to pancreatic trypsin. Analysis of Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction reveals that the mouse TESP4 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, including the pancreas and testis, and the transcript is present in the haploid stages of male germ cells. Moreover, immunochemical analysis of mouse cauda epididymal sperm using an affinity-purified antibody against bovine pancreatic trypsinogen shows that TESP4 is localized only in the sperm acrosome and is released during the acrosome reaction induced by calcium ionophore A23187. These findings may open a new point of view regarding the molecular mechanisms of the sperm/egg interactions, including the sperm penetration of the egg zona pellucida.

This sperm/ZP interaction occurs following the acrosome reaction of sperm, a fusion (vesiculation) event between the overlying plasma and outer acrosomal membranes. Although there has long been a controversy concerning the importance of protease(s) present in the sperm acrosome (3Bedford J.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the creation of a penetration pathway for the motile sperm is thought to require limited hydrolysis of the ZP glycoprotein by the acrosomal enzyme(s). Indeed, various trypsin inhibitors have been reported to block effectively the sperm penetration of the ZP in vitro (4Stambaugh R. Brackett B.G. Mastroianni L. Biol. Reprod. 1969; 1: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Zaneveld L.J.D. Polakoski K.L. Robertson R.T. Williams W.L.

Müller-Esterl W. Engel W. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 9Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar). Although this enzyme has long been believed to act by causing the limited hydrolysis of ZP, our previous study (10Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using acrosin-deficient (Acr −/−) mutant mice conclusively showed that sperm do not require acrosin to penetrate the ZP. Further experiments of the Acr −/− mouse sperm have provided evidence that the major role of acrosin may be to accelerate the dispersal of acrosomal components during the acrosome reaction of sperm (11Yamagata K. Murayama K. Okabe M. Toshimori K. Nakanishi T. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10470-10474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, acrosomal trypsin-like protease(s) other than acrosin are probably essential for the sperm penetration of ZP at least in mouse (10Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).We (13Kohno N. Yamagata K. Yamada S. Kashiwabara S. Sakai Y. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have already identified two similar but different serine proteases, TESP1 and TESP2 (testicular serineproteases 1 and 2) in the acrosome of mouse sperm as candidates involved in the sperm penetration of egg ZP. However, the deduced amino acid sequences of TESP1 and TESP2 imply that these two proteases are unlikely capable of splitting the Arg/Lys-Xaa bond, in contrast to trypsin and acrosin (13Kohno N. Yamagata K. Yamada S. Kashiwabara S. Sakai Y. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BecauseAcr −/− mouse sperm barely penetrate the ZP in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine, a competitive inhibitor toward trypsin and acrosin, a protease(s) sensitive to the inhibitor other than both acrosin and two TESPs must be present in the acrosome to enable the sperm to penetrate the ZP. On the basis of this possibility, we have re-attempted to identify acrosomal serine protease(s) with trypsin-like cleavage specificity in mouse. The cDNA clones encoding each of two serine proteases, termed TESP3 and TESP4, have been isolated from a mouse testis cDNA library. Interestingly, one of these two proteases is a homologue of pancreatic trypsin that is localized in the acrosome of mouse sperm, and is released by calcium ionophore-induced acrosome reaction. A possible function of TESP4 in the sperm/egg interaction is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCalcium ionophore A23187 and bovine pancreatic trypsin (Type III, T-8253) were purchased from Sigma. An IgG fraction of rabbit anti-bovine pancreatic trypsinogen antiserum was purchased from Biogenesis (Sandown, NH). Experimental animals, ddY and ICR mice, Wistar rats, Hartley guinea pigs, Golden hamsters, and New Zealand White rabbits, were obtained from Japan SLC.Acr +/+ and Acr −/− male mice were obtained by mating Acr +/− males and females, as described previously (10Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monkey testicles were provided by Dr. T. Sankai at the Tsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science, Tsukuba, Japan. Dog and cat testes were provided by Dr. M. Sakuma at the Sakuma Animal Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan. Porcine testis was obtained from a slaughterhouse.Polymerase Chain ReactionPCR was carried out using anAcr −/− mouse testis cDNA library (13Kohno N. Yamagata K. Yamada S. Kashiwabara S. Sakai Y. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a template. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: SPP3, 5′-TCCATGGGTI(C/G)TI(A/T)(C/G)IGCIGCICA(C/T)TG-3′; SPP4, 5′-AGGATCCI(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)TCICC(C/T)TG(A/G)CAI(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)TC-3′. The reaction was performed in a 50-μl mixture containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.01 mmeach of the primers, approximately 30 ng of the template DNA, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The reaction program consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 120 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were digested by NcoI and BamHI, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then introduced into a pTV119N vector (Takara) at the NcoI/BamHI sites for sequence analysis.Isolation of cDNA and Genomic ClonesApproximately 4.5 × 105 recombinant plaques from a ddY mouse testis cDNA library in λgt11 (14Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Takada M. Watanabe K. Yano Y. Arai Y. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were screened by the plaque hybridization method (15Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar), using a PCR-amplified DNA fragment encoding TESP4 as a probe, as described previously (16Baba T. Kashiwabara S. Watanabe K.

The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia) by the random-priming procedure (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar). A positive clone was plaque-purified, and the cDNA insert was introduced into the EcoRI site of pUC19 for sequence analysis. A mouse 129/SvJ genomic DNA library in λFIX II (Stratagene) was also screened using the above32P-labeled probe. The phage DNA was prepared from the positive clones, digested by various restriction enzymes, and subcloned into pUC19 for further characterization. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer.Reverse Transcriptase-PCRRT-PCR was carried out using a full 3′-RACE kit (Takara) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNA of various tissues and male germ cells by AMV RT XL using an oligo dT-3 sites adapter (Takara) as a primer. A portion of the synthesized cDNA was subjected to PCR, as described above, except that the reaction of the annealing and chain elongation was performed at 68 °C for 2 min. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: TT13 (5′-GTCTGCAGCTCATTGCTACAAAA-3′) and TT6 (5′-GGCATAATGACTTCAAAGGGATGCT-3′) for TESP4; TT9 (5′-TCTGTCACCATGAGTGCACTTCTGA-3′) and TT10 (5′-TCCATGAATTATAATTGGGGTGCCG-3′) for pancreatic trypsin (Ta); TT14 (5′-TCTGCAGCTCACTGCTACAAGT-3′) and TT6 for Td; TT1 (5′-CTGGCTACCACTTCTGTGGAGGTTCC-3′) and TT2 (5′-TCCTGCTATTGAAGTTGGGATGCTT-3′) for TESP4 and Td; G3PP1 (5′-AGTGGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACGAC-3′) and G3PP2 (5′-GGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGA-3′) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. To amplify a cDNA fragment of TESP4 in various animal testes, RT-PCR was also carried out using TT16 (5′-AGGATCCTGTGGATGATGATGACAA-3′) and TT17 (5′-TAAGCTTAGTTTGCGGCAATGGT-3′) as primers. The PCR reaction consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s. The amplified DNAs were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were then subjected to Southern blot analysis, as described below.Southern and Northern Blot AnalysesDNA and RNA were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes. The blots were probed by32P-labeled DNA fragments, as described previously (18Baba T. Niida Y. Michikawa Y. Kashiwabara S. Kodaira K. Takenaka M. Kohno N. Gerton G.L. Arai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10133-10140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the blots were analyzed by a BAS2000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo).Western Blot AnalysisAn IgG fraction of rabbit anti-bovine pancreatic trypsinogen antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose 4B that had been substituted by bovine trypsin previously treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, as described before (18Baba T. Niida Y. Michikawa Y. Kashiwabara S. Kodaira K. Takenaka M. Kohno N. Gerton G.L. Arai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10133-10140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 1% skim milk, the blots were probed by affinity-purified antibody against bovine trypsinogen and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).ImmunoprecipitationCauda epididymal sperm from eight ICR mice were extracted in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 3 h. The mixture was centrifuged, and the affinity-purified anti-pancreatic trypsinogen was added to a portion (2 ml) of the supernatant solution. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, 50 μl of protein A immobilized on agarose beads (5 ml of gel/20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Pierce) was mixed with the above solution, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The agarose beads were washed five times with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.6 m KCl and 0.05% Triton X-100, and twice with PBS by centrifugation. The pellet was then dissolved in 8m urea, and subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of 0.1% gelatin to detect proteins exhibiting gelatin-hydrolyzing activity (12Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antibody solution, which had been pre-treated with the inactive trypsinogen-coupled agarose beads described above, was used as a control.Immunocytochemical AnalysisSperm suspensions were placed onto glass slides that had been coated with Vectabond (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), treated with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS. After the fixation, the sperm samples on the slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS and with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). The slides were incubated with affinity-purified anti-trypsinogen antibody, washed three times with the above blocking solution, and then treated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) followed by an ABC solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories). After washing with PBS, the sperm samples were stained using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen, mounted, and viewed under an Olympus BX50 microscope.Calcium Ionophore-induced Acrosome ReactionCapacitated cauda epididymal sperm (4 × 106 sperm/ml) in 0.2 ml of a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (TYH medium, see Ref.20Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) were induced to undergo acrosome reaction by addition of calcium ionophore A23187 at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air for 60 min (12Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sperm suspension was transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and then subjected to immunocytochemical analysis, as described above.RESULTSTo isolate cDNA clones coding for a novel serine protease(s) present in mouse sperm, we designed two oligonucleotide primers, SPP3 and SPP4, corresponding to the consensus sequences of trypsin-like proteases around the active-site residues, His and Ser. The antisense primer SPP4 corresponded to the Asp-Ser-Cys-Gln-Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly sequence, where first Asp and seventh Ser function as the substrate recognition and active-site residues in trypsin (21Young C.L. Barker W.C. Tomaselli C.M. Dayhoff M.O. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Spring, MD1978: 73-93Google Scholar), respectively. When PCR was carried out using an Acr −/− mouse testis cDNA library (13Kohno N. Yamagata K. Yamada S. Kashiwabara S. Sakai Y. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a template, two DNA fragments encoding different serine proteases, termed TESP3 and TESP4, were obtained (the details of TESP3 will be reported elsewhere 2S. Sato, N. Kohno, K. Yamagata, and T. Baba, manuscript in preparation. ). Screening of a ddY mouse testis cDNA library and a mouse genomic DNA library, using the PCR-amplified DNA fragment for TESP4 as a probe, yielded a single cDNA clone and 23 genomic clones, respectively.The cDNA sequence of TESP4 (data not shown, see AB009661 in GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank) shared a high degree of identity (87%) with that of mouse pancreatic trypsin (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that TESP4 is a member of the gene family of pancreatic trypsin. Indeed, it has been reported that 5–10 homologues of the trypsin gene are located on the mouse genome (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To identify the genomic clones encoding the mouse TESP4 gene among the above 23 clones isolated, two sets of oligonucleotides, TT1/TT2 and TT9/TT10, were prepared according to the cDNA sequences of TESP4 and pancreatic trypsin, respectively, and used as PCR primers. A genomic clone, mTRYG11, gave a positive DNA band for the pancreatic trypsin gene, termed the Ta gene (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the positive signal for the TESP4 gene was apparently found in four clones, mTRYG3, mTRYG5, mTRYG7, and mTRYG9 (data not shown). Further analysis of restriction mapping and partial sequencing indicated that these four clones were divided into three groups; the TESP4 gene was encoded by mTRYG3, whereas mTRYG7 and mTRYG9 coded for another gene (Td gene) that also belongs to the gene family of mouse trypsin (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as described below. mTRYG5 was distinguished from these three clones by restriction mapping (data not shown). Thus, mTRYG3, mTRYG7, and mTRYG11 were selected for further characterization, because only partial sequences of the trypsin family genes in mouse have been reported (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The mouse TESP4 gene as well as the Ta (pancreatic trypsin) and Td genes consisted of five exons interrupted by four introns, although the size of the TESP4 gene was approximately 200 nucleotides longer than those of the two other genes mainly because of the length of first intron (Fig. 1 and TableI). When mouse genomic DNA was digested by several restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blot analysis using two DNA fragments as probes, the hybridization patterns were consistent with the restriction map of the TESP4 gene (Fig. 1). Thus, the TESP4 gene is a single copy gene on the mouse genome.Table IComparison of the exon/intron sequences among the Ta, Tc (TESP4), and Td genes of mouseMouse geneSize of the exon or intron sequenceExon 1Intron 1Exon 2Intron 2Exon 3Intron 3Exon 4Intron 4Exon 5base pairsTa56973160879254344137283207 (Ta versusTc)(80%)(49%)(93%)(51%)(91%)(56%)(91%)(59%)(77%)Tc (TESP4)561147160908254357137266191 (Tc versusTd)(91%)(59%)(97%)(77%)(100%)(96%)(96%)(96%)(96%)Td56959160882254356137266191 (Td versusTa)(82%)(51%)(95%)(50%)(91%)(56%)(93%)(59%)(78%)Five exons and four introns of the Ta, Tc, and Td genes are numbered in the 5′ to 3′ direction (see Fig. 1). The sequence identity between two corresponding exons or introns in these three genes is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, the nucleotide sequence of the TESP4 gene (Fig.2) was identical to the 482-nucleotide sequence of the Tc gene, one of the trypsin gene family (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), carrying the promoter region, first exon, and first intron. Moreover, the TESP4 gene had the same restriction map as the Tc gene. We therefore concluded that the mouse TESP4 gene corresponds to the Tc gene. Indeed, overlapping among three genomic clones encoding each of the Tc (TESP4) and Td genes (Fig. 1) is consistent with the fact that these two genes are closely located on the mouse genome in a tail-to-tail manner (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Figure 2DNA sequence of the mouse TESP4 (Tc) gene. Upper and lower case letters indicate the exon and intron sequences of the mouse TESP4 (Tc) gene, respectively. The amino acid sequence is shown below the nucleotide sequence numbered in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Three active- site residues of TESP4 are indicated by arrowheads. A putative polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, isunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Alignment of the DNA sequences among the Ta, Tc, and Td genes indicated that the exon and intron sequences of the Tc gene were highly homologous to those of the Td gene, except for first and second introns (Table I). Despite relatively low degrees of identity in the intron sequences between the Ta and Tc (or Td) genes, the exon sequences were still 77–100% homologous among these three genes.The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence indicated that mouse Tc (TESP4) is initially synthesized as a 246-residue preproprotein with a calculated molecular mass of 26,276 Da (Figs. 2and 3). Tc shared high degrees of sequence identity (90 and 98%) with Ta (22Stevenson B.J. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Td, respectively (Fig.3). The locations of ten Cys residues, three active-site residues, and a substrate recognition residue (21Young C.L. Barker W.C. Tomaselli C.M. Dayhoff M.O. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Spring, MD1978: 73-93Google Scholar) are all conserved among the three proteins. Thus, these data demonstrate that both Tc and Td are homologues of pancreatic trypsin (Ta), as described above. The sequence homology also suggests that the N-terminal 15-residue and subsequent 8-residue sequences of the Tc preproprotein correspond to a signal peptide for a nascent protein and a proenzyme segment (activation peptide), respectively.Figure 3Comparison of the amino acid sequence of mouse TESP4 (Tc) with those of mouse pancreatic trypsin (Ta) and a trypsin homologue Td.

Closedand open arrows indicate the sites of removals of the amino-terminal 15-residue signal peptide and 8-residue proenzyme segment (activation peptide), respectively.

To ascertain that the hybridized signal corresponded to the Tc mRNA, we designed three sets of oligonucleotides, TT9/TT10, TT6/TT13, and TT6/TT14, specific for Ta, Tc, and Td, respectively, and used them as primers for RT-PCR (Fig. 4). In Ta and Td, the amplified DNA fragments were found in the pancreas, lung, and kidney among the mouse tissues tested and were completely missing in the testis. The positive signals for Tc were detected in all tissues, including the pancreas and testis, thus indicating that the mouse Tc gene is ubiquitously expressed. RT-PCR analysis also revealed that the Tc gene is initially transcribed in the testis at 20th day after birth, and the transcript is present only in the round and elongating spermatids (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that expression of the mouse Tc gene is restricted in the haploid stages of male germ cells in the testis.Figure 4Expression of the mouse Tc (TESP4) gene in various tissues and male germ cells. A, Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNAs (10 μg each) from testis (T), heart (H), lung (L), brain (B), kidney (K), liver (I), epididymis (E), ovary (O), and uterus (U). The blot was first probed by a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment encoding mouse TESP4 and then re-probed by the DNA fragment coding for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH). Note that the 1.2-kb signal for TESP4 was also found in the pancreatic tissue. However, the data is not shown because of a very strong intensity. B, RT-PCR analysis of Tc, Ta, Td, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNAs of various mouse tissues, including pancreas (P), and a portion of the synthesized cDNA was subjected to PCR followed by Southern blot analysis using specific internal 32P-labeled probes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, RT-PCR analysis of Tc and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) in mouse testis.

A DNA fragment of approximately 700 nucleotides was amplified in these nine mammals (Fig.5). The DNA sequences of the amplified fragments were all identical, except that only mouse Tc sequence contained cytosine (Cyt) at nucleotide 2,288 (Fig. 2) instead of thymine (Thy). However, the amino acid sequences derived from the amplified fragments were the same between mouse and other mammals because the TTG codon still coded for Leu. No DNA fragment encoding a trypsin homologue other than Tc was amplified from the mouse testicular RNA. Thus, the presence of the trypsin homologue corresponding to mouse Tc is widely conserved at least in the testis, regardless of the mammalian species.Figure 5Expression of a trypsin homologue gene corresponding to the mouse Tc gene in mammalian testes.

https://openalex.org/W1979502154,"Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin catalyzed by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase is important in the initiation of smooth muscle contraction and other contractile processes in non-muscle cells. It has been previously shown that residues 1–142 of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase are necessary for high-affinity binding to actin-containing filaments in cells (1Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5987-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further localize the region of the kinase required for binding, a series of N-terminal deletion mutants as well as several N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were constructed. Cosedimentation assays showed that a peptide containing residues 1–75 binds to purified smooth muscle myofilaments. Furthermore, the N-terminal peptide was sufficient for high-affinity binding to actin stress fibers in smooth muscle cells in vivo. Alanine scanning mutagenesis in the fusion protein identified residues Asp-30, Phe-31, Arg-32, and Leu-35 as important for binding in vitro. There are two additional DFRXXL motifs located at residues 2–7 and 58–63. The DFR residues in these three motifs were individually replaced by alanine residues in the full-length kinase. Each of these mutations significantly decreased myosin light chain kinase binding to myofilaments in vitro, and each abolished high-affinity binding to actin-containing filaments in smooth muscle cells in vivo. These results identify a unique structural motif comprised of three repeat consensus sequences in the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase necessary for high-affinity binding to actin-containing filaments.

These results identify a unique structural motif comprised of three repeat consensus sequences in the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase necessary for high-affinity binding to actin-containing filaments. The activation of smooth muscle contraction is regulated by myosin light chain kinase, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme (2Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The initiation of contraction is triggered by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ which subsequently binds calmodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin binds to an autoinhibitory regulatory segment in the C terminus, thereby producing an activated catalytic core. Activated myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates the 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin which allows myosin cross-bridges to bind to F-actin and produce cell force or shortening. Phosphorylation of myosin is also important in a number of non-muscle contractile processes (3Mamiya S. Hagiwara M. Inoue S. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 119-130Crossref Google Scholar).The binding properties of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase have been investigated in vitro, demonstrating that the kinase contains distinct binding sites for F-actin and myosin withK d values of 4 and 0.8 μm, respectively (8Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7740-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide composed of amino acids 1–114 of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase also binds to purified F-actin with a similar affinity (9Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, cleavage of the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase results in the loss of binding. Subsequent studies suggested that regions responsible for binding to F-actin in vitro were contained in residues 1–41 (10Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 173: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol.

Klee C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), detergent-glycerol skinned smooth muscle tissue strips (13Tansey M.G. Hori M. Karaki H. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T.

In all of these preparations, filaments were washed extensively with various aqueous buffers, and the kinase remained bound. Additionally, the C terminus of myosin light chain kinase containing the Ig-like telokin motif bound to myosin-containing filaments (15Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, this C-terminal motif is not necessary for high-affinity binding to detergent-washed myofilaments and actin-containing stress fibers in culture (1Lin P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The apparent binding affinities of myosin light chain kinase for detergent-washed myofilaments or purified thin filaments from smooth muscle were greater than to purified F-actin or skeletal muscle myofilaments (14Lin P.

Scand. 1998; 164: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reason for these differences in binding affinities to F-actin filaments is not clear at this time.In this study we have analyzed high-affinity binding of myosin light chain kinase to myofilaments in vitro and actin-containing filaments in vivo by focusing on structural elements in the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase. Three consensus sequences were defined, and their importance for binding was determined in vitro and in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Myosin Light Chain Kinase MutantsPCR 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reactionΔN23-MLCKdeletion of residues 2–22 in myosin light chain kinaseΔ39-MLCK deletion of residues 2–38 in myosin light chain kinaseΔN59-MLCK, deletion of residues 2–58 in myosin light chain kinaseCMVcytomegalovirusGSTglutathioneS-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescence proteinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Expanded High Fidelity System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used to prepare full-length rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase with a C-terminal flag tag and N-terminal deletion mutants: Δ23-MLCK, Δ39-MLCK, and Δ59-MLCK. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the coding strand of myosin light chain kinase used to amplify the full-length kinase and the N-terminal deletion mutants are: full-length myosin light chain kinase, 5′-GGGGTACCATGGATTTCCGCGCCAACCTGCAGCGG-3′; Δ23-MLCK, 5′-GGGGTACCATGGTGCACAGCCCCCAGCAGGTCGA3-′; Δ39-MLCK, 5′-GGGGTACCATGGGGACTCCCAAGACCCCCGTGCC-3′; Δ59-MLCK, 5′-GGGGTACCATGGATTTTCGCTCCGTGCTGGGTAGCA-3′. The sequence of the 3′-primer which has the coding sequence for the FLAG tag is 5′-GATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTACTTCCTCCTCTTCCTCCTCTTCCCCTTCT-3′. The reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing, annealing, and extension (94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; and 68 °C, 2 min). A final incubation at 68 °C for 7 min was performed. The PCR products were then ligated into PCR 3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the CMV promoter. The resulting sequences of the recombinant plasmids were obtained by DNA sequencing.The GST fusion proteins were constructed by amplifying the N-terminal sequences (residues 1–30, 1–49, 1–55, 1–60, 1–75, 1–293, or 1–466) of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase using PCR. The PCR products were then subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at BamHI and EcoRI sites. A peptide fragment containing residues 1–108 of rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase as well as the subsequent sequence which encodes a histidine tag was amplified using PCR and subcloned into TOPO cloning vector pCRTM 2.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA fragments were then subcloned into expression vector pET 28a (Novagen) and transformed into BL21(DE 3).GST75-MLCK alanine mutants were prepared using overlapping PCR. Four oligonucleotide primers were used to substitute alanine for specific residues in each mutant. Primer 1 had an N-terminal flanking sequence which contains a BamHI restriction site. Primers 2 and 3 contained the nucleotides coding for alanine which would replace the nucleotides coding for the wild-type amino acids at the locale of the mutation. These two primers overlapped each other at the mutation site. Primer 4 had a C-terminal flanking sequence consisting of anEcoRI restriction site. Primers 1 and 2 were used to amplify product 1, and primers 3 and 4 were used to amplify product 2. Purified products 1 and 2 were mixed, and primers 1 and 4 were added to this mixture to re-amplify the full-length sequence containing the desired mutation. Reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 5 min. PCR was performed for 35 cycles of denaturing, annealing, and extension (94 °C, 30 s; 63 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s). The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 72 °C, for 7 min. The final PCR products were digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)The DFR to alanine mutations in the full-length myosin light chain kinase were similarly prepared using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (17Kunkel T.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) with version 2 mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The nucleotides encoding for aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and arginine (at residues 2–4, 30–32, or 58–60) were changed to encode for three alanines. The sequence of the oligonucleotides encoding for the three triple alanine mutants of myosin light chain kinase (D2A, F3A, R4A, 5′-CTGCAGGTTGGCGGCGGCGGCCATCTGCT-3′; D30A, F31A, R32A, 5′-CTTGGCTAGGACGGAGGCGGCGGCGACCTGCTGGGG-3′; and D58A, F59A, R60A, 5′-ACCCAGCACGGAGGCGGCGGCCGGAGTGG-3′) were designed as the noncoding strand of rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase.Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with an aliquot of the synthesis reaction, single colonies were isolated, and the DNA was screened for mutants by DNA sequencing.Recombinant DNA methods such as transformations, plasmid preparations, gel electrophoresis, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ligation, and enzyme digestion were all carried out according to Sambrook et al. (1989), or as described by the respective suppliers (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purification of DNA from agarose gels was performed with Qiaex II purification kit (Qiagen).Myosin Light Chain Kinase PlasmidsMyosin light chain kinase-GFP fusion protein expression vectors were prepared using pGREEN LANTERNTM-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with modifications as described in Lin et al. (1999) (1Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5987-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression was under the control of CMV promoter and contained the sequence encoding GFP. PCMV5 plasmids encoding cDNAs for rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase containing the triple alanine mutations substituted individually for each DFR motif were digested with KpnI andHindIII. The KpnI/HindIII fragments were then subcloned into pGREEN LANTERNTM-1 expression vector. The cDNA encoding for amino acids 1–108 of myosin light chain kinase was fused to GFP, and the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein ExpressionLipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc./Life Technologies, Inc.) or Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to transfect COS-7 cells with myosin light chain kinase or the mutant proteins. COS-7 cells were seeded in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 6 × 105 in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. COS-7 cells at 70–80% confluency were then transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA previously diluted in 1.125 ml of DMEM. The DNA-DMEM mixture was then added to a solution consisting of 0.018 ml of LipofectAMINE and 1.125 ml of DMEM, mixed gently, and incubated at 25 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed once with 5 ml of DMEM. DMEM (2.25 ml) was added to tubes containing the lipid-DNA complexes. For transfection with Fugene 6, 12 μl of Fugene 6 was mixed with 288 μl of serum-free DMEM and incubated at room temperature for 5 min and added to 3 μg of DNA. DNA-DMEM (Fugene or LipofectAMINE) mixture was then overlaid onto the washed COS-7 cells. The cells were incubated 5 h at 37 °C, and the transfection mixtures were removed. The cells were washed with 5 ml of DMEM, 5 ml of fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and then 1% penicillin-streptomycin was added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48–72 h. The transfected cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C in 1% Nondidet P-40, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,320 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble fraction. The COS-7 cell lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Western transfer and immunoblotting was performed with a monoclonal antibody to smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (does not bind to residues 1–75 of the kinase) or a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG sequence (Eastman Kodak) to detect protein expression.The GST fusion proteins were obtained by subcloning the various myosin light chain kinase N-terminal sequences amplified by PCR into pGEX-4T-2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Verification of the sequences was achieved by DNA automated sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown to 0.6 A 550 at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for induction of protein expression, and the cells were cultured for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g (JA-20 Beckman) for 15 min. The cells were resuspended in 5 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin and then lysed by sonication at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fractions were filtered with a 0.45-μm filter (Nalgene), and GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity column chromatography. Purified proteins were dialyzed against and stored at −80 °C in 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol.In Vivo Transfection of Myosin Light Chain Kinase-GFP ConstructsA7r5 rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding for the myosin light chain kinase-GFP constructs as described previously (1Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5987-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For binding experiments in vitro, 0.53 mm trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to detach the cells, followed by addition of 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were pelleted at 200 ×g for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as discussed above for COS-7 cells. Approximately 20% of the transfected A7r5 cells were fluorescent.Cell ImagingFluorescence imaging was performed as described previously (1Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

Twelve-bit images were obtained with a CCD camera (Quantix Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and Oncor-image software (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Narrow bandpass interference filters (Omega, Brattleboro, VT) were used to detect GFP (490 nm was used for excitation and 520 nm for emission) and rhodamine (excitation at 550 nm and emission at 575 nm). During imaging, cells were maintained at 37 °C in an open thermal-controlled chamber (Custom Scientific, Dallas, TX).Preparation of Smooth Muscle MyofilamentsChicken gizzards (2 g, skinned and ground) were homogenized in 10 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCI, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments). Homogenized tissues were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were homogenized in 10 ml of an extraction buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm MgCl2, and 3% Triton X-100. The homogenized suspensions were centrifuged again, and the detergent washing procedure was performed five times. The myofilaments were then washed three times in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The myofilaments were resuspended in 6 ml of the described buffer and stored on ice.In Vitro Cosedimentation Binding AssaysPurified myofilaments (0.2–3 mg/ml) were mixed with COS-7 cell lysates (diluted to give 30 nm recombinant protein) expressing either wild-type myosin light chain kinase or the various myosin light chain kinase mutant proteins in a final volume of 100 μl. Protein concentration was estimated using a standard curve of FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Eastman Kodak). The binding buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 17,300 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once in the same buffer. The pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blot. The ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for visualization.RESULTSBinding of Myosin Light Chain Kinase Fusion Proteins to Smooth Muscle MyofilamentsIn an effort to define the region in the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase responsible for binding to the myofilaments, GST fusion proteins (GST30-MLCK, GST49-MLCK, GST55-MLCK, GST60-MLCK, GST75-MLCK, GST93-MLCK, GST295-MLCK, and GST466-MLCK) varying in lengths of the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase were analyzed for their ability to bind to smooth muscle myofilaments. Each protein begins at the first residue of the kinase and extends to the specified residue number. Fig.1 A demonstrates that GST mutants containing 75 or more residues of the N terminus bound with high affinity with most of the fusion proteins cosedimenting with the myofilaments. GST by itself did not bind to myofilaments. Furthermore, none of the GST fusion proteins were in the pellet fractions after centrifugation in the absence of added myofilaments (data not shown). However, only half of GST60-MLCK cosedimented, suggesting a decreased affinity compared with the other GST fusion proteins. Additional truncations of the N terminus were analyzed to define precisely the region necessary for binding. GST55-MLCK and GST49-MLCK showed a similar binding pattern as GST60-MLCK. However, less binding was observed for GST40-MLCK, and GST30-MLCK failed to bind to the smooth muscle myofilaments. These results show maximal binding with residues 1–75 with contributions from residues 40–55. Hence, we next constructed a series of deletions of the full-length smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase starting at the N terminus.Binding of N-terminal Truncations of Myosin Light Chain Kinase to Smooth Muscle MyofilamentsTruncations of residues 2–22 (ΔN23-MLCK), 2–38 (ΔN39-MLCK), and 2–57 (ΔN58-MLCK) were analyzed for myofilament binding (Fig.2). In this assay, supernatant and pellet fractions prepared in the absence of myofilaments were analyzed to show that full-length and truncated kinases were fully soluble (data not shown). Most of the full-length kinase cosedimented with the smooth muscle myofilaments. However, 50% of ΔN23-MLCK was in the supernatant fraction, similar to GST60-MLCK. Additional truncations in ΔN39-MLCK and Δ58-MLCK resulted in no significant binding to the smooth muscle myofilaments. These results suggest multiple contributions for binding in residues 2–22 and 23–39.Figure 2Effect of selective deletions at the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase on binding to smooth muscle myofilaments.

GST75-MLCK dissociated the endogenous myosin light chain kinase from myofilaments in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). However, if myofilaments were first preincubated with different concentrations of GST75-MLCK followed by addition of the full-length myosin light chain kinase, the sensitivity for inhibition of association was substantially greater than the sensitivity for dissociation. These results are consistent with high-affinity binding properties with a slow rate of myosin light chain kinase dissociation from myofilaments.Figure 3Effect of GST75-myosin light chain kinase on myosin light chain kinase binding to smooth muscle myofilaments.Smooth muscle myofilaments extracted in the absence of 50 mm MgCl2 were incubated with various concentrations of purified GST75-myosin light chain kinase on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation, the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed for the endogenous smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase by Western blotting. Results for disassociation of endogenous myosin light chain kinase are shown by solid squares. Smooth muscle myofilaments in which the endogenous kinase was displaced with 50 mm MgCl2 were preincubated with different concentrations of GST75-myosin light chain kinase. Wild-type rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (30 nm) with a C-terminal FLAG-tag was added to the reaction mixture. The pellet and supernatant fractions were obtained after centrifugation and analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG sequence. The percent myosin light chain kinase bound was calculated after densitometric scanning of immunoblotted bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of a Motif in Myosin Light Chain Kinase Required for Binding to Smooth Muscle MyofilamentsA comparative sequence alignment of residues 1–75 of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase among diverse vertebrate species shows that they are almost identical (Fig. 4). Results from deletion mutations in GST fusion proteins as well as sequential truncations of the N terminus of the full-length kinase suggest a core binding sequence in residues 20–40 in the cosedimentation binding assay. Therefore, specific residues within this sequence were replaced with alanine to identify residues that may contribute to binding. Of 10 substitutions, only alanine at residues Asp-30, Phe-31, Arg-32, and Leu-35 produced a mutant GST75-MLCK with decreased binding affinity for myofilaments (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the sequence of 1–75 residues shows that there are three DFRXXL motifs, one located at the extreme N terminus (residues 2–7), a centrally located motif (residues 30–35), and a C-terminal motif (residues 58–63). The contributions of these three motifs to actin-filament binding were examined.Figure 4Sequence alignment of the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase among various vertebrate species.Conserved residues are highlighted in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Alanine scanning mutagenesis of GST75-MLCK.

Myosin light chain kinase mutants in which either D2F3R4, D30F31R32, or D58F59R60 were replaced with alanine all decreased the apparent affinity of myosin light chain kinase for smooth muscle myofilaments (Fig. 6). The relative amounts found in the pellet fractions in the cosedimentation assay were 47, 57, and 34% for 2AAA4-MLCK,30AAA32-MLCK, and58AAA60-MLCK, respectively, compared with ≥ 95% binding for wild-type kinase. These results verify the conclusion with the alanine point mutations in the centrally located DFRXXL motif in GST75-MLCK and show additionally that D2F3R4 and D58F59R60 are also involved in myosin light chain kinase binding. Interestingly, the mutations did not have as great an effect in the full-length kinase compared with the GST-fusion protein. The reason for this difference was not determined but may be related to an effect of GST itself on binding.Figure 6Effect of alanine mutations on the binding of full-length mutant of myosin light chain kinase to smooth muscle myofilaments.

The mechanism for its secretion from expressing cells is unclear, because its primary structure lacks a cleavable signal sequence. We, therefore, investigated the mechanism and structural requirements for secretion of FGF-9. As with other secreted proteins, in vitrotranslation of FGF-9 was inhibited by signal recognition particle, which binds to the signal sequence. When translated in vitro, full-length FGF-9 was translocated into microsomes, glycosylated, and protected from trypsin digestion. By using various FGF-9 deletion mutants, we found that two hydrophobic domains, located at the N terminus and at the center of the FGF-9 primary structure, were crucial for translocation. Examination of various point mutants revealed that local hydrophobicity of the central hydrophobic domain, but not the N terminus, was crucial for translocation. Analogous results were obtained with respect to FGF-9 secretion from transfectant cells. Upon deletion of the complete sequence preceding it, the previously uncleavable hydrophobic domain appeared to serve as a cleavable signal sequence. Our results suggest that nascent FGF-9 polypeptides translocate into endoplasmic reticulum without peptide cleavage via a co-translational pathway in which both the N terminus and the central hydrophobic domain are important; thereafter, FGF-9 is glycosylated and secreted.

In the presence of heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans, FGFs bind with varying affinities to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors encoded by four distinct genes (10Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S.

The binding induces receptor dimerization, activation of the intracellular kinase domain, and downstream intracellular signaling (11Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In this context, we sought to understand better the mechanism by which FGFs are secreted from expressing cells.FGF-9 was originally purified as a glial cell-activating factor from culture medium conditioned with the human NMCG-1 glioma cell line. Indeed, FGF-9 is a potent mitogen for glia, rat primary cortical astrocytes, BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts, and oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte progenitor cells (12Naruo K. Seko C. Kuroshima K. Matsutani E. Sasada R. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2857-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the absence of a typical N-terminal signal sequence, FGF-9 is efficiently secreted following transfection into COS cells (13Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Peptide microsequencing revealed that secreted FGF-9 has an alanine as the second amino acid residue at its N terminus (14Matsumoto-Yoshitomi S. Habashita J. Nomura C. Kuroshima K. Kurokawa T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); it is N-glycosylated following secretion or in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes, which is in good agreement with the presence of an N-glycosylation consensus sequence (13Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Song J. Slack J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); and deletion of the N-terminal 33 amino acids of FGF-9 abolished the secretion. These characteristics distinguish FGF-9 from FGF-1 and FGF-2, both of which lack a secretion signal and are only inefficiently exported from cells in non-glycosylated forms. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism and structural requirements for the secretion of FGF-9.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we showed that 1) SRP arrests translation of FGF-9; 2) FGF-9 is translocated into microsomes where it is glycosylated; 3) both the N terminus and central hydrophobic regions are important for translocation; 4) the hydrophobicity of the central hydrophobic region, but not that of the N terminus, is crucial for translocation; 5) the central hydrophobic region appears to serve as a cleavable, N-terminal signal sequence in an artificial construct; and 6) point mutations that abolished microsomal translocation of FGF-9 also abolished its secretion from cells. These results indicate that despite the absence of a predictable, cleavable signal sequence, secretion of FGF-9 from expressing cells is mediated via co-translational translocation into ER in a manner very similar to that of other secreted proteins.Proteins secreted by co-translational transport generally contain N-terminal signal sequences. When translated on rough ER, nascent proteins to be secreted are targeted to translocation channels located in the ER membrane, and the signal sequence is cleaved by a signal peptidase (24Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The specific structures of signal sequences are diverse; nonetheless, they have certain features in common as follows: 1) a net positive charge at the N terminus, 2) a hydrophobic region, and 3) a C-terminal region with small, nonpolar amino acids at positions −1 and −3 (signal peptides are numbered negatively from the cleavage site toward the N terminus of the precursor; Ref. 25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). The weak hydrophobic region at its N terminus not withstanding, FGF-9 lacks these characteristics, as confirmed by the signal sequence prediction software. Indeed, the N terminus was intact in the secreted form of FGF-9. Instead, based on SignalP analysis, the central hydrophobic domain was predicted to serve as a cleavable signal sequence, a prediction that was confirmed by our experimental results.Our findings that the C-terminal hydrophilic region (i.e.amino acids 157–209) was not required for FGF-9 translocation (Fig.3 E) and that translation of FGF-9 was inhibited by SRP, which generally binds hydrophobic motifs in signal sequences, prompted us to characterize the contribution made by the FGF-9 hydrophobic regions to its translocation into microsomes. FGF-9 deletion mutants that lacked any part of the major hydrophobic regions were not translocated (Fig. 3 G). Moreover, as substituting Asn for Ile98 or Asn-Asn for Ile100-Ala101blocked translocation, local hydropathy of the central hydrophobic domain is apparently crucial for translocation. Analogous observations were made with plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 and ovalbumin, SERPIN family proteins which are the only other known examples of secreted proteins lacking cleavable signal sequences (26Lingappa V.R. Shields D. Woo S.L. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 567-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Lingappa V.R. Lingappa J.R. Blobel G. Nature. 1979; 281: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 645-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Ye R.D. Wun T.C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4869-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, it was shown that SRP recognizes the second hydrophobic region in its primary structure and that this region was important for translocation into the ER (30Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, the second hydrophobic region was also necessary for efficient secretion of ovalbumin (28Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 645-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the finding of a previous study (14Matsumoto-Yoshitomi S. Habashita J. Nomura C. Kuroshima K. Kurokawa T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal 33 amino acids were indispensable for FGF-9 secretion, making this region less hydrophobic by substituting Asn for Leu25, did not affect translocation. Thus, whereas both the N terminus and central hydrophobic region (amino acids 95–120) were required for translocation, the specific requirement for hydrophobicity was only demonstrated for the central region.Point mutations (G71Y and G80Y) that should have restricted local flexibility of the polypeptide did not affect translocation. It is unlikely, therefore, that an interaction between the N terminus and the central hydrophobic domain is important for translocation. Consequently, it is still unclear how the N terminus of FGF-9 is involved in the secretion mechanism. Our findings that the central hydrophobic domain is able to function as a signal sequence, but that the presence of excess amino acids preceding this region (amino acids 34–90) abolished the secretion, suggest that the N terminus is involved in the effective presentation of the central hydrophobic region to the translocation machinery. Similar observations have been made with plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, where a weakly hydrophobic region preceding a more strongly hydrophobic one is important for the translocation of the protein into microsomes (31von Heijne G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, we have identified FGF-9 as the first example, outside the SERPIN family, of a secreted protein that translocates into microsomes with a clearly uncleavable signal sequence. We have also shown that a sequence of amino acids within the central hydrophobic domain of FGF-9 appears to serve as a cleavable signal sequence when placed at the N terminus. The molecular mechanism by which an otherwise cleavable signal sequence can serve as an uncleavable signal sequence when it is located in the middle of a polypeptide awaits further investigation. A similar secretion mechanism may be shared by other recently identified members of the FGF family that also lack signal sequences (32Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), for instance FGF-16, whose hydropathy plot reveals a central region very similar to that of FGF-9. The present results are consistent with the conclusion that FGF-9 is secreted via a co-translational pathway. However, because the translocation machinery and the steps in this process are not fully characterized, the possibility that FGF-9 is secreted by an alternative process (e.g. post-translational) cannot be fully excluded.

Proteins secreted by co-translational transport generally contain N-terminal signal sequences. When translated on rough ER, nascent proteins to be secreted are targeted to translocation channels located in the ER membrane, and the signal sequence is cleaved by a signal peptidase (24Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The specific structures of signal sequences are diverse; nonetheless, they have certain features in common as follows: 1) a net positive charge at the N terminus, 2) a hydrophobic region, and 3) a C-terminal region with small, nonpolar amino acids at positions −1 and −3 (signal peptides are numbered negatively from the cleavage site toward the N terminus of the precursor; Ref. 25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). The weak hydrophobic region at its N terminus not withstanding, FGF-9 lacks these characteristics, as confirmed by the signal sequence prediction software. Indeed, the N terminus was intact in the secreted form of FGF-9. Instead, based on SignalP analysis, the central hydrophobic domain was predicted to serve as a cleavable signal sequence, a prediction that was confirmed by our experimental results. Our findings that the C-terminal hydrophilic region (i.e.amino acids 157–209) was not required for FGF-9 translocation (Fig.3 E) and that translation of FGF-9 was inhibited by SRP, which generally binds hydrophobic motifs in signal sequences, prompted us to characterize the contribution made by the FGF-9 hydrophobic regions to its translocation into microsomes. FGF-9 deletion mutants that lacked any part of the major hydrophobic regions were not translocated (Fig. 3 G). Moreover, as substituting Asn for Ile98 or Asn-Asn for Ile100-Ala101blocked translocation, local hydropathy of the central hydrophobic domain is apparently crucial for translocation. Analogous observations were made with plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 and ovalbumin, SERPIN family proteins which are the only other known examples of secreted proteins lacking cleavable signal sequences (26Lingappa V.R. Shields D. Woo S.L. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 567-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Lingappa V.R. Lingappa J.R. Blobel G. Nature. 1979; 281: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol.

With respect to plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, it was shown that SRP recognizes the second hydrophobic region in its primary structure and that this region was important for translocation into the ER (30Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, the second hydrophobic region was also necessary for efficient secretion of ovalbumin (28Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 645-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the finding of a previous study (14Matsumoto-Yoshitomi S. Habashita J. Nomura C. Kuroshima K. Kurokawa T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal 33 amino acids were indispensable for FGF-9 secretion, making this region less hydrophobic by substituting Asn for Leu25, did not affect translocation. Thus, whereas both the N terminus and central hydrophobic region (amino acids 95–120) were required for translocation, the specific requirement for hydrophobicity was only demonstrated for the central region. Point mutations (G71Y and G80Y) that should have restricted local flexibility of the polypeptide did not affect translocation. It is unlikely, therefore, that an interaction between the N terminus and the central hydrophobic domain is important for translocation. Consequently, it is still unclear how the N terminus of FGF-9 is involved in the secretion mechanism. Our findings that the central hydrophobic domain is able to function as a signal sequence, but that the presence of excess amino acids preceding this region (amino acids 34–90) abolished the secretion, suggest that the N terminus is involved in the effective presentation of the central hydrophobic region to the translocation machinery. Similar observations have been made with plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, where a weakly hydrophobic region preceding a more strongly hydrophobic one is important for the translocation of the protein into microsomes (31von Heijne G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we have identified FGF-9 as the first example, outside the SERPIN family, of a secreted protein that translocates into microsomes with a clearly uncleavable signal sequence. We have also shown that a sequence of amino acids within the central hydrophobic domain of FGF-9 appears to serve as a cleavable signal sequence when placed at the N terminus. The molecular mechanism by which an otherwise cleavable signal sequence can serve as an uncleavable signal sequence when it is located in the middle of a polypeptide awaits further investigation. A similar secretion mechanism may be shared by other recently identified members of the FGF family that also lack signal sequences (32Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), for instance FGF-16, whose hydropathy plot reveals a central region very similar to that of FGF-9. The present results are consistent with the conclusion that FGF-9 is secreted via a co-translational pathway. However, because the translocation machinery and the steps in this process are not fully characterized, the possibility that FGF-9 is secreted by an alternative process (e.g. post-translational) cannot be fully excluded.

Expression of the CTR3locus, encoding a second copper permease, is Mac1p-dependent as well. However, CTR3 is not expressed in most laboratory strains of yeast due to a 6-kilobase Ty2 insertion between the TATA element and the transcription start site (3Knight S.A.B. Labbé S. Kwan L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes due to Mac1p is strongly reduced by addition of copper to a copper-depleted yeast culture medium; the [copper] that results in 50% reduction of this expression is ≈20 nm (11Joshi A.

These data indicate that Mac1p-DNA binding and transcriptional activity share a common dependence on copper. What the structural features in Mac1p are that underlie this copper dependence remain largely uncharacterized. However, some data suggest that one component of this regulation by copper may be linked to an intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein (9Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Mac1p sequence suggests that the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein may play distinct functional roles. For example, at neutral pH, the N-terminal domain is predicted to have a net +10 charge (pI = 9.9) while the C-terminal half would have a net charge of −12 (pI = 4.7). The basic nature of the N-terminal domain suggests that it would be involved in DNA binding. Indeed, it contains a possible zinc finger element (ZF) (Scheme FS1) which shares ∼50% sequence identity with the N-terminal domains in two other copper-dependent trans factors, Ace1p in S. cerevisiae (53%, Refs. 12Dameron C.T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This domain is required for DNA binding in all three proteins. In the case of Amt1p, NMR analysis demonstrated that this domain forms a zinc ribbon structure with two short helical segments projecting at one end; basic residues projecting from this end most likely make essential DNA contacts (15Turner R.B. Smith D.L. Zawrotny M.E. Summers M.F. Posewitz M.C. Winge D.R. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of Mac1p (designated NT, residues 1–200) also includes the sequence KKXRX 15KKXK (residues 155–177). This sequence conforms to a nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS) (16Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). As noted, the C-terminal half of Mac1p is acidic (designated here as C1C2, Scheme FS1). This domain contains two cysteine-rich repeats, Rep I and Rep II (17Zhu Z. Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each of these repeats is terminated by a histidine residue. Mutation of the first of these to glutamine, i.e. H279Q, yielded Mac1UP1 (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S.

A second mutation in the Rep I motif, C271Y, or Mac1UP2, results in an identical gain-of-function copper uptake phenotype (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D.

The requirement for two copies of the GCTC element suggested that Mac1p binds to the DNA as a dimer. We affirmed this hypothesis by a combination of EMSA and promoter analysis (11Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The protein concentration dependence of the binding of a truncated form of Mac1p to DNA also indicated the formation of both binary and ternary protein-DNA complexes (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C.

Thus, Mac1p function requires multiple intermolecular protein-protein interactions. A further role for an intramolecularinteraction in Mac1p is suggested by the cooperativity seen in DNA binding and transcriptional activation (9Jensen L.T. Winge D.R.

The following media were used for culture growth: YPD was used for routine growth of wild type strains (2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose); SC medium was used for routine selective growth of transformed strains (1.67 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose plus the appropriate drop-out (otherwise complete) mixture of amino acids); for growth of copper-depleted cultures, a completely synthetic, Chelex-treated medium was used that was prepared as described previously (2Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This medium contained an estimated 0.5 nm residual copper based on the amount of copper in the individual media components (as determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry) and the affinity of the Chelex resin for copper. This medium was subsequently supplemented with a trace metal mixture lacking copper to which copper was added as required for a given experiment. Glycerol was used as carbon source replacing glucose to test for the respiration competence of DEY1457 (mac1Δ) when performing functional tests of mutant forms of Mac1p. This is a standard test for mac1Δ-complementing clones that takes advantage of the iron (and, consequently, respiratory) deficiency in this background (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All PCR-generated fragments, mutations, and reading frames in the plasmid constructs described below were confirmed by dideoxysequencing using the T7 Sequenase 2.0 kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The DNA sequence for the Mac1p ORF was derived from the plasmid MAC16 which was obtained by inserting aMAC1 SacI (−162) to HindIII (+1997) fragment (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) into the complementary restriction sites in vector pRS316 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF for ΔZFMac1p (lacking residues 1–41) was constructed using the endogenous NcoI site (+121) in MAC1 which includes the codon for Met42. The NcoI (filled in)/SalI fragment from MAC16 was ligated into theSmaI/SalI sites in pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) generating pGEM-ΔZF for in vitro synthesis of ΔZFMac1p, and into the bait pGBT9 (giving pGB-ΔZF) and catch pGAD424 (giving pGAD-ZF) vectors for one- and two-hybrid analyses (22Bartel P.L. Chen C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 92-924Google Scholar). To construct whole Mac1p ORF fusions, the endogenous NcoI (+121) site in MAC16 was destroyed by PCR mutagenesis and a newNcoI site was engineered at the +1 nucleotide (translation start). This modified NcoI(−1)/PstI(+210) fragment from MAC16 was exchanged with theNcoI(+121)/PstI(+210) fragment in pGB-ΔZF to generate pGB-MAC, comprising the whole Mac1p ORF. The recombinantNcoI(−1)/SalI(+1927) fragment from pGB-MAC was then subcloned into the catch vector pGAD424 (giving pGAD-MAC) and pGEM3Zf(+) (giving pGEM-MAC) as above. The double mutant ZF*Mac1p (C23S/H25N) was engineered by two rounds of PCR mutagenesis using pGEM-MAC as the template. TheNcoI(−1)/HindIII(+1927) fragment from pGEM-ZF*MAC was filled-in and subcloned into the SmaI sites in pGBT9 and pGAD424 to make plasmids pGB-ZF*MAC and pGAD-ZF*MAC, respectively. The Mac1p fragments C1C2 (residues 203–417) and C2 (residues 287–417) were PCR-generated and subcloned into the NcoI/SalI andBamHI/SalI sites in pGBT9 and pGAD424. The fusions with a STOP codon following Asn286(C2-deleted) were constructed by removing the endogenous 197-base pair EcoRI fragment from the MAC1 ORF and religating the filled-in ends. The N-terminal fragments of Mac1p, encompassing residues 1–51, 1–200, and 42–200, respectively, were generated by PCR, also, and subcloned into theNcoI/SalI sites of the bait and catch vectors. The Mac1p D-helix mutants were functionally tested by complementation in DEY1457Δmac1 in the following manner. TheMAC1 ORF (SacI(−162)/KpnI(+1967)) from MAC16 was subcloned into pRS414 and pRS424 to generate MAC14 and MAC24. These constructs were modified by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Change kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The resulting recombinants, Mac1pI396D, Mac1pF400D, and Mac1pΔD, in both centromeric (CEN) and 2-μm vectors, were subsequently transformed into the Mac1p minus strain and the transformants tested for respiration competence as described above. Similarly, a set of complementary primers were used to engineer the HA epitope coding sequence by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. Both single HA and HA3 recombinants were isolated. In all cases the amount of Mac1 protein species, whether full-length, a truncation epitope-tagged, or a fusion to the Gal4DBD, was assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown in text). Cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid, homogenized with glass beads, and the pellet collected by centrifugation. This pellet was then subjected to two cycles of freezing, thawing, and sonication in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 prior to adding SDS sample buffer. Detection was achieved by use of one (in some cases, two) of the following antibodies: a mouse monoclonal to the Gal4 DBD, a rabbit polyclonal to the HA epitope (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a rabbit polyclonal raised against Mac1p residues 41–417 (this work). All three antibodies were immunodepleted or affinity purified to remove all nonspecific binding to yeast proteins, a common background problem when immunoprobing yeast cell extracts. Immunocomplexes were visualized using chemiluminescent detection (Ultra, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and Kodak BIOMAXTM MR film. For the one- and two-hybrid analyses, yeast transformants carrying either or both parental (control) or recombinant bait (fusions in pGBT9) and catch (fusions in pGAD424) vectors were grown in the appropriate Chelex-treated/copper-supplemented defined medium for at least 5 doublings until the cultures reached early-log phase (OD660 nm ≈ 1.0). Samples (2 × 107 cells) were assayed in triplicate for β-galactosidase activity which was expressed in Miller units in the standard fashion (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). In general, the results given were from at least three independent experiments and were analyzed with the use of InStat (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Two double stranded (ds) oligonucleotides were used in the EMSA shown in Fig. 5. One was the 44-mer that conformed to the inverted repeat from the Mac1p-dependent, CTR1promoter (wild type, CTR1-WT); the other was a mutant probe in which the 3′ Mac1p-binding element, TTTGCTC, was randomized (designated CTR1-R3′) (11Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A typical binding reaction contained 2 fmol of radiolabeled probe, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 12% glycerol, 12 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.6 mm EDTA, and 0.6 mm dithiothreitol (11Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This 15-μl binding mixture, in addition, contained 3–5 μl of a wheat germ extract transcription-translation reaction (Promega) that had been programmed with either vector alone (typically pGEM3Zf(+)) or with vector containing either wild type or mutated Mac1p-encoding sequences. Binding reactions were performed by preincubation of all components except labeled probe for 10 min at room temperature; 2 fmol of radiolabeled probe was then added and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was chilled on ice and then electrophoretically resolved on a 6.0% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and to Kodak BIOMAXTM MR film. The screen was then read using a Bio-Rad model GS-505 PhosphorImager and the digitized intensity data were then quantitated using Molecular Analyst 1.5. The EMSA figure (Fig. 5) was imaged directly from these digitized intensities. To determine if the amount of input Mac1p protein was independent of the MAC1 construct used to program the wheat germ extract, each construct was expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine, the reaction mixture resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the dried gel developed by autoradiography. In all cases, a single Mac1p product was detected of appropriate apparent molecular mass. Based on quantitation of the film by image analysis (Bio-Rad Gel Doc system) equivalent amounts of protein were produced from all templates. Yeast transformants producing Mac1p-HA3constructs were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence in a standard fashion (24Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An equal volume of a fresh solution of paraformaldehyde (4%) was added to 20 ml of a log-phase culture (OD660 nm = 1.5) (25Harlow E. Lane D. Harow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 359-420Google Scholar). Cells were collected by filtration (0.8-μm filters) and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 90 min, the fixed cells were washed three times by centrifugation in 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5). Cell walls were digested in a 1-h treatment with 1 mg of Zymolyase 20T (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in 1 ml of solution of 40 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The fixed spheroplasts were washed twice with a phosphate-sorbitol buffer and attached to polylysine-coated coverslips. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/Mg). The spheroplasts were then permeabilized by sequential treatment with methanol (−20 °C, 5 min) and acetone (−20 °C, 30 s) followed by three PBS/Mg washes. The spheroplasts were treated with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS/Mg, 5 min), washed again three times with PBS/Mg, and then incubated with DNase-free RNase A (50 μg/ml in PBS/Mg, 30 min). Following three PBS/Mg washes, the cells were blocked with bovine serum albumin (1% in PBS/Mg, overnight) and with normal goat serum (1:200 in PBS/Mg, 30 min). The polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (preadsorbed by incubation with fixed, digested, and blocked Mac1p minus yeast cells) was diluted 1:500 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Mg and incubated with the samples for 1 h. Following washing (5 times, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Mg), the samples were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:300 in 0.1% PBS/Mg, 1 h) and then washed as above. The coverslips were stained with 2.4 nm YOYO-1 in PBS for 30 min (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), rinsed with water, and mounted with Elvanol for subsequent phase-contrast and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Previous studies have shown that in a one-hybrid fusion to the Gal4 DBD, the C1C2region of Mac1p had a strong transcriptional activity. However, this activity was not strongly copper-dependent (6Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We constructed additional fusions to the Gal4 DBD to map systematically the region(s) in Mac1p that must interact with one or more of the general transcription factors needed for the assembly of a preinitiation complex (26Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate the following. First, although Mac1p itself exhibited a minimal transcriptional activity in the fusion with Gal4 DBD (Fig. 1, row 2), this activity increased ∼20-fold following deletion of the N-terminal zinc finger homology mo"

To understand how transcription factor activities in plants are regulated in response to light, we analyzed the common plant regulatory factor 2 (CPRF2) from parsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) that interacts with promoter elements of light-regulated genes. Here, we demonstrate that CPRF2 is a phosphoprotein in vivo and that its phosphorylation state is rapidly increased in response to light. Phosphorylation in vitro as well as in vivooccurs primarily within the C-terminal half of the factor, and is caused by a cytosolic 40-kDa protein serine kinase. In contrast to other plant basic leucine-zipper motif factors, phosphorylation of CPRF2 does not alter its DNA binding activity.

Therefore, we discuss alternative functions of the light-dependent phosphorylation of CPRF2 including the regulation of its nucleocytoplasmic partitioning. Light is probably the most variable environmental factor controlling plant development. To monitor light quality and quantity, plants have evolved at least three different photoreceptor systems: the red/far-red reversible phytochromes, the blue/UV-A, and the UV-B photoreceptors (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar). The most well understood of these photoreceptors is the phytochrome system (2Whitelam G.C. Devlin P.F. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 752-758Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Furuya M. Schäfer E. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 301-307Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Besides the search for appropriate mutants, other approaches have been used to understand the signal transduction mechanisms mediated by photoreceptors. (i) Characterizing the photoreceptors themselves and searching for interacting proteins, (ii) unraveling the role of signal mediators like Ca2+, calmodulin, cGMP, and phosphorylation events (4Bowler C. Chua N-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and (iii) analyzing DNA-binding proteins that interact with promoter elements of light-regulated genes. As shown, for example, forchalcone synthase or chlorophyll a/b-binding protein genes, promoter elements that mediate light responsiveness frequently contain the palindromic DNA motif ACGT, that, depending on the adjacent nucleotides, is part of the so-called G-box (CACGTG) or C-box (GACGTC) sequences (5Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, G- and C-boxes are not only found in the promoters of light-regulated genes but also in promoters of genes that respond to other exogenic and endogenic stimuli such as stress, hormones, and cell cycle-related signals (6Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1405-1420PubMed Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since CPRF and G-box binding factors proteins, which have molecular masses between 35 and 45 kDa, are encoded by multigene families (15Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), it is difficult to define which and how many members directly act as transcription factors regulating a certain inducible gene. basic leucine-zipper motif common plant regulatory factor nickel nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay alkaline phosphatase polyvinylidene difluoride protein kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa protein kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa The regulation of the activities of these factors in response to light is poorly understood. However, recent studies showed that the DNA binding activities of several factors of the bZIP-type are regulated by their phosphorylation state (16Klimczak L.J. Collinge M.A. Farini D. Giuliano G. Walker J.C. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was demonstrated that bZIP proteins exist in the cytosol of dark-cultivated parsley cells (19Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From these bZIPs it was shown to be CPRF2 that is localized in the cytoplasm of dark-cultivated cells and transferred to the nucleus upon irradiation (20Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A detailed physiological analysis revealed that phytochrome photoreceptors induce the nuclear import of CPRF2 (20Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Regulation of transcription factor activity, therefore, could be caused also by differences in the subcellular partitioning of the factors in dark- and light-grown cells. In this study we identified a 44-kDa protein in the cytosol of dark-cultivated evacuolated parsley protoplasts that in vitro is very rapidly phosphorylated in response to irradiation. In correlation with this observation we show that in vivothe phosphorylation of the 44-kDa bZIP factor CPRF2 is also rapidly enhanced by light. Since red light is most effective in inducing both phosphorylation events, we conclude that the phytochrome photoreceptor system is involved in these photoresponses. CPRF2 is phosphorylated by a cytosolic 40-kDa protein kinase at least one serine residue within its C terminus. As shown by size exclusion chromatography, CPRF2 and its kinase elute in a molecular mass range of about 300 kDa, indicating that both proteins are part of protein complexes. Since the phosphorylation of CPRF2 does not interfere with its DNA binding activity, we propose that light-induced changes in the phosphorylation state might be involved in the regulation of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of CPRF2. Protoplasts were prepared under dim-green safety light (21Schäfer E. Albrecht H. Optische Strahlungsquellen. Lexika-Verlag, Grafenau, Germany1978: 249-266Google Scholar) from a dark-grown parsley cell culture 6 days after subcultivation. The protoplasts were evacuolated and cytosolic extracts were isolated as described previously (19Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J.

The restriction fragment encoding full-length CPRF2 was subcloned into theBamHI site of the pQE70 vector (Qiagen) to produce a fusion protein with a C-terminal (His)6 tag. Transformation of the vectors in Escherichia coli, expression and purification of the proteins on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose were performed under denaturating conditions as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The purified protein was refolded by removing urea by gel filtration through NAP 5 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein content of the eluate was determined using a method that is based on Coomassie Blue (24Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). 20 μg of freshly prepared cytosol kept on ice was supplied with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP solution (10 μCi, 5000 Ci/mmol in aqueous solution, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), mixed once with a micropipette, and irradiated for 30 s on ice with a slide projector using appropriate filters (21Schäfer E. Albrecht H. Optische Strahlungsquellen. Lexika-Verlag, Grafenau, Germany1978: 249-266Google Scholar,22Harter K. Frohnmeyer H. Kircher S. Kunkel T. Mühlbauer S. Schäfer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5038-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by addition of boiling SDS sample buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 4 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5.0% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C before SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and transfer to polyvinylidene (PVDF) membrane (22Harter K.

Detection of phosphotyrosine residues with a monoclonal antibody (clone 1G2) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each assay about 1.5 × 107 evacuolated protoplasts were suspended in 200 μl of a modified phosphate-free hemagglutinin medium (26Hahlbrock K. Planta. 1975; 124: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) containing 0.4 m sucrose (buffer P). 250 μCi of [32P]phosphate (10 mCi/ml in aqueous solution, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and the sample incubated for 5 min at room temperature. During incubation, samples were either irradiated with a slide projector using appropriate filters and mirrors to avoid warming effects or kept in darkness (19Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Schäfer E. Albrecht H. Optische Strahlungsquellen.

A. 1994; 91: 5038-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After irradiation, evacuolated protoplasts were washed with 500 μl of buffer P and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the cells were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmbenzamidin, 5 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl antipain, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate), and the extracts were clarified by centrifugation. Then 5 μl either of CPRF2 antiserum or the corresponding pre-immunoserum were added and the sample incubated for 2 h on ice followed by addition of 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubation for 1 h on ice. The protein A-Sepharose was washed 6 times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (TBST: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and subsequently boiled in SDS sample buffer. Precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography. Prior to size exclusion chromatography cytosolic extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 ml of the supernatant (corresponding to 5 mg of protein) was fractionated through a Fractogel EMD BioSEC 600-16 column (Merck), with 20 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Individual fractions of 4 ml were concentrated and desalted in Centricon 10 tubes (Amicon) against 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, to a final volume of 100 μl. For calibration of the column the following size markers (Sigma) were used: apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). 2 μg of recombinant CPRF2 were mixed in a total volume of 20 μl with 50 μg of cytosolic protein and 1/10 volume of 0.3 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmCaCl2. To test the gel filtration fractions for CPRF2 phosphorylation activity, the cytosolic protein was replaced by 10 μl of the desalted and concentrated fractions. 1 min after addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the samples the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0. The (His)6-tagged proteins were isolated on Ni-NTA-agarose, eluted with 50 μl of 8 m urea, 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 6.3, and 100 mm EDTA and tested for [32P]phosphate incorporation as described above. Silver staining of Ni-NTA purified CPRF2 was performed according to Ref. 27Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar. For fragment analysis of in vivo phosphorylated CPRF2, an immunoprecipitate of 6 × 107 red light-irradiated evacuolated protoplasts was prepared as described above and cleaved with formic acid (28Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-58Google Scholar). For analyzing the in vitro phosphorylation, 20 μg of recombinant CPRF2 was subjected to the phosphorylation reaction and subsequently purified on Ni-NTA-agarose as described above. For the analysis of phosphopeptides, the purified recombinant CPRF2 was cleaved by formiate (28Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-58Google Scholar). The fragments obtained upon formiate cleavage ofin vitro and in vivo labeled CPRF2 were separated by SDS-PAGE (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. For the detection, fragments obtained from endogenous CPRF2 gels had to be exposed to a Kodak BioMax MS imaging film for 21 days. For phosphoamino acid analysis, recombinant CPRF2 was labeled as described above and analysis was performed according to Refs. 28Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-58Google Scholar and30Neufeld E. Goren J.G. Boland D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Recombinant CPRF2 (0.2 mg/ml) was polymerized into the resolving gel of a 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). 10 μl of the concentrated and desalted fractions from size exclusion chromatography and the unfractionated cytosol were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto the gel. After SDS-PAGE the gel was washed twice in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 20% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and then re-equilibrated in buffer A for 1 h and subsequently incubated with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in buffer A for 1 h. To renature the proteins the gel was washed extensively with ice-cold 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in buffer A (18 h). Then the gel was equilibrated in kinase assay buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 90 μm sodium vanadate in buffer A) for 30 min. The phosphorylation reaction was performed in 10 ml of kinase assay buffer with 30 μm ATP and 60 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward the gel was washed in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate until unreacted radioactivity was removed, dried, and the signals detected by autoradiography. For the phosphorylation kinetics of recombinant CPRF2, 200 μl of the following mixture were prepared: 33 mm creatine phosphate, 0.04 unit/μl creatine kinase, 7 mm MgCl2, 7 mm ATP, and 3 μg/μl cytosolic protein. Creatine phosphate and creatine kinase (Sigma) were used to regenerate the ATP pool during the kinetics (19Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The mixture was divided. One-half was incubated on ice with 0.1 unit/μl apyrase (Sigma) to hydrolyze the ATP while the other half was kept on ice. After 30 min, 10-μl aliquots of the mixtures were removed, representing ATP-free and ATP-containing cytosolic extracts and used as controls of the endogenous DNA binding activity of the cytosol. To the remaining reaction mixtures (90 μl each) 0.01 μg/μl CPRF2 were added. For each time point of the kinetics, 10-μl aliquots were removed, mixed with 1 unit of apyrase to stop phosphorylation activities and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples of the phosphorylation reactions and the cytosolic fractions of the size exclusion chromatography were analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). For this a DNA probe according to the monomeric G-box (5′-AATTCTCCCTTATTCCACGTGGCCATCCGG-3′) or the monomeric C-box (5′-AATTCTCCCTTATCTGACGTCAGCATCCGG-3′) was used (20Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P.

Preparation of the radioactively labeled probes as well as experimental conditions for EMSA, electrophoretic mobility supershift assay, and treatments of evacuolated protoplasts extracts with alkaline phosphatase (AP) were described previously (19Harter K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) we characterized the expression and intracellular distribution of three members of the parsley CPRF transcription factor family. In our present work, we are studying the post-translational regulation of CPRF activities. Since transcription factor activities are frequently modulated by phosphorylation (34Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), we initially tested in vitro whether a light-induced phosphorylation of a cytosolic polypeptide occurs in the molecular mass range of about 35–45 kDa that could represent a modification of one of the CPRF proteins. For this purpose, cytosol obtained from dark-cultivated evacuolated protoplasts was used. The removal of the toxic and proteolytically very active content of the vacuole from the protoplasts is necessary for obtaining functionally intact parsley protein extracts (19Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Harter K. Frohnmeyer H. Kircher S. Kunkel T. Mühlbauer S. Schäfer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5038-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cytosolic extract was supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP and the reaction mixture divided in three aliquots. Two aliquots were irradiated for 30 s either with red or white light and one further kept in darkness. The reactions were stopped by addition of boiling SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE and transfer onto PVDF membrane, the phosphorylation pattern of cytosolic proteins was analyzed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.1 A, several proteins with different molecular sizes were phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner. Of particular interest was the phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 44 kDa corresponding well with that of the factor CPRF2. This protein was most strongly labeled in response to red light irradiation indicating the involvement of phytochrome photoreceptors. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is discussed to be involved in phytochrome signaling leading to the activation of the G-box-containing chalcone synthase promoter (35Bowler C. Yamagata H. Neuhaus G. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2188-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the same samples used above were tested with an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine. Although several polypeptides constitutively cross-reacted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, no staining of those proteins was observed that were differentially labeled in response to irradiation (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that the light-induced phosphorylation of all these proteins including the 44-kDa polypeptide occurs most likely at serine and/or threonine but not at tyrosine residues. The importance of phosphorylation for the regulation of transcription factor activities is well studied in yeast and animals (34Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Since the molecular mass of the observed phosphorylated cytosolic 44-kDa protein corresponds with that of CPRF2, we took into consideration that both proteins are identical. Therefore, we tested whether CPRF2 is a phosphoprotein in vivo and whether its phosphorylation state is changed in response to light treatment. Dark-cultivated evacuolated protoplasts were in vivo labeled with [32P]phosphate and irradiated for 5 min with light of different wavelengths or kept in darkness. After lysis of the evacuolated protoplasts, CPRF2 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and assayed for phosphorylation by autoradiography (Fig.2 A). Compared with the dark control (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), irradiation with either far-red, red, or white light enhanced the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into endogenous CPRF2 with red light being most effective (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3). No signal could be detected when the pre-immunoserum was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). These data show that irradiation rapidly increases the phosphorylation state of CPRF2. To be able to further characterize the observed phosphorylation, an in vitro assay was established using recombinant CPRF2 and cytosolic extracts. As shown in Fig. 2 B, lane 1, recombinant CPRF2 was phosphorylated by cytosolic extracts leading to a strong signal after autoradiography. In contrast, no signals could be detected using cytosolic extracts without recombinant CPRF2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). To map the phosphorylation site of CPRF2 in vitro as well as in vivo, phosphorylated and purified recombinant as well as endogenous CPRF2 were used for formiate hydrolysis. Formiate treatment cleaves peptide bonds between aspartate and proline (28Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-58Google Scholar) and should result, in the case of CPRF2, in three peptides of 6.2 kDa (corresponding to amino acid (aa) 1–56), 14.5 kDa (corresponding to aa 57–195), and 23 kDa (corresponding to aa 196–401) (Fig. 3 A). After hydrolysis the fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and the phosphorylation pattern was analyzed by autoradiography. Independently of the fact, whether CPRF2 was phosphorylated in vitro (Fig.3 B) or in vivo (Fig. 3 C), the major phosphorylated peptide had an apparent molecular mass of about 25 kDa. This suggests that, on the one hand, the predominately modified amino acid residues are very likely identical within the in vitroand in vivo labeled CPRF2 and, on the other hand, are localized within the C-terminal half of CPRF2. To identify the phosphorylated amino acid, a phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated recombinant CPRF2 was performed. In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1 B the phosphorylation of CPRF2 was confined exclusively to serine residues (Fig.3 D). The molecular properties of the CPRF2-phosphorylating serine kinase were further characterized by extending our in vitrophosphorylation approach. For this purpose, cytosol was prepared from dark-kept evacuolated protoplasts. Subsequently, the cytosol was irradiated with white light and separated by size exclusion chromatography. The obtained fractions were tested for CPRF2 phosphorylating activities by addition of recombinant CPRF2 and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.4 A, labeling of CPRF2 was mainly found in fractions peaking around a molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa. A weak CPRF2 phosphorylating activity could also be detected in fractions around the molecular mass marker of 45 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8–10). These results could be interpreted that the CPRF2 phosphorylating kinase is either a very large protein or associated with other peptides in a multiprotein complex. To test these possibilities, we performed an in-gel assay. For this, recombinant CPRF2 was polymerized into the matrix of an SDS-PAGE gel. Complete cytosol and those cytosolic fractions showing CPRF2 phosphorylating activity were separated on this gel and, subsequently, the proteins were renatured within the gel matrix. Finally, the gel was incubated in a [γ-32P]ATP containing buffer, washed, and analyzed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 B, two kinase activities of different molecular mass could be detected in the cytosol. A 40 kDa activity (p40) that eluted in the high molecular mass range (with a maximum of approximately 300 kDa) and a 50 kDa activity (p50) that was found in a lower molecular mass range (with a maximum of approximately 60 kDa). In-gel kinase assays under identical methodical conditions but without matrix-immobilized CPRF2 did not yield any detectable signals (data not shown). This demonstrates that the CPRF2 phosphorylating activities derived from substrate phosphorylation and not from autophosphorylation activity. Since the main phosphorylation activity for CPRF2 (Fig. 4 A) was observed in the same high molecular weight fractions as p40 these data strongly suggest that p40 is the cytosolic CPRF2-specific serine kinase. Moreover, the appearance of p40 in a molecular mass range of about 300 kDa indicates that this kinase forms a complex with other proteins. On the other hand, those fraction"

As a result of depolarization, voltage-dependent Ca2+channels open, level of intracellular Ca2+ increases. and release of neurotransmitter commences. Previous study had shown that in rat brain synaptosomes, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (mAChRs) interact with soluble NSF attachment protein receptor proteins of the exocytic machinery in a voltage-dependent manner. It was suggested that this interaction might control the rapid, synchronous release of acetylcholine. The present study investigates the mechanism for such a voltage-dependent interaction. Here we show that depolarization shifts mAChRs, specifically the m2 receptor subtype, to a low affinity state toward its agonists. At resting potential, mAChRs are in a high affinity state (K d of ∼20 nm) and they shift to a low affinity state (K d of tens of μm) upon membrane depolarization. In addition, interaction between m2 receptor subtype and the exocytic machinery increases with receptor occupancy. Both phenomena are independent of Ca2+ influx. We propose that these results may explain control of ACh release from nerve terminals. At resting potential the exocytic machinery is clamped due to its interaction with the occupied mAChR and depolarization relieves this interaction.

Neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals is a unique instance of a secretory process where external stimuli must be handled with extreme speed and accuracy. Many proteins have been implicated to be involved in neurotransmitter release, but only a few have been found to be essential (1Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin.

We have recently addressed this question and identified a group of membrane receptors not previously considered part of the control machinery of neurotransmitter release. We showed that, in rat brain synaptosomes, at Ca2+-depleted solution, presynaptic muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) directly interact with the ExA, specifically with syntaxin and SNAP-25, and that this interaction is voltage-dependent (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A related, large body of work has documented cross-talk between presynaptic G-protein-coupled receptors, including mAChR, and Ca2+ channels (e.g. Refs.19Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Curr. Opin.

Miller R.J. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The observed role of these receptors is in reducing Ca2+ influx via an activation of their associated G-proteins. These studies do not consider, however, a physical interaction between the receptor and the voltage-dependent channel. Consequently, these studies concern the receptor's role in modulating release by determining the Ca2+ levels. The findings of Linial et al. (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) suggest an additional role to mAChRs, namely that they may serve as voltage-dependent gatekeepers of ACh release in nerve terminals. At resting potential, the release apparatus is clamped due to its tight interaction with mAChR. Upon depolarization, presumably in parallel to the influx of Ca2+, the clamp is removed and release may commence. The present study explores a mechanism that may underlie the voltage-dependent interaction between mAChRs and the ExA. Experiments were performed on rat brain synaptosomes in Ca2+-free solution and the effects of depolarizationper se could thus be discerned. We show that depolarization shifts mAChRs, specifically the m2 subtype, from a high to a low affinity state toward its agonists. We also found that interaction of the m2 subtype receptor with the SNARE protein syntaxin increases with receptor occupancy. We suggest that the depolarization-induced shift in mAChR affinity affects its interaction with ExA. Relief from this interaction, together with Ca2+ influx, evokes release of ACh from nerve terminals. Fresh synaptosomes were prepared from rat brains (28Pearce L.B. Buck T. Adamec E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and were used within 3 h of preparation. In all experiments the physiological state of the synaptosomes was monitored by a glutamate release assay as described previously (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as described (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J.

Briefly, antibodies were prebound to Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in HKA buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA), supplemented with 0.1% gelatin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of synaptosomes (150 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Ca2+-free physiological buffer (BSS; 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 128 mmNaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmd-glucose). For depolarization, NaCl was replaced by KCl (BSS-depolarization buffer). Synaptosomes were gently washed (twice), and solubilization was performed for 1 h (4 °C) in IP buffer containing HKA buffer with the respective levels of KCl and 2% freshly prepared CHAPS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 mm AEBSF (Calbiochem) were added to the IP buffer. Following overnight incubation of the prebound beads (4 °C) with solubilized synaptosomes, the bound proteins were thoroughly washed (IP buffer with only 0.2% CHAPS), separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Special precautions were taken to avoid unspecific interactions of mAChR with syntaxin. Syntaxin is prone to artificial interactions due to its strong adhesion to Protein A/G-Sepharose beads. Including gelatin during the experiment and 5% glycerol during a final wash step minimizes syntaxin's adhesion. The intensity of nonspecific immunoreactive signal for syntaxin on Protein G-Sepharose did not exceed 5% of the signal obtained by including the relevant antibody. The amounts of m2-syntaxin complex were insensitive to varying protein concentrations during the IP experiment (range from 1.5 to 0.1 mg/ml). Most IP experiments were done at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB), 45 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products) at 2 nm was incubated (25 °C) with the synaptosomes for 45 min prior to solubilization and throughout the rest of the procedure. The level of [3H]QNB that had been immunoprecipitated with the antibodies was identical irrespective of KCl concentration (in the range of 5–120 mm KCl). After overnight incubation, bound proteins were filtered through GF/C filters using washing buffer and radioactivity was monitored in a scintillation counter. Acetyl cholinesterase (AChE, Sigma), muscarine (Sigma), methoctramine, and pirenzepine (RBI) were incubated with the synaptosomes for 30 min (25 °C) before and during the depolarization step, and were also maintained (excluding AChE) throughout membrane solubilization. The antibodies used to detect proteins of the ExA are: polyclonal anti-syntaxin 1A (Alomone, Israel), monoclonal anti-HPC-1 (Sigma), polyclonal antibodies against SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 (kindly provided by M. Takahashi), monoclonal anti-synaptotagmin I (Signal Transduction), and anti-synaptophysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories). Protein concentration was measured by the Bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce). Immunoreactivity was measured by densitometry of a luminescence reaction within the linear range of the reaction. Data were analyzed using a National Institutes of Health imaging program (NIH Image, version 1.59). All IP experiments were repeated in Ca2+-depleted buffer (2 mmEGTA) with no measurable differences to the results obtained in Ca2+-free buffers. For mAChRs, we used monoclonal m2 antibody (Chemicon) and polyclonal m1–m5 antibodies (kindly provided by E. Heldman, Nes-Ziona, Israel). The titer of the antibodies was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using predetermined amounts of mAChR antigens obtained from CHO-K1-transfected cells. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Beit-hemeek, Israel) buffer containing 10% fetal calf serum and 400 ng/ml neomycin (Promega). Cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared (2 mg/ml) for binding assays (see below). The concentration of each antibody used for immunoprecipitation was optimized for efficient precipitation (>70% efficiency). The level of nonspecific binding, as determined by including 1 μm atropine in the immunoprecipitation, did not exceed 10%. For blocking experiments, purified GST fusion proteins containing the i3 loop of m1 and m2 receptors were prepared and purified as described previously (29Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides (20 μg/ml) were included in the immunoprecipitation experiments. Membranes prebound with 2 nm ofN-[methyl-3H]scopolamine ([3H]NMS, 84 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were treated with either GTPγS (Sigma) or GDPβS (Sigma) at concentrations of 10–100 μm. Immunoprecipitation was performed to quantify the efficiency of the different antibodies to precipitated receptors coupled or uncoupled to their associated G-proteins. Syntaxin recombinant peptide was prepared from a GST fusion construct (amino acids 4–267). The GST fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Syntaxin was purified following thrombin (1:500 molar ratio) cleavage, and the amount of the peptide was quantified by micro-BCA procedure (Pierce). Binding of radiolabeled agonists was performed as described (30Gurwitz D. Kloog Y. Sokolovsky M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 297-305PubMed Google Scholar), using [3H]ACh (20 Ci/mmol, 90% ethanol; ARC Inc.). Briefly, small aliquots of labeled ACh were kept at −70 °C. For each experiment, ACh was dried under N2 flow and resuspended in BSS buffer. We used both BSS and BSS-Ca2+-depleted (BSS containing 2 mm EGTA and 3.4 mmMgCl2) in binding experiments. In BSS buffer the synaptosomes were found to be physiologically stable for longer periods and a smaller variability among data points was observed. Synaptosomes were first washed, to eliminate contamination by endogenous ACh, in 10 volumes of physiological BSS buffer and then depolarized for 30 min at 25 °C in BSS-depolarization buffer. AChE inhibitor (phospholine iodide, 46 μm) was added to all reaction mixtures. Specified concentration of [3H]ACh was added to the depolarized synaptosomes in siliconized glass tubes (to a total volume of 40–200 μl) and incubated with gentle shaking (45 min, 25 °C). Synaptosomes were subsequently filtered through GF/C filters, washed four times with ice-cold depolarization buffer (within less than 30 s, 2 ml each). Extended washing procedure resulted in a marked reduction in the cpm values. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined using scintillation counter. Identical experiments were performed on lysed synaptosomes. Lysis was achieved by physical shearing (using Polytron) in cold, hypotonic buffer (5 mmTris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). To ensure complete lysis, the procedure was repeated three times, and, between lysis, membranes were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g, TLA 100.2, Beckman). All binding determinations were done in duplicates, with less than 10% variation between the duplicates. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm freshly prepared atropine. To construct the nonspecific curve, we fitted the data points (each in duplicate) at concentration of ACh up to 40 nm and extrapolated it to the entire range of ACh concentration. In experiments where mAChR antagonists (pirenzepine, methoctramine) or Ca2+ channel blockers (calcicludine, ω-conotoxin GVIA, and ω-agatoxin IVA; Alomone Laboratories) were included, they were incubated with the synaptosomes in BSS buffer (30 min) prior and throughout depolarization or prior to the addition of agonist. Binding of the radiolabeled antagonist [3H]NMS (84 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to synaptosomes was performed as described above, but [3H]NMS concentrations were 0.1–20 nm and binding was performed in BSS buffer for 45 min at 25 °C. For accurate measurements of [3H]ACh and [3H]NMS, an aliquot from each experimental point was withdrawn for scintillation counting and the actual concentration was determined. Binding curves were fitted assuming a Michaelis-Menten equation with a single binding site. All binding experiments were repeated in BSS-Ca2+-depleted buffers with no measurable differences in results in comparison to BSS-Ca2+-free buffers. [3H]NMS (0.6–1 nm) was incubated with 100 μg of protein from fresh synaptosomes following depolarization at 90 mm KCl (45 min at 25 °C) and was displaced by the presence of unlabeled agonists (muscarine, carbachol, or ACh; 10−10 to 10−2m). ACh stock solutions were prepared freshly before the experiments to minimize ACh decomposition during storage. Samples were filtered and counted as in the binding assays. Total number of binding sites were calculated at each experiment from the [3H]NMS counts obtained prior to the addition of the agonists. Displacement experiments in the presence of Veratridine (Calbiochem) were performed by preincubation of the drug for 10 min before adding [3H]NMS or the different concentrations of unlabeled agonists. Displacement of [3H]oxotremorine (7–10 nm) with unlabeled antagonists was performed similarly but the experiments were performed in the dark (due to the sensitivity of oxotremorine to light). Fitting of the data was accomplished using competitive inhibition equation with two affinity states and aK d for [3H]NMS of 0.2 nm(31Burgermeister W. Klein W.L. Nirenberg M. Witkop B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 751-767PubMed Google Scholar). The value of the high affinity K d for carbachol was fixed to 100 nm. This value is based on the corresponding K d for ACh (∼20 nm, see Fig. 3) and the affinity for carbachol, which is 5.7-fold lower (32Birdsall N.J. Burgen A.S. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 723-736PubMed Google Scholar,33Candura S.M. Castoldi A.F. Manzo L. Costa L.G. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Data analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 1.03 software package. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test comparing two means. For each experiment, the membrane potential was determined by the level of accumulation of [3H]TPP+ (tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, 31.4 Ci/mmol, ethanol, NEN Life Science Products) within the synaptosomes, as described previously (34Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptosomes (at a concentration of 5 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C, 20 min with gentle shaking in BSS-depolarization buffer, in the presence of 0.3 μm [3H]TPP+. Each sample (in duplicates) was filtered through a GF/C filter, and identical samples were filtered while being washed four times with ice-cold water, in order to lyse the synaptosomes. The values of the lysed synaptosomes were taken as the nonspecific background and subtracted from the experimental data. Values for specific binding at 5–120 mmKCl ranged between 85,000–110,000 and 12,000–15,000 cpm, respectively. The membrane potential was calculated according to a Nernst equation referring to 150 mm KCl (assumed to reflect the intracellular [K+] in mammals) as zero membrane potential. Resting potential was defined in 5 mm KCl (rather than at the physiological level of 2.4 mm KCl), as we found that the synaptosomes could not maintain a fixed potential for long periods (>2 h) at KCl concentration below 5 mm. The calculated resting potential we obtained for most of our synaptosomal preparations ranged between −70 and −60 mV. Preparations whose initial membrane potential was below −55 mV were not used. Each one of the added compounds (e.g. channel blockers, mAChRs agonists, and antagonists) were checked for their effect on membrane potential. Five different subtypes of mAChRs, referred to as m1–m5 (35Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 36Ramachandran J. Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Capon D.J. Bioessays. 1989; 10: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37Nathanson N.M. Prog. Brain. Res. 1996; 109: 165-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were identified. These subtypes are localized in distinct brain areas and are distributed differently at pre- and postsynaptic regions (38Levey A.I. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 39Brann M.R. Ellis J. Jorgensen H. Hill E.D. Jones S.V. Prog. Brain Res. 1993; 98: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cumulative experimental data suggest that the m1 receptor is the major postsynaptic muscarinic receptor and that m2/m4 predominate presynaptically and serve as autoreceptors in the cholinergic pathway (29Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rouse S.T. Thomas T.M. Levey A.I. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In order to discern the types of mAChRs involved in the interaction with the ExA, we used a panel of mAChRs subtype-selective antibodies (41Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of the antibodies in immunoprecipitation was determined as follows; CHO-K1 cells transfected with individual receptors (m1–m5) were used to determine the specificity of each antibody. Total amounts of muscarinic receptor binding sites were determined by performing saturation binding curves using [3H]QNB, and the B max value for each cell line was extracted. Immunoprecipitation experiments from all five CHO-K1-transfected cells using five antibodies (raised against the i3 loop of each of the receptors; Ref. 41Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed on solubilized membranes prelabeled by [3H]QNB. The efficiency of immunoprecipitation of the solubilized receptors was high for all five receptors. Antibodies against m1 and m4 precipitated about 75% of the sites, and immunoprecipitation efficiency of the other receptors (m2, m3, and m5) with their appropriate antibodies reached 95% (Fig. 1 A). Specificity of the antibodies is further demonstrated by the absence of cross-reactivity between the m1 and m2 receptor subtypes (Fig.1 A). In our previous study, we demonstrated a specific interaction between mAChRs and various proteins of the exocytic apparatus by using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent (dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate) in intact synaptosomes. We demonstrated that protein complexes of mAChRs and syntaxin are present in situ, before solubilization (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We wished to determine which of the various mAChR subtypes participate in such interactions. To this end, we used immunoblot analysis to monitor syntaxin co-precipitating with the various mAChR subtype-specific antibodies. Fig. 1 B shows that over 85% of syntaxin interacting with mAChRs co-precipitates with m2 and m4 receptor subtypes, and it is the m2 subtype that predominates in this interaction (Fig. 1 B, bottom). The relative amounts of mAChR receptors in the synaptosomal preparation were evaluated by pharmacological and immunological means. Taking into account the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation (as seen in Fig.1 A), we estimated m1 (35%) and m2 and m4 (about 30% each) to account for the majority of mAChRs in rat brain synaptosomes. Both m3 and m5 are present in relatively minute quantities. Accordingly, we concluded that it is mainly the m2 (and to a lesser extent m4) which is responsible for the interaction with syntaxin. The prevalence of the m2 (and m4) receptors in the immunoprecipitation was also demonstrated for the other proteins of the ExA (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). In a previous study (18Linial M. Ilouz N. Parnas H. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we used a mixture of mAChR antibodies to show that the interaction of mAChRs and syntaxin (and also SNAP-25) is voltage-dependent. In the present study, therefore, we examine whether the interaction of the m2 subtype, by itself, with syntaxin and with other proteins of the ExA is voltage-dependent. To this end we have used a monoclonal antibody raised against the i3 loop of m2 receptor that was optimized for quantitative immunoprecipitation as determined by using m2-CHO-K1-transfected cells. Table Ishows that the antibody is specific to m2 receptor subtype and no cross-reactivity is detected with other mAChR subtypes. Addition of excess m2-i3 expressed peptide to the reaction competed efficiently with the binding of the antibody to m2 subtype receptor while addition of saturated amounts of expressed m1-i3 peptide had a negligible effect on the amount of immunoprecipitated receptor. In addition, supplementing GTPγS or GDPβS to the reaction does not affect the immunoprecipitation efficiency indicating that the antibody is insensitive to the level of association of the receptor with G-proteins (Table I). We thus conclude that the antibody is suitable for quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments under varying experimental conditions. We have used this m2 antibody to reconfirm the specific interaction of m2 receptor with syntaxin. As seen, addition of m2-i3 expressed peptide greatly reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitated syntaxin with m2 receptor (Fig. 1 C).Table ISpecificity of m2 mAChR antibodyAntibodiesMembranesAddition[3H]QNBcpm (S.E.)m2CHO-m1142.3 (55.3)m2CHO-m2748.6 (61.6)m2CHO-m3107.6 (20.7)m2CHO-m490.0 (31.1)m2CHO75.6 (34.5)IgGCHO-m263.5 (19.5)m2CHO-m2m2-antigen182.0 (13.9)m2CHO-m2m1-antigen738.3 (120.4)m2CHO-m2GTPγS711.6 (165.2)m2CHO-m2GDPβS765.0 (133.8)Membranes from untransfected CHO (300 μg) and sublines of CHO-K1 stable transfected with human m1–m4 mAChR (100–300 μg) were prepared and saturated with 1.6 nm [3H]QNB.

The rds gene encodes rds/peripherin (rds), a membrane glycoprotein in the rims of rod and cone outer segment discs. rds is present as a complex with the related protein, rom1. Here, we generated transgenic mice that express a chimeric protein (rom/D2) containing the intradiscal D2 loop of rds in the context of rom1. rom/D2 was N-glycosylated, formed covalent homodimers, and interacted non-covalently with itself, rds, and rom1. The rds·rom/D2 interaction was significantly more stable than the non-covalent interaction between rds and rom1 by detergent/urea titration. Analysis of mice expressing rom/D2 revealed that rds is 2.5-fold more abundant than rom1, interacts non-covalently with itself and rom1 via the D2 loop, and forms a high order complex that may extend the entire circumference of the disc. Expression of rom/D2 fully rescued the ultrastructural phenotype inrds+/− mutant mice, but it had no effect on the phenotype in rds−/− mutants. Together, these observations explain the striking differences in null phenotypes and frequencies of disease-causing mutations between the RDS andROM1 genes.

These discs are the sites of photon capture and reactions of visual transduction. rds is a 36-kDa glycoprotein with four transmembrane segments located in the rims of rod and cone outer segment discs (1Connell G.

Although the function of rds is not known, the phenotype resulting from a null mutation in its gene has been described. Photoreceptors inretinal degeneration slow(rds−/−)1 mice completely fail to develop outer segments (3van Nie R. Ivanyi D. Demant P.

Instead, rhodopsin-containing vesicles are present in the subretinal space between the photoreceptor cell bodies and retinal pigment epithelium (6Nir I. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Disc addition at the base of the outer segment is an ongoing process in mature photoreceptors, to compensate for the diurnal shedding of distal outer segments (9Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The rds−/− phenotype suggests that outer segment membranes are synthesized in these mutants but cannot fold into discs without rds.rds+/− heterozygotes have a partial phenotype of short and grossly disorganized outer segments, which results from haploinsufficiency (10Hawkins R.K. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Ma J. Norton J.C. Allen A.C. Burns J.B. Hasel K.W. Burns J.L. Sutcliffe J.G. Travis G.H. Genomics. 1995; 28: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More than 50 mutations in the human RDS gene are responsible for several dominantly inherited retinal degenerations including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (reviewed in Refs. 12Keen T.J. Inglehearn C.F. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 13Shastry B.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MostRDS mutations cause single-residue substitutions within the large intradiscal D2 loop of rds between transmembrane segments three and four (Fig. 1 A). An unusual form of RP with digenic inheritance has been described (14Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Affected individuals in three pedigrees were heterozygous for both a mutation in RDS, causing an L185P substitution in the D2 loop, and an early frameshift mutation in the unlinked gene for rom1 (14Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Neither mutation alone caused disease. rom1 is a protein homologous to rds with an overall identity of 37% and a similar predicted membrane topology (15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The distribution of rom1 in outer segment discs is identical to that of rds (15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both rds and rom1 have been shown to form covalent homodimers (15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S.

Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results of immunoprecipitation and velocity sedimentation studies, it has been suggested that covalent homodimers of rds and rom1 interact non-covalently to form a heterotetrameric complex (17Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The domain responsible for non-covalent interactions between rds and rom1 homodimers is not known. Given this apparent symmetry, mutations in therom1 and rds genes should cause similar phenotypes. Curiously, this is not the case. No mutations inROM1 alone have been convincingly associated with any human retinal diseases (22Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1972-1982PubMed Google Scholar). Also, mice with a null mutation in therom1 gene show only mild outer segment dysplasia (23Clarke G.A. Rossant J.A. McInnes R.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: S962Google Scholar), in contrast to complete nondevelopment of outer segments inrds−/− mutants (3van Nie R. Ivanyi D. Demant P. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 12: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 21: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Cohen A.I. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 832-843PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we generated transgenic mouse lines that expressed a chimeric protein, named rom/D2, containing the D2 loop of rds in the context of rom1 (Fig. 1 A). Expression of rom/D2 in transgenic retinas allowed us to measure directly relative levels of rds and rom1 in photoreceptors, as well as the relative strength of interactions between these proteins. Based on our observations, we propose an alternative model for the interaction of rds and rom1 in outer segments. cDNA fragments encoding the C1–M3 domains of mouse rom1, the D2 domain of mouse rds, and the M4–C3 domains of mouse rom1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting products were assembled into a coding unit for rom/D2. The sequence of rom/D2 is shown in Fig. 1 A. The rom/D2 coding unit was assembled into a transgene construct containing 6.5 kilobase pairs from upstream of the mouse rhodopsin gene as a transcriptional regulator and the SV40 t-intron and early polyadenylation signal as a transcriptional terminator, similar to what we have used in other transgenic studies (21Kedzierski W.

ICR strain transgenic founders were out-crossed with wild-type C57BL/6 mice or with rds−/− homozygous mutants on a C57BL/6 background to yield mice of the desired genotype. To reduce possible photic damage, only pigmented (non-albino) animals were studied (26Noell W.K. Walker V.S. Kang B.S. Berman S. Investig. Ophthalmol. 1966; 5: 450-473PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle at 40 lux and were sacrificed between 4 and 6 h after light onset. For all experiments, mice were studied at 3 weeks of age. Mice were analyzed for the presence of the transgene by polymerase chain reaction with primers: 5′-CCTGGAGTTGCGCTGT and 5′-GTCTTTTTCATGAAGCACC, from the mouse rhodopsin promoter (27Baehr W. Falk J.D. Bugra K. Triantafyllos J.T. McGinnis J.F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the rds coding region (28Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), respectively. Mice were analyzed for the presence of a wild-typerds gene by polymerase chain reaction using the primers: 5′-CCTCCATGCCCTGCCTCT, from the first intron of rds (11Ma J. Norton J.C. Allen A.C. Burns J.B. Hasel K.W. Burns J.L. Sutcliffe J.G. Travis G.H. Genomics. 1995; 28: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and 5′-AGCAGAGCGGCCCTGCA, from the rds coding region, and for the presence of the mutant rds gene with 5′-CGCATCAAGAGCAAC, from the rds coding region, and 5′-CACATTACTCTTAAGGCC, from the rds inserted element (11Ma J.

Polymerase chain reaction was done on DNA from tail cuts under standard conditions. Total RNA was extracted from individual eyecups using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were hybridized to a [α-32P]UMP-labeled RNA probe of 1050 nucleotides, which contained 899 nucleotides complementary to therds mRNA and 321 nucleotides complementary to the transgenic mRNA. After hybridization and S1 nuclease digestion, protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea as described (29Kedzierski W. Porter J.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 899- and 321-nucleotide protected fragments were quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics model 425F PhosphorImager and normalized for their content of radioactive nucleotide. Antiserum against the rds D2 loop (rds D2 Ab) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with peptide D2P4 (KEVKDRIKSNVDGR) (Fig. 1 A) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antisera against residues 296–346 from the carboxyl terminus of rds (rds C-term Ab) and residues 296–351 from the carboxyl terminus of rom1 (rom1 C-term Ab) were prepared as described (21Kedzierski W. Bok D. Travis G.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were as described previously (21Kedzierski W. Bok D. Travis G.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For analysis of protein dimers, dithiothreitol was omitted in the sample buffer. For radioactive detection, 125I-labeled protein A (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) was used in a 6-h incubation at a concentration of 0.1 μCi/ml instead of secondary antibody. After five 8-min washes, the radioactive bands were visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics model 425F PhosphorImager. For quantitative immunoblotting, retinal extracts were deglycosylated, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon P-SQ (Millipore) in buffer containing 0.05% SDS, immunolabeled, and detected with 125I-labeled protein A. Individual pairs of retinas were homogenized in sodium phosphate (NaP) buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1% SDS, 0.1m dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors), heated at 55 °C for 2 min in a homogenizer, and diluted 5-fold with the NaP buffer without SDS. After a 2-min clearing centrifugation, samples were incubated at 37 °C with cloned (protease-free) peptideN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 15 units per retina equivalent of total protein. Samples were diluted with 6× sample buffer and submitted to SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis as described above. Dissected retinas were homogenized in Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 2.5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Homogenates were cleared by a 2-min spin in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C and incubated with the indicated antisera at 4 °C for 2 h. Before use, the rds C-term and rom C-term Abs were coupled to Affi-Gel Hz (Bio-Rad). rds D2 antiserum was used unbound, and the reaction mixture was subsequently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for immunoprecipitation. After adsorption, the beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted with 2× sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. For the experiment presented in Fig.3 A, cleared homogenates were mixed with SDS and urea to get 1% and 8 m final concentration, respectively. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the homogenates were diluted 20-fold with Triton buffer (without SDS) and then incubated with antisera. For the experiment presented in Fig. 3 B, retinas were extracted in NaP buffer, treated with N-glycosidase F, and mixed with SDS and urea at 1% and 8 m final concentrations, respectively. After a 5-min incubation, the homogenates were diluted 20-fold in Triton buffer (without SDS) and incubated with antisera. For the experiment presented in Fig. 5, retinas were homogenized in 1% CHAPS plus phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors, cleared by centrifugation, and incubated with antisera.Figure 5Co-precipitation of rds and rom1.Retinal homogenate prepared under non-reducing conditions from a non-transgenic rds+/+ mouse was immunoprecipitated with either rds C-term or rom1 C-term Abs (precipitating Ab). Equivalent volumes of the starting homogenate (homog), pellet, and supernatant (sup) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting, using the rds C-term or rom1 C-term Abs (detecting Ab).

Note complete co-precipitation of rds with rom1 by the rom1 C-term Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Eyes dissected from 3-week-old mice were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 0.1m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.5% picric acid. Fixed tissues were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h and stained en bloc with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. The specimens were then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin. 80-nm sections were cut using a diamond knife on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome, collected on Formvar-coated copper oval slot grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined using a JEOL 1200EX II transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Six transgenic lines (rdm1–rdm6) were generated with the rom/D2 construct encoding the chimeric protein represented in Fig. 1,A and B. Fig. 1 C shows the results of nuclease protection analysis performed on RNA from the eyes of 3-week-old transgenic offspring using a riboprobe that simultaneously detected the transgenic and endogenous rds mRNAs (21Kedzierski W. Bok D. Travis G.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,25Kedzierski W. Lloyd M. Birch D.G. Bok D. Travis G.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 498-519PubMed Google Scholar). After correcting for probe length and UMP content, the ratio of transgenic:endogenous rds mRNAs was determined. The levels of rom/D2 transgenic mRNA in these lines ranged between one and six times that of the wild-type endogenousrds mRNA (Fig. 1 C). We performed immunoblot analysis on retinal homogenates from the same mice using rds D2 and rom1 C-term antisera (Fig. 1 D). As predicted, rds and rom/D2 were both detected by the rds D2 Ab, whereas rom/D2 and rom1 were both detected by the rom1 C-term Ab. The apparent molecular mass of rom/D2 was higher than that of rds and slightly lower than that of rom1. The endogenous rds mRNA and rds protein were at significantly reduced levels in high-expressing transgenic lines rdm2, rdm4, and rdm5 (Fig. 1, C andD), because of partial photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptor degeneration in these high-expressing lines was confirmed by light microscopic analysis of retinal sections (not shown). No reduction in the endogenous rds mRNA or protein levels were observed in lines rdm1, rdm3, and rdm6. The retinas of these animals were also normal by light microscopy (not shown). The D2 loop of rds, but not rom1, contains one site of N-glycosylation. To define whether rom/D2 is N-glycosylated in vivo, we incubated retinal homogenates from transgenic and non-transgenicrds+/+ mice with peptide N-glycosidase F, which cleaves asparagine-linked glycans (30Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the rds D2 and rom1 C-term antisera (Fig.2 A). Both rds and rom/D2 migrated at reduced apparent molecular mass after digestion withN-glycosidase F, whereas the electrophoretic mobility of rom1 was unchanged. Thus, rom/D2 is N-glycosylated in vivo, similar to rds. Retinal homogenates were prepared under non-reducing conditions from transgenic and non-transgenic mice on rds+/+ and rds−/− genetic backgrounds. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents and analyzed by immunoblotting with the rds D2 Ab. Similar to native rds in wild-type mice, most rom/D2 migrated as a dimer (Fig. 2 B). Small amounts of monomer rds and rom/D2 were also detected, possibly representing synthetic intermediates. Next, we attempted to identify the protein species that dimerizes with rom/D2. To test for the formation of rds-rom/D2 covalent dimers, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis on 1% SDS plus 8.0m urea (SDS-urea) homogenates of retina from transgenic and non-transgenic rds+/+ and rds−/− mice, with immobilized rds or rom1 C-term Abs. The rds C-term Ab precipitated rds but not rom1 or rom/D2, whereas the rom1 C-term Ab precipitated both rom1 and rom/D2 but not rds (Fig.3 A). These data rule out the presence of rom/D2-rds covalent heterodimers. To test for rom1-rom/D2 covalent heterodimers, we precipitated SDS-urea homogenates from transgenic and non-transgenic rds+/+ retinas with the rds D2 Ab. The bound fraction plus starting retinal homogenate were analyzed by immunoblotting using the rom1 C-term antiserum for detection (Fig.3 B). Here, the rds D2 Ab precipitated rom/D2 but not rom1, excluding the presence of rom/D2-rom1 covalent heterodimers. Together, these data show that rom/D2 covalently dimerizes with itself but does not form dimers with rds or rom1. We tested the stability of the rds·rom/D2 and rds·rom1 non-covalent interactions by defining the conditions required to dissociate the complexes. SDS and increasing concentrations of urea were added to Triton X-100 homogenates of non-transgenic and transgenic retinas. Samples were diluted 20-fold and immunoprecipitated with the rds C-term Ab followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 C). rom/D2 was present in immunoprecipitates from transgenic retinas after preincubating in 1% SDS plus 2.0 m urea but was absent at higher urea concentrations. In contrast, rom1 immunoreactivity dropped significantly after preincubating in 1% SDS with no added urea and became undetectable at 2.0 m urea. These data indicate that milder dissociating conditions are required to disrupt the rds·rom1 compared with the rds·rom/D2 complex. An alternative explanation is that the D2 loop of rom1 is more susceptible to denaturation than that of rds. The data also suggest that the D2 loop is involved in complex formation. To test further this possibility, we attempted to immunoprecipitate rds from Triton X-100 homogenates of wild-type retinas with the rds D2 Ab after preincubation with or without SDS plus 8 m urea followed by dilution. rds immunoreactivity was detected only after preincubation in SDS-urea (Fig. 3 D). This observation implies that the D2P4 epitope is sterically encumbered in the intact complexes, corroborating the involvement of the D2 loop in these interactions. Although it has been assumed that rds and rom1 are equally abundant, until now it has not been possible to compare their levels directly. Because rom/D2 is recognized by both the rds D2 and rom1 C-term antisera, we used this protein as an internal standard to determine the ratio of rds to rom1 in the same transgenic retinal homogenate. Accordingly, we performed quantitative immunoblot analysis of retinal homogenates from 3-week-old transgenicrds+/+ mice using the rds D2 and rom1 C-term antisera (Fig.4). Homogenates were predigested withN-glycosidase F for better resolution of protein bands. Quantitation of the 125I-labeled protein A signals in five pairs of retinas resulted in a rds-to-rom/D2 ratio of 1.5 (± 0.1 S.D.), a rom1-to-rom/D2 ratio of 0.6 (± 0.1 S.D.), and a calculated rds-to-rom1 ratio of 2.5 (± 0.2 S.D.). The ratios were determined over a 10-fold range in the amounts of added retinal homogenate with virtually identical results. We confirmed complete electrotransfer of rds, rom/D2, and rom1 from the polyacrylamide gel and full retention of these proteins on the Immobilon P-SQ membrane under the conditions employed. To control for the possibility that expression of rom/D2 in transgenic retinas modifies expression of rds and/or rom1, we performed similar quantitative immunoblot analysis on transgenic and non-transgenic retinal homogenates in separate lanes (Fig. 4). Here, rom/D2 served as an external standard. The ratio of rds-to-rom1 was determined to be 3.0 (± 0.4 S.D., n = 5). Finally, we repeated this study in 2-month-old mice to test for age-dependent changes in expression. In this experiment, the ratio of rds-to-rom1 again was 2.5 (± 0.2 S.D., n= 5). To study the stoichiometry of the interaction between rds and rom1, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation from wild-type retinal homogenates with antibodies against rds and rom1. After precipitation, we analyzed both the pellets and supernatants for the presence of rds and rom1 (Fig. 5). As predicted, the antibody against either rds or rom1 efficiently precipitated its cognate protein. The rom1 C-term Ab also precipitated more than 90% of rds. Efficient co-immunoprecipitation of rds and rom1 was reported previously (15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar). Given the 2.5-fold greater abundance of rds over rom1, quantitative precipitation of rds by rom1 implies that these proteins exist in a multimeric complex of higher order than tetramer. As previously reported, we observed profound ultrastructural disorganization of photoreceptor outer segments in retinas from non-transgenic rds+/− heterozygous mutants (10Hawkins R.K. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and complete absence of outer segments in retinas from non-transgenic rds−/− homozygotes (31Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 224: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig.6, B and C). To test further the function of rom/D2 in vivo, we studied the effects of transgene expression on the ultrastructural phenotype inrds mutant mice. In rds+/− heterozygotes, we observed virtually complete rescue of the outer segment disorganization by expression of rom/D2 (Fig. 6, D and E). In contrast, expression of rom/D2 did not affect the phenotype of absent outer segments in rds−/− null mutants (Fig.6 F). This lack of rescue was observed in lines rdm6, rdm1, and rdm4 on rds−/−, indicating that the level of transgene expression was not a determinant. Together, these observations suggest that rom/D2 can only rescue the rds phenotype in the presence of at least a small quantity of normal rds. In this study, we generated transgenic mice that express a chimeric protein comprising rom1 substituted with the large intradiscal D2 loop of rds. The D2 loops of rds and rom/D2 were identical except for a single, conservative amino acid substitution (Arg to Lys) adjacent to membrane-spanning segment M3. We demonstrated that rom/D2 was N-glycosylated, underwent covalent homodimerization, participated in non-covalent complex formation with rds, and effected rescue of the outer segment phenotype in rds+/− mutants. These features suggest that rom/D2 was stable, was correctly processed and efficiently translocated to outer segments, and was functional. We also showed that rds, rom/D2, and rom1 all form covalent homodimers but that mixed dimers between these proteins do not occur (Figs. 2 and 3). We used retinas from mice expressing rom/D2 to make several observations about the function of rds and rom1. The non-covalent interaction between rds and rom/D2 was more stable than the interaction between rds and rom1 in a dissociating titration with increasing concentrations of urea (Fig. 3 C). Because rom/D2 and rom1 differ only in their D2 loop domains, this observation provides the first indication that the non-covalent interaction between rds and rom1 is via their D2 loops. Further evidence to support this conclusion is that rds could only be immunoprecipitated with the rds D2 Ab after dissociation of the complex (Fig. 3 D), implying that the D2P4 epitope is normally sterically blocked. The D2P4 epitope is inside a highly conserved stretch (Fig. 1 B), which may represent an interacting structural element. The D2 loop of rds, but not rom1, is N-glycosylated. However, in a previous study we showed that this modification does not contribute to the function of rds in vivo (21Kedzierski W. Bok D. Travis G.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, non-glycosylated rds interacted normally with rom1 by immunoprecipitation and fully rescued the rds−/− null phenotype. Therefore, the D2-loop structure itself, and not the glycan moiety, is responsible for this interaction. We exploited the shared epitopes and different electrophoretic mobilities of rds, rom/D2, and rom1 to show that rds is 2.5-fold more abundant than rom1. This result was unexpected, given the similarity ofrds and rom1 mRNA-levels by Northern blot analysis and by the isolation frequencies of cDNA clones (15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Nearly identical results were obtained by quantitating both proteins in the same transgenic retinal homogenate and by comparing levels in transgenic and non-transgenic homogenates (Fig. 4), indicating no transcriptional cross-regulation between the transgene and endogenousrds gene. Formally, it is possible that the observed differences in abundance between rds, rom/D2, and rom1 may be due to context-dependent differences in antibody binding. However, because the proteins were analyzed under denaturing conditions and because the D2 and C-term epitopes are both far removed from one another and from the rom1·rds junction-regions in rom/D2, this explanation is unlikely. The currently accepted model for the rds·rom1 complex is a heterotetramer composed of paired covalent homodimers (17Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Goldberg A.F. Loewen J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Kedzierski W. Bok D. Travis G.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This model demands revision on two accounts. First, the 2.5-fold difference in abundance between rds and rom1 requires that rds homodimers interact primarily with themselves. Non-covalent interactions between rds and rom1 must be rare. Second, quantitative co-precipitation of rds and rom1 by the rom1 C-term Ab (Fig. 5, Refs.15Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and 19Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar) requires that both proteins be part of a higher order complex rather than a simple tetramer. The rds·rom1 complex may extend along the entire disc circumference. The distance between luminal faces of the terminal loop in bullfrog outer segments is ∼130 Å (32Corless J.M. Fetter R.D. Costello M.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1987; 257: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a plausible distance to be spanned by paired 130-residue globular domains. The disc rim represents a thermodynamically unfavorable fold in the membrane with a radius of curvature only about twice the thickness of the bilayer (32Corless J.M. Fetter R.D. Costello M.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1987; 257: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because rds and rom1 are situated within this terminal loop, and because discs fail to form without rds despite ongoing outer segment membrane and protein synthesis (6Nir I. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 836-840PubMed Google Scholar, 7Usukura J. Bok D. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. De Grip W.J. Schalken J.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 44: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), rds may serve to stabilize this sharp fold in the disc membrane. Expression of rom/D2 at a level similar to that of endogenous rds resulted in rescue of the outer segment disorganization inrds+/− heterozygotes (Fig. 6). However, up to 4-fold over-expression of rom/D2 had no effect on the ultrastructural phenotype in rds−/− homozygotes. In an earlier study, we completely rescued the rds−/− phenotype by expressing normal rds in transgenic retinas (24Travis G.H. Groshan K.R. Lloyd M. Bok D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because rom/D2 contains the complete D2 loop of rds, these observations suggest that a second domain of rds may be required in trans for its normal function. By definition, this domain must be functionally absent in rom1. Possible functions of this rds domain are: (i) trafficking of the rds complex to outer segment discs, as has been shown for the carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin (33Deretic D. Schmerl S. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); (ii) coupling of the disc rim to the outer segment plasma membrane via direct protein-lipid interactions (34Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or via interactions between rds and the cytoskeleton; or (iii) interactions between rds complexes of adjacent discs to maintain outer segment alignment. In this work, we have identified three characteristics that distinguish rds from rom1. Together, these differences explain the mild phenotype in rom1−/− mutant mice and the paucity of disease-causing mutations in the human ROM1 gene. First, rom1 is significantly rarer than rds. Thus, even if rds and rom1 were functionally equivalent, we would predict a much milder phenotype inrom1−/− null mutants compared with rds−/− mutants. However, this cannot be the whole story. If we assume that rds and rom1 are functionally equivalent and differ only by their abundance, then the rds+/− phenotype is seen in the context of 64% total protein expression and the much milderrom1−/− phenotype (23Clarke G.A. Rossant J.A. McInnes R.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: S962Google Scholar) in the context of 71% total protein expression. It is unlikely that the disparity of phenotypes between these mutants could be explained by a mere 7% difference in total protein expression. The second distinguishing characteristic between rds and rom1 is the difference in stability of their respective non-covalent interactions with rds. Given the apparent weakness of the rom1·rds interaction, loss of rom1 may have little effect upon outer segment structure. Can we then conclude that rom1 has no function in outer segments? Probably not. The reported digenic form of RP in humans, because of a nonsense mutation in ROM1 and a simultaneous mis-sense mutation inRDS (14Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), provides genetic evidence that rom1 plays a role. This clinical observation was corroborated by our analysis of a transgenic model for digenic RP. In mice doubly heterozygous for anrds L185P and rom1 null allele, we saw accelerated photoreceptor degeneration compared with the two “monogenic” controls. 2D. Bok, G. Clarke, W. Kedzierski, R. R. McInness, and G. H. Travis, unpublished observations. Finally, the ability of rom/D2 to rescue the rds+/− but notrds−/− phenotype independent of transgene expression level suggests a second functional domain in rds outside of the D2 loop that is absent from rom1. Thus, we suggest that rds is a bifunctional protein that interacts on both its intradiscal and cytoplasmic surfaces. rom1, on the other hand, may interact only via its intradiscal D2 loop.

In wild type mice, this induction is completely abolished by pretreatment with the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390, and pretreatment with the D2-like receptor antagonist eticlopride reduces the levels of c-fos expressed in response to D1 receptor stimulation. Mice deficient for the dopamine D3 receptor express levels of D1 agonist-stimulated c-fosimmunoreactivity that are lower than c-fos levels of their wild type littermates. Moreover, the acute blockade of D2receptors in D3 mutant mice further reduces c-fos expression levels. These data indicate that the basal activity of both D2 and D3 receptors contributes to D1 agonist-stimulated c-fosresponses. The findings therefore indicate that not only D2but also D3 receptors play a role in dopamine-regulated gene expression. The acute administration of dopamine D1 receptor agonists induces the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos. In wild type mice, this induction is completely abolished by pretreatment with the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390, and pretreatment with the D2-like receptor antagonist eticlopride reduces the levels of c-fos expressed in response to D1 receptor stimulation. Mice deficient for the dopamine D3 receptor express levels of D1 agonist-stimulated c-fosimmunoreactivity that are lower than c-fos levels of their wild type littermates. Moreover, the acute blockade of D2receptors in D3 mutant mice further reduces c-fos expression levels. These data indicate that the basal activity of both D2 and D3 receptors contributes to D1 agonist-stimulated c-fosresponses. The findings therefore indicate that not only D2but also D3 receptors play a role in dopamine-regulated gene expression. An increase in neuronal activity triggers the transcription of immediate early genes, including the proto-oncogene c-fos, which, in turn, stimulates the transcription of AP-1-promotor-containing late response genes that are responsible for adaptive changes in mature neurons (1Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 2Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is well established that the concentration of second messengers and differences in the activation threshold for calcium-dependent signaling are important factors controlling cellular responses to stimulatory signals, including the transcriptional activation of Fos genes (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 4Fields R.D. Eshete F. Stevens B. Itoh K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7252-7266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two key regulators of c-fos transcription are the phosphorylated forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are:MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePnpostnatal dayn and CREB (4Fields R.D. Eshete F. Stevens B. Itoh K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7252-7266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CREB is a Ca2+/cAMP-responsive transcription factor that in its phosphorylated form (pCREB; phosphorylated at Ser133) stimulates transcription of the c-fos gene by interacting with the CRE transcriptional regulatory element (for review see Ref.2Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The MAPK cascade is thought to participate in the activation of c-fos transcription either by phosphorylating CREB at Ser133 or by phosphorylating ternary complex factors that, together with serum response factor, bind to the SRE element of the c-fos promotor (2Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Activation of the MAPK cascade occurs in response to serum or growth factor stimulation (5York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) as well as in response to increased calcium levels via a Ras-dependent pathway (6Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase postnatal dayn Induction of c-fos expression is an important mechanism in the control of neurotransmitter-regulated gene expression. One extensively studied example is the dopamine-regulated expression of Fos (7Hughes P. Dragunow M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 133-178PubMed Google Scholar). In the striatum, for example, induction of c-fosexpression has been shown to occur in response to the acute administration of cocaine and amphetamine (8Graybiel A.M. Moratalla R. Robertson H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6912-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 9Young S.T. Rorrino L.J. Iadarola M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These drugs indirectly activate dopamine receptors, and the Fos responses elicited by them have been linked to the activation of dopamine D1-like receptors, which couple to stimulatory subsets of heterotrimeric proteins to stimulate cytosolic second messengers (14Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Moreover, blockade of dopamine D2-like receptors (which couple to inhibitory G proteins) by neuroleptic drugs results in increased c-fos expression levels. Anatomically, a close topographic relationship exists between c-fos effects and the expression of receptors upon which various typical and atypical neuroleptics act (15Robertson G.S. Fibiger H.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 16Merchant K.M. Dorsa D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Robertson G.S. Matsumura H. Fibiger H.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1058-1066PubMed Google Scholar, 18Merchant K.M. Dobie D.J. Filloux F.M. Totzke M. Aravagiri M. Dorsa D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 460-471PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, if mesotelencephalic dopaminergic neurons are destroyed by 6-hydroxydopamine, neuroleptic drugs no longer increase c-fos expression levels, indicating that dopamine exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on basal c-fos levels via its action on D2-like receptors (15Robertson G.S. Fibiger H.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies further revealed synergistic c-fosresponses to combined D1- and D2-like receptor stimulation in the striatum of normal and dopamine-depleted rats (19Paul M.L. Graybiel A.M. David J.-C. Robertson H.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3729-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Keefe K.A. Gerfen C.R. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Le Moine C. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8038-8048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the topographic overlap between increase in c-fos expression and expression of receptors blocked by various neuroleptic drugs suggest a cellular mechanism that regulates basal c-fos-expression levels, synergistic c-fosresponses to combined D1- and D2-like receptor stimulation are more likely to be regulated at the level of neuronal circuitry. The studies that found synergistic effects of D1- and D2-like receptor activation on c-fos responses (20Keefe K.A. Gerfen C.R. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Le Moine C. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8038-8048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used D2-like agonists that do not discriminate between the D2 and D3 receptor subtypes (for review see Ref. 22Levant B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unresolved whether D2and D3 receptors contribute similarly or differently to the modulation of c-fos responses. However, the current lack of antagonists specific for each member of the D2 class of dopamine receptors complicates attempts to elucidate the role of both receptor subtypes in the modulation of c-fos expression levels. Therefore, the present study used mutant mice generated by gene targeting via homologous recombination that lack D2, D3, and D2/D3 receptors (23Jung M.-Y. Skryabin B.V. Arai M. Abbondanzo S. Fu D. Brosius J. Robakis N.K. Polites H.G. Pintar J.E. Schmauss C. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to test whether the absence of D2 and D3 receptors alters dorsal striatal and extrastriatal c-fos responses to D1 receptor stimulation. The generation of D2, D3, and D2/D3 mutant mice is described elsewhere (23Jung M.-Y. Skryabin B.V. Arai M. Abbondanzo S. Fu D. Brosius J. Robakis N.K. Polites H.G. Pintar J.E. Schmauss C. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For studies that compared c-fos responses to application of the D1 agonist SKF82958 across different mutants, homozygous mutants and wild type littermates were derived from crosses of heterozygous D2 and D3 single mutants with a hybrid 129/Sv × C57Bl/6 genetic background. Heterozygous D2/D3 double mutants were generated via cross-breeding of homozygous D2 males with homozygous D3 females and were subsequently cross-bred to generate wild type and the various genetic combinations of D2/D3 double mutants. For studies that compared c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation between wild type and D3 single mutants, congenic (8th generation of back-crossing) C57Bl/6 D3mutants and their wild type littermates were used. Male animals at postnatal ages P15, P30, P60, and P70 were used in this study. Their genotypes were verified by Southern blotting as described in Jung et al. (23Jung M.-Y. Skryabin B.V. Arai M. Abbondanzo S. Fu D. Brosius J. Robakis N.K. Polites H.G. Pintar J.E. Schmauss C. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle colony room at 22 °C with free access to food and water. The following drugs were administered: 1 mg/kg SKF82958, 1 mg/kg SCH23390, and 0.5 mg/kg eticlopride. All drugs were purchased from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA). Drugs were dissolved in saline and administered intraperitoneally between 2 and 5 p.m. Animals were killed at defined time points after systemic drug administration, and their brains were quickly removed. The dorsal striatum (caudoputamen) was immediately dissected from all brains. This dissection did not include the ventral part of the striatum containing the nucleus accumbens. The dorsal striatal tissue and the remaining brain tissue were collected in separate tubes and stored at −80 °C until use. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For immunoblot analyses (c-fos, pMAPK, and pCREB), proteins were extracted in a buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS (RIPA buffer) supplemented with 2 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm microcystin, and protease inhibitors. The protein concentration in each lysate was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). c-fos immunoreactivity was detected with two different rabbit polyclonal anti-c-fos antibodies. One antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA; lot number H067) and used at a dilution of 1:1000. The other antibody (dilution, 1:2,500 to 1:5000) was obtained from Oncogene Research (San Diego, CA; lot number D08330). A sheep polyclonal anti-phospho MAPK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-pCREB antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:2,500. A mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (Incstar, Stillwater, MN; dilution, 1:10,000) was used to reprobe all immunoblots. Bound antigen was visualized using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) in conjunction with ECL (Pierce). The ECL signals on autoradiograms were assessed densitometrically using the National Institutes of Health Image Analysis Software. Optical density measurements of standards on the film were made to construct a standard correlation curve. Relative optical densities were determined for optical densities of signals located in equal size sample areas. To test whether mice lacking dopamine D2, D3, and D2/D3 receptors maintain the wild type specificity between stimulation of D1receptors and transcription of the c-fos gene, mice were treated with the full D1 agonist SKF82958 (1 mg/kg intraperitoneal), a ligand known to stimulate c-fosexpression in rat striatum (21Le Moine C. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8038-8048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang J.Q. McGinty J.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A first series of experiments performed on wild type animals determined the time course of c-fos induction and tested whether D1- and D2-like receptor antagonists block or reduce this induction. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the earliest time point at which a robust induction of expression of c-fos can be detected on Western blots is 60 min after the systemic application of the drug. In general, however, the onset of detectable c-fos expression varies between 60 and 90 min, a variability that is most likely accounted for by the route of drug administration (i.e. intraperitoneal). c-fosimmunoreactivity remains detectable up to 120 min after drug administration and then returns to base-line levels (not shown). In addition to the induction of c-fos expression, SKF82958 administration also leads to phosphorylation of the MAPK. The kinetics of MAPK phosphorylation is more rapid and increased levels of pMAPK immunoreactivity are detected 20 min after drug administration (Fig.1 A). The expression levels of pMAPK return to base line 30–45 min after drug administration (not shown). Interestingly, although the anti-pMAPK antibody recognizes the phosphorylated pMAPK isoforms ERK 1 and ERK 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), only the 42-kDa protein pERK 2 was detected following SKF treatment. SKF-induced c-fos responses are completely abolished when mice are pretreated with the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390 (1 mg/kg intraperitoneal). The results of duplicate experiments with dorsal striatal and extrastriatal tissues of mice are shown in Fig. 1 B. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.1 C, pretreatment of mice with the D2-like antagonist eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) reduces c-fos responses to SKF stimulation, an effect that is most apparent in the dorsal striatum and that is further examined below. The next series of experiments analyzed the expression of c-fos immunoreactivity 60 and 90 min after SKF-82958 (1 mg/kg) application in the dorsal striatum and brain without dorsal striatum tissues of mutant mice lacking D2, D3, and D2/D3 receptors. These experiments were performed on mice with a hybrid C57Bl/6 × 129Sv genetic background (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the results are shown in Fig. 2. In both striatal and extrastriatal tissues of mice at P30, the most striking difference in the levels of c-fos immunoreactivity is seen in D3 single mutants, which express lower levels compared with wild type, D2 single mutants, and D2/D3 double mutants. In Fig. 2 A, other differences include an earlier induction of c-fosexpression in D2 single mutants and a slightly stronger induction in D2/D3 double mutants, but these differences are no longer apparent in mice at P60. A representative example of c-fos levels expressed in extrastriatal tissues of P60 mice is shown in Fig. 2 B. Similar to results obtained with P30 mice, c-fos levels of D3 single mutants are decreased when compared with wild type, D2 single mutants, and D2/D3 mutants. The optical density of signals measured 60 and 90 min following drug administration is 5.17 for wild type and 1.98 for D3 single mutants and indicate a 62% decrease in c-fos responses in the mutant animals. Optical density measurements of corresponding signals obtained from D2 single mutants (optical density, 3.51) and D2/D3 double mutants (optical density, 3.01) also indicate a reduction of c-fos expression. However, this reduction (32% in D2 single mutants and 42% in the double mutants) is substantially less than the reduction seen in D3 single mutants. Furthermore, c-fos levels expressed in the dorsal striatum of both D2 and D2/D3 mutants are reduced by only 20% (not shown). When SKF82958 was administered to mice at P15, only a marginal (and barely detectable) c-fos response was detected in all animals, regardless of their genotype. A representative example of c-fos responses in the striatum of these mice is shown in Fig. 2 C. Thus, a robust c-fos expression in response to D1 agonist stimulation occurs only at most advanced postnatal ages. In fact, the differences in c-fosresponses of P30 and P60 mice suggest that the maturity of c-fos responses correlates with the maturity of the animal. Despite of the differences in c-fos responses seen in D2 and D2/D3 mutants at P30 and P60, c-fos levels of D3 single mutants are consistently lower at both postnatal ages. To test whether possible differences in the genetic background could have accounted for the lower c-fos responses to SKF82958 in brains of D3 single mutants, additional experiments were performed with congenic (C57Bl/6) D3 mutants and their wild type littermates. As shown in Fig. 3, also congenic D3 mutants showed a substantial reduction in the levels of c-fos expressed following SKF treatment. Fig.3 A shows a representative example of a Western blot of proteins extracted from brain (without striatum) tissue that was probed with the same antibody used to probe the blots shown in Fig. 2 (a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-fos antibody; Santa Cruz). Identical results were obtained when the blot was probed with another polyclonal anti-c-fos antibody (Oncogene Research) (Fig.3 B). This antibody, like the first antibody, recognizes an epitope located within peptide sequences that constitute the amino terminus of the c-fos protein. Unlike the first antibody, however, the second antibody does not recognize other nonspecific protein bands (like the one migrating above the c-fos band in Fig. 2). In fact, it recognizes exclusively one major c-fos protein of 55 kDa and a second protein of 57 kDa that is known to result from posttranslational modifications of the 55-kDa c-fos protein (25Curran T. Bravo R. Muller R. Cancer Surveys. 1985; 4: 655-681PubMed Google Scholar). A densitometric analysis of signals shown in Fig. 3 B revealed an optical density of 2.95 for the entire field containing c-fos signals of wild type animals 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after SKF treatment. The optical density for an equal size field containing corresponding signals of D3mutants is only 1.68, indicating a 57% reduction in c-fosexpression levels. Thus, the results obtained with congenic D3 mutants are very similar to the results obtained with hybrid (129Sv × C57Bl/6) D3 mutant mice (Fig.2 B). Moreover, Fig. 3 C illustrates that, similar to the results shown in Fig. 2 A, congenic D3mutants also express lower levels of dorsal striatal c-fosimmunoreactivity in response to D1 agonist stimulation. Optical density measurements of these signals (wild type, 4.84; D3 mutants, 1.42) revealed a 70% reduction of c-fos levels in D3 mutants. The next experiments tested whether the D2-like antagonist eticlopride would further affect the D1 agonist-stimulated c-fos response of D3 mutants. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. As expected, in both extrastriatal and striatal tissue, administration of eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg) alone does not lead to detectable c-fosexpression levels. It should be noted that in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, the c-fos responses of mice treated with SKF alone are low at 60 min and robust at 90 min after drug administration, whereas c-fos responses of mice treated with eticlopride and SKF are clearly detectable at both time points. As outlined above, the onset of detectable c-fos expression following the systemic administration of SKF varies between 60 and 90 min. This variability in the kinetics of c-fos induction necessitates that c-fos levels are measured at 60 and 90 min after drug administration so that the sums of optical densities of both time points can be compared. In Fig. 4 A, results of duplicate experiments on extrastriatal tissues of mice treated with SKF and eticlopride and mice treated with SKF alone are compared. The optical density of the 60- and 90-min signals obtained from SKF-treated animals is 7.74. By comparison, the mean optical density of the 60- and 90-min c-fos signals of animals treated with SKF and eticlopride is 4.43. Thus, a 43% reduction of c-fos expression levels is found in mice pretreated with eticlopride. Similar results are obtained for the dorsal striatum (Fig. 4 B). The optical density of c-fos signals following SKF treatment alone (2.51) is 20% higher than the corresponding optical density of c-fossignals following SKF and eticlopride treatment (2.01). It is further noted that in contrast to mice treated with SKF alone, striatal tissues of mice treated with SKF and eticlopride express similar levels of the 55- and 57-kDa c-fos proteins (see Figs. 1 C and4 B). The reason for this expression pattern is presently unclear. Finally, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390 completely abolishes the c-fos response to SKF82958 administration in D3single mutants (see also Fig. 1 B). In summary, the results shown above indicate that D3 single mutants express lower levels of c-fos in response to SKF treatment alone and that the D2-like antagonist eticlopride further reduces this response. These results are consistent with the results obtained with wild type mice (Fig. 1 C), and they suggest that the basal activity of both D2 and D3 receptors is required for the expression of maximum levels of c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation. It is therefore very surprising that compared with D3 single mutants, the c-fos responses of D2/D3 double mutants are reduced to a substantially lesser extent. In fact, given that c-fosresponses are also reduced in D2 single mutants (albeit to a much lesser extent compared with D3 single mutants), one would expect that D2/D3 double mutants express the lowest levels of c-fos in response to D1agonist stimulation. Results of two additional experiments, however, suggest that mice lacking D2 and D2/D3 receptors develop compensatory mechanisms that enable them to express higher levels of c-fos in response to D1 receptor stimulation. First, as shown in Fig. 5 A, it is obvious at a glance that double-mutant mice that are homozygous for the D3 mutation and heterozygous for the D2mutation (D3−/−;D2+/−; labeledD2+/− in Fig. 5 A) express drastically reduced levels of c-fos compared with mice that are either heterozygous for the D3 mutation and homozygous for the D2 mutation (D3+/−;D2−/−; labeled D3+/− in Fig. 5 A) or homozygous for both mutations (D3−/−;D2−/−; labeledMD−/− in Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that on a D3 mutant genetic background, c-fos levels are reduced substantially when only one intact D2-encoded allele is lacking. Second, as shown in Fig. 5 B, c-fos responses of homozygous D2 single mutants are unaffected by eticlopride, an antagonist with high affinity for both D2 and D3 receptors (22Levant B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that adaptive mechanisms involving systems other then the dopaminergic system also operate in brains of D2 single mutants. It has previously been shown that differences in MAPK activity and CREB phosphorylation are critical in regulating c-fos expression (4Fields R.D. Eshete F. Stevens B. Itoh K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7252-7266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following experiments therefore tested whether the expression of these two key transcriptional regulators is affected by the lack of D3 and/or D2 receptors. Immunoblotting experiments were performed with pCREB- and pMAPK-specific antibodies to test whether the levels of pCREB and pMAPK differ between wild type and the various mutants that received SKF82958 treatment (1 mg/kg). These experiments were done with C57Bl/6 × 129Sv hybrid mice. As shown in Fig. 6, SKF administration led to the expression of similar levels of pCREB and pMAPK in wild type, D2 and D3 single mutants, and D2/D3 double mutants. The slightly lower level of pCREB immunoreactivity shown in Fig. 6 for D3mutants could not be verified with additional pCREB immunoprecipitation experiments (not shown). Thus, the results indicate that differences in the expression levels of pCREB and pMAPK do not account for the differences seen in the c-fos responses described above. The present study revealed a blunted c-fos response to D1 agonist stimulation in mice lacking the dopamine D3 receptor. In both wild type and D3 mutants, c-fos responses to stimulation with the full D1 agonist SKF82958 could be completely abolished by pretreatment with the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390. Furthermore, in both wild type and D3mutant mice, pretreatment with the D2-like antagonist eticlopride reduced the magnitude of c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation. These results indicate that although the induction of c-fos responses is dependent on D1 receptor stimulation (26Moratalla R. Xu M. Tonegawa S. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14928-14933Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), maximum c-fosresponses require a steady-state activity of bothD2 and D3 receptors. The reduced c-fos response to D1 agonist stimulation in D3 mutants and the further reduction of c-fosexpression levels following blockade of D2 receptors in these mutants indicate cooperativity between D1, D2, and D3 receptors in the modulation of c-fos responses to D1 receptor stimulation. Differences in c-fos responses between wild type and D3 mutants were found in mice with a hybrid C57Bl/6 × 129Sv genetic background as well as in congenic C57Bl/6 mice. Thus, it is unlikely that differences in the genetic background contributed to the reduced c-fos expression found in SKF-treated D3 mutants. Furthermore, the observed differences in c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation cannot be explained by differences in D1 receptor expression levels in D3 mutants. Previous studies (27Accili D. Fishburn C.S. Drago J. Steiner H. Lachowicz J.E. Park B.-H. Gauda E.B. Lee E.J. Cool M.H. Sibley D.R. Gerfen C.R. Westphal H. Fuchs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), as well as our own unpublished results, have shown that the expression of D1 receptor ligand-binding sites is unaltered in these mutants. It is also unlikely that the D1-selective agonist used in the present study exerts its effects on c-fos induction not only via D1 but also via D2 receptors. SKF82958 has recently been reported to act as a D2-like autoreceptor agonist to inhibit the basal firing rate of midbrain dopaminergic units (29Ruskin D.N. Rawji S.S. Walters J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 272-281PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in the present study, c-fosresponses elicited by SKF82598 are completely abolished by pretreatment with the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390. Moreover, if c-fos responses were modulated by an agonist action of this drug at D2-like autoreceptors, the autoreceptor effect would be inhibitory and, in contrast to our results, pretreatment with eticlopride should have increased c-fos responses. In addition, studies on mutant mice have now shown clearly that autoreceptor functions are mediated by D2 but not D3 receptors (30Mercuri N.B. Saiardi A. Bonci A. Picetti R. Calabresi P. Bernadi G.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-fos responses of D3 single mutants (in which D2 receptors remain expressed), however, are also reduced by eticlopride. Altogether, these results are inconsistent with a possible agonist action of SKF82958 at D2 autoreceptors to modulate c-fosresponses. The present study demonstrates a similar role for D2 and D3 receptors in the potentiation of c-fosresponses to D1 agonist stimulation. Our results resemble results of previous pharmacological studies that found synergistic effects of concurrent D1- and D2-like receptor stimulation on c-fos responses in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals (20Keefe K.A. Gerfen C.R. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Le Moine C. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8038-8048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D2-like agonists quinpirole and quinelorane used in these studies, however, have high affinities for both D2 and D3receptors (22Levant B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it remained unclear whether both D2and D3 receptors participate in this synergism. The present study, however, employed D3 mutant mice that were treated either with a D1 agonist alone or a combination of the D1 agonist and a D2-like receptor antagonist. The results revealed not only a cooperative involvement of both D2 and D3 receptors in the modulation of D1 agonist-stimulated c-fos responses, they also illustrate that the basal activity of D2 and D3receptors (i.e. activity in the absence of exogenous agonist) is sufficient to mediate this synergistic effect. Studies on D3 mutant mice revealed a role for both D2 and D3 receptors in enhancing c-fos responses to D1 receptor stimulation. However, the minimal reduction of c-fos expression levels observed in D2/D3 mutants does not reflect the magnitude of the combined contribution of D2 and D3receptors to the modulation of D1 agonist-stimulated c-fos responses. In fact, c-fos levels of double mutants are substantially higher than those seen in D3single mutants. It is therefore possible that D2/D3 double mutants have developed compensatory mechanisms that enable them to maintain relatively high (but still subnormal) c-fos responses to D1agonist stimulation, processes that, at least to some extent, are also likely to operate in brains of D2 single mutants. Three observations support this possibility: First, D2+/−;D3−/− double mutants express substantially lower levels of c-fos in response to D1 agonist stimulation compared with homozygous double mutants (D2−/−;D3−/−). This result is consistent with the cooperative role of D2 receptors in the induction of c-fos responses (i.e. the reduced expression of D2 receptors leads to reduced cooperativity) and suggests further that the much lesser reduction of c-fosresponses of homozygous D2 single mutants results from compensatory adaptations that developed in mice with a homozygous and not a heterozygous D2 mutant genotype. Second, in contrast to wild type and D3 single mutants, c-fosresponses to SKF treatment of homozygous D2 mutants are not affected by pretreatment with the D2-like antagonist eticlopride. Because eticlopride has a high affinity for both D2 and D3 receptors (22Levant B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar), it should have blocked the effect mediated by D3 receptors. The inability of eticlopride to alter c-fos responses of D2mutants suggests that compensatory mechanisms involve systems other than the dopaminergic receptor system. Such systems could, for example, involve the adenosine A2A receptor, which has been shown to modulate c-fos responses to D1 receptor stimulation (21Le Moine C. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8038-8048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, as shown in Fig. 2 A, c-fos responses of D2/D3 double mutants at P30 but not at P60 are higher than corresponding wild type responses. This may indicate that, at P30, the “fine tuning” of developing compensatory mechanisms is not yet completed. Adaptive changes are known to occur during the development of mice generated with constitutive knockout techniques, and they can be a serious complication for the interpretation of mutant phenotypes. It is perhaps not surprising that D2/D3 and possibly also D2 mutants (but not D3 mutants) develop adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the loss of the receptor(s). D2 receptors are far more abundant than D3receptors (14Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), and their absence is likely to have more serious consequences for the normal functioning of the brain. Indeed, a comparison of the motor phenotypes of all three mutants revealed that mice lacking D2 receptors are more severely impaired than mice lacking D3 receptors and that D2/D3 double mutants are most severely impaired (23Jung M.-Y. Skryabin B.V. Arai M. Abbondanzo S. Fu D. Brosius J. Robakis N.K. Polites H.G. Pintar J.E. Schmauss C. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other adaptations have already been described for D2 single mutants that include, for example, alterations in the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA, whose encoded protein is involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid (32Baik J.-H. Picetti R. Dalardi A. Thirlet G. Dierich A. Depaulis A. Le Meur M. Borelli E. Nature. 1995; 377: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Regardless of the nature of adaptations that result in relatively high c-fos responses in mice lacking D2 receptors, our results suggest that these adaptations obscure the interpretation of the magnitude of effect mediated by D2 receptors in the complex interaction between D1, D2, and D3 receptors to modulate c-fos responses. Synergistic or cooperative effects of D1- and D2-like receptor stimulation have not only been observed for the induction of c-fosexpression, they have also been observed in electrophysiological and behavioral experiments. For example, the co-administration of D1- and D2-like agonists results in a synergistic inhibition of spontaneous and glutamate-evoked firing (33White F.J. Hu X.-T. Waddington J.L. Dopamine Receptor Interactions. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 79-114Google Scholar). Furthermore, in dopamine-depleted animals, unconditional behavioral responses to psychostimulants (increased locomotor activity, sniffing, licking, and biting) have been shown to require stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptors (34Waddington J.L. Daly S.A. Waddington J.L. Dopamine Receptor Interactions. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 51-78Google Scholar). However, it is not yet established whether the apparent cooperative interaction between D1, D2, and D3 receptors result from interactions at the cellular level or whether they involve intercellular pathways. For the striatum, for example, anatomic studies suggest a predominant expression of D1 receptors in neurons of the striatonigral pathway, whereas D2 receptors are expressed in neurons of the striatopallidal pathway (35Gerfen C. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). This different cellular distribution would imply that anintercellular interaction between different pathways underlies the D1/D2 receptor synergism, pathways that may modulate the tonic inhibitory influence of enkephalin and/or γ-amino butyric acid released from local axon collaterals of D1-containing striatonigral neurons and/or alter the activity of striatal interneurons. However, recent single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments detected an extensive co-localization of D1- and D2-like receptor-encoded mRNA in medium spiny neurons of the striatonigral pathway (36Surmeier D.J. Song W.-J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports (37Sokoloff P. Giros B. Martres M.-P. Bouthenet M.-L. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1990; 347: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 38Bouthenet M.-L. Souil E. Martres M.-P. Sokoloff P. Giros B. Schwartz J.-C. Brain Res. 1991; 564: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), results of our studies on the expression of D3 receptor protein (detected with D3-specific monoclonal antibodies) and D3-encoded mRNA revealed a significant amount of D3 receptor expression in the dorsal striatum (23Jung M.-Y. Skryabin B.V. Arai M. Abbondanzo S. Fu D. Brosius J. Robakis N.K. Polites H.G. Pintar J.E. Schmauss C. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Nimchinsky E.A.

In addition, imunocytochemical studies on rodent brain tissues identified a high number of D3-immunoreactive neurons that possibly represent medium spiny cells and many (but not all) large interneurons. 2E. A. Nimchinsky, P. R. Hof, W. G. M. Janssen, C. Schmauss, and J. H. Morrison, unpublished observation. Results of single-cell polymerase chain reaction studies further revealed that ∼50% of the substance P/D1 receptor-expressing neurons also expressed D3 and D4 receptor mRNA, and results of electrophysiological studies suggest that ∼50% of all medium-spiny projection neurons co-express functional D1- and D2-like receptors (36Surmeier D.J. Song W.-J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings give weight to the possibility that a cellular mechanism underlies the modulatory effects of D2 and D3 receptors. However, it should be noted that the effects of D2 and D3receptor expression on c-fos responses to D1agonist stimulation are not restricted to the dorsal striatum as previously suggested (20Keefe K.A. Gerfen C.R. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We found that it also operates in extrastriatal brain regions. Because the extrastriatal tissues that we analyzed comprised the entire brain (without dorsal striatum), we can only suggest that the c-fos immunoreactivity detected therein is derived mainly from anatomic regions representing the mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic projection areas that express D1, D2, and D3 receptors. For these anatomic structures, however, evidence for co-localization of all three receptors is still lacking. Despite the present uncertainty regarding the contribution of cellular or intercellular mechanisms, determining the point at which D1, D2, and D3 receptor-mediated signals converge to regulate the transcriptional activity of the c-fos gene will be an important next step toward understanding the mechanism of dopaminergic regulation of c-fos expression. Our finding that the expression of two key regulators of c-fos transcription, pCREB and pMAPK, is not significantly altered in D1 agonist-treated mice that lack either D2 or D3 receptors suggests that the activity of other components of the signaling/transcriptional activator cascade is modulated by D2 and D3 receptors and that these components are most likely operating downstream of CREB and MAPK activation. Although D3receptors were identified by molecular cloning almost a decade ago, it has proven difficult to elucidate the function of these receptors with conventional pharmacological studies (22Levant B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, a behavioral study on D3 mutant mice showed that one role of D3 receptors is to diminish the normal cooperative effects of D1 and D2 receptor stimulation in the regulation of motor activity and responses to the rewarding properties of psychostimulants (28Xu M. Koeltzow T.E. Santiago G.T. Moratalla R. Cooper D.C. Hu X.-T. White N.M. Graybiel A.M. White F.J. Tonegawa S. Neuron. 1997; 19: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The present study identified another role, namely a cooperative participation of D3 receptors in the regulation of c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation. The finding that D3 receptors play a role in dopamine-regulated gene expression adds an important new aspect to our understanding of D3 receptor expression and function."

It was considered that the best targets were those that included the N↓GUC sequence surrounding the cleavage site. In contrast to previous studies that failed to evaluate all possible combinations of these nucleotides, we have performed an exhaustive analysis of the cleavage of 64 substrate variants. They represent all possible sequence combinations of the J2/1 nucleotides except the well established G+1. No cleavage was observed with 24 sequences. C+2 variants showed little or no cleavage, whereas U+2 substrates were all cleavable. The maximal cleavage rate was obtained with the AGUC substrate. Cleavage rates of sequences HGUC (H = A, C, or U), GGUN, GGGR (R = A or G), AGUU, and UGUA were up to 5 times lower than the AGUC one. This shows that other sequences besides NGUC could also be considered as good targets. A second group of sequences WGGG (W = A or U), UGUK (K = G or U), MGAG (M = A or C), AGUA, and UGGA were cleaved between 6 and 10 times less efficiently. Furthermore, the UGCU sequence of a noncleavable viral target was mutated to AGUC resulting in a proficiently cleavable substrate by its cognate hairpin ribozyme. This indicates that our conclusions may be extrapolated to other hairpin ribozymes with different specificity.

This indicates that our conclusions may be extrapolated to other hairpin ribozymes with different specificity. The hairpin ribozyme belongs to the group of smalltrans-acting catalytic RNAs. They are considered promising candidates for the development of specific tools for RNA inactivation. Numerous studies aimed at the inactivation of targeted RNAs by the hairpin ribozyme have been carried out with varying success. Among other factors, the extension of cleavage of selected targets would be affected by the sequence at the region containing the cleavage site within the substrate (J2/1 in Fig. 1).

Although in vitro selection strategies allow the analysis of a large number of sequences, the authors did not evaluate every possible sequence combination. Indeed, we have observed that substrate sequences following this consensus are not cleavable by the hairpin ribozyme. 2M. Pérez-Ruiz and A. Berzal-Herranz, unpublished data. 2M. Pérez-Ruiz and A. Berzal-Herranz, unpublished data. Similarly, Hampel and co-workers (2Anderson P. Monforte J. Tritz R. Nesbitt S. Hearst J. Hampel A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) defined the N↓GUC consensus as the optimal sequence for trans-cleavage by the hairpin ribozyme. However, sequence restrictions for these nucleotides surrounding the cleavage site were mostly determined by the effect of individual mutations. Therefore, although each consensus defined could be acceptable, it might lead to an under or overestimation of the proficiency of certain sequences to be used as substrates for the hairpin ribozyme. In this work we wanted to investigate the substrate sequence requirements at the J2/1 region to redefine sequence specificity of the hairpin ribozyme. Our results show that other sequences different from NGUC are also efficiently cleaved by the ribozyme. In addition, sequences fitting the established consensus (1Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) cannot be used as substrates for the hairpin catalytic motif. These results are of great importance in targeting RNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of DNA Templates and RNA SynthesisOligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman Instruments), purified by electrophoresis on a 10–15% 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, excised out, and eluted overnight at 37 °C in 500 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. RNAs were recovered by sequential extraction with phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol precipitated in 0.3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Partially degenerate oligonucleotide for the synthesis of 64 substrate variants (GAGGA TCCTT TAAAC AGNNC NGTCA CGCTA TAGTG AGTCG TATTA GAATT CTC; mutJ2/1) was converted to double-stranded DNA after annealing to E-T7 (GAGAA TTCTA ATACG ACTCA CTATA) and was cloned into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pUC19 to generate the pT7-MUTJ2/1 plasmid series. Transcription of each of the 64DraI-digested pT7-MUTJ2/1 plasmids yielded the corresponding 17-nt-long RNA substrate variant, carrying an extra GCG sequence at the 5′-end.Oligonucleotides RzWT (TACCA GGTAA TATAC CACAA CGTGT GTTTC TCTGG TTGAC TTCTC TGTTT CCCTA TAGTG AGTCG TATTA) and Rz-TAR (TACCA GGTAA TGTAC CACAA CGTGT GTTTC TCTGG TCCAC TTCTT AAGCC CTATA GTGAG TCGTA TTA) were used as templates for the synthesis of wild-type and TAR ribozymes, respectively, prior to annealing to T7p (TAATA CGACT CACTA TA). Similarly, UGCU-TAR (GGCTT AAGCA GTGGG TTCCC TATAG TGAGT CGTAT TTA) and AGUC-TAR (GGCTT AGACT GTGGC GCTAT AGTGA GTCGT ATTA) were used to obtain short UGUC-TAR (17 nt) and AGUC-TAR (14 nt) RNA substrates, respectively. Long UGCU-TAR substrate was obtained by transcription of the BamHI-digested pG3TAR (3Pérez-Ruiz M. Sievers D. Garcı́a-López P.A. Berzal-Herranz A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 9: 33-42Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). pG3TAR was polymerase chain reaction-amplified to generate the DNA template for the synthesis of long AGUC-TAR substrate. Sense and antisense primers for the polymerase chain reaction were T7p and 3′-TAR (GCTAA GCTTA TTGAG GCTTA GACTG TGGGT TCCCT AGTTA), respectively. Synthesis and purification of RNAs were as described in Ref. 3Pérez-Ruiz M. Sievers D. Garcı́a-López P.A. Berzal-Herranz A.

Ribozyme and substrate RNAs were separately denatured at 95 °C for 2 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 12 mmMgCl2 and renatured at 4 °C for 15 min and 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were initiated by mixing ribozyme and substrate solutions. Preincubation and reaction steps were carried out in a GeneAmp®PCR System (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Reactions were followed over a time course of 60 min at 37 °C. Twelve aliquots of 5 μl were removed during the reaction and were quenched with an equal volume of formamide loading buffer. At least three independent experiments were carried out for each substrate variant. RNAs were loaded on 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and reaction products were quantified using a β-scan radioanalytic imaging instrument (InstantImager, Packard Instrument Co.). Data were fitted by nonlinear regression to a single exponential equation (Sigmaplot 4.0 software).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious studies aimed at evaluating the influence of the substrate J2/1 sequence in the catalytic activity of the hairpin ribozyme did not cover all possible variants. We performed an exhaustive analysis of the ability of the hairpin ribozyme to cleave 64 of 216 possible sequence combinations of the four nucleotides surrounding the cleavage site (Fig. 1). In this study, position +1 was fixed to a guanosine residue, as it has been shown to be essential for catalytic activity (4Chowrira B.M. Berzal-Herranz A. Burke J.M. Nature. 1991; 354: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Substrate variants were synthesized from the DraI-digested pT7-MUTJ2/1 plasmid series and assayed against the in vitro synthesizedtrans-cleaving hairpin ribozyme corresponding to the 50-nt-long sequence of the (-)sTRSV catalytic motif (Fig. 1) (6Feldstein P.A.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4929-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Cleavage RatesPre-steady-state kinetics were carried out, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to determine and compare the ability of the hairpin ribozyme to cleave each substrate variant. The percentage of cleavage as a function of time was fitted by nonlinear regression to a single exponential equation as follows (Sigmaplot 4.0 software; Fig. 2 shows two examples). y=y0+a(1−exp−bx)Eq. 1 Where y is the fraction cleaved, a is the amplitude, x is the time, and b is the reaction rate constant (min−1).Figure 2Cleavage assays.

Under our conditions we did not observe cleavage at other phosphodiester linkage than the one between nucleotides +1 and −1 (Fig. 1) in any of the substrates assayed. Substrate variant carrying the sequence AGUC in loop J2/1, which corresponds to the sequence in (-)sTRSV (wild-type in this work) showed the highest cleavage rate (shown by an asterisk in Fig. 3). The catalytic activity of the hairpin ribozyme against the other substrate variants was compared with the cleavage rate of the wild-type one. Kinetic parameters obtained for other substrate variants indicated that other sequences besides AGUC could also be considered as good targets fortrans-cleavage (Fig. 3). In addition, it is worth noting that all U+2 sequences were cleavable. Here we discuss only those substrates processed by the hairpin ribozyme with cleavage rates up to 10 times lower than the wild-type one. This group comprises 19 different sequences, and in general, cleavage of these substrates also reached high amplitude values. These variants have been further classified into two subgroups; variants HGUC (H = A, C, or U), GGUN (N = any nucleotide), GGGR (R = A or G), AGUU, and UGUA with a rate ranging from 1 to 5 times lower than the wild-type substrate fall within the first subgroup (shown on a black background in Fig. 3). Amplitude values ranged from 0.75 to 1, except in the case of substrates with GGUC and UGUA sequences whose amplitudes were 0.49 and 0.34, respectively. The second subgroup consists of substrate variants WGGG (W = A or U) with amplitude values of 0.87 and 0.85; UGUK (K = G or U) with amplitudes of 0.75 and 0.83; MGAG (M = A or C) with amplitudes of 0.62 and 0.53; and AGUA and UGGA with amplitude values of 0.43 and 0.38, respectively (shown on a gray background in Fig. 3). These variants were all cleaved with rates between 5 and 10 times lower than the AGUC substrate.Figure 3Cleavable substrates. Theleft side of the figure shows the kinetic parameters for the cleavage reaction. A graphical display of the data is also shown on theright. Cleavage rates have been normalized to the maximum value for the graphical representation. Sequences shown on ablack background correspond to the ones cleaved between 1 and 5 times less efficiently than the wild type, which is indicated with an asterisk. Sequences shown on a gray background correspond to the ones cleaved between 5 and 10 times less. Data included in the figure for each parameter represent the average of at least three independent experiments ± S.D. Ther 2 determination of goodness of fit exceeded 0.99 in all cases except for five substrate variants in which it was 0.985. The standard error for the fitted parameters was less than 10%. Interexperimental error was within 20%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As it has been shown that the best theoretical cleavage sites are not always accessible to ribozymes in complex molecular contexts (full-length RNAs) (8Yu Q. Pecchia D.B. Kingsley S.L. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it would be of great interest to have at our disposal alternative sequences for targeting purposes. We can conclude from our work that, besides the AGUC (or wild-type) sequence, variants fitting the NGUC consensus can be efficiently cleaved by the (-) sTRSV hairpin ribozyme. In addition, we have identified some more variants that were cleaved with comparable rates to the previous ones, and therefore they should be considered for in vivo targeting of mRNAs as well. Indeed, variants GGUU and UGUA were cleaved with higher rates than CGUC or GGUC, but they have been systematically excluded in the search for targeting sites (9Hampel A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Noncleavable SubstratesWe failed to detect any cleavage products in 24 sequences after 1 h of reaction (TableI). Those substrate variants have been excluded from Fig. 3. Some general rules for sequence requirements can also be extrapolated from the noncleavable substrate variants. It was remarkable that sequences containing a C+2 showed little or no cleavage. In general, no detectable cleavage products were seen for substrates containing NGCN (Table I). AGCA, AGCC, and UGCC sequences constituted exceptions and showed cleavage products, though their cleavage rates were between 20 and 27-fold lower than for the wild-type substrate, and the maximal extent of cleavage ranged between 0.18 and 0.25 (Fig. 3). Other noncleavable substrates were UGAN, CGAW, NGGU, and CGGC (Table I). Interestingly, under our experimental conditions, sequences completely compatible with the established consensus (1Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were noncleavable (e.g. CGAU or UGAN).Table INoncleavable substratesPosition −1Position +2Position +3ACGUAACAGCGGAGCUAGGUUCCGAACGCAACGCCCGGCCCGCGGCGAUCGCUCGGUUGGGCAAGGCCCGGCGGGGCUGGGUUUUGAAUGCAAUGACCUGAGUGCGGUGAUUGCUUGGUU Open table in a new tab Extent of CleavageThe analyses presented here also provided information about the maximal extent of cleavage of each substrate variant. This feature is described by the amplitude of the reaction. The final cleavage percentage is highly variable (from 0.14 to 1.0; Fig. 3). Low amplitudes (<0.40) usually correspond to rather poor cleavage rates, whereas the highest cleavage rates exhibited high amplitudes as well. The UGUA sequence constitutes the only exception, because it is cleaved with one of the highest rates (0.502),but the amplitude is only about 0.34 (Fig. 3). A common consensus for the 12 sequences with lower amplitudes (<0.40) cannot be extrapolated. However, it is important to point out two conclusions. First, this group does not include sequences with U at position +2 with the only exception of the previously mentioned UGUA variant. Second, the four GGAN sequences belong to this group with amplitudes ranging from 0.14 to 0.38.All the experiments were performed under single-turnover conditions, so it is very unlikely that substrate intermolecular associations could be the reason for the wide amplitude variability. On the other hand, after a careful sequence analysis, we can affirm that intramolecular structures (like hairpins) are not limiting the availability of substrate. Therefore, as all sequences share identical helix 1 and helix 2 regions (Fig. 1), all variants should have similar intrinsic capability of binding to the ribozyme. It has been proposed that the fraction of substrate that cannot be cleaved could be trapped into a nonactive conformation of the ribozyme-substrate complex (10Esteban J.A. Banerjee A.R. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13629-13639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The final extent of cleavage would depend on the magnitude of the misfolded subpopulation. It is clear then, that the J2/1 region is somehow participating in the correct folding of the complex. Although some work has been carried out to elucidate this matter, the role of these nucleotides in the three-dimensional structure of the substrate-ribozyme complex still remains unclear (11Earnshaw D.J. Masquida B. Müller S. Sigurdsson S. Th. Eckstein F. Westhof E. Gait M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A high resolution structural analysis would be required to elucidate the role of this region and to explain the observed differences. The data presented here support both catalytic and structural roles for the J2/1 nucleotides.Catalytic Activity of Hairpin Ribozymes with Different SpecificityAll the variants analyzed in this work shared common sequences at both ribozyme binding regions (H1 and H2 in Fig. 1). We wanted to test whether these conclusions might be of general application. A 14-nt sequence that fulfilled the proposed substrate consensus (1Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was previously identified at the 3′-end of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 TAR region (Fig.4). Attempts to cleave this sequence by the corresponding hairpin ribozyme had been unsuccessful.2Interestingly, the J2/1 sequence of this putative target was UGCU, which corresponds to one of the noncleavable sequences identified in this work (Figs. 3 and 4 A). We tested whether the specific hairpin ribozyme (Rz-TAR) could cleave a mutated 92-nt-long human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 RNA carrying an AGUC sequence at the corresponding J2/1 region (long AGUC-TAR substrate, Fig. 4). The AGUC sequence yielded the highest cleavage rate in the analysis presented above (Fig. 3). Significant cleavage of the AGUC-TAR substrate was observed, whereas no cleavage products of the UGCU-TAR substrate were detected under the same conditions (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the J2/1 nucleotides might determine the availability of an RNA target to be cleaved by the hairpin ribozyme. However, we could not rule out the possibility that other factors could be affecting the ability of the ribozyme to cleave the UGCU-TAR. Thus, the three nucleotide change might bring about a conformational change of the RNA structure altering the accessibility of the target region. This feature was evaluated by targeting two short RNA molecules carrying either the UGCU or the AGUC-TAR sequence (Fig. 4 C). As expected, no cleavage products were detected for UGCU-TAR, whereas significant cleavage was observed for the AGUC variant. These data suggest that the results presented above might be, at least qualitatively, applied to other ribozyme-substrate systems different from the one derived from the (-)sTRSV.Figure 4Cleavage of UGCU-TAR and AGUC-TAR substrates.

Furthermore, substrate specificity is not restricted to NGUC. We have identified a number of sequences with cleavage efficiencies comparable to NGUC. The hairpin ribozyme could cleave up to 40 different sequences, which is of great interest for ribozyme targeting as the putative good targets may not be accessible. Equally important is the identification of 24 sequences that cannot be cleaved by this catalytic motif. The hairpin ribozyme belongs to the group of smalltrans-acting catalytic RNAs. They are considered promising candidates for the development of specific tools for RNA inactivation. Numerous studies aimed at the inactivation of targeted RNAs by the hairpin ribozyme have been carried out with varying success. Among other factors, the extension of cleavage of selected targets would be affected by the sequence at the region containing the cleavage site within the substrate (J2/1 in Fig. 1). Results based on both in vitro selection and mutational experiments carried out with the hairpin catalytic motif derived from the (-)sTRSV 1The abbreviations used are:(-)sTRSVnegative strand of the satellite RNA associated with the tobacco ring spot virusTARtrans-activation response elementntnucleotideRzribozyme1The abbreviations used are:(-)sTRSVnegative strand of the satellite RNA associated with the tobacco ring spot virusTARtrans-activation response elementntnucleotideRzribozyme established the substrate sequence for optimal cleavage as 5′-RYN↓GHY-3′ (1Berzal-Herranz A.

Although in vitro selection strategies allow the analysis of a large number of sequences, the authors did not evaluate every possible sequence combination. Indeed, we have observed that substrate sequences following this consensus are not cleavable by the hairpin ribozyme. 2M. Pérez-Ruiz and A. Berzal-Herranz, unpublished data. 2M. Pérez-Ruiz and A. Berzal-Herranz, unpublished data. Similarly, Hampel and co-workers (2Anderson P. Monforte J. Tritz R. Nesbitt S. Hearst J. Hampel A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) defined the N↓GUC consensus as the optimal sequence for trans-cleavage by the hairpin ribozyme. However, sequence restrictions for these nucleotides surrounding the cleavage site were mostly determined by the effect of individual mutations. Therefore, although each consensus defined could be acceptable, it might lead to an under or overestimation of the proficiency of certain sequences to be used as substrates for the hairpin ribozyme. In this work we wanted to investigate the substrate sequence requirements at the J2/1 region to redefine sequence specificity of the hairpin ribozyme. Our results show that other sequences different from NGUC are also efficiently cleaved by the ribozyme. In addition, sequences fitting the established consensus (1Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) cannot be used as substrates for the hairpin catalytic motif. These results are of great importance in targeting RNA. negative strand of the satellite RNA associated with the tobacco ring spot virus trans-activation response element nucleotide ribozyme negative strand of the satellite RNA associated with the tobacco ring spot virus trans-activation response element nucleotide ribozyme EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of DNA Templates and RNA SynthesisOligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman Instruments), purified by electrophoresis on a 10–15% 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, excised out, and eluted overnight at 37 °C in 500 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. RNAs were recovered by sequential extraction with phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol precipitated in 0.3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Partially degenerate oligonucleotide for the synthesis of 64 substrate variants (GAGGA TCCTT TAAAC AGNNC NGTCA CGCTA TAGTG AGTCG TATTA GAATT CTC; mutJ2/1) was converted to double-stranded DNA after annealing to E-T7 (GAGAA TTCTA ATACG ACTCA CTATA) and was cloned into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pUC19 to generate the pT7-MUTJ2/1 plasmid series. Transcription of each of the 64DraI-digested pT7-MUTJ2/1 plasmids yielded the corresponding 17-nt-long RNA substrate variant, carrying an extra GCG sequence at the 5′-end.Oligonucleotides RzWT (TACCA GGTAA TATAC CACAA CGTGT GTTTC TCTGG TTGAC TTCTC TGTTT CCCTA TAGTG AGTCG TATTA) and Rz-TAR (TACCA GGTAA TGTAC CACAA CGTGT GTTTC TCTGG TCCAC TTCTT AAGCC CTATA GTGAG TCGTA TTA) were used as templates for the synthesis of wild-type and TAR ribozymes, respectively, prior to annealing to T7p (TAATA CGACT CACTA TA). Similarly, UGCU-TAR (GGCTT AAGCA GTGGG TTCCC TATAG TGAGT CGTAT TTA) and AGUC-TAR (GGCTT AGACT GTGGC GCTAT AGTGA GTCGT ATTA) were used to obtain short UGUC-TAR (17 nt) and AGUC-TAR (14 nt) RNA substrates, respectively. Long UGCU-TAR substrate was obtained by transcription of the BamHI-digested pG3TAR (3Pérez-Ruiz M. Sievers D. Garcı́a-López P.A. Berzal-Herranz A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 9: 33-42Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). pG3TAR was polymerase chain reaction-amplified to generate the DNA template for the synthesis of long AGUC-TAR substrate. Sense and antisense primers for the polymerase chain reaction were T7p and 3′-TAR (GCTAA GCTTA TTGAG GCTTA GACTG TGGGT TCCCT AGTTA), respectively. Synthesis and purification of RNAs were as described in Ref. 3Pérez-Ruiz M. Sievers D. Garcı́a-López P.A. Berzal-Herranz A.

Ribozyme and substrate RNAs were separately denatured at 95 °C for 2 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 12 mmMgCl2 and renatured at 4 °C for 15 min and 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were initiated by mixing ribozyme and substrate solutions. Preincubation and reaction steps were carried out in a GeneAmp®PCR System (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Reactions were followed over a time course of 60 min at 37 °C. Twelve aliquots of 5 μl were removed during the reaction and were quenched with an equal volume of formamide loading buffer. At least three independent experiments were carried out for each substrate variant. RNAs were loaded on 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and reaction products were quantified using a β-scan radioanalytic imaging instrument (InstantImager, Packard Instrument Co.).

The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA encoding LPAP had 421 residues including a putative signal peptide and was homologous to acid phosphatase, especially at the active site. Human LPAP had 28.5% amino acid identity to human prostatic acid phosphatase. Northern blot analysis showed a ubiquitous expression of LPAP, which was marked in kidney, heart, small intestine, muscle, and liver. Human chromosome map obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridazation showed that the gene for LPAP was localized to chromosome 1 q21. The mutant in which histidine was replaced with alanine at the active site and the putative signal peptide-deleted LPAP had no LPA phosphatase activity. In addition, the putative signal peptide-deleted LPAP showed no mitochondrial localization. The site of intracellular localization of endogenous LPAP was also mitochondria in MDCK cells and differentiated C2C12 cells. The LPAP homologous phosphatase, human prostatic acid phosphatase, also has LPA phosphatase activity. LPAP-stable transfected NIH 3T3 cells showed less phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. These results suggested that LPAP regulates lipid metabolism in mitochondria via the hydrolysis of LPA to monoacylglycerol.

It has been shown that LPA induces a wide range of functions such as enhancement of cell growth, stimulation of neurite retraction, chemotaxis of fibroblasts, and membrane depolarization in quiescent fibroblasts (1Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This variety of activities seems to be induced through LPA-specific receptors (2Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The binding of LPA to the receptors that are present on the cell surface causes the activation of trimeric G-protein-coupled pathways, resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling molecules including phospholipase C, Ras, and Rho (3Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). LPA also plays important roles in phospholipid metabolism inside of cells. It is an intermediate lipid in the pathway of phosphatidic acid (PA) synthesis. LPA is synthesized either from sn-glycerol-3 phosphate (G-3-P) or acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate. The acylation of G-3-P proceeds in two steps: the uptake of one fatty acyl moiety, which results in the formation of either 1-acyl- or 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (LPA), and the subsequent conversion into PA by the incorporation of a second fatty acid (4Numa S. Yamashita S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1974; 8: 197-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Tamai Y. Lands W.E.M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1974; 76: 847-860PubMed Google Scholar). In another LPA synthesis pathway, acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate by acylation, is reduced to 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by the cofactor, NADPH. The acyltransferases that catalyze the synthesis of LPA from G-3-P and fatty acyl carnitine or coenzyme A derivatives have been shown to be present in both mitochondria and microsomes (6Hajra A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3458-3465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hajra A.K.

Chem. 1968; 243: 3542-3543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the differences of substrate utilization, products formed, divalent cation requirements, and molecular weights, the mitochondrial and microsomal acyltransferases appeared to be different enzymes (10Mok A.Y. McMurray W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Further, both mitchondria and microsomes have a capacity to acylate G-3-P and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to LPA and acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate and subsequently to PA (11Lipton J.H. McMurray W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). There are two possible LPA-hydrolyzing pathways, one via LPA phospholipase A and the other via LPA phosphatase. Since LPA is a biologically active lipid, its elimination by these enzymes is important for terminating the signal. LPA phospholipase A was purified from rat brain (12Thompson F.J. Clark M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a molecular mass of 80 kDa, is membrane-bound, and hydrolyzes LPA but not other lysophospholipids. Concerning LPA phosphatase, the existence of an ecto-type LPA phosphatase that also hydrolyzed PA was reported in PAM212 cells (13Xie M. Low M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To date, membrane-bound PA phosphatases have been purified from porcine thymus; these enzymes are relatively PA-specific with weak activity for LPA (14Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and from rat liver, this enzyme also hydrolyzes LPA, ceramide-1-phosphate, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (16Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19422-19429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), while a LPA-specific phosphatase had not yet been purified. Previously, we purified the LPA specific phosphatase (LPAP) from the cytosol fraction of bovine brain and characterized it (18Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated a cDNA encoding LPAP from a human brain library and showed that it is homologous to acid phosphatases, including a prostatic acid phosphatase. Further, we examined the intracellular localization and biological activity of LPAP. These results demonstrate that LPAP is localized to mitochondria by signal peptides and regulates the biosynthesis of mitochondrial lipids by hydrolyzing LPA to monoacylglycerol. Polyclonal antibody against human prostatic acid phosphatase was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.[32P]Orthophosphate, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]CTP were from NEN Life Science Products, Inc. MitoTracker Red CMXRos and rhodamine-wheat germ agglutinin were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A was from Biogenesis Ltd. Monoclonal anti-Bip antibody was from Stressgen Biotech Corp. PC-3 is a human prostate cancer cell line derived from bone metastases, which were obtained from the Japan Health Sciences Foundation. PC-3 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12K (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 monkey kidney cells, kidney MDCK epithelial cells, and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.5% (w/v) glucose, and antibiotics, and the differentiation was initiated by medium exchange to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% horse serum and 3.5% (w/v) glucose. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells with LPAP and prostatic acid phosphatase were carried out using an electroporation method. To obtain stable clones expressing LPAP, 10 μg of pNeoSRα II plasmid was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Kingston R.E. Ausbel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 3 days and then for 14 days in the same medium with geneticin (G418) at 400 μg/ml. Then stable transformant colonies were isolated with cloning cups. The expression of LPAP was verified by immunoblotting. Twenty-four clones showing different levels of expression were obtained. LPAP was purified as described (18Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain. The enzyme was finally purified by heparin column chromatography, reproducibly resulting in a product more than 3,300 times purer than that obtained from the cytosol, with a specific enzyme activity of 37.99 units/mg of protein as described (18Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The final enzyme preparation was then sequenced. LPAP (20 μg) was subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad apparatus. The sample on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was digested with lysylendopeptidase (Wako, Japan) for 24 h at 37 °C. The digested sample was subjected to a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatograph using a Zorbax C-18 column (1–150-mm inner diameter), and the collected peptides were analyzed with a protein sequencer (PPSQ-10 protein sequencer; Shimazu). Since the partial sequences of LPAP are very similar to the internal sequence encoded by human prostatic acid phosphatase, we designed two degenerate primers for PCR amplification: 5′-ATGGTICA(A/G)GTIGTITT(T/C)(C/A)GICA(T/C)GG -3′, 5′-CCIC(G/T)(A/G)TA(A/G)TAIA(A/G)(T/C)TGIAC(A/G)AACCA-3′. The amplification reactions were done on a PCR thermal cycler (TaKaRa) at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 40 cycles. A 987-base pair fragment thus amplified was gel-purified, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase followed by Klenow fragments, and subcloned into pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene) at theSmaI site. Purified plasmid DNAs were sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A γ ZAP II cDNA library made from human brain (Stratagene) was used for screening. Plaque lifts with a total of 1 × 106 recombinant plaques were hybridized with a radiolabeled LPAP cDNA fragment probe (0.5–1 × 106 cpm/ml). Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and plaque-purified through a second round of screening. The multiple choice Northern blots (OriGene Technologies, Inc.) were hybridized with 32P- labeled probes specific to each LPAP and the control actin probe. Mouse LPAP fragment cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer DNA labeling kit (TaKaRa). The LPAP cDNAs were subcloned into pEF-BOS (20Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) at the BamHI site and into pNeoSRα II plasmid at the XhoI and BamHI sites. Lymphocytes isolated from human blood were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml; Sigma) to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and recultured at 37 °C for 6 h in α-minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma). Cells were harvested, and slides were made by using standard procedures including hypotinic treatment, fix, and air-dry. A 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA probe was biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc. BioNick labeling kit (15 °C, 1 h) (21Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The procedure for FISH detection was performed according to Heng et al. (21Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and Heng and Tsui (22Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by taking photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI banded chromosomes (22Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To construct the mutant (H52A) in which histidine (amino acid 52) is replaced with alanine at the putative active site, we designed two primers: 5′-GGTGCAGGTCGTGTTTCGAGCCGGGGCTCGGAGTCCTCT-3′ and 5′-GAGGACTCCGAGCCCCGGCTCGAAACACGACCTGCACCA-3′ (the mutation site is underlined). To confirm the desired mutation, the mutant DNA in pBluescript II KS(−) was sequenced by the method described above. The complete sequence of the mutated LPAP insert was subcloned into pNeoSRα II plasmid at the XhoI andBamHI sites. To express LPAP with a histidine tag, two primers were synthesized for PCR amplification. In the case of LPAP, the sense primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAAGAAGGACCCATCATCATC-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 168–174) was designed to generate a BamHI site (underlined). The antisense primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTGTCGGGGGCAGTGGCA-3′ (amino acids 312–317) was designed to introduce a BamHI site. PCR amplification was performed as described using the two primers and the LPAP cDNA in pBluescript SK(−) as template. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and subcloned into the plasmid pQE30 at the corresponding site. The recombinant plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactosidase to produce a histidine-tagged protein. The E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in a buffer containing 8 murea. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (QIAGEN). The bound proteins were eluted with 250 mmimidazole, dialyzed against PBS, and used as antigen. Two rabbits were immunized with the histidine-tagged LPAP fragment (1 mg) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco). Booster injections were repeated every 2 weeks thereafter using half the amount of the conjugated protein emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The serum was collected 10 days after each booster injection. For the affinity purification of the antibody, the antigen protein (2 mg) was coupled to 0.15 g of BrCN-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immune IgG was applied to the column and affinity-purified by elution at pH 2.5. Total RNA was prepared from PC-3 cells by a single step guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (24Xie W.Q.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAATCTGTACTGTCCTCAG-3′ (nucleotides 1155–1175 in prostatic acid phosphatase). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of PC-3 cells using the random primer. The reaction mixture (25 μl) containing the total RNA (10 μg), random primer, and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies), was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. One-fourth of the resulting DNA preparation was used as a template for the subsequent PCR amplification. COS-7 cells were transfected with LPAP or human prostatic acid phosphatase in pEF-BOS plasmid. After 48 h, cells were harvested and homogenized. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and then the supernatant was applied onto a column of DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the enzyme eluted at 0.5 ml/min/fraction with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The substrate specificity of enzymes was examined by the modified method of Hiroyama et al. (18Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, after the reaction with various lipids, chloroform/methanol (1:2; 200 μl) was added to the reaction mixture (50 μl), and then chloroform (80 μl) and 1 n HCl (80 μl) were further added. The mixture was vigorously mixed and separated to two phases by centrifugation. A part (125 μl) of the upper phase was transferred to another tube, and perchloric acid (25 μl), 10% ammonium molybdate (25 μl), and 10% ascorbic acid (50 μl) were added and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 795 nm. The cells expressing LPAP were incubated with 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for mitochondrial staining in growing medium for 30 min and then rinsed with PBS three times. They were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then rinsed with PBS three times. Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-LPAP polyclonal antibody and anti-Bip monoclonal antibody for 1 h. After being rinsed with PBS, cells were then incubated with fluorescence-labeled second antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A or rhodamine-wheat germ agglutinin for 30 min. The subcellular localization of LPAP was visualized by confocal microscopy. NIH 3T3 cells and LPAP-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were labeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate and then harvested with a rubber policeman after being washed in PBS. Phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42664) Google Scholar), and 150,000 cpm of lipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia/water (15:11:2:2, v/v/v/v) as the first dimensional solvent and n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (30:5:5, v/v/v) as the second on oxalate-treated TLC plates, or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v) as the first and chloroform/methanol/formic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v) as the second dimensional solvent (28Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After development, the spots were visualized by autoradiography. To quantitate the radioactivity in each spot, the spots were scraped off, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counter. To ascertain which phospholipid is dephosphorylated most effectively by LPAP, a crude extract of lipids was used as substrate for LPAP. The catalytic activity for the extracted lipids was measuredin vitro. In brief, the 150,000 cpm of lipids were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-maleate (pH 7.5) and 2 mm Triton X-100. LPAP purified from bovine brain was added and then reacted at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was extracted as described above and spotted on a TLC plate. After two-dimensional separation, each lipid was scraped off, and the radioactivity was measured. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with anti-LPAP antibody, followed by anti-rabbit IgG conjugated peroxidase, and the protein bands were visualized with benzamide (Sigma) and H2O2 in PBS. We determined the amino acid sequences of six polypeptides formed by digestion of a 44-kDa protein with lysylendopeptidase. Next, we attempted to isolate the cDNA encoding the enzyme based on the information obtained from partial amino acid sequencing. Since two (MVQVVFRHGARSPL and EWFVQLYYRGK) in six polypeptides were similar to the sequence of prostatic acid phosphatase, two degenerate primers were designed based on them and used in PCR amplification. We obtained a single 987-base pair amplification product. After screening 1,000,000 phages from the human brain cDNA library using the 987-base pair fragment as probe, 25 putative clones were isolated. Of these, 20 clones were positive on secondary screening and further analyzed by DNA sequencing. All clones encoded the same protein. The amino acid deduced sequence, which was found to contain six polypeptides, coded a novel protein of 421 amino acid residues including the putative signal sequence, which was hydrophobic (Fig. 1). There are two putative initiation codons, ATG (positions −21 to −19) and ATG (positions 1–3) in human LPAP cDNA. To determine which is the initiation codon, we further investigated the N-terminal sequence of mouse LPAP. It was found that ATG (positions −21 to −19) upstream of ATG (positions 1–3) was not present in mouse LPAP (data not shown). Thus, we presumed that ATG (positions 1–3) is the real initiation codon. Further, we attempted to study the LPA phosphatase activity and intracellular localization of the constructs containing either ATG (positions −21 to −19) or ATG (positions 1–3). Both had LPA phosphatase activity and a similar intracellular localization (data not shown), indicating that ATG (positions 1–3) was the initiation codon of LPAP. Next, we searched for homologous proteins in a data bank with a computer. As a result, we found that human prostatic acid phosphatase was most homologous to LPAP (Fig.2 A). 28.5% of the amino acids of LPAP were identical to prostatic acid phosphatase. In addition, LPAP had a consensus sequence(LXXVXXVXRHGXRXP) with a group of acid phosphatases (Fig. 2 B) at the N terminus.Figure 2A, comparison of LPAP with human prostatic acid phosphatase. Amino acids encoded by LPAP and prostatic acid phosphatase are aligned, and identical residues areboxed. Dashes indicate gaps inserted to maximize alignment. B, highly conserved peptide sequence in acid phosphatases and two other proteins. The proteins are as follows (in descending order): human LPA phosphatase, human prostatic acid phosphatase, human lysosomal acid phosphatase, rat lysosomal acid phosphatase, E. coli acid phosphatase, and three yeast acid phosphatases as well as the rat sodium channel protein and E. coli penicillin-binding protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first studied the tissue distribution of LPAP by Northern blot analysis, demonstrating an expression of a 1.75-kilobase LPAP mRNA (Fig.3 A). The LPAP mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, but the expression was marked in kidney, heart, small intestine, muscle, and liver. To examine the possibility that LPAP is involved in genetic diseases, we attempted to analyze the localization of the gene on chromosomes by FISH. Under the conditions used, the hybridization efficiency was approximately 79% for this probe (among 100 mitotic figures checked, 79 of which showed signals on one pair of chromosomes). DAPI banding was used to identify the specific chromosome, and an assignment between the signal from the probe and the long arm of chromosome 1 was obtained. The position was further determined based on 10 photos (Fig. 3, B(a)). No additional locus was detected by FISH under the conditions used; therefore, the LPAP gene is located at human chromosome 1, region q21. An example of the mapping results is presented in Fig. 3, B (b). It has been suggested that the high molecular weight acid phosphatases are histidine phosphatases; phosphorylated histidine has been proposed as an intermediate in enzyme-catalyzed phosphoester hydrolysis (29van Etten R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 390: 27-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We constructed a mutant (H52A) in which histidine (amino acid 52) was replaced with alanine at the putative active site and a signal peptide-deleted LPAP(−) (Fig.4 A) to investigate the LPA phosphatase activities and intracellular localization. Further, we raised a specific polyclonal antibody against LPAP and checked the expression of LPAP. The antibody that was prepared using the proteins produced in E. coli also reacted with the native LPAP from bovine brain. Immunoblotting with LPAP antibody revealed that all transfected plasmids were expressed as proteins in the COS-7 cells (Fig.4 B), although control COS-7 cells also contained the endogenous LPAP. In the wild type LPAP(+) cell lysate, a 45-kDa protein and smaller proteins including one of 37 kDa were stained by anti-LPAP antibody. To determine whether the smaller proteins were degradative products of the 45-kDa protein, we tagged LPAP with GFP at the C terminus. Immunostaining of lysates from C-terminal tagged LPAP-expressing cells with tag antibody produced the same staining pattern as that for polyclonal anti-LPAP antibody, confirming that the smaller proteins are degradative proteins (data not shown). Using lysates from these protein-expressing cells, we measured LPA phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 C, LPA phosphatase activities in mutant (H52A) and LPAP(−)-expressing cells were the same as that of the negative control (vector only). The wild type LPAP(+) and LPAP(H52A) were colocalized with a mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, but LPAP(−) was cytoplasmic (Fig.4 D). We further examined the possibility that LPAP localized in other organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. But LPAP was not colocalized with those organelles (Fig.4 E). The results indicate that LPAP is localized to mitochondria by the signal peptide and functions in mitochondria. Next, we examined the intracellular localization of the endogenous LPAP in MDCK cells and differentiated C2C12 cells. Both of the cells expressed the LPAP in abundance (Fig. 3 A). These endogenous LPAP also colocalized with MitoTracker Red CMXRos in MDCK cells and differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig.5 A), but in undifferentiated C2C12 cells, LPAP was not detectable (data not shown), suggesting that the endogenous LPAP localized in mitochondria and was induced with the differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes. To confirm whether LPAP is induced in differentiated C2C12 cells, we examined the change in LPAP content during differentiation (0, 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 days) after starvation (Fig. 5 B). There were two positive proteins with anti-LPAP antibody, 37 and 44 kDa. Both of them increased with differentiation (Fig. 5 B). However, in the differentiated C2C12 cells, 37-kDa protein was contained at a much higher level, while it was at a lower level in MDCK cells than the 44-kDa protein (data not shown). Since the 37-kDa protein was detected both in LPAP(+)-expressing COS-7 cells and LPAP(−)-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 B), we thought it was a degradative or processed LPAP. Thus, LPAP was found to be induced with the differentiation from myoblast to myotube. To investigate the substrate specificity of LPAP and human prostatic acid phosphatase, two expression vectors that contained cDNA encoding LPAP and human prostatic acid phosphatase were constructed. These expression vectors and pEF-BOS as a control vector were introduced into COS-7 cells, and the cell lysates were separated by a DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography. Partially purified human prostatic acid phosphatase and LPAP were used to study the substrate specificity. The presence of the enzymes was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. In this expe"

In this study, we demonstrate that the flagellar membrane-targeting motif is recognized by several species ofLeishmania.Previously, we demonstrated that the 130 amino acid NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of isoform 1 glucose transporter was sufficient to target a nonflagellar integral membrane protein into the flagellar membrane. We have now determined that an essential flagellar targeting signal is located between amino acids 20 and 35 of the NH2-terminal domain. We have further analyzed the role of specific amino acids in this region by alanine replacement mutagenesis and determined that single amino acid substitutions did not abrogate targeting to the flagellar membrane.

Characterization of a targeting motif for a flagellar membrane protein in Leishmania enriettii.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 277Issue 14PreviewRecent studies in our group have revealed that a deletion mutant that removes the first 30 amino acids from the Leishmania enriettii flagellar glucose transporter ISO1 produces a protein that still targets to the flagellum, in contradiction to our previously reported results. Consequently, the essential flagellar targeting information cannot be located at amino acids 25–29, as postulated in this manuscript. Additional deletions suggest that a region between amino acids 67 and 97 is important for flagellar targeting, and we are further investigating the role of this region in localization of the ISO1 transporter. Full-Text PDF Open Access Eukaryotic flagella and cilia are present throughout the evolution of eukaryotic cells from early flagellated protozoa to mammalian cilia. These specialized organelles contain an internal microtubule-based axoneme that provides structure and generates movement (1Lindemann C.B. Kanous K.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 173: 1-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cosson J. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Flagella and cilia play roles in cellular locomotion, trapping of food, and sensory functions (3Bloodgood R.A. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To carry out sensory functions, ciliary and flagellar membranes contain proteins unique to these organelles. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans expresses ODR-10 (a seven-transmembrane domain receptor), OSM-9 (a cation channel), and ODR-3 (a Gα protein) that localize to the cilia of AWA olfactory neurons (4Colbert H.A.

Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mammalian ependymal cells, oviduct, and trachea contain a G protein subtype (Gi2) that localizes predominantly in cilia (8Shinohara H. Asano T. Kato K. Kameshima T. Semba R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition to distinct protein compositions, considerable evidence has accumulated that flagella and cilia exhibit lipid compositions distinct from other domains of the plasma membrane (9Kaneshiro E.S. Bloodgood R.A. Ciliary and Flagellar Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1989: 241-265Google Scholar). For example, Paramecium cilia contain 1.5 times more sterols and 5 times more sphingolipids relative to the lipid composition of the whole cell (9Kaneshiro E.S. Bloodgood R.A. Ciliary and Flagellar Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1989: 241-265Google Scholar). Despite lipid and protein compositions distinct from the rest of the plasma membrane, the membranes of these organelles are contiguous with the plasma membrane. How these membrane subdomains are generated is a question of general importance in cell biology. Previously, several motile processes have been observed that could be responsible for movement of proteins into and within the flagellar membrane (3Bloodgood R.A. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Kozminski K.G. Johnson K.A. Forscher P. Rosenbaum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, Dwyer et al. (7Dwyer N.D. Troemel E.R. Sengupta P. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have identified two proteins, ODR-4 and ODR-8, in C. elegans that are required for the localization of ODR-10 to the cilia of AWA olfactory neurons. However, little is known about the process by which specific membrane proteins are targeted to ciliary and flagellar membranes. To better study the mechanisms that generate the differential protein distributions in eukaryotic flagella, we have characterized a targeting motif for a flagellar integral membrane protein in the parasitic protozoan Leishmania enriettii. Leishmania are single-cell primitive eukaryotes that have a plasma membrane that can be subdivided into three distinct subdomains: (a) flagellar, (b) flagellar pocket, and (c) pellicular plasma membranes (12Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Each subdomain has distinct protein populations (12Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously (13Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that two closely related isoforms of the major glucose transporter from L. enriettii are differentially localized. Isoform 1 glucose transporter (ISO1) 1The abbreviations used are:ISO1isoform 1 glucose transporterISO2isoform 2 glucose transporterPBSphosphate-buffered saline is located primarily in the flagellar membrane, whereas isoform 2 glucose transporter (ISO2) localizes primarily to the pellicular plasma membrane surrounding the cell body. Both isoforms are also present in the flagellar pocket membrane, the functionally specialized domain of the plasma membrane that receives proteins that are ultimately destined for the pellicular and flagellar membranes or secreted into the extracellular medium (12Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar,14Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Overath P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). isoform 1 glucose transporter isoform 2 glucose transporter phosphate-buffered saline ISO1 and ISO2 differ only in the sequence of their cytosolic NH2-terminal domains; ISO1 has a 130-amino acid domain that lacks similarity to the 48-amino acid NH2-terminal domain of ISO2. We have previously demonstrated that the NH2-terminal domain of ISO1 is sufficient to target an integral pellicular plasma membrane protein to the flagellar membrane (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that several species ofLeishmania target ISO1 to the flagellar membrane, indicating that the ISO1 flagellar membrane-targeting sequence is broadly recognized among members of this genus. Based on the combined results of NH2-terminal deletions (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and chimeric constructs, a critical flagellar targeting sequence has now been mapped to the region between amino acids 20 and 35. We have used alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region to identify a cluster of five contiguous amino acids that are likely to play a role in flagellar targeting. Promastigotes of L. enriettii were cultured at 26 °C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle-Leishmania medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (17Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) containing 5% fetal calf serum and 5% bovine embryonic fluid or RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Both types of medium contained xanthine (0.1 mm) and hemin (50 μg/ml) supplements. Parasites were transfected by electroporation (18Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) of plasmid DNA using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) apparatus. One day after transfection, hygromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to the culture, and the parasites were maintained under these conditions until drug-resistant parasites grew out (usually ∼3–4 weeks). The hygromycin concentration was then increased to 200 μg/ml for maintenance of transfected parasites. Polyclonal antiserum against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the 25 COOH-terminal amino acids of rat GLUT2 was purchased from Biogenesis. The antibody was used at a dilution of 1:500 for immunofluorescence and at a dilution of 1:2000 for immunoblots. The mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody raised against native chick brain microtubules was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The antibody was used at a dilution of 1:600 for immunofluorescence and at a dilution of 1:5000 for immunoblots. For immunofluorescence imaging, parasites were pelleted, washed twice in PBS, resuspended at a density of approximately 107 cells/ml, and attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. The adherent parasites were fixed with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. After fixation, coverslips were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in PBS plus 2% goat serum for 15 min. Antiserum was added at the appropriate dilution in PBS plus 2% goat serum and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or to Texas Red (1:800) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in PBS plus 2% goat serum. Coverslips were rinsed five times with PBS and then mounted onto slides in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 90% glycerol, and 20 mg/mln-propyl-gallate (Sigma). Images were acquired at the Oregon Hearing Research Center of the Oregon Health Sciences University using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES laser scanning confocal imaging system attached to an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a ×60 oil immersion lens and a ×2 zoom. The acquisition system (LaserSharp) used a krypton/argon laser with excitation lines at 488, 568, and 647 nm and simultaneous or sequential detection using one/two/three 8-bit photomultiplier tubes. Images were processed using the LaserSharp (Bio-Rad) post-processing software. The plasmidpX63 HYG (19Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was used for expression of epitope-tagged constructs in L. enriettii. The 13 COOH-terminal amino acids of rat GLUT2 (20Thorens B. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (TVQMEFLGSSETV), which were used as the epitope tag, were introduced into ISO1- and ISO2 (genes encoding ISO1 and ISO2, respectively)-containing plasmids as described previously (13Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the following descriptions, all restriction sites followed by (P) indicate that these sites are in the polylinker cloning region of the plasmid. For chimeric constructs, a primer containing aEcoRI restriction site, the six nucleotides immediately preceding the initiating methionine of ISO1 (a putative Kozak sequence (21Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AGCAGC) and encoding a methionine and the first six amino acids of the region to be fused (amino acids 1–31, 20–35, 20–31, 20–29, 21–31, or 21–29 of ISO1), was used as the forward primer, and an antisense primer encoding the final six amino acids of the ISO1 sequence to be included in the construct followed by an AspI site was used as the reverse primer to amplify regions near the NH2 terminus of ISO1 by polymerase chain reaction. To create the ISO1 (NH2-terminal fragment)::ISO2 chimeras, the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments were gel-purified, digested withEcoRI and AspI, and cloned intoEcoRI/AspI-digested pBS ISO2 EcoRI (P)/ClaI, a Bluescript plasmid containing the coding region of ISO2 from the initiating methionine to the internalClaI restriction site (22Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2130-2134Google Scholar). Because the ISO2 gene contains an AspI site spanning bases 13–18 of theISO2 open reading frame, the resulting chimeric plasmid encodes a protein containing an NH2-terminal fragment of ISO1 fused to amino acid 4 of ISO2. Subsequently, the BamHI (P)/ClaI fragment of this chimeric construct was cloned into the BglII (P)/ClaI sites of the pX63 HYG ISO1 vector containing the ISO1 open reading frame fused to GLUT2 epitope tag (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using the internal ClaI site and the BglII site in the upstream polylinker region. This strategy generated chimeras encoding a fragment of the NH2-terminal domain of ISO1 fused to amino acid 4 of ISO2 and containing the 13-amino acid GLUT2 epitope tag at the COOH terminus. The regions containing the ISO1 fragment and its junction with ISO2 were sequenced, as reported previously (22Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2130-2134Google Scholar), to confirm that the correct constructs had been generated. The ISO1 (1Lindemann C.B. Kanous K.S. Int. Rev.

The BamHI (P)/ClaI fragment containing the chimeric region was then cloned into the pX63 HYG ISO1 BglII (P)/ClaI sites as described above. Alanine scanning mutagenesis and the addition of new restriction sites to ISO1 were accomplished using a variation of the Promega Altered Sites II Mutagenesis Systems protocol. Briefly, mutagenic oligomers (sense orientation) containing both a single mutated codon to convert the encoded amino acid to an alanine and a translationally silent change of one or two wobble bases to add or remove a restriction site for ease of screening were phosphorylated with the T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and annealed to single-stranded phagemid DNA from a Bluescript-based plasmid containing a fragment of ISO1 (bases 1–1432 of the open reading frame terminating in the single ClaI site within the open reading frame) in the antisense orientation (23Stack S.P. Stein D.R. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6785-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis and ligation were performed, and the product was transformed into ES1301, a mutS strain of Escherichia coli, and then into XL-1 blue bacteria as described previously (24Seyfang A. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24210-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutants were screened by restriction digests, followed by sequencing of the mutated DNA, as described below. Mutagenized constructs were excised with BamHI (P) and ClaI and ligated into the BglII (P)/ClaI site of thepX63 HYG TΔ20 vector (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which produced an expression vector encoding the mutant ISO1 protein containing a 13-amino acid epitope tag from rat GLUT2 at the COOH terminus (see below). To characterize flagellar membrane-targeting phenotypes, 30 different confocal immunofluorescence images of each wild-type or mutant ISO1-expressing cell line were obtained. Each 512 × 512, 72 pixel/inch image was analyzed using NIH Image 1.61 for Power PC Macintosh on a Power Macintosh 7300. Files were opened as gray scale images and inverted (i.e. bright pixels become gray to black, and dark pixels become gray to white) for ease of processing. The different plasma membrane subdomains (flagellar, flagellar pocket, and pellicular plasma membranes) are illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The flagellar pocket was designated as the most intense 3 × 3-pixel area inside the cell within 6 pixels of the point at which the flagellum and pellicular plasma membrane join. Flagellar fluorescence values were taken as the average of three 3 × 3-pixel areas along the flagellum (specifically, the area within 2 pixels just before the flagellum joins the cell body, a point approximately in the middle of the flagellum, and the tip of the flagellum) (Fig. 1 B). Fluorescence values for flagella and the flagellar pockets were normalized to a scale of 1–100 for each cell, and the flagellar pocket value was designated as 100. The relative flagellar intensity was defined as the average of the three flagellar fluorescence values divided by the flagellar pocket fluorescence value (Fig. 1 B). For wild-type ISO1-expressing cells and each mutant, a histogram of relative flagellar intensities for 30 cells was plotted. Because the histograms of these data did not fit a normal distribution, we used the χ2 statistical test to determine whether differences in the relative flagellar fluorescence staining were significant between lines expressing the mutant or wild-type ISO1. Because no specific criteria exist to divide relative flagellar intensities into high and low values, we compared the significance of the relative distributions of flagellar intensities at two different cutoffs (80% and 60% of relative flagellar pocket intensity). In all cases where statistically significant differences were found, distinct mutant phenotypes differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the wild-type epitope-tagged ISO1 in the amount of staining that occurred above both the 80% and 60% cutoff values. We have previously determined that the parasitic protozoan L. enriettii targets the glucose transporter ISO1 to the flagellar membrane (13Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The genusLeishmania contains several species with distinct geographical distributions and divergent evolutionary histories (25Croan D.G. Morrison D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because L. enriettii is the most divergent member of the genus (26Fernandes A.P. Nelson K. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11608-11612Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we first wanted to determine whether the flagellar ISO1 protein from L. enriettii could be correctly targeted in three other species of parasite. Promastigotes of L. major,L. mexicana, and L. donovani transfected with the[pX63 HYG ISO1] construct all exhibited staining of epitope-tagged ISO1 primarily on the flagellum (Fig.2), confirming that the flagellar membrane-targeting signal(s) of ISO1 is/are recognized in these other species. Thus, ISO1 flagellar targeting signals are likely to be of general importance for localizing flagellar membrane proteins in many, if not all, Leishmania species. One objective of the current study was to define the minimal protein sequence that results in the targeting of polypeptides to the flagellar membrane of trypanosomatid protozoa. Previous studies (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) on the ISO1 flagellar glucose transporter from L. enriettii demonstrated that the unique 130-amino acid NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain of this polytopic membrane protein contained a flagellar membrane-targeting sequence, whereas deletion mutagenesis suggested that an essential flagellar targeting sequence was located near amino acid 25. To define the flagellar membrane-targeting sequence of ISO1 more precisely, we prepared chimeric constructs that encode segments of the NH2-terminal domain of ISO1 fused to amino acid 4 of ISO2 (Fig. 3 A), a protein normally targeted to the pellicular plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B). These constructs were transfected into L. enriettii promastigotes, and the location of each chimeric protein was determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The data in Fig. 3 C indicate that the chimera containing amino acids 1–35 of ISO1 fused to the NH2 terminus of ISO2 largely retargeted to the flagellar membrane, confirming that this region contains all of the essential flagellar targeting sequence. Furthermore, the previous observation that the first 20 amino acids of ISO1 could be deleted without affecting flagellar targeting (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) implies that the region between amino acids 20 and 35 (SSPPRRTGTTSHAAHN; Fig.4) encompasses all of the essential flagellar targeting information. A chimera containing amino acids 20–35 of ISO1 revealed a partial retargeting phenotype (Fig.3 D). Staining patterns among different cells in the population varied from primarily pellicular plasma membrane to predominantly flagellar membrane. The partial retargeting is reminiscent of the partial flagellar targeting of the 25-amino acid deletion of the ISO1 NH2 terminus (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which also varies for individual cells in a population. In contrast, chimeras containing shorter segments of ISO1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) remained in the pellicular plasma membrane (data not shown), as did the wild-type ISO2 protein (Fig. 3 B). Consequently, the shortest segment that was sufficient to cause complete flagellar retargeting, at least in the context of these particular chimeras, contained amino acids 1–35, whereas amino acids 20–35 could induce partial retargeting.Figure 4Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images of alanine replacement mutants of ISO1 . Confocal microscopy images of L. enriettii promastigotes expressing epitope-tagged ISO1 alanine replacement mutants P22A, P23A, R24A, R25A, T26A, G27A, T28A, T29A, S30A, H31A, or A32G are shown. Stable cell lines transfected with one pX63 HYG ISO1(alanine mutant) construct each were stained with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-GLUT2 antibody and a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody and examined by confocal microscopy. Each micrograph represents a single 0.5-μm section through each field. A, the P22A, P23A, R24A, S30A, H31A, and A32G mutants did not differ significantly in their pattern of ISO1 staining when compared with wild-type ISO1. B, the G27A, T28A, and T29A mutants exhibited less intense flagellar staining relative than flagellar pocket staining when compared with wild-type ISO1. C, the R25A and"

Using polymerase chain reaction-based cloning strategy, we cloned aDrosophila gene that is homologous to the vertebrate FAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases. We designated this geneDfak56 and characterized its gene product. The overall protein structure and deduced amino acid sequence of Dfak56 show significant similarity to those of FAK and PYK2. Dfak56 has in vitro autophosphorylation activity at tyrosine residues. Expression of the Dfak56 mRNA and the protein was observed in the central nervous system and the muscle-epidermis attachment site in the embryo, where Drosophilaposition-specific integrins are localized. The results suggest that like FAK in vertebrates, Dfak56 functions downstream of integrins. Dfak56 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin-dependent attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix. We conclude that the Dfak56 tyrosine kinase is involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion signaling and thus is a functional homolog of vertebrate FAK.

Accumulating data, however, show that FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is induced upon adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix through the surface integrin (3Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and upon stimulation of cells by a variety of other extracellular factors including those for receptor tyrosine kinases and for G-protein-coupled receptors (4Zachary I.

The function of PYK2 seems to be different from that of FAK because tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 is independent of cell adhesion and is not localized to focal adhesions (13Sasaki H. Nagura K.

Since calcium ionophores stimulate PYK2 and chelation of extracellular calcium ion abrogates tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in response to various stimuli, PYK2 is thought to be regulated by calcium (12Lev S.

The roles of FAK in development and cell adhesion are directly revealed by gene targeting experiment (16Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 17Furuta Y. Ilic D. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the FAK gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality. Cells from mutant embryos have reduced mobility and increased number of focal adhesions, suggesting that FAK is involved in the turnover of focal adhesion contacts during cell migration. Disruption of the mouse β1 integrin subunit, one of the well known upstream factors of FAK, also causes embryonic lethality in a very early stage of development (18Stephens L.E. Sutherland A.E. Klimanskaya I.V. Andrieux A. Meneses J. Pedersen R.A. Damsky C.H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, because of the anomalous phenotypes, further biological analysis of knockout mice remains difficult. In Drosophila, study of cell adhesion was started by the identification of position-specific (PS) antigens as homologs of vertebrate integrins (19Bogaert T. Brown N. Wilcox M. Cell. 1987; 51: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Several Drosophila genes encoding integrins have been identified, including myospheroid(mys), multiple edematous wings (mew), and inflated (if), which encode the integrin β chain (βPS integrin) (20MacKrell A.J. Blumberg B. Haynes S.R. Fessler J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), αPS1 integrin (21Wehrli M. DiAntonio A. Fearnley I.M. Smith R.J. Wilcox M. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and αPS2 integrin (19Bogaert T. Brown N. Wilcox M. Cell. 1987; 51: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), respectively. Genetic analyses of these mutations demonstrate that integrins are required for a wide variety of developmental processes, including germ-band retraction, muscle attachment, and morphogenesis of the wing and eye (22Brower D.L. Brabant M.C. Bunch T.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic approaches to isolate the genes encoding possible downstream molecules of integrins have been performed (23Prout M. Damania Z. Soong J. Fristrom D. Fristrom J.W. Genetics. 1997; 146: 275-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated the cDNA for the Drosophilahomolog of FAK. Characterization of the protein product strongly suggested that Drosophila FAK is an important downstream factor of integrin-mediated signaling pathways, as is mammalian FAK. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using fully degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequences HRDIAAR (for the forward primer) and DVWAFG (for the reverse primer) as primers and 108 plaque-forming units of Drosophila embryo cDNA library (a gift from T. Todo, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) as template. The amino acid sequences were located in conserved motifs of the kinase domain and are unique for FAK and PYK2. Amplified cDNAs (∼200 base pairs) were subcloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced with Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Replicate filters from aDrosophila embryo cDNA library were prehybridized for 3 h at 65 °C in 7% SDS and 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and then hybridized to the 32P-labeled cDNA fragment for 16 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the filters were washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were isolated and sequenced on both strands. Other molecular biological techniques were performed as described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed using Genetics Computer Group software packages and ClustalW and BLAST programs employing the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank running at the Human Genome Center of the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan). Genomic DNA from wild-type (Oregon-R strain) Drosophila melanogaster (1 μg/sample) digested with suitable restriction enzymes was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel. mRNA samples from cultured cells andDrosophila tissues were electrophoresed on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel. The fractionated RNAs were then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to hybridization using full-lengthDfak56 cDNA and the 5′-portion (SacII fragment, corresponding to nucleotides 1–2743) of theDfak56 cDNA as probes. Hybridizations were performed employing the same procedure as that used for cDNA screening. Drosophila Schneider cells (S2) and derivatives of their integrin-expressing cells were a gift from D. L. Brower (Arizona University). BG2-c6 and 7E10 cells were described previously (25Ui K. Nishihara S. Sakuma M. Togashi S. Ueda R. Miyata Y. Miyake T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.

The cells were cultured at 27 °C under normal atmospheric conditions in Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum. Simian COS cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To generate rabbit anti-Dfak56 polyclonal antibodies, glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Dfak56 was constructed by inserting the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 1–280 of the Dfak56 protein into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression of the GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with the purified GST-Dfak56 fusion protein. Antiserum raised against Dfak56 were purified using GST and the GST-Dfak56 protein bound to a HiTrap NHS-activated affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. Whole-mountin situ hybridization was conducted using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes as described previously (28Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). The digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (sense and antisense) were prepared by a standard procedure with a digoxigenin-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and full-length Dfak56 cDNA as a template. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry was performed as described (29Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-Dfak56 antibodies at 1:100 dilution. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at 1:500 dilution. Immunohistochemistry with cultured cells was performed as described previously (30Takagi Y. Ui T.K. Miyake T. Hirohashi S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 244: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in TNNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm NaF. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The lysates were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad). The proteins reacted with anti-Dfak56 antibodies were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removing the beads, the lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-Dfak56 antibodies and protein-A Sepharose. The immune complex was washed several times with TNNE buffer and then with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmMnCl2). Following addition of [γ-32P]ATP (370 kBq, 110 TBq/mmol), the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated proteins and two-dimensional analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides were performed as described previously (31Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). To identify a Drosophila FAK homolog of protein-tyrosine kinase, we used polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify cDNAs from aDrosophila embryo cDNA library. The sequences of the degenerate primers corresponded to the amino acid sequences conserved in both FAK and PYK2. Amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into plasmids and sequenced. We searched the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank against these sequences. A cDNA fragment was revealed to contain a novel sequence with homology to FAK and PYK2. The cDNA fragment was subsequently used to screen the same library. Four cDNA clones of varying sizes were isolated, and the one containing the longest insert (4.3 kilobase pairs) was sequenced on both strands. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA predicted an open reading frame of 1198 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The calculated molecular mass of the predicted protein was 130 kDa. Since the cDNA hybridized at 56A or 56B on the second chromosome, which was determined by in situ hybridization with polytene chromosomes (data not shown), we named the gene Dfak56. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative product of theDfak56 gene showed the presence of a protein kinase domain. Like FAK and PYK2, Dfak56 has large N- and C-terminal sequences flanking the kinase domain. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the Dfak56 kinase domain with the protein sequence data bases revealed that the kinase domain of Dfak56 is most similar to that of FAK (59% identity to human FAK) and PYK2 (52% identity to human PYK2) (Fig.1 B). The sequences of the N- and C-terminal regions are relatively divergent. The amino acid sequence alignment of the kinase domains of these proteins is shown in Fig. 1 C. Unlike the vertebrate counterparts, Dfak56 contains an additional 24-amino acid sequence near the ATP-binding site of the kinase. In the C-terminal regions, FAK and PYK2 have a conserved sequence of ∼150 amino acid residues. The sequence is called the focal adhesion targeting sequence because it is essential for localization of FAK to focal adhesions (32Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Dfak56 also carries a focal adhesion targeting-like sequence (∼40% identity to human FAK) in the C-terminal region (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the focal adhesion targeting sequence is conserved as a functional domain. There are tyrosine phosphorylation sites within FAK that are conserved in PYK2. A major autophosphorylation site (Y397AEI for human FAK and Y402AEI for human PYK2) that mediates binding to the SH2 domain of Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases is well conserved in Dfak56 (Y430AEI). Another tyrosine phosphorylation site (Y925ENV for FAK and Y881LNV for PYK2) serves for binding of the GRB2 SH2 domain. Tyrosine 954 in Dfak56 is likely to correspond to this phosphorylation site, although the sequence is slightly divergent (Y954CAT). The C-terminal region of FAK has two PXXP motifs, P712PKPSRP and P874PKKPPRP, which can bind to the SH3 domain. These sequences are highly conserved in PYK2, and only one of them (P772PSKPSR, corresponding to P712PKPSRP of FAK) is conserved in Dfak56. We conclude that Dfak56 is aDrosophila homolog of vertebrate FAK family protein-tyrosine kinases. The sequence data did not reveal which kinase, FAK or PYK2, is the counterpart of Dfak56. Southern hybridization analysis strongly suggested thatDfak56 is a single-copy gene of Drosophila (Fig.2 A). Moreover, under less stringent washing conditions, no bands other than those forDfak56 were found (data not shown). Therefore, we tentatively concluded that Drosophila contains no close relatives of Dfak56. Northern hybridization analysis of Drosophilapoly(A)+-selected RNAs from various developmental stages (embryo, larva, pupa, and adult) and cell lines showed that two mRNA species of ∼5 and 6 kb hybridized with the Dfak56cDNA probe (Fig. 2 B). A short transcript of ∼1.5 kb was also detected in embryonic and larval RNA samples. This short transcript did not hybridize to the cDNA probe corresponding to the 5′-portion (including the coding region N-terminal to the kinase domain) of the Dfak56 mRNA, suggesting that this transcript corresponds to the 3′-portion of the Dfak56mRNA. The expression of a short transcript was also reported in the case of the avian FAK gene (33Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To determine the spatial expression of the Dfak56 gene, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization with the embryos. In stage 16 embryos, strong expression of theDfak56 mRNA was detected in the central nervous system and the junction of muscle and epidermis (Fig.3, A and B). Immunohistochemical analysis also showed expression of the Dfak56 protein in the muscle attachment (Fig. 3 C). A cross-sectioned view of the immunostained image suggests that Dfak56 is expressed predominantly in the epidermal cells, but less or not at all in the muscular cells (Fig. 3 D). We examined the subcellular localization of the Dfak56 protein using theDrosophila neuronal cell line BG2-c6 (25Ui K. Nishihara S. Sakuma M. Togashi S. Ueda R. Miyata Y. Miyake T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30: 209-216Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The BG2-c6 cells expressed the Dfak56 mRNA (Fig. 2 B). They also expressed integrins, and formation of integrin clusters was observed in cells with several focal adhesion proteins, including p21-activated kinase and α-actinin (30Takagi Y. Ui T.K. Miyake T. Hirohashi S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 244: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining of the BG2-c6 cells with anti-Dfak56 antibodies produced a focal adhesion-like pattern (Fig.4 A). The nucleus was also stained with these antibodies. In some populations, the edges of the cells were also stained. Staining with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody produced a pattern that overlapped with that of anti-Dfak56 antibodies, except for the nucleus (Fig. 4 B). Staining with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-βPS integrin antibodies (Fig. 4 C) showed colocalization of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with integrin. These data suggested that Dfak56 is a component of focal adhesion in Drosophila. We tested for protein kinase activity and phosphorylation of Dfak56 with mutational analysis. By site-directed mutagenesis, an amino acid substitution at residue 430 (tyrosine to phenylalanine) was introduced (Y430F mutant). This residue corresponds to the major autophosphorylation site in vertebrate FAK (tyrosine 397). We also substituted methionine for lysine at residue 513, a possible ATP-binding site essential for tyrosine kinase activity (K513M mutant). The cDNAs for the wild-type Dfak56 protein and the mutant proteins constructed in expression plasmids were then introduced in simian COS cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dfak56 antibodies, and the precipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay. Autophosphorylation of the Dfak56 protein was observed in the wild-type protein and the Y430F mutant, but not in the K513M mutant (Fig.5 A). The Dfak56 kinase activity observed was not attributable to co-immunoprecipitated kinases because the lysine at residue 513 of Dfak56 was essential for the kinase activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitrophosphorylated Dfak56 detected phosphorylated tyrosine only (Fig.5 B), confirming that Dfak56 is a protein-tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, the incorporated radioactivity of the phosphorylated Y430F mutant was approximately half that of wild-type Dfak56 (Fig.5 A), suggesting that the tyrosine at residue 430 is a major autophosphorylation site. This was confirmed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the wild-type and Y430F mutant proteins (Fig.5 C). A major spot in the peptide map of wild-type Dfak56 (arrow) was not observed in that of the Y430F mutant. Drosophila S2 cells and stable transfectants (34Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 116: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar) expressing Drosophila PS integrin chains of αPS1 and βPS (called PS1 cells) or αPS2 and βPS (called PS2 cells) were cultured on plastic dishes. Among them, only PS2 cells could attach to a plastic dish in serum-containing medium because of the cross-reactivity of αPS2βPS integrin to vertebrate vitronectin and fibronectin (34Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 116: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). Using these cell lines, the levels of phosphotyrosine in the Dfak56 protein were examined following integrin-dependent cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. As shown in Fig. 6, the Dfak56 protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated in PS2 cells that attached to the surface of the dish. This indicated that Dfak56 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin-dependent cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Note that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 50–60 kDa were associated with the Dfak56 protein (Fig. 6). These phosphoproteins were also present in the anti-Dfak56 precipitates of PS1 cells or suspended PS2 cells, but not in precipitates of parental S2 cells. This suggests that the interaction between Dfak56 and these phosphoproteins requires the presence of integrins and is enhanced by cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. We have identified a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate focal adhesion kinase and termed it Dfak56. Dfak56 shares both sequence and structural homology with the vertebrate FAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases (FAK and PYK2). We demonstrated that Dfak56 is tyrosine-phosphorylated following integrin-dependent cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. This property is the unique functional feature that distinguishes FAK from PYK2. Thus, we conclude that Dfak56 is a functional homolog of vertebrate FAK rather than PYK2. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and PYK2 occurs in response to a number of stimuli, and some of them overlap (stimuli for the G-protein-coupled receptor, e.g. bradykinin) (35Tippmer S. Bossenmaier B. Haring H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 37Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that the biochemical function of FAK and PYK2 is partly interchangeable. Furthermore, the similarity of the kinase domains between FAK and PYK2 (50–60% amino acid identity) is almost the same as that between Dfak56 and FAK or PYK2. Therefore, we strongly suspect that Drosophila has only one FAK-related gene and that the ancestor gene duplicated and diverged in vertebrates during evolution. In chicken embryonic fibroblasts, the FAK gene is alternatively transcribed to generate another short mRNA that encodes a C-terminal portion of the FAK protein named FAK-related non-kinase (33Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of FAK-related non-kinase in fibroblasts blocks the formation of focal adhesions on fibronectin, acting as an inhibitor of FAK (38Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We observed a relatively short, 1.5-kb transcript corresponding to the 3′-portion of the Dfak56mRNA only in embryo and larva (Fig. 2 B). This mRNA might encode a FAK-related non-kinase-like protein. If so, Dfak56-mediated cell adhesion processes may be regulated by the expression of this FAK-related non-kinase-like protein in embryogenesis. Dfak56 expression is mainly observed in the embryonic central nervous system and the muscle attachment process. In muscle attachment, PS integrins and tiggrin, the ligand for αPS2βPS integrin, are expressed. Mutants defective for these proteins show improper formation of muscle attachment, resulting in embryonic lethality (39Leptin M. Bogaert T. Lehmann R. Wilcox M. Cell. 1989; 56: 401-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 40Bunch T.A. Graner M.W. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Schneider K.D. Kerschen A. Choy L.P. Burgess B.W. Brower D.L. Development ( Camb. ). 1998; 125: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrate neurons, FAK is highly expressed and localized to a growth cone (41Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,42Stevens G.R. Zhang C. Berg M.M. Lambert M.P. Barber K. Cantallops I. Routtenberg A. Klein W.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that FAK plays a role in neural development and axon guidance. Recently, the role of integrins in axon guidance inDrosophila was determined (43Hoang B. Chiba A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7847-7855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Null mutations in either the αPS1 or αPS2 subunit gene caused widespread axon pathfinding errors that could be rescued by supplying the wild-type integrin subunit to the mutant nervous system. Another novel α integrin subunit gene, Volado, was identified to mediate olfactory learning of Drosophila (44Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D. Wu K.H. Zhu X.R. Davis R.L. Nature. 1998; 391: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the integrin-mediated signal transduction pathway is important for the function of the central nervous system. Given the similar expression patterns and the close functional relation between integrins and FAK in vertebrates, Dfak56 may also participate in neural functions of Drosophila. One of the most effective strategies for the study of signal transduction pathways is to identify novel upstream or downstream factors of the known players in the signaling cascade. The genetics ofDrosophila are suited for the large-scale screening to isolate the suppressor or enhancer if a visible mutant of the interested gene is available. Using this system, a number of the novel molecules implicated in the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways have been identified (45Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 46Raabe T. Riesgo E.J. Liu X. Bausenwein B.S. Deak P. Maroy P. Hafen E.

Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the locus of the Dfak56 gene, polytene band 56A to 56B, we could not find mutant alleles for the Dfak56 gene in the FlyBase data base. However, if we could isolate the mutants ofDfak56, the genetics of Drosophila would allow analysis of the cell adhesion signaling, and the findings would relate back to studies of higher organisms. In conclusion, we cloned Dfak56, a Drosophilahomolog of the FAK gene, and characterized its product by determining its expression, kinase activity, and signaling through integrin-mediated cell attachment. Future genetic studies would facilitate the analysis of the roles of FAK family proteins in vivo. We thank T. Todo for the cDNA library and D. L. Brower for the integrin-expressing cell lines."

This aberrant phenotype persists when cells are grown without lovastatin for up to 37 days. The inability to regulate HMGR degradation is not due to its overproduction since in LP-90 cells, which were selected for lovastatin resistance in lipoprotein-deficient serum, HMGR is overexpressed, yet its turnover is regulated normally. Also, the rapid degradation of transfected α subunit of T cell receptor is markedly retarded in L-90 cells. These results show that in addition to gene amplification and overexpression of cholesterogenic enzymes, statin resistance can follow loss of regulated HMGR degradation.

Cells must constantly synthesize MVA yet avoid accumulation of these products to toxic levels. This problem is especially acute in mammalian cells since cholesterol, the bulk end product of the MVA pathway, can be obtained also by receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoproteins (LDL). Classical experiments by Brown and Goldstein (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar) and their co-workers have demonstrated that the increase in intracellular levels of LDL-derived cholesterol triggers a feedback response that down-regulates the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and represses endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Conversely, depletion of cholesterol leads to increased surface expression of LDLR and enhanced rate of cholesterol synthesis (6Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Kaneko I. Endo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major regulatory step in the MVA pathway is the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA by the enzyme HMGR. Early experiments have shown that cultured mammalian cells maintain low rate of endogenous MVA production even in the presence of saturating amounts of sterols. HMGR activity can be fully repressed only if the synthesis of MVA-derived nonsterol is allowed, suggesting that HMGR activity (hence MVA synthesis) is controlled through multivalent feedback regulation by sterol and nonsterol MVA-derived metabolite(s) (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were greatly advanced by the discovery of statins, potent HMGR inhibitors, such as compactin and lovastatin (8Endo A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1569-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Alberts A.W. Chen J. Curon G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshau H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R.

When naive cells are exposed to statins in their growth medium, they respond by drastically increasing the amounts of HMGR to overcome the acute depletion in endogenously synthesized sterol and nonsterol compounds (6Brown M.S.

Thus, when cells are starved for sterols/MVA, the enzyme is stabilized and its half-life is prolonged, whereas abundance of sterols/MVA leads to its rapid degradation. The mechanisms underlying the regulated degradation of HMGR are not yet fully understood. Unlike other early enzymes in the MVA pathway, HMGR is a resident glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with its active site, contained within the C-terminal portion of the protein, facing the cytosol (23Liscum L. Cummings R.D. Anderson R.G.W. DeMartino G.N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7165-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A highly conserved N-terminal hydrophobic domain, which spans the membrane eight times, anchors the enzyme in the ER (24Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J.

Deletion analyses have demonstrated that the membrane domain is dispensable for catalytic activity, yet it is essential for the regulated turnover of the enzyme (22Chin D.J. Gil G. Faust J.R.

Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Moreover, when fused to the N termini of heterologous proteins, e.g. β-galactosidase of E. coli, the membrane domain confers ER localization and sterol/MVA-regulated degradation onto this chimeric HMGal protein (26Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the membrane domain is believed to function as a sensor that monitors the levels of sterols and/or MVA-derived nonsterols in the ER membrane (29Kumagai H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Other key questions relate to the intracellular site(s) of degradation, the role of potential trans-acting factor(s) that recognize HMGR and tag it for rapid elimination when sterols/MVA are abundant, and the protease(s) that actually destroys the HMGR protein. Current evidence indicates that HMGR is degraded in the ER (31Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a process that involves a yet unidentified short-lived protein(s) (31Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, HMGR degradation is severely inhibited by ALLN (33Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) suggesting the participation of the 26 S proteasome. Indeed, a mutation in the 26 S proteasome has been shown to affect HMGR degradation in yeast (36Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although conjugation of multi-ubiquitin chains to HMGR was demonstrated in yeast (37Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it remains to be established whether the ubiquitin pathway is involved also in the degradation of mammalian HMGR. To gain further insight into the regulated degradation of HMGR, we sought to isolate cells that are defective in this process. In this work, we describe a CHO-derived cell line, designated L-90, that was selected for growth in the presence of serum lipoproteins and increasing concentrations of lovastatin. Our results demonstrate that L-90 cells survived the lovastatin selection by increasing the levels of HMGR enzyme, in part by losing their ability to degrade HMGR in a regulated manner. Analysis of L-90 cells should provide information on cellular factors that are involved in HMGR turnover.

Compactin was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Simoni, Stanford University. Lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum (LPDS;d ≥1.25) and human LDL (d 1.019–1.063) were prepared by ultracentrifugation, as described (38Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S.

Peffley (Finch University of Health Sciences/the Chicago Medical School), and full-length cDNA of human LDLR (44Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) was provided by E. Leitersdorf (Hebrew University/Haddassah Medical School). Antibodies against HMGS, the cytoplasmic domain of HMGR, and FPPS were kindly provided by P. Edwards. An anti-rat SQS antibody was a gift from I. Shechter. Antibodies against the membrane domain of HMGR were described previously (24Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The anti-β-galactosidase antibody was either a mouse monoclonal (Promega) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cappel Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA). Protein A bacterial adsorbent and protein A-agarose were obtained from Sigma and Bio-Rad, respectively. CHO cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator in FCS (“F”) medium (MEM supplemented with 5% FCS, 2 mmglutamine, 100U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). L-90 cells were selected in this medium with increasing concentrations of lovastatin (5, 7, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 μm) over a 4-month period. L-90 cells are continuously maintained in FCS medium plus 90 μm lovastatin. To obtain LP-90 cells, CHO cells were first adapted to grow for 2 months in “L” medium (MEM supplemented with 5% LPDS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and then selected, in the same stepwise fashion, for lovastatin resistance in LPDS medium. LP-90 cells are continuously maintained in LPDS medium plus 90 μmlovastatin. In experiments where transfected cells were used, all media also contained 250 μg/ml geneticin. For CHO cells, LPDS medium was supplemented with 2 μm compactin and 100 μmMVA (32Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For L-90 and LP-90 cells, LPDS medium contained 90 μm lovastatin without MVA. Where indicated, the respective LPDS medium was also supplemented with 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 μg/ml cholesterol from a 200× stock solution in absolute ethanol (LPDS + ST; “S”) or with 20 mm MVA from a 2 m stock solution (LPDS + MVA; “M”). CHO and L-90 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE with 2 μg of each of the above-described promoter-Luc plasmids together with 0.2 μg of βGal-Neo, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in a medium containing 750 μg/ml geneticin, and 300–500 resistant colonies were pooled and expanded. The cells were maintained continuously in 250 μg/ml of the antibiotic. Lines expressing HMGal (pHMGal-Neo) or soluble β-galactosidase (pβGal-Neo) were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated plasmids. Clones expressing highest β-galactosidase activity were isolated by limiting dilution. Genomic DNA was adsorbed onto GeneScreen Plus membrane using a slot blot filtration manifold. Following UV cross-linking and prehybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 60 °C with 3 × 106 cpm/ml of an ∼1.4-kb 32P-labeledEcoRI-PstI cDNA fragment of hamster HMGR membrane-spanning region in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (30 min; 42 °C), 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS (60 min; 42 °C), 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS (40 min; 42 °C), and an additional 30 min wash at 50 °C in the same solution. The membrane was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The radioactive probe was stripped (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.58Google Scholar), and the membrane was successively re-probed with 32P-labeled human LDLR and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs. To prepare an antisense RNA probe for HMGR, we amplified a 206-base pair DNA fragment from the cytoplasmic domain of Chinese hamster HMGR using pDGS6 plasmid as the template and oligonucleotides 5′-CGGAATTCGTGCCTGGATGGTAAAGAG-3′ ((46) positions 1629–1648, including an EcoRI site), and 5′-CCGGTACCGGGTGTTTCAAGCCAGGCC-3′ ((46) positions 1833–1814 plus aKpnI site) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and ligated into BlueScript. The plasmid was linearized withNotI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using MaxiScriptTM kit obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Similarly, 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe for the S17 ribosomal protein was transcribed using the AvaII-digested pRPS17 plasmid (17Gayen A.K. Peffley D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted with RNAzol B reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) and hybridized overnight at 50 °C with gel-purified antisense probes, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (RPAIITM kit; Ambion). Following RNase digestion, the protected fragments were analyzed by 8 m urea/PAGE and autoradiography. After exposure, the protected bands were cut out of the gel and quantified by liquid scintillation. On Day 0, CHO (8 × 105) or L-90 (1.2 × 106) cells were plated in FCS medium in 60-mm dishes. On Day 1, the cells were refed with LPDS medium containing 2 μm compactin plus 100 μm MVA (CHO) or 90 μm lovastatin (L-90). On Day 2, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were starved for 1 h in 1 ml of starvation medium (methionine- and cysteine-free MEM supplemented with 5% LPDS and 2 μm compactin, 100 μm MVA (CHO) or 90 μm lovastatin (L-90 and LP-90)). The cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min in 0.5 ml of starvation medium containing 100–150 μCi of Expre35S35S protein labeling mix and chased in LPDS medium supplemented with 2 mmmethionine. Unless otherwise noted (e.g. Fig. 11), L-90 and LP-90 cells were chased in LPDS medium containing 90 μmlovastatin. CHO cells were chased in LPDS medium containing 2 μm compactin plus 100 μm MVA. Where indicated, sterols (2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 20 μg/ml cholesterol) or MVA (20 mm) were added to the chase medium. The cells were lysed, processed for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies, and samples were resolved by 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, as described previously (32Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because L-90 and LP-90 cells contain high levels of enzyme, only 10–13% of lysate volume was used for immunoprecipitating HMGR from these samples. This allowed comparable studies with CHO cells and ensured that HMGR was precipitated quantitatively (data not shown). For immunoblot analyses, cells were plated as described above. Twenty four h prior to analysis, the cells received fresh FCS, LPDS, LPDS + ST, or LPDS + MVA media. After lysis and estimation of protein content, samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Optitran BAS-83 reinforced nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (32Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were scraped off the dish and post-fixed in 2% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 2 h. After dehydration in graded ethanol solutions, the cells were embedded in Epon. Ultra-thin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol-1200 EX II electron microscope. On Day 0, 1 × 105 CHO cells or 1.5 × 105L-90 cells were plated in a 24-well dish in FCS medium. On Day 1, the cells were refed with LPDS medium containing 2 μm compactin plus 100 μm MVA (CHO) or 90 μm lovastatin (L-90), in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 μg/ml cholesterol. On Day 2, quadruplicate wells received 125I-LDL at 10 μg/ml (250–650 cpm/ng) in the absence or presence of 400 μg/ml unlabeled LDL. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity was determined, as described (38Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). CHO and L-90 cells were set on Day 0 in their respective FCS medium. On Day 1, the cells were washed extensively to remove lovastatin, and LPDS medium (without lovastatin) was added to both cell types. On Day 2, all dishes were washed, and triplicate plates received FCS medium with or without 90 μm lovastatin, as indicated in Table I, and the cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi of [3H]acetate. Cells were harvested, and 3H-labeled lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified, as described (47Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

On Day 1, replicate wells were washed with PBS, and the cells were refed either with fresh FCS, LPDS, LPDS + ST, or LPDS + MVA media (see above). On Day 2, the cells were washed with PBS and processed for measurements of luciferase activity, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The hydrolysis ofo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside by β-galactosidase was measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells, as described previously (26Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured either according to Lowry et al. (48Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with the protein microassay reagent (Bio-Rad). Luciferase-specific activity was calculated as light units/mg cell protein. β-Galactosidase-specific activity was calculated as A 420/mg cell protein/h. In both cases, the results are expressed as percent of the specific activity in LPDS-treated cells (“100%”) in the same experiment. X-ray films were scanned and quantified using a Model GS-690 imaging densitometer and the MultiAnalyst software package from Bio-Rad. CHO cells were selected for growth in increasing concentrations of lovastatin in the presence of serum lipoproteins (FCS medium). After each incremental increase in lovastatin concentration >90% of the cells died. Those that survived 90 μmlovastatin are designated L-90 cells and have been maintained at this concentration since June 1994. Fig. 1shows that L-90 cells are highly resistant to lovastatin (IC50 ≅ 240 μm), unlike naive CHO cells whose growth is sensitive to low concentrations of the drug (IC50 ≅ 8 μm). L-90 cells remain highly resistant to lovastatin (IC50 180–200 μm) even after culture in the absence of the drug for over 100 days (data not shown). L-90 cells are resistant to lovastatin, at least in part, due to elevated activity of the cholesterogenic pathway, as shown in TableI. When lipid synthesis and cellular content were measured, the rate of [3H]acetate incorporation into sterols was >120-fold higher in L-90 cells than in CHO cells. Moreover, whereas addition of 90 μm lovastatin totally abolished sterol synthesis in CHO cells, L-90 cells incorporated acetate into sterols in amounts comparable to sterol synthesis i"

This model suggests that in the absence of the ligand the receptor extracellular domain negatively regulates the activation of the receptor complex. To investigate this proposition, four TGF-β type I and II receptor extracellular/transmembrane-cytoplasmic and extracellular-transmembrane/cytoplasmic chimeras, TβRII-I-I and TβRI-II-II as well as TβRII-II-I and TβRI-I-II, and two extracellular domain truncated receptors TβRI-STC and TβRII-STC were generated. In either mutant mink lung R1B (lacking functional type I receptor) or DR26 (where the type II receptor is nonfunctional) cells, coexpression of two chimeric receptors, which are complementary in extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, transduced TGF-β induced signaling, as measured by the transcriptional activation of a p3TP-Lux reporter gene. Coexpression of this type of chimeric receptor with a wild-type receptor containing the opposite cytoplasmic domain exhibited a varied level of constitutive activity depending on the particular combination of the extracellular domains. In general, the type I-type I extracellular domain combination gave higher constitutive activity than the type I-type II or type II-type II combinations. Furthermore, coexpression of the extracellular domain truncated receptor with any receptor containing the opposite cytoplasmic domain always resulted in ligand independent receptor signaling. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the formation of the receptor complexes paralleled the ligand independent activation of p3TP-Lux.

They exert biological effects by binding to their cell surface receptors. The binding of the growth factor to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization/oligomerization, leading to activation of the intracellular kinase and subsequently, the intracellular signaling pathway. Although evidence has started to emerge that some receptor dimers/oligomers are preformed in the absence of ligand. The main function of the receptor extracellular domain has been thought to be ligand recognition and binding. Little has been published about other functions of motifs in the receptor extracellular domain,e.g. clustering motifs, trafficking signals, and proteosome activation. Transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-β)1 are important for intercellular communication (1ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Opin.

Biological responses to TGF-β are mediated mainly by the type I and type II cell surface receptors, referred to as TβRI and TβRII, respectively (2Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Both of these receptors comprise a small extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with serine/threonine kinase activity. There is almost 40% homology between the TβRI and TβRII kinase domains (1ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Opin.

Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Weiser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while TβRII determines ligand binding (19Ebner R. Chen R.-H.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While TGF-β binds directly to TβRII, TβRI only binds to TGF-β in the presence of TβRII and TβRII signals through TβRI. It has been proposed that TGF-β binds to TβRII, TβRI is then recruited into the complex and becomes phosphorylated by TβRII, and the phosphorylated TβRI then propagates the signal to downstream substrates (22Wrana J.L.

However, subsequent studies on heteromeric and homomeric associations of TGF-β receptors in the absence of TGF-β suggest that some fundamental questions concerning the molecular mechanism of receptor activation have yet to be answered. Experiments using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay and double immunoprecipitation analyses (27Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that full-length TβRI and TβRII can form heteromeric complexes in the absence of TGF-β. Using an antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching technique, a recent study (29Wells R.G. Gilboa L. Sun Y. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5716-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) provided evidence in live cells that TβRI and TβRII can form heteromeric receptor complexes in the absence of ligand. Heteromeric complexes were also formed between the extracellular domains as well as between the cytoplasmic domains of TβRI and TβRII in the absence of ligand (27Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More importantly, these studies indicate that the TβRI·TβRII heteromeric receptor complexes pre-exist in latent forms and TGF-β activates the complexes. Double immunoprecipitation analyses using lysates from metabolically labeled cells co-transfected with differentially epitope-tagged type II receptors have demonstrated that the type II receptors form a homomeric complex both in the presence and absence of TGF-β (30Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-independent TβRII homomeric complex formation has also been demonstrated in live cells using an immunofluorescence co-patching technique (31Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the extracellular domains of TβRII are capable of interacting with itself in the absence of TGF-β (30Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that after ligand binding, TβRII forms a heteromeric complex with TβR-2.1, a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of type II receptor and the intracellular domain of type I receptor, but this complex fails to signal any TGF-β response in R1B cells, which lack functional type I receptor (33Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzén P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β is not required for the receptor oligomerization and that receptor oligomerization is not sufficient for TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, coexpression of the cytoplasmic domains of TβRI and TβRII activates TGF-β signaling pathways in the absence of TGF-β (34Feng X.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Clearly the cytoplasmic domains of TβRI and TβRII can physically and functionally interact with each other to form an active heteromeric complex (34Feng X.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coexpression of a single cytoplasmic domain with its complementary full-length receptor also activates the signaling complex (34Feng X.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since expression of full-length receptors does not induce spontaneous signaling, these results indicate that the extracellular domains of TGF-β receptors may play roles, in addition to ligand binding, in the regulation of receptor activation and signaling. Given the observations that: (i) full-length wild-type TβRI and TβRII form a latent heteromeric receptor complex; (ii) both the extracellular and intracellular domains of TβRI and TβRII form heterodimers in the absence of TGF-β; and (iii) coexpression of the cytoplasmic domains of TβRI and TβRII results in constitutive activation of the receptors, it is reasonable to postulate that the interaction between the extracellular domains of TβRI and TβRII, in the absence of TGF-β, prevents constitutive activation of the cytoplasmic domain. Our previous work on chimeric receptors TβRI-II-I and TβRII-I-II (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), where the type I and II transmembrane domains are exchanged, and also on mutant type II receptors with progressive deletion of defined numbers of transmembrane residues (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), showed that TGF-β binding to its receptors results in a reorientational rotation of the receptor subunits leading to receptor activation (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A corollary of our receptor activation model is that the interaction between the extracellular domains of TβRI and TβRII in the absence of TGF-β constrains the receptors from rotating to form the active configuration. In order to define this latency function for the extracellular domains of TβRI and TβRII in the absence of the ligand, we have constructed a series of TGF-β chimeric receptors in which the extracellular domains or the cytoplasmic domains were interchanged or the extracellular domains were truncated in both TβRI and TβRII. The signaling activity of these chimeras and mutants in mutant mink lung cells demonstrates that the extracellular domains impose a latent state for the TβRI·TβRII heteromeric complex and that the binding of TGF-β activates the complex. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and human cDNAs ALK-5 (TβRI) (14Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and H2–3FF (TβRII) (15Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) were used to generate chimeric and extracellular truncated TGF-β receptors. The primers used were reported previously (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the following two primers were also used, where a single underline indicates the cDNAs of the type I receptor and a double underline indicates the type II receptor. Restriction sites are shown in lower case, RI-STCs(sense), cccgggGGTGGAACTGGCAGCTGTCATT, and RII-Sa(antisense),GactagtAGCAACTGAACGTGCGGTGGGATCGT. The primers were designed to exchange the type I receptor extracellular domain (125 amino acids, 1–125) or the cytoplasmic domain (356 amino acids, 148–503) with the type II receptor extracellular domain (159 amino acids, 1–159) or the cytoplasmic domain (376 amino acids, 190–565). RI-STCs and RII-Sa were designed to truncate the extracellular domains of TβRI and TβRII, respectively. The construction of TβRI(-M2), TβRI-II-I(-M2), TβRII(-HA3), TβRII-I-II(-HA3), and TβRIIΔ-1(-HA3) were described previously (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PCR products of the extracellular (E), extracellular-transmembrane (E-T), transmembrane-cytoplasmic (T-C), and cytoplasmic (C) domains of type I and II were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler withTaq DNA polymerase (BIOTECH), ALK-5 (14Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), or H2–3FF (15Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) as templates, and primers as indicated previously (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The PCR products were first ligated to a linearized pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Because of the deletion of about 20 nucleotides in the signal sequence region of TβRI (33Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzén P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using PCR amplification, primer RI-Ss was used with RI-1a or RI-2a to generate TβRI-E or TβRI-E,T, respectively. Two cDNA fragments, TβRII-E and TβRI-T,C or TβRII-E,T and TβRI-C were ligated to pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen) at HindIII and SphI sites to form TβRII-I-I(-M2) or TβRII-II-I(-M2) cDNA constructs. To create HA3-tagged TβRI-II-II(-HA3) or TβRI-I-II(-HA3), a EcoRI-XbaI fragment consisting of three repeats of hemagglutinin (HA) coding sequence replaced the corresponding fragment in TβRI(-M2)-pcDNA I/Amp (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), then at its SmaI and EcoRI sites, fragments TβRI-E and TβRII-T,C or TβRI-E,T and TβRII-C were ligated to the modified TβRI(-M2)-pcDNA I/Amp. As shown in Fig.1, TβRII-I-I consists the extracellular domain of TβRII (aa 1–159) and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains (T/CDs) of TβRI (aa 126–503) and TβRII-II-I consists of the extracellular/transmembrane domains (E-TDs) of TβRII (aa 1–189) and the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of TβRI (aa 148–503). Similarly, TβRI-II-II contains the extracellular domain of TβRI (aa 1–125) and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of TβRII (aa 160–565), and TβRI-I-II contains the E-TDs of TβRI (aa 1–147) and the CD of TβRII (aa 190–565). To generate TβRI-STC(-M2), theSmaI-SphI fragment in TβRI(-M2) was replaced by a PCR fragment using primers RI-STCs and RI-3a and ALK-5 as template. Replacement of HindIII-SpeI fragment in TβRI-II-II(-HA3) by a type II leader sequence coding fragment obtained by PCR using primers RII-1s and RII-Sa and H2–3FF as template generated TβRII-STC(-HA3). Thus, TβRI-STC contains the leader sequence, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of TβRI, with most of the extracellular domain (aa 31–123) being truncated. TβRII-STC is TβRII with a truncation of the most of the extracellular domain (aa 30–159), consisting of the leader sequence, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Mutant mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells R1B and DR26 (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M.

The cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Australia), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using a DEAE-dextran (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) or FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) protocol and transfected cells were assayed 48 or 72 h later. 125I-TGF-β was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Binding and affinity cross-linking assays using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce) were performed as described previously (27Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transient transfection with TGF-β receptor constructs, COS-1 cells in 6-well plates were washed with binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.9 mmCaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated on ice for 3 h with 0.4 μCi of 125I-TGF-β/well in 200 μl of binding buffer. After incubation, the cells were washed with the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin and cross-linked with 0.5 ml of 0.28 mm BS3 (in binding buffer without bovine serum albumin) for 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 25 mmTris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.5% Trasylol (Bayer). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-M2 FLAG antibody-conjugated beads (IBI and Eastman Kodak Co.) followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide and autoradiography. The p3TP-Lux (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) TGF-β inducible luciferase reporter construct, containing a region of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene promoter and three repeats of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements upstream of the luciferase gene (12Wrana J.L.

Roberts (National Institutes of Health). p3TP-Lux (6 μg) was co-transfected into mutant Mv1Lu cells together with 6 μg of TGF-β receptor construct(s). The cells in a 10-cm dish were divided into six wells in 6-well plates 24 h after transfection. At 48 h post-transfection, the media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and three wells of each transfected cell line were stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml). Thereafter, cells were lysed in 100 μl/well lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Cell lysates (20 μl/well) were used to measure the total light emission in 10 s using a luminometer (ML 3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer). The cell lysates were also analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide and Western blotting. Anti-M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from IBI, Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-HA3 polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from D. Bowtell, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne. Our previous work demonstrated that the C-terminal M2-tagged TGF-β type I and C-terminal HA3-tagged type II receptors are functional (35Zhu H.-J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The M2 and HA3 tags facilitate the detection of each receptor type. Tagged type I and type II receptors, TβRI(-M2) and TβRII(-HA3) were transfected into COS-1 cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Expression of receptors containing the type I cytoplasmic domain (Fig.2A) and receptors containing the type II cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2 B) was confirmed. COS-1 cells transfected with chimeric receptor cDNAs were used to determine the ligand binding properties. Binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to chimeric receptors was confirmed by affinity cross-linking (Fig.2 C). Both M2-tagged TβRII-I-I and TβRII-II-I bind TGF-β (Fig. 2 C). The HA3-tagged TβRI-II-II and TβRI-I-II are also present after cross-linking with125I-TGF-β1 and immunoprecipitation with anti-M2 (TβRII-I-I or TβRII-II-I) antibody (Fig. 2 C), which confirms the formation of complementary extracellular/intracellular chimeric receptor complexes. These results indicate that these C-terminal tagged chimeric receptors are expressed, transported to the cell surface, bind TGF-β, and form receptor complexes. TGF-β induces expression of PAI-1 (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Consequently the induction of PAI-1 can be used as a measure of TGF-β signaling activity (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). A reporter gene construct, p3TP-Lux (21Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which PAI-1 promoter drives expression of luciferase, and TGF-β receptor construct(s) were co-transfected into Mv1Lu mutant cells, R1B or DR26 cells (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). R1B cells express endogenous TβRII but lack functional TβRI and are not responsive to TGF-β stimulation while DR26 cells express endogenous TβRI but lack functional TβRII and do not transduce TGF-β induced signal (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Thereby the luciferase activity correlates with the receptor activation. We demonstrated successful expression and TGF-β binding of TβRII-I-I and TβRII-II-I as well as TβRI-II-II and TβRI-I-II in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2). However, when each of the four extracellular/cytoplasmic chimeric receptor constructs was transfected alone in either R1B or DR26 cells, the TGF-β responsiveness was not restored (Fig.3), although the wild-type TβRI restored the responsiveness in R1B cells as did TβRII in DR26 cells (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with previous studies (33Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzén P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

The resultant fluorescent derivatives, AD-S-1 and BD-S-1, have the same fluorophore at either SH2 or SH1, which was verified by inspections of changes in the ATPases and the localization of fluorescence after tryptic digestion and CNBr cleavage for the two derivatives. Especially, AD was found to be a very useful fluorescent reagent that readily reacts with only SH2 of S-1. Measurements of the nucleotide-induced changes in fluorescence emission spectra of AD-S-1 and BD-S-1 suggested that during ATP hydrolysis the environment around the fluorophore at SH2 is very distinct from that around the fluorophore at SH1, being defined as that the former has the hydrophobic and closed characteristics, whereas the latter has the hydrophilic and open ones. The KI quenching study of the fluorescence of the two S-1 derivatives confirmed these results. The most straightforward interpretation for the present results is that during ATP hydrolysis, the helix containing SH2 is buried in hydrophobic side chains and rather reinforced, whereas the adjacent helix containing SH1 moves away from its stabilizing tertiary structural environment.

Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1962; 85: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the S-1 structure is a long helix spanning 85 Å that is stabilized by interactions with the myosin light chains (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R.

It has been proposed that this light chain-binding domain acts as a semi rigid “lever arm” to amplify and transmit conformational changes in the ATP and actin binding sites of S-1 (3Lowey S.

Cys707 (SH1) and Cys697 (SH2) are located on the two different helixes in the C-terminal segment of the S-1 catalytic domain and separated from one another by 19 Å (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R.

The two helixes are kinked at a conserved glycine residue (Gly699) found in a bend joining two helixes. Recent experiments have led to a conclusion that the fulcrum point for the swinging motion of the lever arm is in the vicinity of the SH1-SH2 region (4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R.

Furthermore, Gly699 (close to SH2) and Gly710 (close to SH1) have been proposed to act as pivot points or flexible hinges for such motion (8Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

However, the precise conformational changes of this region that are involved in lever arm movement are still unknown. One approach for understanding the involvement of the SH1-SH2 region in lever arm movement is a precise comparison of the individual conformational changes around SH1 and SH2 during ATPase cycle of S-1. Such a study could provide new insights into the mechanism of the lever arm movement in the generation of force. Although the conformational changes around SH1 have extensively been studied, little is known about those around SH2 (12Phan B.C. Peyser Y.M. Reisler E. Muhlrad A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Ajtai K. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Hiratsuka T. J. Biol.

A recurrent question is whether SH2 is mobile or stationary. Several reports have suggested that SH2 is mobile (16Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rajasekharan K.N. Mayadevi M. Burke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10810-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kasprazk A.A. Chaussepied P. Morales M.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9230-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Xing and Cheung (19Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have indicated that SH2 was relatively immobilized even in the presence of nucleotides. One approach to examine the mobility of SH2 is to attach a sensitive fluorescent probe covalently to SH2. However, little is known about a simple method for the fluorescent labeling of SH2 (20Reisler E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, I have initiated a study of covalent fluorescent probes that react specifically with SH2. Several fluorescent probes were examined in an attempt to label only SH2. Of the compounds tested, 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (AD) was chosen as a specific fluorescent label for SH2 (SchemeFS1). Furthermore, an attempt at the labeling of SH1 with the same fluorophore as that labeled with SH2 was made to obtain a consistent view of conformational changes around the two thiols. Finally 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (BD) was chosen as a fluorescent label for SH1. The resultant AD and BD derivatives of S-1 have the same fluorophore, the 6-acyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene group, at either SH1 or SH2. Unlike the vast majority of the more commonly used fluorophores, the noncovalent fluorescent probe prodan, the parent fluorophore of AD and BD (Scheme FS1), should be particularly well suited to probe the surface of proteins by virtue of the exquisite sensitivity of the fluorophore to minor changes in the environment (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7167-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It gives a 130-nm shift in the emission maximum from 401 nm in cyclohexane to 531 nm in water (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Thus the emission maximum of the fluorophore would truly be a polarity sensor for proteins. Furthermore, the half-widths of the emission spectra of the prodan fluorophore provide an indication of the accessibility of solvent molecule to the fluorophore attached to proteins (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Thus these remarkable properties of the prodan fluorophore are utilized in the present study to describe precise differences between SH2 and SH1 of S-1 in their environmental changes during ATPase cycle of S-1. AD and BD were purchased from Molecular Probes. IAEDANS was from Aldrich. IAA was from Wako Pure Chemicals. α-Chymotrypsin, diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and AMP-PNP were from Sigma. ATP and ADP were from Kohjin. Other reagents were reagent or biochemical research grade. S-1 was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (25Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm as in my previous works (14Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24742-24750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with protein samples were carried out in the following buffers: buffer A (25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2), buffer B (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5m KCl, and 5 mm CaCl2), and buffer C (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m KCl, and 5 mm EDTA). Fluorescent labeling of S-1 with AD and BD was performed at 7 °C in buffer A in the dark. S-1 (2–2.5 mg/ml) was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of the reagent over S-1. Because AD and BD were scarcely soluble in water, the reaction mixtures contained 0.3% N, N-dimethylformamide. The addition of 0.3% N, N-dimethylformamide had no effect on the K+-, Mg2+-, and Ca2+-ATPases of S-1. The reaction was stopped by the addition of dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 2 mm. The labeled S-1 was then separated from the unreacted reagent and the reaction products with dithiothreitol by passage through 1.5 × 9-cm columns of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 30 mm KCl. For measurements of ATPase activities, the samples were compared with a control subjected to the same conditions but excluding the reagent. The stoichiometry of the incorporated fluorophore/S-1 was determined from the absorption spectra in 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 30 mm KCl using extinction coefficients of 12,000 ± 300m−1 cm−1 at 382 nm for AD-S-1 and 12,300 ± 100 m−1 cm−1 at 392 nm for BD-S-1. These values were determined by comparing the absorption spectrum of the labeled S-1 with the amount of the thiol groups decreased. The labeled S-1, in which 0.62–0.98 thiol group/mol of S-1 had been labeled, was used for all experiments. The specific modifications of SH1 of S-1 with IAEDANS and IAA was done according to the procedures of Takashi et al. (26Takashi R. Duke J. Ue K. Morales M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Kunz et al. (27Kunz P.A. Walser J.T. Watterson J.G. Schaub M.C. FEBS Lett. 1977; 83: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively. The resultant derivatives of S-1, in which 1–1.1 thiol groups/mol of S-1 had been modified, exhibited 5–10% of the K+-ATPase activity and 310–360% of the Ca2+-ATPase activity relative to those of control S-1. Thiol titrations were carried out to determine the extent of modification of thiol groups in S-1 by the method of Ellman's titration (28Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar), as described previously (14Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24742-24750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For unlabeled S-1, the amounts of thiol groups/mol of S-1 were 9.6 ± 0.15. These values were in excellent agreement with the values reported previously (29Schaub M.C. Watterson J.G. Walser J.T. Waser P.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Hiratsuka T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Limited cleavage of the fluorescent derivatives of S-1 with trypsin and subsequent cleavage of the trypsinized samples at Asn-Gly bonds with hydroxyl amine (31Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3281-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously (14Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24742-24750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CNBr cleavage of fluorescent derivatives of S-1 were performed by the method of Elzinga and Collins (32Elzinga M. Collins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4281-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After CNBr cleavage, the samples were dialyzed against water with Spectropore 3 dialysis tubing (M r cut-off = 3,500). Finally, the samples were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 30 °C. For SDS-PAGE, all the fragmented samples were dissolved with a solution containing 2% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 34% sucrose, and 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. SDS-PAGE was carried out by the system of Weber and Osborn (33Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 7.5 and 15% acrylamide gels, as described previously (16Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of fluorescence in the fluorescent derivatives of S-1, the S-1 samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then relative amounts of fluorescence extracted from peptide bands were measured as described previously (34Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+- and K+-ATPase activities were measured at 25 °C in 1 mm ATP in buffers B and C, respectively. Piliberated was determined by the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (35Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ATPase activities of the unlabeled S-1 in μmol of Pi/min/mg were: K+-ATPase, 10; Ca2+-ATPase, 1.2. All spectral measurements of the thiol-modified derivatives of S-1 were performed in buffer A. Absorption spectra were measured at room temperature with a Shimadzu MPS-2000 spectrophotometer. Corrected fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a thermostatted Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (model MPF-4). All fluorescence measurements with S-1 samples (0.4–0.75 μm) were performed in the presence and absence of ligands (1 mm). Because fluorescence measurements were completed within 15 min, the data in the presence of ATP were regarded as those obtained during the steady state of ATP hydrolysis. Excitation wavelength was 390 nm. The slit widths on excitation and emission monochromators were 5 nm. For the measurements of the labeling rates of S-1 with AD and BD, increases in fluorescence at 500 nm were monitored at 7 °C. The freshly prepared KI solution was used. The stock solution (5 m) contained 10−4m sodium thiosulfate to prevent oxidation of I−. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C with excitation and emission lights of 390 and 500 nm, respectively. Data were shown as Stern-Volmer plots to obtain the quenching constant,K SV (36Stern O. Volmer M. Phys. Z. 1919; 20: 183Google Scholar). Concentrations of thiol-modified S-1 were determined by the biuret method, standardized against control S-1. Control experiments showed that the modification of S-1 did not interfere with protein determinations by the biuret methods. S-1 was assumed to have an M r of 120,000 (25Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Alkylation of S-1 with IAA and IAEDANS invariably results in the modification of only SH1 (20Reisler E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Takashi R. Duke J. Ue K. Morales M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Kunz P.A. Walser J.T. Watterson J.G. Schaub M.C. FEBS Lett. 1977; 83: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although chemical properties of BD had scarcely been studied, the reagent was expected to be useful as a specific fluorescent label for SH1 of S-1. This is because the reactivity of the functional group of BD, the bromoacetyl group, is similar to those of functional groups of IAA and IAEDANS (Scheme FS1). On the other hand, the structure of the fluorophore moiety of BD, the 6-acyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene group, is the same as those of another thiol reagent AD and the noncovalent probe prodan (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus BD can be expected to show fluorescence that is extremely sensitive to solvent polarity as well as prodan and AD (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Marriott G. Zechel K. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6214-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Hiratsuka T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7167-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra of BD and AD derivatives of S-1 exhibited a maximum at 278 nm together with those at 382 nm (AD-S-1) and 392 nm (BD-S-1) (Fig.1). The maxima around 380–390 nm are associated entirely with the 6-acyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene moiety of AD and BD (21Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon excitation at 390 nm, the S-1 derivatives fluoresced strongly with a single maximum at 502 nm (AD-S-1) and 508 nm (BD-S-1) (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the AD adduct of 2-mercapto-ethanol fluoresced at 535 nm (Fig. 1, inset). However, the fluorescence intensity of AD itself was less than 4% relative to that of the fluorescent adduct. Similar results were obtained in the case of the reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol with BD (not shown). This indicates that the formation of the fluorescent derivatives of S-1 can be conveniently monitored by measurements of an increase in fluorescence that is associated with fluorophores attached to S-1 (see below). Fig. 2 shows the time courses of labeling of S-1 with AD, which occurred at 7 °C with a 3-fold molar excess of AD over S-1. They were followed by measurements of the amount of labeled thiol groups and fluorescence increase at 500 nm. The time courses obtained by both measurements agreed well. The data indicate that the labeling of S-1 is relatively rapid for the first 30 min and much slower thereafter. The labeling reaction was completed in 1 h, resulting in the incorporation of 0.8–1.0 AD group/mol of S-1. It should be noted that the existence of 0.9 mol of the first-labeled thiol group is indicated by extraporation of the slow labeling to zero time. Fig. 2 (inset) shows the relationship between the percentage of remaining ATPase activities of AD-S-1 and the number of the labeled thiol groups/mol of S-1. The K+-ATPase activity was decreased linearly with increasing amount of the labeled thiol group. The decrease of 1 mol of thiol group led to a 70% loss of activity. On the other hand, the Ca2+-ATPase activity was scarcely affected by the labeling. Fig. 3 A shows the time course of the labeling of S-1 with BD, which has occurred under the same condition as that of the labeling with AD (Fig. 2). The rate of the labeling with BD was much faster than that of the labeling with AD. 1 mol of thiol group/mol of S-1 was labeled within 5 min. The existence of 1 mol of the first-labeled thiol group/mol of S-1 was indicated by extraporation of the slow labeling to zero time. However, unlike the labeling with AD, another thiol group of S-1 was also labeled within 25 min (see below). The effect of BD on the K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities of S-1 was also followed. Fig. 3 B shows that as thiol groups are labeled with BD the Ca2+-ATPase activity increases, while the K+-ATPase activity decreases. When 1.2 thiol group/mol of S-1 was labeled, the Ca2+-ATPase activity was increased to 220% of the original value. Thereafter, the activity began to plateau and then decreased. The linear relationship between the Ca2+-ATPase activity and the loss of K+-ATPase activity was observed (Fig. 3 B,inset). The enzymatic properties of fluorescent derivatives of S-1 described above are indicative of the labeling of SH1 with BD and SH2 with AD (12Phan B.C. Peyser Y.M. Reisler E. Muhlrad A. Eur. J.

To ascertain this point, the locations of AD and BD attached to S-1 were defined by fragmenting the S-1 samples with both trypsin and CNBr (16Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Elzinga M. Collins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4281-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All the samples were run on SDS-PAGE, followed by the examination under UV illumination. The S-1 derivative where SH1 had been fluorescently labeled with IAEDANS (26Takashi R. Duke J. Ue K. Morales M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was also used as a standard. As shown in Fig. 4 A, all fluorescent labels are predominantly localized in the heavy chain of S-1. However, some labeling of light chain-1 was found with BD. Relative amounts of fluorescence extracted from peptides bands of heavy chain and the combined light chains were 93 and 7% (IAEDANS-S-1), 78 and 22% (BD-S-1), and 91 and 9% (AD-S-1), respectively. For the tryptic digests, fluorescence was found only on the 20-kDa band (Fig.4 B). Upon CNBr cleavage for the samples, fluorescence was observed on the 10-kDa segment (Fig. 4 C), showing that only thiol groups that had been labeled were either SH1 or SH2 for both the BD and AD derivatives of S-1 (32Elzinga M. Collins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4281-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is well established that hydroxylamine cleaves the 20-kDa tryptic peptide of S-1 at the single Asn-Gly bond to produce a C-terminal 13-kDa peptide containing SH1 and a 7-kDa peptide containing SH2 (31Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3281-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the usual demonstration using this hydroxylamine cut is not possible with AD and BD because of the instability of the labels to the extreme pH and temperature conditions of the hydroxylamine treatment. I found that fluorescence of the samples of AD-S-1 and BD-S-1 disappeared by the treatment, although that of the sample of IAEDANS-S-1 remained unaltered. Because of this complication I tried an indirect approach where IAA-S-1 was further labeled with BD and AD. As summarized in Table I, IAA-S-1 was further incubated with BD and AD for 3 and 30 min, respectively. For control S-1, the amount of thiol groups labeled with BD was 1.05 mol/mol of S-1. However, for IAA-S-1, the amount was diminished to be only 0.19 mol/mol of S-1. Thus 0.86 thiol group/mol of S-1 (82% of the control value) was unlabeled with BD after treatment with IAA. This suggests that BD labels SH1 predominantly together with a slight labeling of light chain-1 (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). On the other hand, the labeling with AD was scarcely affected by the pretreatment with IAA. The amounts of labeled thiol groups were 0.90 and 0.82 mol/mol of S-1 for control S-1 and IAA-S-1, respectively. This indicates that AD can specifically label SH2. SDS-PAGE patterns for the samples of AD derivatives of S-1 and IAA-S-1 confirmed this result (Fig. 4 D). In the case of labeling with AD, no difference in fluorescence intensities between S-1 and IAA-S-1 was observed on both bands of the heavy chain and the 20-kDa tryptic peptide. On the other hand, fluorescence was scarcely observed on the bands of IAA-S-1 in the case of labeling with IAEDANS.Table IFluorescent labeling of IAA-S-1 with AD and BDSampleaIAA-S-1 in which 1.1 thiol groups/mol of S-1 had been modified was used.BDbIncubation times were 30 and 3 min for AD and BD, respectively.ADbIncubation times were 30 and 3 min for AD and BD, respectively.Amount of SH labeledAmount of SH protected with IAAmol/mol of S-1mol/mol of S-1Control S-1+−1.05IAA-S-1+−0.190.86Control S-1−+0.90IAA-S-1−+0.820.08Control S-1 and IAA-S-1 (2 mg/ml) were incubated at 7 °C in buffer A in the presence (+) and absence (−) of a 3-fold molar excess of the reagent over S-1, followed by passage through a column of Sephadex G-50 and then subjected to the assays of thiol contents as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a IAA-S-1 in which 1.1 thiol groups/mol of S-1 had been modified was used.b Incubation times were 30 and 3 min for AD and BD, respectively.

We have previously shown that a 500-base pair fragment in the first intron of the GRIK5 gene, which encodes the kainate-preferring glutamate receptor subunit KA2, down-regulates gene expression. In our present studies, mutation of an 11-base pair element within this fragment resulted in a loss of nuclear protein binding and reverses negative regulation by the intron. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we have identified intron-binding proteins from rat brain as COUP-TFI, EAR2, and NURR1. Gel shift studies with postnatal day 2 rat brain extract indicate the presence of COUP-TFs, EAR2, and NURR1 in the DNA-protein complex. Competition assays with GRIK5-binding site mutations show that the recombinant clones exhibit differential binding characteristics and suggest that the DNA-protein complex from postnatal day 2 rat brain may consist primarily of EAR2. The DNA binding activity was also observed to be enriched in rat neural tissue and developmentally regulated. Co-transfection assays showed that recombinant nuclear orphan receptors function as transcriptional repressors in both CV1 cells and rat CG4 oligodendrocyte cells. Direct interaction of the orphan receptors with and relief of repression by TFIIB indicate likely role(s) in active and/or transrepression. Our findings are thus consistent with the notion that multiple nuclear orphan receptors can regulate the transcription of a widely expressed neurotransmitter receptor gene by binding a common element in an intron and directly modulating the activity of the transcription machinery.

Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, and its physiological effects are mediated through the activation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), 1The abbreviations used are:AMPAα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acidkbkilobase(s)AEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridePCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenical acetyltransferaseRSVRous sarcoma virusLucluciferasebpbase pair(s)IRinverted repeatEReverted repeat and kainate receptors (1Dingledine R.

Although assigning a specific role for kainate receptors has been difficult, the presence of functional kainate receptors in neural cells (2Heuttner J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated. It has also been shown that kainate/AMPA receptor agonists promote the survival of rat spinal cord cells (8Bardoul M. Drian M.J. König N. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 15: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and kainate-generated currents were detected in human fetal astrocytes (9Cauley K. Kukekov V. Young D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Despite overlapping binding properties between kainate and AMPA receptor classes, kainate preferentially promotes neurite arborization in rat cerebellar neurons in culture, an effect not reproduced by AMPA, thus demonstrating differential effects on neural cell growth and survival (10Pizzi M. Fallacara C. Consolandio O. Memo M. Spano P.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 166: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, kainate receptors are found both in the rat embryonic neural tube as well as in cell cultures derived from this tissue (11Scherer S.E. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and expression of the subunits GluR6 and KA2 is up-regulated by culture conditions that stimulate cell differentiation (11Scherer S.E. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the notion that kainate receptors may play important role(s) in neural cell differentiation. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid kilobase(s) 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride polymerase chain reaction chloramphenical acetyltransferase Rous sarcoma virus luciferase base pair(s) inverted repeat everted repeat Nuclear orphan receptors constitute the majority of members in the nuclear receptor superfamily (12Enmark E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These proteins are of great interest, because the lack of identified ligands presents a challenge to the elucidation of their function. COUP-TFI was shown to antagonize retinoic acid-induced differentiation of teratocarcinoma cell lines (13Neuman K. Soosaar A. Nornes H.O. Neuman T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). More recently, targeted gene ablation has provided evidence that COUP-TFI is an important regulator of neuronal development, because COUP-TFI-null mice display deficiencies in the formation of cranial nerves IX and X and do not survive after birth (14Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Deletion of NURR1 resulted in a failure to generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a condition that was also lethal in neonatal mice (15Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). To understand the function of members of the nuclear orphan receptor family in neural development, it is important to identify neural-specific genes that are targets of orphan receptor action and whose products are themselves involved in neural cell function and possibly maturation. Studies have previously demonstrated the expression of the neural-specific KA2 subunit to be widespread in the rat brain (16Bahn S. Benedikt V. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar); however, the factors that regulate KA2 subunit expression have not been characterized. Elucidation of these factors is necessary to understand the physiological basis of changes in kainate receptor composition in neural cells. In our effort to address regulatory factors of KA2 gene expression, we have cloned the rat GRIK5 gene (glutamate receptor ionotropickainate 5), which encodes the KA2 receptor, and shown that neural cell-specific activity of its TATA-less promoter is largely dictated by sequences contained within 2 kb of its upstream region (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although most studies of transcriptional regulation have localized cis-acting regulatory regions in 5′-flanking sequences, there are many examples of specific regulatory functions, mediated by both positively and negatively acting genetic elements, that have been attributed to introns (Refs. 19Bergers G. Graninger P. Braselmann S. Wrighton C. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3748-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Franklin G.C. Donovan M. Adam G.I.R. Holmgren L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20962-20967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and references therein). Such elements appear to be located most commonly in the first intron, perhaps because of its proximity to the promoter and to the cap site of the gene. Transfection studies with rat GRIK5constructs also revealed the presence of negative regulatory element(s) within the first intron (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Inclusion of this intron in reporter constructs represses, in a position-independent manner,GRIK5 promoter activity not only in neural cells but also in HeLa cells (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to RE1-silencing transcription factor, REST/neuron-restrictive silencer factor, NRSF, which was found to control neural-specific expression of a sodium channel (22Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 (24Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the repressor(s) acting on theGRIK5 intron is not a determinant of neural-specific KA2 expression but rather a modulator of transcript levels in KA2-expressing cells. In this study, we show that binding of nuclear proteins to an 11-bp element in this intron is sufficient for transcriptional repression ofGRIK5 promoter activity. We identify several nuclear orphan receptors from rat brain that are capable of binding thisGRIK5 element. In addition, we also examine their binding characteristics in various neural cell types and, using binding site mutations, establish a profile of binding activity in the rat brain and neural cells to determine the major component of the repressor-DNA complex. Protein interaction assays with TFIIB suggest that each of these receptors can participate in active repression of transcription. Previous studies of other neural-specific genes, mouse arrestin (25Lu X.P. Salbert G. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1774-1788PubMed Google Scholar), and preproenkephalin (26Chan R.M. Stewart M.J. Crabb D.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have implicated COUP-TF as a positive modulator of gene transcription. However, there is now much evidence supporting the notion that transcriptional repression is as common and important as transcriptional activation (27Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our observations thus represent the first description of negative regulation of a widely expressed neurotransmitter-gated ion channel gene by members of the nuclear orphan receptor family. CG-4 cells were cultured as described previously by Louiset al. (28Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthrope M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and Patneau et al. (3Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winter C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and were harvested 2 days after replating (80% confluency). Cortical type-1 astrocyte cultures were prepared as described previously in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Welfare guidelines (29McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar) and were harvested after 12 days in culture. Cerebellar granule cell cultures were prepared as described previously (30Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and were harvested after 2 and 7 days in culture. Nuclear protein extracts from CG-4 cells, astrocytes, and granule cells were prepared with the protocol described by Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins from tissues were extracted by using a rapid method developed by Deryckere and Gannon (32Deryckere F. Gorman F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Rat tissues were dissected out, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and shattered between layers of aluminum foil. Approximately 500 mg of tissue powder was homogenized in 5 ml of solution A (0.6% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmAEBSF and homogenized with five strokes with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s at 2,000 rpm. The supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of solution B (25% glycerol, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysed nuclei were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 15 s. The supernatant was aliquoted in small fractions, frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford assay. The sequences of probe 62 and other competitors are given in Table II. Probe 62 is a 27-bp probe containing the putative 11-bp GRIK5 silencer element and corresponds to the sequence between positions +3206 and +3232 in the rat GRIK 5 gene relative to the start of exon 1 (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), purified on G50 columns, and used in gel shift assays. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitrotranslated recombinant clones, the reaction buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6 μg of nuclear proteins from cell and tissue extracts or 3–8 μl of crude translation mixture. Then 10 fmol of labeled probe was added to each reaction and incubated for another 30 min on ice. For supershifts, 1–2 μl of antiserum was added to the reactions 15–30 min prior to loading. After adding 2 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue loading dye, each reaction was directly loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresced at 100 V. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed on x-ray film (Kodak) for 16–24 h. In competition experiments, the wild type probe was32P-labeled, and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were used in 50- and 100-fold molar excess. The intensity of the shifted bands was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In a separate set of experiments, complementary Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCGCCCCGCCCCGATCG-3′) were used as a control in gel shift assays. RXR antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Table IIOligonucleotides used for gel mobility shift assays and competition studiesThe core sequence is shown for all oligonucleotides used in this study for gel mobility shift competition assays.

A common 5′ primer (5′-ATGGAGCTCAATCTGGCTTTGAA-3′) and a series of 3′ primers containing different mutations (m11–21) were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All primers contained a SacI site at their 5′ ends for cloning of PCR products into SacI sites. PCR was performed with these primers using 5.4-CAT plasmid DNA as template (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The annealing temperatures were different, depending on the primer pairs (m11–13,15–21 at 45 °C; m11–13 and m15–17 at 50 °C; all others at 55 °C). Eight PCR products with different mutations at distinct positions were generated, and each one was used as a cassette to replace the corresponding wild type sequence in 5.4-CAT between two SacI sites. The 5.4-CAT DNA lacking the 2-kb SacI fragment (5.4-ΔSacI-CAT) was generated by digestion of 5.4-CAT with SacI, and individualSacI-digested PCR products containing mutations were ligated with 5.4-ΔSacI-CAT. Transformants were screened by hybridizing with individual mutated 32P-labeled primers as probes to select for desired clones. The orientation of positive clones was determined by restriction digestion, and all the mutations verified by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid DNAs were used in transient transfection assays (see below). All expression plasmids used in transfections were purified with Qiagen DNA purification kits. A plasmid containing a lacZ gene driven by the RNA polymerase II gene promoter (pPolIIplacF.β-gal) was simultaneously transfected with all the CAT constructs to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. CAT constructs (10 μg) and pPolIIplacF·β-gal (2 μg) were used to transiently transfect CG-4 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were carried out for 8 h, and the culture medium was replaced. Cells were harvested 38 h after transfection and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Levels of CAT activity were determined on a PhosphorImager. For nuclear orphan receptor co-transfections, reporter plasmid was transfected with varying amounts of orphan receptor cDNA cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). DNA concentrations were balanced with the empty expression vector pcDNA3. pBLCAT51 was generated by ligating, between the HindIII and XbaI sites of the thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter pBLCAT5, synthetic oligonucleotides containing the sequence of wild-type probe 62 (see Table I). The construction of β-actin-I-CAT has been previously described (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For TFIIB co-transfections, reporter plasmids were transfected with either 0.2 or 2 μg of RSV-TFIIB or negative control RSV-Luciferase. CAT activity was determined by scintillation counting, and values were normalized against total protein content instead of β-galactosidase activity, because COUP-TF expression vectors have been shown to repress the expression of β-galactosidase expression vectors (33Cooney A.J.

The in vivo screening strategy was carried out using the Yeast Matchmaker One-hybrid system (CLONTECH). This required generating a yeast reporter strain containing three tandem copies of wild type or mutated probe 62 sequences (to eliminate false positives) cloned upstream of yeast promoters driving two different reporter genes, HIS3 and lacZ. The dual reporter yeast strain containing the wild type 62 sequence was used as a host for introducing a postnatal day 2 rat brain GAL4 activation domain cDNA library in pGAD10 (custom generated by CLONTECH). After introduction of the cDNA library (corresponding to approximately 150 × 106 independent clones) into yeast cells by the LiAc method, cells were selected on SD/−His/−Leu plates in the presence of 45 mm 3- amino-1,2,4-triazole. The transformation efficiency was 12 × 104 cfu/μg DNA, and putative positives were screened for lacZexpression by a filter assay (CLONTECH). The cDNA clones from these colonies were isolated, amplified, and reintroduced into the yeast reporter strain carrying the mutated probe 62 reporter. The confirmed positives were analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The inserts were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for in vitro translation and co-transfection assays. Expression plasmid for rat EAR2 cDNA carried a modified Kozak sequence upstream of the coding region for improved translation efficiency. Coupled transcription-translation of nuclear receptor constructs was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysates according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). For recombinant proteins used in gel shift assays, a 1 mm amino acid stock (Promega) was used in the translation reactions. For immunoprecipitation, translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal volumes of the labeled products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. Relative intensities of the bands were estimated by scanning densitometry, so that equivalent amounts could be used in immunoprecipitation reactions. Approximately 3–6 μl of crude translation mixture was mixed with 4 μl of TFIIB antibody (Santa Cruz) and 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) in a total volume of 150 μl, containing binding buffer of the following composition: 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% nonfat dry milk. The mixtures were rocked at 4 °C for 1–2 h, after which the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g and washed three times with cold binding buffer. The agarose pellets were then resuspended in 20 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. GRIK5 promoter constructs have previously been shown to be expressed in cells of the oligodendrocyte line CG4 (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows twoGRIK5 constructs used in our studies. 2-CAT consists of theGRIK5 promoter and 2 kb of upstream sequences cloned into a promoterless CAT vector, pCATbasic, whereas 5.4-CAT contains the 3.4 kb first intron cloned downstream of the 2-kb promoter fragment. As shown in Fig. 1 B and as described previously (18Huang F Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), inclusion of the 3.4-kb first intron resulted in a 3-fold repression of reporter gene activity. Preliminary analysis of mice bearing 7.7 kb ofGRIK5 sequences that contain the 4-kb promoter fragment and the 3.4-kb first intron cloned upstream of a β-galactosidase reporter gene indicates that the inclusion of the intron results in a generalized decrease in reporter gene expression in the brain, when compared with transgenic mice bearing only a 4-kb promoter fragment. 2S. E. Scherer, F. Huang, X. Yuan, and V. Gallo, unpublished observations. This suggests that the intronic element also acts to repress GRIK5transcription in vivo. Extensive deletion analysis and transfection assays as well as DNase 1 footprint assays have previously delineated a single 24-bp region (3207–3231) in this intron that binds nuclear protein from CG4 cells. The role of this region in transcriptional repression is thus the main focus of our present studies. A series of mutations was generated in 5.4-CAT in which 1–3 nucleotides were systematically replaced from 5′ to 3′ with their respective complements (Fig. 1 B). Transfection of these constructs in CG-4 cells showed that changes in 10 nucleotides significantly affected repressive capacity of the intron (Fig.1 B). When clustered together in m11–13,15–21, reporter activity was restored to levels similar to 2-CAT, indicating a complete loss of repressor function of the intron. Although the CAT activities of mutant constructs m18,19, m15–17, m11–13, and m20,21 were clearly lower than that of 2-CAT, they were still significantly higher than that of 5.4-CAT, indicating that these mutations had partially affected the activity of the repressor. In contrast, mutations in m22–25, m9,10, and m14 were ineffective, suggesti"

Nitrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of dinitrogen to ammonium during biological nitrogen fixation, is composed of two component metalloproteins: dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (1Burris R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9339-9342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dinitrogenase (MoFe protein, NifDK) is an α2β2 tetramer of the nifD andK gene products. Dinitrogenase contains two different metal clusters: the P-clusters and the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), 1The abbreviations used are:FeMo-coiron-molybdenum cofactorDTHsodium dithionitePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are:FeMo-coiron-molybdenum cofactorDTHsodium dithionitePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid the site of substrate reduction (2Madden M.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9339-9342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains two nucleotide binding sites and one Fe4-S4 cluster ligated via cysteines 97 and 132, bridging the two identical subunits (5Hausinger R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13486-13492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifH shares a high degree of structural and functional similarity to a family of proteins called the G-proteins (GTP-binding proteins) (6Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The two regions of structural similarity between the G-proteins and NifH include the P-loop (residues 9 to 16 in NifH), which is involved in the binding of ATP, and the Switch II region (residues 125 to 132 in NifH), involved in the Mg2+ coordination (7Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding site in NifH is ≈19 Å away from the Fe4-S4 cluster (8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, many changes in the Fe4-S4 cluster have been observed upon MgATP binding to NifH, including the accessibility of the cluster to iron chelators like α,α′-bipyridyl, a decrease in the mid-point redox potential of the cluster, and spectral changes in the EPR line shape. iron-molybdenum cofactor sodium dithionite polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid iron-molybdenum cofactor sodium dithionite polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid NifH has at least three different functions in the nitrogenase enzyme system. It is required for electron donation to nitrogenase, for apo-dinitrogenase maturation, and for FeMo-co biosynthesis (9Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Madden M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1994; 14: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The nitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction involves a complex series of reactions including the association of the component proteins, MgATP hydrolysis coupled to electron transfer, followed by the dissociation of the two proteins (10Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 221-284Google Scholar). The role of NifH as the specific electron donor to nitrogenase has been well documented. It serves as the obligate physiological electron donor to dinitrogenase during catalysis, transferring one electron at a time with the concomitant hydrolysis of two MgATPs (11Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The electrons transferred to dinitrogenase are channeled to FeMo-co, where the reduction of nitrogen is believed to occur. The features of NifH required for its function in substrate reduction include the ability of NifH to interact with low potential electron donors, to bind MgATP, to undergo the nucleotide-induced conformational change, to bind dinitrogenase, to transfer electrons to dinitrogenase, and to hydrolyze MgATP. Altered forms of NifH that are unable to perform one or more of the above properties result in the enzyme that is completely nonfunctional in electron transfer. Recent studies on these altered forms of NifH generated by site-directed mutagenesis have contributed tremendously toward understanding the role of NifH in nitrogenase turnover (12Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 260-266Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Apart from its indispensable role in catalysis, NifH is involved in two other functions: in the maturation of α2β2apo-dinitrogenase (NifDK) to the α2β2γ2 form (NifDKγ) (13Robinson A.C. Chun T.W. Li J.-G. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (15Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The α2β2 form of apo-dinitrogenase is not FeMo-co-activable, whereas the γ-associated form can be activated upon the addition of preformed FeMo-co. γ is a non-nifprotein and has been shown to function as a chaperone insertase during the formation of dinitrogenase (16Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NifH mediates the association of γ2 with the α2β2apo-dinitrogenase in the presence of MgATP. But the exact role of NifH in apo-dinitrogenase maturation is not very well understood. The purification of a His-tagged α2β2apo-dinitrogenase without the γ subunit that is 80% activable by addition of purified FeMo-co has recently been reported (17Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At least seven nif gene products are known to be involved in FeMo-co biosynthesis: nifQ, nifV, nifX, nifB,nifN, nifE, and nifH (18Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J.

Azotobacter vinelandii mutants carrying a deletion of any of nifH,nifN, nifE, or nifB produce a cofactorless dinitrogenase (this form contains the P-clusters) termed as apo-dinitrogenase. The nifQ gene product has been postulated to play a role in molybdenum processing during FeMo-co biosynthesis (18Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nifV gene encodes homocitrate synthase (23Zheng L. White R.H. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThenifX gene product has recently been shown to be required for FeMo-co synthesis by the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay, although the exact role played by NifX is not known.2 The metabolic product of NifB is NifB-cofactor (NifB-co) (24Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifB-co has been shown to function as a specific iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co during cofactor biosynthesis (25Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The nifN andnifE gene products together form a tetrameric protein that shows a high sequence similarity to the nifK andnifD gene products (26Brigle K.E. Weiss M.C. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NifNE has been postulated to form a scaffold upon which FeMo-co is assembled. An absolute requirement of NifH in FeMo-co biosynthesis has been demonstrated using the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system (27Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the precise role(s) of NifH in cofactor biosynthesis is not very clear. Surprisingly, a form of NifH that is active in substrate reduction is not required for its function in FeMo-co biosynthesis. For example, several altered forms of NifH, completely inactive in substrate reduction, have been shown to support cofactor biosynthesis and its insertion into apo-dinitrogenase (28Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that NifH contains distinct domains that enable it to perform each of its functions independently. In an attempt to understand the role of NifH in FeMo-co synthesis, the interaction of NifH with NifNE has been studied. In this study, we have used a site-specific altered form of NifH, L127Δ. This form of NifH has been shown to bind dinitrogenase with extremely high affinity (30Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). L127Δ NifH was found to be inactive in FeMo-co synthesis and inhibited FeMo-co synthesis by wild-type NifH. Here, we report the formation of a complex of L127Δ NifH with NifNE in the presence of NifB-co. This is the first direct evidence to show the interaction of NifH with NifNE. In light of these data, the possible roles for NifH in FeMo-co biosynthesis are discussed. A. vinelandii strains CA11.1 (ΔnifHDK ΔvnfDGK::spc) (31Waugh S.I. Paulsen D.M. Mylona P.V. Maynard R.H.

To 9-ml serum vials flushed with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) were added 100 μl of anaerobic Tris-HCl, 10 nmol of sodium molybdate, 100 nmol of homocitrate, 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mmMgCl2, 51 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH), 200 μl of extract (2.5 mg of protein) of strain CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK::spc; as a source of NifNE, NifB-co, and γ2), and purified wild-type or L127Δ NifH (50 μg of protein). The vials were incubated for 35 min at 30 °C, after which they were placed on ice. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were subjected to anoxic native gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using anti-γ antibody, as described below. In vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays were performed with the extract of strain CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK::spc), as described above. Purified L127Δ NifH (25 to 250 μg of protein) was added to the assays, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C (preincubation phase). Purified wild-type NifH (50 μg) was then added to the assays, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then placed on ice, and aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were subjected to anoxic native PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-γ antibody, as described below. In vitroFeMo-co synthesis assays were performed with the extract of strain CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK::spc), as described above. Purified L127Δ NifH (100 μg protein), purified NifNE (50 or 100 μg protein), and an excess of NifB-co (5 nmol of Fe) were added to the assays, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C (preincubation phase). Purified wild-type NifH (50 μg protein) was then added to the assays, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then placed on ice, and aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were subjected to anoxic native PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-γ antibody, as described below. High resolution, analytical gel filtration chromatography was used to monitor the complex formation between NifNE and L127Δ NifH. This was performed using a Zorbax GF-250 HPLC column equilibrated in degassed 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and 0.5 mm DTH. Before injection onto the HPLC column, the proteins were incubated for 5 min at ambient temperature in degassed 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 0.5 mm DTH. The protein concentration of NifNE used for each HPLC run was 35 μm and that of NifH or L127Δ NifH was 140 μm. The column eluent was monitored from 200 to 800 nm, and data was collected and processed using a Beckman Noveau software package. The complex formation between NifNE and L127Δ NifH in the presence of NifB-co was monitored using a Superose 12 gel filtration column. The column was equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl in 0.025 m MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5) and was calibrated using proteins of known molecular masses (dinitrogenase 230 kDa, bovine serum albumin 67 kDa, ovalbumin 45 kDa, myoglobin 18 kDa, and cytochromec 12 kDa). Two hundred μl of a solution containing purified NifNE (0.5 mg of protein) and excess purified NifB-co (5 nmol of iron) was applied to the column. The column was developed with the same buffer, and fractions (0.5 ml, collected anoxically) were tested for NifNE activity by in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays as described previously (32Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and by immunoanalysis with anti-NifNE antibody. Two hundred μl of a solution containing L127Δ NifH (2.0 mg of protein) was then applied to the column and chromatographed as described above. The fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed for the presence of NifH by subjecting 10 μl aliquots to SDS-PAGE, followed by NifH immunoanalysis. The protein concentration of L127Δ NifH in the Superose 12 fractions was calculated by a densitometry scan of the NifH immunoblot. When examining the interaction of L127Δ NifH with NifNE, 200 μl of a solution containing purified NifNE (0.5 mg of protein), excess purified NifB-co (5 nmol iron), and L127Δ NifH (2.0 mg of protein; preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C) was applied to the Superose 12 column (equilibrated as described above). The column was developed, and the fractions (0.5 ml) were monitored for NifNE and L127Δ NifH by SDS-PAGE of the fractions, followed by NifNE and NifH immunoanalyses. The protein concentrations of NifNE and L127Δ NifH in the Superose 12 fractions were calculated by densitometry scans of the NifNE and NifH immunoblots. Proteins were separated on anaerobic native gels with a 7–14% acrylamide and 0–20% sucrose gradient as described previously (14Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K.

Anti-NifNE antibody was a gift from Dr. Jon Roll and Dr. Gary P. Roberts, Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The anti-NifH antibody was raised in rabbit. The protocols for immunoblotting and developing with modifications by Brandner et al. (38Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson A.K. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provezano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 175-179Crossref Scopus (18342) Google Scholar). Iron was quantitated by the α,α′-bipyridyl method as described previously (40Fortune W.B. Mellon M.G. Ind. Eng. Chem. Anal. Ed. 1938; 10: 61-64Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The site-specific altered form of NifH, L127Δ, was tested in FeMo-co biosynthesis by the γ gel shift assay (16Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This assay involves the shift in the migration of γ on anoxic native gels as an indicator of FeMo-co synthesis. FeMo-co synthesis assays were performed using extracts of A. vinelandii strain CA11.1 (ΔnifHDK ΔvnfDGK::spc) as a source of NifNE, NifB-co, and γ2. The assays were carried out by incubating wild-type and L127Δ NifH (50 μg of protein) with aliquots of extract of strain CA11.1 (2.5 mg of protein), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of these assays are shown in Fig. 1. γ in the extract of strain CA11.1 is a dimer (γ2) because the strain is impaired in FeMo-co synthesis (Fig. 1, lane 1). Upon addition of NifH to the reaction mixture (containing all components required for FeMo-co synthesis), FeMo-co is synthesized and accumulates on γ. γ bound to FeMo-co (γ-FeMo-co) electrophoreses as a faster migrating band on anoxic native gels and can be clearly distinguished from the slower migrating γ2 species (Fig.1, compare lanes 1 and 2). When L127Δ NifH was used in place of wild-type NifH in the assay, no shift of γ was observed upon anoxic native gel electrophoresis of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1, lane 3). No change was observed upon increasing the concentration of L127Δ NifH or upon increasing the incubation time of the reaction mixtures. These data clearly show that L127Δ NifH is inactive in FeMo-co biosynthesis. A slower migrating species of γ (designated as X) is observed in extracts of strain CA11.1; this species is as yet uncharacterized. Leucine 127 in NifH has been shown to play an important role in the MgATP signal transduction pathway from the nucleotide binding site to the Fe4-S4 cluster in NifH (36Ryle M. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The deletion of this residue results in a form that greatly resembles the MgATP-bound conformation of NifH. The L127Δ form of NifH is capable of binding two molecules of MgATP, binding dinitrogenase with extremely high affinity, and transferring one electron to dinitrogenase but is incompetent in substrate reduction (30Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Ryle M. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This altered form of NifH has also been shown to behave as a tight binding inhibitor of dinitrogenase, inhibiting substrate reduction by the wild-type nitrogenase complex (30Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). L127Δ NifH was found to be impaired in the FeMo-co synthesis reaction, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, it was of interest to investigate if L127Δ NifH could inhibit FeMo-co synthesis by wild-type NifH. FeMo-co synthesis was monitored by the γ gel shift assay, as described above. Increasing concentrations of purified L127Δ NifH (25–250 μg of protein) were included in the in vitroFeMo-co synthesis reactions containing the extract of strain CA11.1, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After preincubation of 30 min, purified wild-type NifH (50 μg of protein) was added to the reaction mixtures and further incubated for 30 min. The results shown in Fig. 2 reveal that increasing the concentration of L127Δ NifH in the reaction mixture from 25 μg to 250 μg showed inhibition of FeMo-co biosynthesis, as can be seen by the decreasing amounts of the faster migrating γ species (γ-FeMoco). Increasing the concentration of L127Δ NifH in the preincubation phase to 100 μg completely inhibited FeMo-co synthesis by wild-type NifH (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and5). No inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis was observed when O2-denatured L127Δ NifH (250 μg of protein) was used in the preincubation phase of the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay (Fig. 2, lane 8). Thus, the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH was dependent upon the native conformation of the enzyme. No inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis was observed when a nonspecific protein, bovine serum albumin, was added to the preincubation phase of the reaction in place of L127Δ NifH (data not shown). Given the specificity of the inhibition, it was of interest to investigate if the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH was due to its binding to small molecules such as homocitrate, MgATP, or molybdenum, thus making these essential components unavailable to the cofactor biosynthetic machinery. In vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays were performed using extract of strain CA11.1 as a source of all components for FeMo-co synthesis except NifH. Increasing concentrations of homocitrate, MgATP, and molybdenum were added to select assay mixtures to determine if increasing the concentrations of these components would relieve the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH. The assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with purified L127Δ NifH in the preincubation phase followed by the addition of wild-type NifH. The results presented in Fig. 3 show that doubling the concentration of homocitrate, MgATP, or molybdenum in the assay mixtures did not relieve the inhibition by L127Δ NifH (Fig. 3,lanes 5 to 7). These data indicate that the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH is not due to its binding to small molecules like MgATP, molybdenum, or homocitrate. Given the observation that L127Δ NifH inhibited acetylene reduction by the wild-type nitrogenase complex by forming a tight complex with dinitrogenase (30Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if L127Δ NifH inhibited FeMo-co synthesis in a similar manner, i.e. by binding to an essential component protein in the FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture. The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture employs two proteins that are structurally similar to dinitrogenase, apo-dinitrogenase and NifNE. Because the γ gel shift reaction is performed in the absence of apo-dinitrogenase, the inhibition by L127Δ NifH cannot be due to its binding apo-dinitrogenase. Thus, it was of interest to investigate if the addition of purified NifNE and NifB-co to the reaction mixtures would relieve the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH. In vitro FeMo-co synthesis reactions were carried out with the extract of strain CA11.1 as the source of all components required for FeMo-co synthesis except NifH. Increasing quantities of purified NifNE and an excess of NifB-co were added to the reaction mixtures containing purified L127Δ NifH (100 μg) during the preincubation phase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Fig. 3 (lanes 8 and 9) show that the addition of purified NifNE and NifB-co to the reaction mixture relieves the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH, as indicated by the presence of the faster migrating species of γ. These results suggest that the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH may be due to a complex formation with NifNE. The addition of purified NifNE alone or purified NifB-co alone to the reaction mixtures did not relieve the inhibition of FeMo-co synthesis by L127Δ NifH (data not shown). The interaction of L127Δ NifH with the NifNE proteins was examined given the structural similarity between NifNE and dinitrogenase. The association of NifNE with L127Δ NifH was monitored by high resolution analytical gel filtration chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.4 shows the elution patterns (measured at 405 nm) resulting from the interactions of NifNE and L127Δ NifH. The elution profile of NifNE resulted in a single peak (Fig. 4, trace1), which is presumably due to the presence of the Fe4-S4 clusters of NifNE. Similarly, the elution profile of either the wild-type NifH (Fig. 4, trace2) or L127Δ NifH (data not shown) also resulted in a single peak due to the presence of Fe4-S4clusters. When NifNE and the wild-type NifH were incubated together, the elution profile (Fig. 4, trace 3) resulted in two separate peaks, which correspond to the positions of NifNE control (Fig. 4, trace 1) and the wild-type NifH control (Fig. 4, trace 2). However, when NifNE was incubated with the L127Δ NifH, the elution profile showed 3 peaks. The positions of two of the peaks correspond to the positions of the NifNE control and the wild-type NifH control. The third peak (Fig. 4, trace 4,arrow) elutes at a position that is larger in size than both NifNE and the wild-type NifH. This third peak elutes at the similar position corresponding to the dinitrogenase·L127Δ NifH complex (data not shown). Based on these elution profile similarities, it seems likely that the third peak represents a complex of NifNE and L127Δ NifH. In contrast to the complex formed between dinitrogenase and L127Δ NifH, the complex formation of NifNE with L127Δ NifH is not complete. As the concentration of L127Δ NifH used in this experiment is four times that of NifNE, one would expect that all the NifNE be complexed with L127Δ NifH and elute at the position of the complex. This is not the case, which can be seen clearly in Fig. 4, trace4. It has been shown previously that NifNE can exist in two forms, an uncharged form and a charged form (32Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the charged form, it is believed that NifNE is bound to the FeMo-co precursor, NifB-co, or to a processed form of NifB-co. Metal analyses of the overproduced NifNE routinely showed the presence of more iron than is necessary to support the formation of the two Fe4-S4clusters (12–15 iron atoms/NifNE tetramer). Thus it is possible that the preparations of NifNE contain a portion of NifNE bound to NifB-co. It is possible that NifH may interact only with this charged form of NifNE. If this is the case, it would be likely that only a small portion of NifNE would be able to complex with L127Δ NifH, which is consistent with the data presented. The in vitro formation of a complex between L127Δ NifH and NifNE in the presence of NifB-co was investigated using gel filtration chromatography. A solution containing purified NifNE in the presence of excess NifB-co and a L127Δ NifH-containing solution were fractionated separately on a calibrated Superose 12 gel filtration column. The NifNE·NifB-co complex reproducibly eluted atV e/V o 1.31–1.62, with a peak atV e/V o 1.5 (Fig.5, panel A). Elution of purified NifNE in the absence of NifB-co also showed similarV e/V o values (data not shown). Purified L127Δ NifH reproducibly eluted atV e/V o 1.62–1.8 (values similar to wild-type NifH; data not shown), with a peak atV e/V o 1.7 (Fig. 5, panel B). A solution containing both L127Δ NifH and NifNE in the presence of NifB-co was chromatographed on the Superose 12 column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Superose 12 fractions were analyzed for the presence of NifNE and L127Δ NifH proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoanalyses using anti-NifH and anti-NifNE antibody. The elution of both NifNE and L127Δ NifH under these conditions was found to be altered. NifNE now eluted atV e/V o 1.25–1.44, with a peak atV e/V o 1.38, whereas L127Δ NifH eluted at V e/V o 1.25–1.75 (Fig.5, panel C). The elution of L127Δ NifH was broader and unlike the sharp peak obtained when chromatographed in the absence of the NifNE·NifB-co complex. Moreover, the elution of L127Δ NifH showed two peaks, one that comigrated with the elution peak of NifNE (V e/V o 1.38), and the other peak showing V e/V o 1.7, which was identical to the value obtained when L127Δ NifH was chromatographed in the absence of NifNE. Scanning densitometry of the NifNE and NifH immunoblots was used to determine the relative quantities of each protein and to calculate the stoichiometry of the L127Δ NifH to NifNE in the complex. A ratio of 2.5 L127Δ NifH to 1 NifNE was estimated in the L127Δ NifH·NifNE complex. The fractionation of wild-type NifH and NifNE in the presence of NifB-co resulted in no change in the elution profiles of either NifH or NifNE. Upon fractionation of L127Δ NifH in the presence of a nonspecific protein, bovine serum albumin, no change in the elution profile of L127Δ NifH was observed. These data suggest that the change in elution profile of L127Δ NifH is most likely due to a specific interaction of L127Δ NifH with the NifNE·NifB-co complex. A similar set of experiments performed without purified NifB-co did not show altered elution profiles for L127Δ NifH and NifNE (data not shown). These data suggest that the interaction of NifH with NifNE occurs after the binding of NifB-co to NifNE and that the interaction is dependent on the presence of NifB-co. It has been shown in previous studies that NifNE binds NifB-co, and a shift in the migration of NifNE on anoxic native gels upon binding NifB-co has been observed (32Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NifNE with associated 55Fe and 35S from radiolabeled NifB-co has also been observed (25Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This reaction has been suggested to be one of the early steps in the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway, as the binding of NifB-co to NifNE is not dependent on the presence of NifH or MgATP. The conformational change brought about by NifB-co binding may expose a region in NifNE that serves as the NifH recognition site. It seems likely that the binding of NifH to NifNE is very transient, because no such complex formation was observed with wild-type NifH and NifNE in the presence or absence of NifB-co (data not shown). The requirement of NifH for FeMo-co biosynthesis has been known for the last few years. The exact role of NifH in the cofactor biosynthetic pathway is not well understood. That several altered enzymes impaired in catalysis are active in FeMo-co biosynthesis indicates a role for NifH that is not analogous to its role in substrate reduction. Several possible roles for NifH in FeMo-co biosynthesis can be envisioned. One role for NifH is in the catalysis of a specific redox reaction. However, site-specific-altered forms of NifH that show virtually no electron transfer ability have been shown to function in FeMo-co biosynthesis (28Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the presence of a redox-active Fe4-S4 cluster in NifH is not required for its function in cofactor biosynthesis (41Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11250-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data rule out a role for NifH that is analogous to its role in substrate reduction. Another possibility is that NifH could be involved in specifying the heterometal associated with the individual cofactors, namely FeMo-co, FeV-co, and FeFe-co. The evidence in support of this hypothesis lies in the existence of independent proteins for each of the three nitrogenases in A. vinelandii, i.e.NifH for the molybdenum-nitrogenase, VnfH for the vanadium nitrogenase, and AnfH for the iron-only nitrogenase. However, the substitution of NifH with VnfH in in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reactions has been successfully carried out (21Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21604-21608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This result does not support the hypothesis that NifH and its analogs specify the heterometal in the nitrogenase enzymes. Another role for NifH in cofactor biosynthesis could involve its interaction with NifNE. The concept of NifH interaction with NifNE is very appealing, given the structural resemblance between NifNE and dinitrogenase. To date, experiments to show the interaction of wild-type NifH with NifNE were unsuccessful. Cross-linking experiments that involved purified NifNE, NifH, and the carbodiimide cross-linker EDC (1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride) in the presence or absence of NifB-co proved inconclusive. 3P. Rangaraj and P. W. Ludden, unpublished data. In this study, we have shown the interaction of NifNE with NifH by using a site-specific-altered enzyme, L127Δ, that forms a tight protein complex with dinitrogenase. L127Δ NifH, although impaired in FeMo-co synthesis, could inhibit wild-type NifH in this process. We have demonstrated that L127Δ NifH associates with NifNE in the presence of NifB-co and that this complex is sufficiently stable to survive gel filtration chromatography. The requirement of NifB-co for the interaction between NifNE and L127Δ NifH indicates a role for NifH after the formation of the NifNE·NifB-co complex. Based on the results of this study, we propose the following steps for FeMo-co biosynthesis. NifNE binds 2 mols of NifB-co 4J. T. Roll and G. P. Roberts, unpublished data. ; any modifications of NifB-co catalyzed by NifNE are not known at this time. NifH may interact with NifNE·NifB-co complex for induction of a conformational change in that complex. The conformational change brought about by this interaction could be crucial for the next step in the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway, which may involve NifX. The role of NifX in FeMo-co biosynthesis is not clear, although the requirement for this protein has been demonstrated by the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction. One possible role for NifX could be in the incorporation of the heterometal, in this case molybdenum, into the cofactor. The incorporation of the organic acid homocitrate could be catalyzed by yet another protein. The finished FeMo-co is then bound by γ, which also inserts the cofactor into apo-dinitrogenase, forming holodinitrogenase. We thank Dr. Lance C.

https://openalex.org/W2086037796,"The role of the inhibitory region of troponin (Tn) I in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction was studied with three deletion mutants of its inhibitory region: 1) complete (TnI-(Δ96–116)), 2) the COOH-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ105–115)), and 3) the NH2-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ95–106)). Measurements of Ca2+-regulated force and relaxation were performed in skinned skeletal muscle fibers whose endogenous TnI (along with TnT and TnC) was displaced with high concentrations of added troponin T. Reconstitution of the Tn-displaced fibers with a TnI·TnC complex restored the Ca2+ sensitivity of force; however, the levels of relaxation and force development varied. Relaxation of the fibers (pCa 8) was drastically impaired with two of the inhibitory region deletion mutants, TnI-(Δ96–116)·TnC and TnI-(Δ105–115)·TnC. The TnI-(Δ95–106)·TnC mutant retained ∼55% relaxation when reconstituted in the Tn-displaced fibers. Activation in skinned skeletal muscle fibers was enhanced with all TnI mutants compared with wild-type TnI. Interestingly, all three mutants of TnI increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction. None of the TnI deletion mutants, when reconstituted into Tn, could inhibit actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase in the absence of Ca2+, and two of them (TnI-(Δ96–116) and TnI-(Δ105–115)) gave significant activation in the absence of Ca2+. These results suggest that the COOH terminus of the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 105–115) is much more critical for the biological activity of TnI than the NH2-terminal region, consisting of residues 95–106. Presumably, the COOH-terminal domain of the inhibitory region of TnI is a part of the Ca2+-sensitive molecular switch during muscle contraction. The role of the inhibitory region of troponin (Tn) I in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction was studied with three deletion mutants of its inhibitory region: 1) complete (TnI-(Δ96–116)), 2) the COOH-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ105–115)), and 3) the NH2-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ95–106)).

Activation in skinned skeletal muscle fibers was enhanced with all TnI mutants compared with wild-type TnI. Interestingly, all three mutants of TnI increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction. None of the TnI deletion mutants, when reconstituted into Tn, could inhibit actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase in the absence of Ca2+, and two of them (TnI-(Δ96–116) and TnI-(Δ105–115)) gave significant activation in the absence of Ca2+. These results suggest that the COOH terminus of the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 105–115) is much more critical for the biological activity of TnI than the NH2-terminal region, consisting of residues 95–106. Presumably, the COOH-terminal domain of the inhibitory region of TnI is a part of the Ca2+-sensitive molecular switch during muscle contraction. Contraction of skeletal muscle is initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory sites of troponin (Tn) 1The abbreviations used are:TntroponinTmtropomyosinWTnIwild-type TnIRSTnTrabbit skeletal TnTPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are:TntroponinTmtropomyosinWTnIwild-type TnIRSTnTrabbit skeletal TnTPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid C, the Ca2+-binding subunit of Tn, which causes an interaction with TnI, the inhibitory subunit of Tn, releasing its inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. For full biological function, Tn requires a third subunit, TnT, which anchors the TnI·TnC complex to the actin-tropomyosin (Tm) filaments and also plays a role in the Ca2+-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity and/or contraction (1Potter J.D.

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1999Google Scholar).The inhibitory function of Tn has been studied in many different ways, yet the structure-function of the inhibitory region of TnI, responsible for this, is still under investigation. The role of the putative inhibitory region of TnI, which consists of 21 amino acids (residues 96–116), has been studied previously utilizing synthetic peptides as well as proteolytic and recombinant fragments of TnI. The cyanogen bromide fragment (CN4) of TnI (residues 96–116) was originally found to possess all of the inhibitory properties of intact TnI (6Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Studies with synthetic peptides have demonstrated that residues 105–114 represent the minimal sequence necessary to produce inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity and to retain TnC binding (7Talbot J.A.

Biol. 1991; 222: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, the CN4 fragment (TnI-(96–116)) has been shown to have an 8-fold higher affinity for TnC compared with TnI-(104–115) (11Chandra M. McCubbin W.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Several regions of TnI, including its inhibitory region (residues 96–116), have been identified as interacting with actin-Tm and TnC (12Levine B.A. Moir A.J.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sequence 104–115 of TnI has been shown to share both the actin-Tm- and TnC-binding sites. Studies of Tripet et al.(17Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggest that the region of TnI that follows the inhibitory sequence (residues 96–116) contains additional actin-Tm- and TnC-binding sites. A synthetic peptide consisting of residues 128–148 was able to bind specifically to the actin-Tm filament and could induce a weak inhibitory activity on its own. Truncation of residues 140–148 completely abolished the inhibitory effect of this region when compared with TnI-(96–115), suggesting that region 140–148 of TnI presumably contains the second actin-Tm-binding site (17Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with Farah et al. (18Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R.

The recombinant fragment TnI-(1–116) failed to inhibit ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+compared with other fragments (TnI-(1–156) and TnI-(103–182)) that were able to regulate actomyosin ATPase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tripetet al. (17Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues 116–131 are not important for inhibition, but are critical for the interaction with TnC and designated this region to be the second TnC-binding site (17Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that residues 96–116 of TnI are primarily responsible for the binding to the COOH-terminal domain of TnC and residues 117–148 for the binding of TnI to the NH2-terminal domain of TnC (19Pearlstone J.R.

Reconstituted TnI fragments containing the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 96–116) plus either the NH2-terminal (TnI-(1–116)) or COOH-terminal (TnI-(96–148)) region of TnI were shown to be responsible for either maintaining the maximal level of actomyosin ATPase activity or the Ca2+ dependence of ATPase, respectively (20Van Eyk J.E. Thomas L.T. Tripet B. Wiesner R.J. Pearlstone J.R. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In summary, the regulatory complex containing TnT, TnC, and TnI-(96–148) retained all of the full regulatory properties of troponin, suggesting that TnI-(96–148) contains the major sequence of TnI responsible for inhibitory activity (17Tripet B.

Based upon these experiments, an extended inhibitory region of TnI has been proposed, containing residues 96–148 (17Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol.

We have expressed and purified wild-type TnI (WTnI) and three deletion mutants of TnI: TnI-(Δ95–106), TnI-(Δ105–115), and TnI-(Δ96–116). We have applied the improved method of Shiraishi and Yamamoto (23Shiraishi F. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and Hatakenaka and Ohtsuki (24Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to displace the endogenous Tn complex with high concentrations of added TnT, followed by functional reconstitution of the fibers with preformed complexes of TnC and the TnI mutants. This system allowed us to study the effect of these deletions on the Ca2+ regulation of force development. These proteins were also tested for their ability to inhibit actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity as well as their ability to regulate ATPase activity when complexed with TnT and TnC. Our results suggest that the COOH-terminal end of the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 105–115) is much more critical for the biological activity of TnI than its NH2-terminal region (residues 95–106). Presumably, the COOH-terminal domain of the inhibitory region of TnI is a component of the Ca2+-sensitive molecular switch that regulates muscle contraction.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein PurificationRabbit skeletal muscle troponin, tropomyosin, and actin and myosin were isolated and purified according to Potter (25Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (26Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Jakubiak H. Drabikowski W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and Stepkowski et al. (27Stepkowski D. Szczesna D. Wrotek M. Kakol I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 831: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively.Wild-type TnI and the TnI inhibitory region deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression was checked by SDS-15% PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and Western blotting. The culture for bacterial expression was collected and centrifuged at 7000 rpm (J-10, Beckman). Bacterial pellets were dissolved in a solution containing 6m urea, 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3 and sonicated (Sonicator Heat Systems, Inc.) twice at setting 8 for 2 min at 4 °C. After the sonication, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.0, and the mixtures were then centrifuged again at 18,000 rpm (J-20, Beckman) at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants, containing the TnI proteins, were loaded onto a CM52 ion-exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer used to dissolve bacterial pellets, except that the pH was 5.0. The proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.6 m KCl in the equilibration buffer. The fractions containing the TnI proteins (identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting) were pooled together and dialyzed against 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a TnC affinity column equilibrated with the same buffer. Pure TnI proteins were eluted with a double gradient of urea (0–6 m) and EDTA (0–3 mm). The average yield was 3–5 mg of pure TnI/liter of culture.Actin-Tm-activated Myosin ATPase AssaysWild-type TnI and the TnI mutants were first tested for their ability to inhibit actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity, and then the whole Tn complexes (TnI + TnC + TnT formed at a molar ratio 1:1:1) were examined for their ability to regulate (±Ca2+) the ATPase activity. The ATPase assays were performed with actin (3.5 μm), Tm (1 μm), and myosin (0.6 μm) in the presence (0.5 mm CaCl2) or absence (1 mmEGTA) of Ca2+. The ATPase reaction (in 10 mmMOPS, 50 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm ATP and terminated after 6 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Inorganic phosphate was measured according to Fiske and SubbaRow (29Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Airfuge Binding AssaysThe binding of the TnI proteins or troponins containing TnI, TnT, and TnC (1:1:1) to actin-Tm was measured at a molar ratio of 7 actin (14 μm)/1 Tm (2 μm)/1 Tn (2 μm) or 2 TnI (4 μm) in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. The complexes of Tn and actin-Tm were additionally mixed with either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Protein complexes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and Airfuged (maximum speed) for 30 min. In parallel, the control samples of the TnI proteins alone or complexed with TnT and TnC without actin-Tm were sedimented. The samples of TnI proteins, troponins, and their complexes with actin-Tm (prior to sedimentation) as well as the supernatants and pellets were run on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and analyzed.Displacement of the Endogenous Troponin Complex in Skinned Skeletal Muscle Fibers with TnT: Steady-state Force and the Ca2+ Sensitivity of Force DevelopmentDisplacement of the endogenous Tn complex in skinned skeletal muscle fibers was performed according to method of Shiraishi and Yamamoto (23Shiraishi F. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and Hatakenaka and Ohtsuki (24Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have slightly modified this method (described below) to achieve complete Tn displacement, as judged by SDS-PAGE, and the measurements of Ca2+-unregulated force. Briefly, rabbit psoas skinned muscle fiber bundles (three to five fibers) were mounted on a force transducer and treated with apCa 8 relaxing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The composition of the pCa 8 solution was 10−8m Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgATP2+, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, I = 150 mm. The Ca2+ dependence of force development was tested twice to make certain that it was stable. Following the initial testing, the fibers were then incubated in a solution containing 250 mmKCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and ≈1.6–2 mg/ml rabbit skeletal TnT for 1 h at room temperature. The fibers were then washed with the same solution without the protein (10 min at room temperature) and tested for the Ca2+-unregulated force that results from the displacement of the endogenous Tn complex from the fibers. The Ca2+regulation of steady-state force development was then restored with a preformed TnI·TnC complex. The reconstitution with the TnI·TnC complex (20 μm) was performed in the pCa 8 solution, generally for 1 h at room temperature or long enough for the force to reach a stable level. Wild-type TnI and the various TnI mutants were complexed with TnC and used to reconstitute Ca2+-regulated force. Control fibers were run in parallel and treated with the same solutions minus the proteins. The purpose of this was to get an estimate of fiber rundown and to be able to determine the extent of reconstitution of the TnT-treated fibers. The Ca2+ dependence of force development was determined before the TnT treatment and after TnI·TnC reconstitution, and the data were analyzed with the Hill equation (30Hill A.V. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1910; 40: 190-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar): % relative force = 100 × [Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]n +pCa50n), wherepCa50 is the pCa of a solution in which 50% of the change is produced and n is the Hill coefficient.RESULTSTo identify domains of physiological significance in inhibitory region 96–116 of TnI, we generated WTnI and three inhibitory region deletion mutants: an NH2-terminal deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ95–106); a COOH-terminal deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ105–115); and a deletion of the complete inhibitory region, TnI-(Δ96–116). Fig. 1 shows amino acid sequences of the inhibitory region of TnI that have been deleted.Inhibition of Actin-Tm-activated Myosin ATPase Activity by TnI and Its Inhibitory Region Deletion MutantsThe inhibitory properties of rabbit skeletal TnI, WTnI, and its deletion mutants are presented in Fig. 2. Actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity was measured as a function of increasing concentrations of the TnI proteins. As illustrated, recombinant TnI (WTnI) had essentially the same activity as rabbit skeletal TnI, and both inhibited ≈90–95% of the ATPase activity. The NH2-terminal inhibitory deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ95–106), only partially inhibited actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity, and ≈40–50% inhibition occurred at a 3–4-fold molar excess of TnI-(Δ95–106) over actin. The COOH-terminal deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ105–115), and the entire inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ96–116), completely lost the ability to inhibit ATPase activity. The latter also gave a slight activation. In summary, the TnI mutants alone could not inhibit actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity when the COOH-terminal region or the entire inhibitory region was deleted.Figure 2Effect of the TnI inhibitory region deletion mutants on the inhibition of actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity. The concentration of actin was 3.5 μm, that of Tm was 1 μm, and that of myosin was 0.6 μm. The error bars represent S.D. values from four to six experiments.

TnI and its deletion mutants were complexed with TnT and TnC, and the actomyosin ATPase activity was measured in the presence (Fig. 3 A) or absence (Fig. 3 B) of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 3, the troponin complex containing wild-type TnI or rabbit skeletal TnI regulated the ATPase activity in a similar way (±Ca2+), suggesting that recombinant TnI is functional. Tn containing the NH2-terminal inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ95–106), activated the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+, but its inhibitory function (in the absence of Ca2+) was lost. The COOH-terminal inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ105–115), activated the ATPase activity in the presence or absence of Ca2+, with ∼1.3-fold higher activation in Ca2+. A similar, Ca2+-independent activation of ATPase activity was observed for the complete inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ96–116); however, the extent of activation was not as high as for TnI-(Δ105–115). In summary, in the presence of Ca2+(Fig. 3 A), all the activation curves were not significantly different, whereas the inhibition curves (in the absence of Ca2+) were dramatically different among the various TnI mutants (Fig. 3 B). TnI-(Δ105–115) as well as TnI-(Δ96–116) not only did not inhibit the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+, but gave a 1.4-fold activation of the ATPase. TnI-(Δ95–106) did not inhibit the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+ and also lacked the activation seen with the other mutants (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Activation (+Ca2+) (A) and inhibition (−Ca2+) (B) of actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity by the troponin complex containing TnT, TnC, and TnI inhibitory region deletion mutants.The concentration of actin was 3.5 μm, that of Tm was 1 μm, and that of myosin was 0.6 μm.

In parallel, the controls of the TnI proteins alone or complexed with TnT and TnC without actin-Tm were sedimented. No pellets of the TnI proteins alone or troponins containing the TnI mutants were observed (data not shown). Fig.4 A shows the binding of WTnI and TnI mutants to actin-Tm, whereas Fig. 4 B demonstrates the binding of the Tn complexes in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The analysis of the pellets and supernatants indicated that all of the troponin complexes containing either WTnI or the TnI deletion mutants bound well to actin-Tm in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). Their binding to actin-Tm was weaker for the TnI mutants alone than when they were complexed with TnT and TnC (Fig. 4, A and B).Figure 4SDS-PAGE pattern of the binding of WTnI and its inhibitory region deletion mutants to actin-Tm alone (A) and complexed with TnT and TnC (B).

After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, they were Airfuged (maximum speed) for 30 min. SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% polyacrylamide gel according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar).

Following Tn displacement, the fibers were reconstituted with preformed complexes of TnC and WTnI and its deletion mutants. Fig. 5 illustrates a typical experiment on the TnT-treated fiber (panel A) compared with the control buffer-treated fiber (panel B), which had been tested in parallel to estimate the time-dependent rundown of the fibers. Fig.6 illustrates the Tn displacement procedure. As shown, incubation of the fibers with TnT resulted in a complete loss of Ca2+ dependence of force, and the fibers became unregulated (Fig. 5 A). This is illustrated in Fig. 6by a transition from step 1 to step 2. When Tn-displaced fibers were incubated with a preformed TnI·TnC complex, dissolved in the relaxing solution (pCa 8), the fibers underwent a gradual relaxation as the Tn activity was reconstituted (Fig. 5 A). This step (step 3) restored the Tn complex (Fig. 6), and the fibers became entirely regulated by Ca2+. The level of force relaxation depended on the TnI mutant used for the TnI·TnC complex. In Fig. 5 A, WTnI or rabbit skeletal TnI was used, and full relaxation in the pCa 8 solution was achieved. Fig. 7summarizes the effect of the TnI mutations on the level of relaxation and force development following reconstitution of the fibers with preformed TnI·TnC complexes. The dashed line in Fig. 7represents the level of Ca2+-unregulated force after RSTnT treatment (this step and the level of Ca2+-unregulated force are also shown in Fig. 5 A). Arrows indicate the percentage of force inhibition relative to Ca2+-unregulated force. As shown, the relaxation in the fibers could be restored upon incubation with TnI·TnC; however, the level of relaxation varied depending on the TnI mutant utilized in the reconstitution. The NH2-terminal inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ95–106), inhibited ≈54.9 ± 6% of the force following reconstitution. On the other hand, the COOH-terminal inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ105–115), as well as the complete inhibitory region deletion mutant, TnI-(Δ96–116), inhibited only 28.3 ± 10 and 28.0 ± 7% of the force, respectively. Interestingly, all three TnI deletion mutants gave an elevated maximal level of force recovery in the high Ca2+ solution (pCa 4) (Fig. 7). The extent of activation over that recovered with WTnI·TnC was ≈114 ± 16, 116 ± 15, and 123 ± 5% for TnI-(Δ96–116), TnI-(Δ105–115), and TnI-(Δ95–106), respectively (Fig. 7). The Ca2+sensitivity of force development measured after fiber reconstitution is demonstrated in Fig. 8. All three deletion mutants of TnI increased slightly the Ca2+dependence of force (ΔpCa50 ≅ 0.1–0.2) compared with WTnI·TnC-reconstituted fibers. A Western blot of the experimental fibers performed with the TnI antibodies is presented in Fig. 9. As shown, all of the experimental fibers were reconstituted with the respective TnI deletion mutants. Amino acid deletions within the inhibitory region of TnI did not prevent the binding of TnI-(Δ95–106)·TnC, TnI-(Δ105–115)·TnC, or TnI-(Δ96–116)·TnC complexes to the Tn-displaced fibers.Figure 5Protocol for the RSTnT-treated (troponin-displaced) skinned skeletal muscle fibers.
