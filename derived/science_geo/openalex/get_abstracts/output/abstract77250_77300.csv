https://openalex.org/W2092766784,"The intact leukocytes of two children with chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. This is due to defective operation of an oxidase of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide that is insensitive to cyanide and that indirectly stimulates the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate in leukocytes. Such leukocytes undergo no increase in oxygen consumption or in activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt during phagocytosis, although lactate production is normal. The addition of nitroblue tetrazolium to a leukocyte suspension appears to provide a sensitive diagnostic screening test for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1520987654,"λ exonuclease exhibits a much greater rate of attack on native deoxyribonucleic acid than on denatured DNA, the difference in rate being 350-fold for T7 phage DNA. The attack is exclusively exonucleolytic, and the only acid-soluble products are deoxyribonucleoside 5‘-monophosphates. In contrast to the known Escherichia coli exonucleases, its initial site of attack is at the 5‘ termini of a DNA molecule, with a strong preference for termini bearing a phosphoryl residue as compared with those bearing a free hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1497121023,"Abstract By means of procedures for isolating subcellular structural components in a state free from cross-contamination, 5'-nucleotidase of the rat liver has been localized to the membranous component of the microsomes. Evidence has been obtained that suggests that a large fraction of the 5'-nucleotidase activity resides in the plasma membrane fragments that constitute a part of the population of the microsomal membranes. This enzyme is present in the lipoprotein residue of the plasma membrane that is not extractable with 0.9% NaCl solution. It is readily solubilized from the membrane with 0.5% solution of sodium deoxycholate. Isolated nuclei contained a negligible amount of 5'-nucleotidase activity, indicating that the substantial recovery of this enzyme previously reported in the nuclear fraction was due to contaminating microsomal membranes. 5'-Nucleotidase of the plasma membrane exhibited a pH optimum at about 7.5 when assayed in the absence of added metal ions. In the presence of 0.01 m Mg++, a second pH optimum appeared near 9.3. At pH 7.5 and in the presence of 0.01 m Mg++, a Km(amp) value of 2.2 x 10-5 m was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1986715110,"It is apparent that antibiotics are useful in differentiating different stages in the formation of memory. Puromycin gave the first indication that very early memory can be established and survive, for a short period at least, in spite of inhibition of protein synthesis (12). Injection of actinomycin D indicates that RNA synthesis is not essential during this early stage (13). The duration of this early period seems to vary with the inhibiting agent; with puromycin memory was notably degraded in less than an hour, but with actinomycin D or with acetoxycycloheximide it persisted for several hours or more. The fixation or consolidation of memory involves whatever processes give permanence to memory. These processes are disrupted when electroconvulsive shock is administered shortly after a learning experience, presumably because of the interference with organized patterns of neuronal electrical activity. Memory acquired in the presence of antibiotics appears to proceed to a stage beyond that based purely on electrical activity because the memory persists beyond the period usually reported as sensitive to electroconvulsive shock. Further work should show whether this stage is truly insensitive to electroconvulsive shock. Memory acquired in the presence of puromycin does not seem to achieve any durable consolidation. In contrast, memory acquired in the presence of or immediately before injection of acetoxycycloheximide does appear to initiate the later stages of consolidation, as permanent memory. reappears some days after the initial stages have become ineffective in controlling performance. Finally, puromycin has provided evidence of the enlarged area of the neocortex which participates as memory matures. Puromycin also indicates the time required for this maturation process. Since antibiotics have also been useful in studying learning and memory in goldfish (14), this approach seems to have general applicability in defining various stages in the process of memory formation. The initial purpose of these investigations was to determine the molecular basis of the ""memory trace"" This goal still remains distant, although there are some indications that protein synthesizing systems are involved. This objective, though of enormous interest, is to be regarded as only a necessary first step. Whether new proteins or some other molecules cause the changes in synapses thought to underlie memory, this knowledge of itself will contribute only a beginning to our understanding of the events which account for the functioning of the brain. A determination of the composition of computer components would provide very little information towards unraveling their function. As the experiments proceeded, however, information of a more general nature was being obtained. The identification of different stages of consolidation show how injections of antibiotics can supplement electroconvulsive shock as a way of disrupting the establishment of memory and how it can supplement ablation in destroying memory already laid down in a permanent mode. Applied to larger animals the localization of various regions sensitive or insensitive to the action of the drugs should become more definitive. We hope that such experiments will contribute increasingly to the general problem of brain function."
https://openalex.org/W1532989721,"Abstract Ferrous horseradish peroxidase, when mixed rapidly with oxygen-containing solutions, reacts with 1 molecular equivalent of oxygen to form 1 molecular equivalent of a product, oxyperoxidase. This reaction follows second order kinetics and proceeds without detectable intermediates. Ferrous peroxidase when titrated with oxygen yields 4 moles of ferric peroxidase for every mole of oxygen consumed. We believe that in this reaction the initial product is oxyperoxidase, which subsequently reacts with a further 3 moles of ferroperoxidase. Oxyperoxidase, therfore, retains all 4 oxidizing equivalents of the oxygen. The spectrum of oxyperoxidase closely resembles that of oxyhemoglobin and is very similar to that of the previously described Compound III of peroxidase. On the basis of this and other evidence we suggest that Compound III is actually oxyperoxidase. Our preparations of oxyperoxidase undergo a slow, spontaneous decay to ferric peroxidase; the process follows first order kinetics and no intermediates are detected. We have been unable to show dissociation of oxyperoxidase, even with an intense light pulse. Oxyperoxidase oxidizes dithionite directly, in a reaction not found in other heme proteins. Oxyperoxidase on the one hand shows striking similarities to other oxyheme proteins, and on the other hand may accept electrons, for example, from dithionite or ferroperoxidase. The conjunction of these properties in one molecule makes it a prototype of a terminal oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1498199291,"Abstract A procedure is described for purifying adenylate deaminase from calf brain. The method involves salt precipitation from the soluble protein of brain followed by heat treatment, diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography, and either sucrose density gradient centrifugation or gel filtration. The final purification is 180-fold. The enzyme is activated by adenosine triphosphate and by alkali metal ions. The most effective alkali metal ion is that of lithium. Ammonium and tetramethylammonium ions have no effect on activity. The activators do not alter the pH optimum of the enzyme, which is about pH 6.2. ATP protects the enzyme against heat inactivation. Some kinetic properties of the enzyme in the presence and in the absence of ATP and LiCl are presented. A plot of the reaction rate with respect to the AMP concentration in the absence of activators yields a curve with a pronounced sigmoidal shape. Addition of LiCl yields similar curves which are displaced to the left. Addition of ATP yields curves which approximate rectangular hyperbolas. The effect of both activators is thus to increase the apparent affinity of the enzyme for AMP without affecting the maximum reaction velocity. Conversely, increasing the concentration of AMP has the effect of increasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP. Addition of LiCl also increases the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP."

The purified preparation is free of detectable contamination by the endonuclease I, DNA polymerase, DNA phosphatase-exonuclease, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and ribonuclease activities known to be present in Escherichia coli; it may contain a trace (0.01%) of exonuclease I."
https://openalex.org/W1542788366,"Abstract The metabolic function of carnitine in the fatty acid oxidase-deficient flight muscle of the blowfly, Phormia regina, was investigated. Mitochondria from flies did not oxidize palmitate or hexanoate in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, coenzyme A, carnitine, and serum albumin. Palmitoyl carnitine was oxidized at an extremely slow rate, QO2 of 20. The rate of synthesis of the carnitine ester was much slower and is rate limiting in fatty acid oxidation. Hexanoyl carnitine was apparently not metabolized. Flight muscle of flies, however, has a concentration of carnitine of over 4 µmoles per g, wet weight. These findings suggest that the primary function of carnitine in blowfly flight muscle is not related to utilization of fats. Carnitine increased the rate of oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate-1-14C to acetyl-CoA. The malonate inhibition of the rate of production of 14CO2 from pyruvate-1-14C, but not from pyruvate-3-14C, was relieved by carnitine. The rate of oxidation of pyruvate-3-14C to 14CO2 was inhibited by carnitine. These effects of carnitine may be explained by the formation of acetyl carnitine from carnitine and acetyl-CoA, derived from pyruvate, catalyzed by an active carnitine acetyl transferase. Approximately 90% of the enzyme was found in the mitochondria of the muscle. Acetyl-CoA, in the presence of carnitine, was not oxidized by mitochondria, although acetyl carnitine was oxidized with a QO2 of over 300. This indicates that blowfly mitochondria are not permeable to acetyl-CoA but are permeable to acetyl carnitine. When both pyruvate and acetyl carnitine were available, pyruvate was used preferentially. The concentration of acetyl carnitine in flight muscle of blowflies increased 4-fold on initiation of flight, paralleling the increase in pyruvate. After about 1 min of flight, the level of acetyl carnitine decreased and attained a steady state at a concentration twice that in the muscle at rest. Functions for carnitine in carbohydrate utilization, resulting from the direct action of carnitine on pyruvate metabolism, are proposed. A comparative study of the metabolism of carnitine in blowflies and bees is described."
https://openalex.org/W1579655741,"Abstract The apoprotein separated from human serum lipoproteins of density 1.063 to 1.21 (HDL) by extraction with ethanol-ethyl ether (3:2) at -10° was shown to recombine in definite stoichiometric ratios either with the whole phospholipids of HDL or with the lecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin fractions separated from the same lipoproteins. For the reaction, aqueous dispersions of phospholipids were obtained by sonic oscillation. HDL apoprotein maintained its binding property for phospholipids after acetylation, succinylation, reduction and alkylation, and treatment with neuraminidase, as well as in the presence of urea. The reconstituted protein-phospholipid complex acted as a substrate activator for the enzyme lipoprotein lipase obtained from chicken adipose tissue. This activity, previously reported for whole HDL, was not observed when either HDL apoprotein or phospholipids were used alone. The results are considered compatible with the concept that HDL is made of apoprotein subunits held by lipid bridges."
https://openalex.org/W1507522791,"Abstract Protein synthesis in brain slices was followed by the incorporation of 14C-amino acid, mostly 14C-valine; it remained steady for at least 4 hours at 37°. When applied for 15 min or longer, electrical stimulation of slices, by use of alternating line current reduced to 0.5 to 3 volts, inhibited protein synthesis increasingly, the inhibition reaching a plateau at 1.5 volts. For comparison, the paired slice technique was used. When stimulation was in the presence of uniformly labeled 14C-glucose, only slight inhibition of 14C incorporation into proteins was found. However, electrical stimulation also increases the conversion of glucose to amino acids. Therefore, the pool of 14C-labeled amino acids increases with stimulation. If this is taken into account, the degree of inhibition of protein synthesis due to electrical stimulation becomes equal whether the amino acid is internally produced from glucose or is added to the suspending fluid. Acidic amino acids that have excitatory effect on nerves in vivo were found to inhibit protein synthesis in brain slices in the following order of decreasing percentage inhibition: dl-homocysteate (47%), l-glutamate (34%), d-aspartate (35%), and dl-α-aminoadipate (17%). Exposure was for 60 min at 37°. The order is approximately parallel to their excitatory potency on nerves. In both electrical and chemical stimulation, the inhibition of protein synthesis was poorly reversible or irreversible. Analogous effects of electrical stimulation or acidic amino acids were not found with kidney slices. Amino acid permeation in brain slices was unaffected by electrical or chemical stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2171045949,"Quantitative data are presented on the distribution of pteridines, primarily xanthopterin, leucopterin, erythropterin, and sepiapterin, in adults and developing pupae of the butterfly Colias eurytheme. The pteridine biosynthetic pathway in the developing wings of Colias has been studied by the use of radioactive precursors injected into whole pupae and incubated in Ringer's solution with excised, developing wings. By comparison of isotope incorporation, by pupae and isolated wings, from uniformly labeled adenosine- and guanosine-14C and guanosine-8-14C, it was concluded that Colias forms the pteridine ring from guanosine (or a phosphorylated derivative) with loss of the guanosine carbon atom 8. Pteridine interconversions were examined by studying the kinetics of isotope incorporation by the pteridines from uniformly labeled guanosine-14C immediately after its injection into whole pupae, and by studying the incorporation patterns obtained upon incubation of isolated wings with xanthopterin-14C, leucopterin-14C, and erythropterin-14C. The pteridine pathway is bipartite, one branch leading to position 6 side chain-bearing pteridines, the other leading to pteridines not alkylated at position 6. Within the latter branch, xanthopterin serves as precursor of leucopterin and erythropterin. The origins of position 6 side chain of sepiapterin and position 7 side chain of erythropterin were studied by incubation of isolated wings with radioactive pyruvate, malate, lactate, serine, threonine, and β-hydroxybutyrate. The results showed no incorporation into the sepiapterin side chain from any of these, but strong incorporation into the erythropterin side chain from pyruvate, malate, and lactate. In addition, sepiapterin made by Colias from uniformly labeled guanosine-14C was oxidized to 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine-6-carboxylic acid, and the specific radioactivities of the parent compound and oxidation product were compared. The observed loss of specific activity agrees quantitatively with that expected if the sepiapterin side chain arises by modification of substitution on the initial pteridine position 6 side chain derived from guanosine ribose. The predictions of the alternative hypothesis of cleavage and replacement of the initial side chain are not compatible with the values observed. The present findings are discussed in relation to other recent work on pteridine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1496120431,Abstract A rat liver microsomal system in vitro was used to study the transport of protein from the attached ribosomes to the contents of the microsomal vesicle. Puromycin caused a release of the protein from the ribosomes and the released protein was transferred to the contents of the microsomal vesicle. The transfer of nascent protein across the microsomal membrane was not accompanied by any changes in phospholipid metabolism and occurred in the absence of adenosine triphosphate and of any added enzyme and also at 0°. The only requirement needed for transport of the nascent protein across the microsomal membrane is that it be released from the ribosomes.
https://openalex.org/W2068943522,Experiments with slices of human kidney cortex from two control subjects demonstrated two distinct transport systems for lysine (alpha and beta) which differ greatly in affinity and capacity. Both systems were found in kidney from two patients with cystinuria. Studies with rat kidney confirmed these findings. These experiments defined only a single transport system for cystine in kidney from both control and cystinuric subjects.

In the presumed homozygote there is still significant residual transport of these compounds; however, this remaining function is saturated at normal concentrations of substrate in the plasma and is not inhibited by L-proline in the expected way. The presumed heterozygote has partial loss of a transport system common to the three substrates, which becomes saturated at high concentrations of substrate and is inhibited by L-proline. Two different types of transport systems are proposed: a common system and systems with lower capacity and greater specificity. The two types of transport appear to be controlled by separate genes."

https://openalex.org/W1582236828,"Abstract Polyribosomes were obtained from the livers of hypophysectomized and control rats. Although sucrose gradient analysis disclosed that polyribosome profiles of the livers of hypophysectomized animals were identical with those of livers derived from intact controls, the rate of amino acid incorporation into hepatic protein in vitro was lower in the polyribosomes derived from hypophysectomized animals. Furthermore, the stimulation of phenylalanine-14C incorporation that followed the addition of polyuridylic acid was less when the disaggregated polyribosomes were obtained from hypophysectomized rats than when similar preparations obtained from control animals were used. Similar findings were obtained with polyribosomes from thyroidectomized rats. These studies suggest that hypophysectomy and thyroidectomy influence protein synthesis predominantly by action at the level of the ribosome."

The data presented in this paper clearly show that the binding of a gaseous ligand by hemoglobin is coupled with a change in optical rotation in the far ultraviolet, which amounts to about 8.5%. The change in optical rotation at 233 mµ which is associated to the binding of a ligand by hemoglobin indicates a conformational rearrangement of the protein moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1550199748,Abstract Static studies of some enzymes and their interaction with substrate models suggested the occurrence of conformational changes in the complex prior to the catalytic steps. Kinetic studies of such a system by the temperature jump method yielded data which apparently only fit the scheme: E + S ⇄ ES ⇄ E'S. All four of the rate constants could be evaluated. This kinetic evidence of the occurrence of an isomerization in the enzyme-substrate complex lends considerable support to the hypothesis of the catalytically important conformational change.

The maximum specific radioactivity of RNA was seen in the microsomal RNA fraction 2 days after thyroxine treatment. Actinomycin D inhibited RNA synthesis in liver at all the stages of metamorphosis induced by thyroxine; however, delayed administration of actinomycin D did not inhibit induction of carbamyl phosphate synthetase. In the later stages of metamorphosis, temperature-dependent (thyroxine-independent) carbamyl phosphate synthetase synthesis was observed accompanied by a rapid RNA turnover."

https://openalex.org/W2120778880,"1. The substrate, tryptophan, forms spectrophotometrically detectable enzyme-substrate complexes with tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.1.12)—commonly known as tryptophan pyrrolase—when the iron atom of the heme prosthetic group is either divalent, trivalent, or combined with carbon monoxide. 2. One-half of the enzyme-bound ferriprotoporphyrin IX undergoes a rapid cyclic valence change during catalysis owing to its sequential reduction by tryptophan and reoxidation by oxygen. During steady state catalysis rapid reoxidation maintains the enzyme predominantly as ferriprotoporphyrin, but addition of CO to the steady state catalytic system leads to the detection and trapping of the reduced form as the CO-ferroprotoporphyrin complex. 3. Activation of latent enzyme may be accomplished with sulfhydryl compounds or photochemically, as well as with ascorbate. The nature of the action spectrum and the inhibition of activation by catalase implicates photochemically generated hydrogen peroxide as the chemical mediator of the photoactivation. 4. Spectral studies indicate that reductive or photochemical activation of the enzyme is not due to net reduction of the ferriprotoporphyrin, but rather to the reduction of an unidentified enzyme component which then permits the ferriprotoporphyrin prosthetic group to undergo reduction by the substrate, tryptophan. 5. p-Chloromercuribenzoate competitively inhibits tryptophan oxygenase, indicating probable involvement of one or more sulfhydryl groups as binding sites for tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1536207644,"Abstract In addition to their action upon adenine, the adenine aminohydrolases of Azotobacter vinelandii and of Candida utilis have been found capable of acting upon 6-chloropurine, 6-iodopurine, 6-hydrazinopurine, 2-amino-6-chloropurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and 7-aminothiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine. In each case the enzyme catalyzes the replacement by a hydroxyl group of the substituent on position 6 or on the position analogous to position 6 of the purine ring system. Kinetic constants for each of these substrates are reported. Km appears to reflect affinity for the enzyme rather than turnover number, and some of these compounds gave higher turnover numbers than the natural substrate, i.e. adenine. In addition, several purine analogues have been found to act as competitive inhibitors of adenine aminohydrolase. Several structurally related acyclic compounds, including guanylurea, biuret, and biguanide, have also been found to inhibit adenine aminohydrolase competitively. Milk xanthine oxidase also was found to be competitively inhibited by these acyclic compounds.

While the Soret absorption of both ferri- and ferrocytochrome c was enhanced in 20% ethylene glycol, the extent of enhancement, Δe/e, was substantially less than that measured for the model compound or for the unfolded protein in 8 m urea. The percentage maximal perturbation of ferrocytochrome c was found to be independent of the radius of the perturbant over the range from 1.4 to 3.6 A. It was concluded that only a portion of the heme moiety of native cytochrome c is in contact with the solvent. Replacement of one of the two protein-heme coordinate-covalent bonds by cyanide increased the exposure of the heme to the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1520822896,"Abstract Rat liver microsomes preincubated for 12 min with all the factors necessary for amino acid incorporation do not incorporate phenylalanine in the absence of polyuridylic acid. In the presence of polyuridylic acid, preincubated microsomes show a 3- to 4-fold greater polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine incorporation than nonpreincubated microsomes. By varying preincubation time, temperature, and magnesium ion, adenosine triphosphate, or guanosine triphosphate concentration, the amount of phenylalanine incorporated during preincubation and the phenylalanine-incorporating activity remaining after preincubation are altered. Under these various conditions the response of preincubated microsomes to polyuridylic acid is shown to be directly related to the amount of amino acid incorporated during preincubation and inversely related to the amino acid-incorporating activity remaining after preincubation. Preincubated microsomes are more sensitive to low levels of polyuridylic acid and require higher levels of polyuridylic acid to saturate their capacity to incorporate phenylalanine. Furthermore, preincubated microsomes from which endogenous messenger ribonucleic acid activity has been removed bind greater amounts of polyuridylic acid."

Observations of the living cell communities with the light microscope indicated that deuteration within viable limits (up to 25 percent) accelerates and increases the growth of sympathetic neurons and favors their repeated subdivision as a very large size is attained, thus inducing them to recapitulate cyclically the early stages of neurogenesis. Living deuterated cells appear more opaque and heteromerous than control neurons; furthermore, electron micrographs reveal an unusual abundance of granular and fibrillar elements in the nuclei of both neurons and supporting cells. Sheaves of complexly organized fibrillar components appear in the neuronal perikaryon; and ribosomes, Golgi elements, and microtubules are conspicuously numerous.

Myokinase activity is completely regenerated by the addition of dithiothreitol to the derivative. Alkylation of the myokinase derivative with iodoacetic acid at pH 2.4 completely prevents regeneration of activity by dithiothreitol. Amino acid analysis shows that the loss in activity is due to the specific modification of 2 to 3 methionine residues.

https://openalex.org/W1963685033,"Oxygen-carrying capacity of hemocyanin from Limulus and Busycotypus (Busycon) decreases with increasing radiation, giving initial yield values for G(-O(2),) of 1.1 and 1.0, respectively. High radiation doses regenerate this capacity of Busycotypus hemocyanin. These effects are attributed largely to the dual nature of hydrogen peroxide, which, at low concentrations, oxidizes protein-bound copper and at high concentrations, that is, at high doses, reduces oxidized copper. The ability of hemocyanin to decompose hydrogen peroxide is relatively unaffected by irradiation, which suggests that copper atoms at the active sites are not all equivalent. The catalase-like activity of Busycotypus hemocyanin can be simulated by amino acid chelates of copper, including arginine, histidine, and glycine."
