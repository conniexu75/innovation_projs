https://openalex.org/W1989194294,"The Wnt-1 (int-1) proto-oncogene, which encodes a putative signaling molecule, is expressed exclusively in the developing central nervous system and adult testes. To examine the role of Wnt-1, we generated six independent embryonic stem cell lines in which insertion of a neoR gene by homologous recombination inactivated a Wnt-1 allele. Germline chimeras were generated from two lines, and progeny from matings between heterozygous parents were examined. In all day 9.5 fetuses homozygous for mutated Wnt-1 alleles, most of the midbrain and some rostral metencephalon were absent. The remainder of the neural tube and all other tissues were normal. In late-gestation homozygotes, there was virtually no midbrain and no cerebellum, while the rest of the fetus was normal. Homozygotes are born, but die within 24 hr. Thus the normal role of Wnt-1 is in determination or subsequent development of a specific region of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2010207338,"The C-terminal CAAX motif of ras proteins undergoes a triplet of posttranslational modifications that are required for membrane association. The CAAX motif lies immediately C-terminal to the hypervariable domain, a region of 20 amino acids that distinguishes the ras proteins from each other. The hypervariable domains of p21H-ras, p21N-ras, and p21K-ras(A) contain sites for palmitoylation, which we now show must combine with the CAAX motif to target specific plasma membrane localization. Within the hypervariable domain of p21K-ras(B), which is not palmitoylated, we have identified a novel plasma membrane targeting signal consisting of a polybasic domain that also acts in combination with the CAAX motif. One function of the hypervariable domains of p21ras is therefore to provide different signals for plasma membrane localization."

https://openalex.org/W2168146165,"We have identified a novel growth factor, stem cell factor (SCF), for primitive hematopoietic progenitors based on its activity on bone marrow cells derived from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil. The protein was isolated from the medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells. It is heavily glycosylated, with both N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate. Amino acid sequence following removal of N-terminal pyroglutamate is presented. The protein has potent synergistic activities in semisolid bone marrow cultures in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors. It is also a growth factor for mast cells. In two companion papers, we present the sequences of partial SCF cDNAs, identify SCF as a c-kit ligand, and map the SCF gene to the Sl locus of the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2000540402,"Cells expressing mRNA for hippocampus-derived neurotrophic factor (HDNF/NT-3) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were identified by in situ hybridization. In the rat brain, HDNF mRNA was predominantly found in pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus. Lower levels of HDNF mRNA were found in granular neurons of the dentate gyrus and in neurons of the taenia tecta and induseum griseum. BDNF mRNA-expressing cells were more widely distributed in the rat brain, with high levels in neurons of CA2, CA3, and the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, in the external and internal pyramidal layers of the cerebral cortex, in the claustrum, and in one brainstem structure. Lower levels were seen in CA1 and in the granular layer of the hippocampus, in the taenia tecta, and in the mammillary complex. In peripheral tissues, HDNF mRNA was found in glomerular cells in the kidney, secretory cells in the male rat submandibular gland, and epithelial cells in secondary and tertiary follicles in the ovary. Cells expressing BDNF mRNA were found in the dorsal root ganglia, where neurons of various sizes were labeled."
https://openalex.org/W2074225638,"Proteolytically produced carboxyl-terminal fragments of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein that include a conserved region rich in arginine and lysine bind specifically to transactivation response RNA sequences (TAR). A chemically synthesized 14-residue peptide spanning the basic subdomain also recognizes TAR, identifying this subdomain as central for RNA interaction. TAR RNA forms a stable hairpin that includes a six-residue loop, a trinucleotide pyrimidine bulge, and extensive duplex structure. Competition and interference experiments show that the Tat-derived fragments bind to double-stranded RNA and interact specifically at the pyrimidine bulge and adjacent duplex of TAR."
https://openalex.org/W2052398986,"In addition to the induction of tumor regression, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated as the causative agent in a number of pathologies, including cachexia, septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmunity, and induction of HIV expression. We propose that this complex physiology might be manifest by different forms of TNF: the 17 kd secretory component, the 26 kd transmembrane form, or both. To determine whether the 26 kd form of TNF was biologically active and whether its biology differed from that of the secretory component, we generated uncleavable and solely secretable mutants of TNF and studied their biological activities. We found that an uncleavable mutant of the 26 kd cell surface transmembrane form of TNF kills tumor cells and virus-infected cells by cell-to-cell contact, and that TNF need not be internalized by its target to kill. Thus, the 26 kd integral transmembrane form of TNF may function in vivo to kill tumor cells and other targets locally in contrast to the systemic bioactivity of the secretory component."
https://openalex.org/W2116797743,"RNA export from the nucleus has been analyzed in Xenopus oocytes. U1 snRNAs made by RNA polymerase II were exported into the cytoplasm, while U1 snRNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase III, and therefore with a different cap structure, remained in the nucleus. Export of the polymerase II-transcribed RNAs was inhibited by the cap analog m7GpppG. Spliced mRNAs carrying monomethylguanosine cap structures were rapidly exported, while hypermethylated cap structures delayed mRNA export. The export of a mutant precursor mRNA unable to form detectable splicing complexes was also significantly delayed by incorporation of a hypermethylated cap structure. The results suggest that the m7GpppN cap structure is likely to be a signal for RNA export from the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2058794781,"Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop an autoimmune form of diabetes, becoming hyperglycemic after 3 months of age. This process was accelerated by injecting young NOD mice with CD4+ islet-specific T cell clones derived from NOD mice. Overt diabetes developed in 10 of 19 experimental animals by 7 weeks of age, with the remaining mice showing marked signs of the disease in progress. Control mice did not become diabetic and had no significant pancreatic infiltration. This work demonstrates that a CD4 T cell clone is sufficient to initiate the disease process in the diabetes-prone NOD mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1978624555,"Interferons (IFNs) are a heterogeneous family of cytokines that exhibits multiple biological activities. Upon viral infection, expression of type I IFNs (i.e., IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) is induced in a variety of differentiated cells but not in cells of embryonal origin. IRF-1 and IRF-2, which bind to the same cis-elements within the promoters of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I genes, were identified previously. Here we demonstrate that the expression of both IRF and IFN genes is developmentally regulated in mouse EC cells; these genes become functional only after cell differentiation. Furthermore, cDNA-directed IRF-1 produced in undifferentiated but not differentiated EC cells efficiently activates the transfected IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and endogenous IFN-alpha genes, whereas IRF-2 represses the IRF-1 effects. These findings emphasize the dual function of the IRF-responsive cis-elements as positive and negative regulators, since they can be occupied by transcriptionally active or inactive IRF molecules. This type of regulatory mechanism might operate in other cytokine systems."
https://openalex.org/W2077679480,"We have previously shown that the two transcriptional activation functions (TAF-1 and TAF-2) of the human estrogen receptor (hER) have synergistic properties different from one another and from those of acidic activating domains (AADs). Here we compare the transcriptional interference/squelching properties of the hER TAFs with those of the AADs of yeast GAL4 and chimeric GAL-VP16 activators. Our results indicate that AADs interact with a factor(s) that, while required for activation by AADs, is not essential for activation by hER TAFs. In contrast, hER TAFs appear to interact with factors indispensable for mediating both their activation function and that of AADs. Thus, different classes of trans-activators may interact with different factors. In addition, the synergistic and transcriptional interference/squelching properties of the two TAFs of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) indicate that both are composed of acidic and nonacidic activation functions."
https://openalex.org/W2117859683,"The regulatory protein NIFA activates transcription of nitrogen fixation (nif) operons by the σ54 holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase. NIFA from Klebsiella pneumoniae activates transcription from the nifH promoter in vitro; in addition, the integration host factor, IHF, binds between the nifH promoter and an upstream binding site for NIFA. We demonstrate here that IHF greatly stimulates NIFA-mediated activation of nifH transcription in vitro and thus that the two factors are functionally synergistic. Electron micrographs indicate that IHF bends the DNA in the nifH promoter regulatory region. Although IHF binds close to the nifH promoter, it does not directly stlmulate binding of σ54 holoenzyme. Rather, the IHF-induced bend may facilitate productive contacts between NIFA and σ54 holoenzyme that lead to the formation of open complexes. IHF binds to nif promoter regulatory regions from a variety of organisms within the phylum “purple bacteria,” suggesting a general ability to stimulate NIFA-mediated activation of nif transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2060358284,"We have analyzed the DNA sequences associated with four different human telomeres. Two are members of distinct repeated sequence families which are located mainly but not exclusively at telomeres. Two are unique in the genome, one deriving from the long arm telomere of chromosome 7 and the other from the pseudoautosomal telomere. One telomere-associated repeated sequence has a polymorphic distribution among the chromosome ends, being present at a different combination of ends in different individuals. These data thus identify a new source of human genetic variation and indicate that the canonical features of the organization of telomere-associated DNA are widely conserved in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2087251720,"Although astrocytic gliosis has been linked to failure of axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS, its role is not fully established. We used an in vitro assay to investigate the role of reactive astrocytes and macrophages in influencing axonal growth in the lesioned adult rat optic nerve. Soon after optic nerve transection, the nonpermissive nature of the optic nerve is altered to a permissive state near the lesion. This may account for injury-induced axonal sprouting and may contribute to the failure of these sprouts to elongate beyond the site of the lesion in vivo. We provide evidence that this lesion-induced change in the axonal growth-promoting properties of the CNS near the lesion may be produced by mononuclear phagocytes. In addition, several months after optic nerve transection, the degenerated nerves, which consist mainly of astrocytes and lack myelin, i.e., astrocytic ""scar"" tissue, are a good substrate for neurite growth. Taken together, these results suggest that in this in vitro system, substantial inhibitory effects are not associated with regions of astrocytic gliosis and that the nonpermissive nature of the CNS white matter can be modified by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2146504848,"A soluble RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was isolated from Nicotiana tabacum plants infected with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which has a genome of three positive-strand RNA components, 1, 2, and 3. The purified polymerase contained two virus-encoded polypeptides and one host polypeptide. Polymerase activity was completely dependent on addition of CMV RNA as template, and the products of reaction were single-stranded (ss) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA, corresponding to RNAs 1, 2, and 3, and a subgenomic RNA (RNA 4) derived from RNA 3. The ratio of ssRNA to dsRNA was about 5:1, and the ssRNA was shown to be predominantly the positive strand. This demonstrates the complete replication of a eukaryotic virus RNA in vitro by a template-dependent RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1527762941,"By differential hybridization screening of a cDNA library derived from insulin-stimulated cells, we selected a clone which hybridized to an mRNA species that rapidly accumulated in response to insulin. The insert from this clone encoded a putative polypeptide of Mr 33,600, pI 11.2; because the protein was enriched in proline residues (14.4 mol %) and contained three Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro repeats, we have tentatively labeled it tris-tetraprolin (TTP). The function of this protein is not known, but it contains two regions very rich in proline (30-40 mol %); similar proline-rich regions have been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation by other proteins. The mRNA (2.0 kilobases) encoding the TTP protein was essentially undetectable in serum-deprived HIR 3.5 cells, but accumulated dramatically within 10 min of stimulation by insulin. This effect appeared to be due to insulin acting through the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of its own receptor. Insulin induction of TTP mRNA accumulation was prevented by actinomycin D and superinduced by cycloheximide. Accumulation of TTP mRNA was also stimulated by a variety of growth factors and active phorbol esters; however, the insulin effect was virtually normal in cells depleted of protein kinase C. A single TTP gene appeared to be present in the mouse genome. This gene joins the group of genes whose members are rapidly transcribed in response to insulin and other mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W2011039500,"The isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli is an example of a ubiquitous class of enzymes that are regulated by covalent modification. In the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-substrate complex, isocitrate forms a hydrogen bond with Ser113, the site of regulatory phosphorylation. The structures of Asp113 and Glu113 mutants, which mimic the inactivation of the enzyme by phosphorylation, show minimal conformational changes from wild type, as in the phosphorylated enzyme. Calculations based on observed structures suggest that the change in electrostatic potential when a negative charge is introduced either by phosporylation or site-directed mutagenesis is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme. Thus, direct interaction at a ligand binding site is an alternative mechanism to induced conformational changes from an allosteric site in the regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1982373244,"The E74 early ecdysone-inducible gene plays a key role in the regulatory hierarchy activated by ecdysone at the onset of Drosophila metamorphosis. We show here that E74A protein binds to three adjacent sites in the middle of the E74 gene. The consensus sequence for E74A protein binding, determined by random-sequence oligonucleotide selection, contains an invariant purine-rich core sequence, C/AGGAA. This sequence is also present in the binding sites of two mammalian proteins that, like E74A, are related to the ets oncoprotein. Antibody staining of larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes revealed that E74A protein binds to both early and late ecdysone-inducible puffs. This study supports Ashburner's proposal that the early puffs encode site-specific DNA binding proteins that directly interact with the early and late ecdysone-inducible puffs."
https://openalex.org/W2011864580,"We have investigated the interaction of rat primary calvarial bone cells and a mouse osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1 with basement membrane components. On a reconstituted gel of basement membrane, both cell types attached and formed isolated clusters that developed long interconnecting cell processes similar to the canalicular network observed in bone. The differentiation of the osteoblastic phenotype was stimulated as determined by increased alkaline phosphatase production and the deposition of mineral. Antibodies to laminin and to a 32/67 kd laminin receptor blocked this differentiation. Cell morphology was altered by the addition of active laminin-derived synthetic peptides, YIGSR-NH2 and CSRARKQAASIKVAVSADR-NH2, but not by an active RGD-containing peptide. When coated directly on plastic, all three peptides promoted cell adhesion, demonstrating that bone cells interact with specific molecular domains of laminin. These data demonstrate that basement membrane plays a key role in formation of a network of cytoplasmic processes resembling the osteocyte canalicular network in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2116370973,"Voltage-dependent ion channels are thought to consist of a highly conserved repeated core of six transmembrane segments, flanked by more variable cytoplasmic domains. Significant functional differences exist among related types of K+ channels. These differences have been attributed to the variable domains, most prominently the N- and C-termini. We have therefore investigated the functional importance of both termini for the delayed rectifier K+ channel from rat brain encoded by the drk1 gene. This channel has an unusually long C-terminus. Deletions in either terminus affected both activation and inactivation, in some cases profoundly. Unexpectedly, more extensive deletions in both termini restored gating. We could therefore define a core region only slightly longer than the six transmembrane segments that is sufficient for the formation of channels with the kinetics of a delayed rectifier."
https://openalex.org/W2041834434,"The post-translational processing of the yeast a-mating pheromone precursor, Ras proteins, nuclear lamins, and some subunits of trimeric G proteins requires a set of complex modifications at their carboxyl termini. This processing includes three steps: prenylation of a cysteine residue, proteolytic processing, and carboxymethylation. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the product of the DPR1-RAM1 gene participates in this type of processing. Through the use of an in vitro assay with peptide substrates modeled after a presumptive a-mating pheromone precursor, it was discovered that mutations in DPR1-RAM1 cause a defect in the prenylation reaction. It was further shown that DPR1-RAM1 encodes an essential and limiting component of a protein prenyltransferase. These studies also implied a fixed order of the three processing steps shared by prenylated proteins: prenylation, proteolysis, then carboxymethylation. Because the yeast protein prenyltransferase could also prenylate human H-ras p21 precursor, the human DPR1-RAM1 analogue may be a useful target for anticancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1608344832,"Stimulation of human neutrophils with the chemoattractant N-formyl peptide caused rapid polymerization of F-actin as detected by right angle light scatter and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD)-phallacidin staining of F-actin. After labeling neutrophils with 32P, exposure to N-formyl peptide induced a fast decrease of phosphatidylinositol 4-bisphosphate (PIP)2, a slow increase of phosphatidic acid, and a rapid rise of phosphatidylinositol 4-trisphosphate (PIP3). Formation of PIP3 as well as actin polymerization was near maximal at 10 s after stimulation. Half-maximal response and PIP3 formation at early time points resulted from stimulation of neutrophils with 0.01 nM N-formyl peptide or occupation of about 200 receptors. Sustained elevation of PIP3, prolonged right angle light scatter response, and F-actin formation required higher concentrations of N-formyl peptide, occupation of thousands of receptors, and high binding rates. When ligand binding was interrupted with an antagonist, F-actin rapidly depolymerized, transient light scatter response recovered immediately, and elevated [32P]PIP3 levels decayed toward initial values. However, recovery of [32P]PIP2 was not influenced by the antagonist. Based on the parallel time courses and dose response of [32P] PIP3, the right angle light scatter response, and F-actin polymerization, PIP3 is more likely than PIP2 to be involved in modulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2079323599,"The influence of MHC antigens on TCR γδ usage in CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was examined using a pan-reactive and Vδ4 region-specific MAb. While an average of 30% of IELs from the majority of mice of various MHC haplotypes were Vδ4+, a 2-fold or greater percentage of IELs from H-2k mice were Vδ4+. Analysis of IELs from F1 mice indlcated that the increase in TCRs using Vδ4 was likely to be the result of positive selection. The Vδ4 usage patterns of IELs from recombinant inbred strains and from mice recombinant within H-2 revealed that the increase in Vδ4 usage mapped to H-2 and required I-E expression. Moreover, selection of TCRs using Vδ4 occurred in chimeric mice in the absence of a thymus. The results demonstrate an extrathymic selective mechanism for γδ TCRs of CD8+ IELs and suggest that these cells may exhibit MHC class II-restricted antigen recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2078556700,"Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci are extremely valuable for the forensic technique known as DNA fingerprinting because of their hypervariability. Nevertheless, the use of these loci in forensics has been controversial. One criticism of DNA fingerprinting is that the VNTR loci used for the ""fingerprints"" violate the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-W), making it difficult to calculate the probability of observing a genotype in the population. If one can assume H-W, the probability of observing the pair of alleles constituting an individual's genotype can be calculated by taking the product of the alleles' frequencies in the population and multiplying by two if the alleles are different. The evidence cited against assuming H-W is homozygote excess, which is presumed to be caused by an undetected mixture of two or more populations with limited interpopulational mating and distinct allele frequencies. For most VNTR loci, measurement error makes it impossible to test these claims by standard methods. The Lifecodes database of three VNTR loci used for forensics was used to show that the claimed excess of homozygotes is not necessarily real because many heterozygotes with similar allele sizes are misclassified as homozygotes. A simple test of H-W that takes such misclassifications into account was developed to test for an overall excess or dearth of heterozygotes in the sample (the complement of homozygote dearth or excess). The application of this test to the Lifecodes database revealed that there was no consistent evidence of violation of H-W for the Caucasian, black, or Hispanic populations."
https://openalex.org/W1596598368,"The juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor (IR) beta-subunit contains an unphosphorylated tyrosyl residue (Tyr960) that is essential for insulin-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of some endogenous substrates and certain biological responses (White, M.F., Livingston, J.N., Backer, J.M., Lauris, V., Dull, T.J., Ullrich, A., and Kahn, C.R. (1988) Cell 54, 641-649). Tyrosyl residues in the juxtamembrane region of some plasma membrane receptors have been shown to be required for their internalization. In addition, a juxtamembrane tyrosine in the context of the sequence NPXY [corrected] is required for the coated pit-mediated internalization of the low density lipoprotein receptor. To examine the role of the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor during receptor-mediated endocytosis, we have studied the internalization of insulin by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing two mutant receptors: IRF960, in which Tyr960 has been substituted with phenylalanine, and IR delta 960, in which 12 amino acids (Ala954-Asp965), including the putative consensus sequence NPXY [corrected], were deleted. Although the in vivo autophosphorylation of IRF960 and IR delta 960 was similar to wild type, neither mutant could phosphorylate the endogenous substrate pp185. CHO/IRF960 cells internalized insulin normally whereas the intracellular accumulation of insulin by CHO/IR delta 960 cells was 20-30% of wild-type. However, insulin internalization in the CHO/IR delta 960 cells was consistently more rapid than that occurring in CHO cells expressing kinase-deficient receptors (CHO/IRA1018). The degradation of insulin was equally impaired in CHO/IR delta 960 and CHO/IRA1018 cells. These data show that the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor contains residues essential for insulin-stimulated internalization and suggest that the sequence NPXY [corrected] may play a general role in directing the internalization of cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2136302838,"Molecular analysis of a Drosophila minichromosome, Dp(1;f)1187, revealed a relationship between position-effect variegation and the copy number reductions of heterochromatic sequences that occur in polytene cells. Heterochromatin adjacent to a defined junction with euchromatin underpolytenized at least 60-fold. Lesser reductions were observed in euchromatic sequences up to 103 kb from the breakpoint. The copy number changes behaved in all respects like the expression of yellow, a gene located within the affected region. Both copy number and yellow expression displayed a cell-by-cell mosaic pattern of reduction, and adding a Y chromosome, a known suppressor of variegation, increased both substantially. We discuss the possibility that changes in replication alter copy number locally and also propose an alternative model of position-effect variegation based on the somatic elimination of heterochromatic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2010947404,"By homology screening of a rat brain library, we have isolated cDNAs that encode a novel member of the synaptophysin/connexin channel protein superfamily. The deduced protein, named synaptoporin, displays 58% amino acid identity to synaptophysin, with highly conserved transmembrane segments, but a divergent cytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis and PCR amplification of RNA from different rat tissues indicate expression of synaptoporin transcripts in the CNS. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide or a fusion construct encompassing the cytoplasmic tail region of synaptoporin detect a polypeptide of 37 kd that copurifies with small synaptic vesicles. Our data suggest the existence of a family of vesicular channel proteins whose members may be differently distributed among synaptic vesicle subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2051719256,"The isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli is regulated by covalent modification at the active site rather than, as expected, at an allosteric site. As a means of evaluating the mechanism of regulation, the kinetics of the substrate, 2R,3S-isocitrate, and a substrate analog, 2R-malate, were compared for the native, phosphorylated, and mutant enzymes. Phosphorylation decreases activity by more than a factor of 106 for the true substrate, but causes minor changes in the activity of the substrate analog. The kinetic results indicate that electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between the phosphoryl moiety and the γ carboxyl group of 2R,3S-isocitrate are the major causes of the inactivation, with a lesser contribution from the loss of a hydrogen bond."
https://openalex.org/W1491824111,"Alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) is similar to other members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) supergene family in that it undergoes structural rearrangement during the formation of a covalently stabilized inhibitory complex with its cognate enzyme, neutrophil elastase. We have recently demonstrated an abundant, high-affinity cell surface receptor on human hepatoma cells and human mononuclear phagocytes which recognizes a conformation-specific domain of the alpha 1-AT-elastase complex as well as of other serpin-enzyme complexes (Perlmutter, D. H., Glover, G. I., Rivetna, M., Schasteen, C. S., and Fallon, R. J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3753-3757). Binding to this serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) receptor activates a signal transduction pathway for increased expression of the alpha 1-AT gene and may be responsible for clearance of serpin-enzyme complexes. In this study, we show that there is time-dependent and saturable internalization of alpha 1-AT-elastase and alpha 1-AT-trypsin complexes in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Internalization is mediated by the SEC receptor as defined by inhibition by synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 359-374 of alpha 1-AT. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of intracellular radioactivity demonstrated that intact 75- and 66-kDa alpha 1-AT-trypsin complexes were internalized. Kinetic analysis of internalization at 37 degrees C showed that a single cohort of 125I-alpha 1-AT-trypsin complexes, prebound to cells at 4 degrees C, disappeared from the cell surface and accumulated intracellularly within 5-15 min at 37 degrees C. The intracellular concentration of radiolabeled complexes then decreased rapidly coincident with appearance of acid-soluble degradation products in the extracellular culture fluid. Intracellular degradation was inhibited by internalization at 18 degrees C or by internalization at 37 degrees C in the presence of weak bases ammonium chloride, primaquine, and chloroquine, indicating that degradation is lysosomal. These results indicate that in addition to its role in signal transduction the SEC receptor participates in internalization and delivery of alpha 1-AT-protease complexes to lysosome for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1490207104,The synthetic gene coding for the precursor of the cysteine protease papain (EC 3.4.22.2) has been expressed using the baculovirus/insect cell system. The prepropapain gene was cloned into the transfer vector IpDC125 behind the polyhedrin promoter. The recombinant construct was then incorporated by homologous recombination into the Autographa californiaca nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome. The host Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus secrete an enzymatically inactive N-glycosylated papain precursor. This zymogen could be activated in vitro to yield about 400 nmol of active papain per liter of culture. The recombinant active mature papain was enzymatically indistinguishable from natural papain but the precursor was not processed to the same amino acid residue. The insect cells also accumulated prepropapain and glycosylated propapain intracellularly. This accumulation was an indication that there are rate-limiting steps in the secretion of proteins from insect cells in this expression system. Characterization of mutants of the precursor has shown that entry into the secretory pathway and addition of carbohydrate are prerequisite conditions for the production and secretion of functional propapain.

Light-induced changes in cyclic nucleotide levels modulate the phosphorylation of phosducin by protein kinase A. The complete amino acid sequence of purified phosducin from bovine retinas was determined by Edman degradation from overlapping polypeptides derived from enzymatic digestion by trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or from chemical degradation by cyanogen bromide. Excluding the unidentified group which blocks the NH2 terminus, phosducin contains 245 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28,185 and isoelectric point of pH 4.5. Phosducin is enriched with acidic and sulfur-containing amino acids, having 32 glutamic acid, 16 aspartic acid, 9 methionine, and 5 cysteine residues. It also contains 24 serine and 8 threonine residues, of which only serine 73 is located within a consensus phosphorylation sequence (-RKMS(P)QV-) for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase. Secondary structure analysis predicts the presence of 62% alpha-helix, 22% beta-sheet, and 16% random coil, with eight turns. Computer-aided searches of protein data banks revealed no apparent homology to any sequenced protein except that coded by a MEKA cDNA clone (Kuo, C-H., Akiyama, M., and Miki, N. (1989) Mol. Brain Res. 6, 1-10) which deviates from the confirmed phosducin sequence in the last 15 amino acids. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone for bovine retinal phosducin confirmed that the MEKA clone deviation resulted from an unidentified cDNA guanosine nucleotide, a shifted reading frame and a premature stop codon."
https://openalex.org/W2033706859,"A truncated analog of the backbone of sphingomyelin and glycolipids was synthesized. This truncated C8C8 ceramide was soluble in water (but was still able to cross cell membranes) and was utilized by the Golgi apparatus of living cells to produce water-soluble truncated phospholipids and glycolipids that were then secreted into the medium. Sphingomyelin is synthesized in a proximal (likely the cis) Golgi compartment. At 37°C in CHO cells, the sphingomyelin analog is secreted with a half time of about 10 min. With this rate of bulk flow, no special signal is needed to pass through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. At 30°C the half time of secretion of a lumenal ER marker is about 18 min, and that of the truncated sphingomyelin is about 14 min. Comparison of these rates sets an upper limit of about 4 min for half of the ER to be drained into the proximal Golgi at 30°C."

We have shown that Tat potentiates the expression of TAR-containing RNAs, but only when Tat and the TAR-containing RNA are present in the nucleus. We now show that a small change in the TAR loop abolishes nuclear potentiation by Tat. Furthermore, the HIV-1 U3 region induces expression incompetence in mRNA synthesized by this promoter. RNAs of identical structure are, however, translated efficiently when produced from the CMV-IE promoter. The Tat-TAR system appears, therefore, to rescue the expression potential of HIV-1 LTR-directed RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2088891507,"A sequence of three tandem repeats of a 13-mer in the replication origin (oriC) of E. coli is the highly conserved site of opening of the duplex for initiation of DNA synthesis. A protein that binds this sequence has been discovered in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. This novel 33 kd polypeptide behaves as a dimer. Binding to the 13-mers is specific and limited to this region. At a ratio of 10-20 monomers per oriC plasmid, the binding blocks initiation by preventing the opening of the 13-mer region by dnaA protein. Once the 13-mers are opened by dnaA protein action, the 33 kd protein is without effect on the subsequent stages of replication. The specificity of binding and profound inhibitory effect suggest a regulatory role for this protein at an early stage of chromosome initiation."

We found two major clonal populations: astrocyte clones containing GFAP+, but GD3−, O4−, and GC− cells, and oligodendrocyte clones containing cells expressing various combinations of GD3, 04, and GC, with rare GFAP+ cells. These results indicate that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes belong to separate lineages in forebrain postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W1504062513,"The (minus L15) character from the Escherichia coli strain AM16.98 was transduced to an RNase-deficient strain in order to enable a reconstitution analysis. The following results were obtained. 1) The strain lacking L15 showed a 2-3-fold prolonged generation time and the 70 S ribosomes a reduced tendency toward dissociation. 2) Active particles could not be reconstituted unless L15 was added. Addition of L15 regained activity, even if L15 was added after the two-step procedure during a third incubation. However, a modification of the standard two-step reconstitution procedure (lowering NH4+ from 400 to 240 mM and the incubation temperature of the second step from 50 to 47 degrees C) yielded 100% active particles in the absence of L15. Active particles could be formed which even lacked L15, L16, and L30. Addition of either L15 or L16 accelerated the formation of active particles in the second step by a factor of five, and both proteins together by a factor of more than 20. 3) The activation energy of the rate-limiting step of the second incubation was surprisingly reduced for about 20 kcal/mol in the absence of L15, although the corresponding rates were two to five times slower. We conclude 1) that L15 and L16 are late assembly proteins which accelerate the formation of active particles during the late assembly but are neither needed for the early assembly nor essential for ribosomal functions; 2) that some routes of the late assembly (e.g. incorporation of L16) are changing their significance depending on the NH4+ concentration and the absence and presence of L15; and 3) that different reactions are rate limiting during the second step incubation in the presence and absence of L15, respectively, and that the corresponding reaction rates exhibit a different temperature dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2048800658,"We show that transfer of human fibroblast chromosome 11 (containing the human MyoD gene) from primary cells into 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts by microcell fusion activates expression of the transferred human MyoD gene and converts these cells to myoblasts. Transfer of human chromosome 11 into B78 melanoma cells also leads to the activation of human MyoD. In contrast to the results where a single chromosome 11 is transferred, whole-cell hybrids between 10T1/2 cells and human skin fibroblasts do not express the myogenic phenotype; however, when specific human chromosomes are lost, myogenesis occurs. These results suggest that the MyoD locus is potentially functional in primary human fibroblasts, but is normally repressed in trans by a locus on a different human fibroblast chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2052121114,"C-myb, the normal cellular homolog of the retroviral transforming gene v-myb, encodes a nuclear, transcriptional regulatory protein (p75c-myb). C-myb is involved in regulating normal human hematopoiesis, and inhibits dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cells. An alternately spliced c-myb mRNA encodes a truncated version of p75c-myb (mbm2) that includes the DNA binding region and nuclear localization signal present in the c-myb protein, but does not contain the transcriptional regulatory regions. Constitutive expression of mbm2, in contrast to c-myb, here resulted in enhanced differentiation of F-MEL cells. These data suggest that the c-myb protooncogene encodes alternately spliced mRNA species with opposing effects on differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1493175673,"P2-purinergic receptor agonists (UTP) and formylated peptide receptor agonists (FMLP) were found to be equally efficacious in eliciting rapid 6-7-fold increases in inositol polyphosphate accumulation in differentiated HL-60 granulocytes. The activation of this response by either agonist was substantially but incompletely inhibited in cells treated with pertussis toxin. Thus, in cells containing only 1-10% of the control level of non-ADP-ribosylated Gi-2/3, UTP induced rapid 2-fold increases in inositol polyphosphate accumulation whereas smaller 50% increases were observed in FMLP-stimulated cells. Washed membranes prepared from control and toxin-treated HL-60 cells were used to characterize this toxin-insensitive activation of phospholipase C further. The agonist-independent stimulation of phospholipase C by either millimolar Ca2+ or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) was only modestly attenuated by toxin treatment. There was a 70-80% decrease in the rate and extent of phospholipase C activity stimulated by GTP per se in the absence of receptor agonists. The rate and extent of FMLP-induced potentiation of GTP-dependent phospholipase C activity were also inhibited by greater than 80% in toxin-treated membranes. Conversely, the potency and efficacy characterizing UTP-induced potentiation of GTP-dependent phospholipase C activity were only modestly attenuated (less than 20% inhibition). The results indicate that P2-purinergic receptors (and perhaps other Ca2(+)-mobilizing receptors) activate both pertussis toxin-sensitive and toxin-insensitive pathways for phospholipase C regulation in phagocytic leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1947782959,"The L-arabinose-binding protein (ABP) of Escherichia coli consists structurally of two distinct globular domains connected by a hinge of three separate peptide segments. Arabinose is bound and completely sequestered within the deep cleft between the two domains. With reduced affinity, ABP also binds D-galactose (approximately 2-fold reduction) and D-fucose (approximately 40-fold reduction). Experiments have been conducted to explore the role in sugar binding of the hinge connecting the two domains of ABP. To increase the flexibility of the hinge region, a glycine was substituted for a proline at position 254 by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly, this mutation resulted in the dramatic enhancement of galactose binding over that of arabinose. The affinity of the mutant ABP for galactose increased by over 20-fold, while that for arabinose and fucose remained relatively unchanged. We have measured association and dissociation rates of the Gly-254 ABP with L-arabinose, D-galactose, and D-fucose and have determined the crystallographic structure of the protein complexed with each of the three sugars. Both the ligand-binding kinetic measurements and structure analysis indicate that the altered specificity is due to an effective increase in the rigidity of the hinge in the closed conformation which is induced upon galactose binding. Stabilizing contacts are formed between the strands of the hinge in the Gly-254 ABP when galactose is bound which are not found in complexes with the other sugars or the liganded wild-type protein."
https://openalex.org/W1999801071,"Spinal cord axons display a rostrocaudal, positional bias in their innervation of sympathetic ganglia and intercostal skeletal muscles. In an effort to examine the molecular basis of this positional specificity, we used the cyclophosphamide immunosuppression method to produce monoclonal antibodies that bind preferentially to rostral ganglia. The staining distribution of one of these antibodies, ROCA1, has been analyzed using a novel histological method. A graded decline in binding is observed along the chain of adult rat sympathetic ganglia, as well as in the nerves innervating intercostal muscles. The antigen is identified on immunoblots as a 65 kd protein, whose distribution corresponds to the pattern found histologically. Surprisingly, ROCA1 appears to bind to glial cells, implying rostrocaudal, molecular differences in their surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1971797001,"High-threshold Ca2+ current triggers neurotransmitter release, but the existence, significance, and correct identification of different types of high-threshold Ca2+ channels remain controversial. We show selective inhibition of a rapidly inactivating component of high-threshold Ca2+ current in rat sensory neurons by bursts of brief pulses that mimic trains of action potentials and by prolonged depolarization just above the normal rest potential. In contrast, a slowly inactivating component decreases only when sufficient Ca2+ accumulates within the cell. Thus, there are physiologically important differences: whereas availability of the transient component depends on the value of the rest potential and the pattern of a prior stimulus, the sustained component seems to provide a baseline level of voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry that is lost only when intracellular Ca2+ rises."

https://openalex.org/W1602379591,"A binary plasmid system was used to produce nitrogenase components in Escherichia coli and subsequently to define a minimum set of nitrogen fixation (nif) genes required for the production of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) reactivatable apomolybdenum-iron (apoMoFe) protein of nitrogenase. The active MoFe protein is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer containing two FeMoco clusters and 4 Fe4S4 P centers (for review see, Orme-Johnson, W.H. (1985) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 14, 419-459). The plasmid pVL15, carrying a tac-promoted nifA activator gene, was coharbored in E. coli with the plasmid pGH1 which contained nifHDKTYENXUSVWZMF' derived from the chromosome of the nitrogen fixing bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. The apoMoFe protein produced in E. coli by pGH1 + VL15 was identical to the apoprotein in derepressed cells of the nifB- mutant of K. pneumoniae (UN106) in its electrophoretic properties on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as well as in its ability to be activated by FeMoco. The constituent peptides migrated identically to those from purified MoFe protein during electrophoresis on denaturing gels. The concentrations of apoMoFe protein produced in nif-transformed strains of E. coli were greater than 50% of the levels of MoFe protein observed in derepressed wild-type K. pneumoniae. Systematic deletion of individual nif genes carried by pGH1 has established the requirements for the maximal production of the FeMoco-reactivatable apoMoFe protein to be the following gene products, NifHDKTYUSWZM+A. It appears that several of the genes (nifT, Y, U, W, and Z) are only required for maximal production of the apoMoFe protein, while others (nifH, D, K, and S) are absolutely required for synthesis of this protein in E. coli. One curious result is that the nifH gene product, the peptide of the Fe protein, but not active Fe protein itself, is required for formation of the apoMoFe protein. This suggests the possibility of a ternary complex of the NifH, D, and K peptides as the substrate for the processing to form the apoMoFe protein. We also find that nifM, the gene which processes the nifH protein into Fe protein (Howard, K.S., McLean, P.A., Hansen, F. B., Lemley, P.V., Kobla, K.S. & Orme-Johnson, W.H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 772-778) can, under certain circumstances, partially replace other processing genes (i.e. nifTYU and/or WZ) although it is not essential for apoMoFe protein formation. It also appears that nifS and nifU, reported to play a role in Fe protein production in Azotobacter vinelandii, play no such role in K. pneumoniae, although these genes are involved in apoMoFe formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1512986262,Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used to examine glycogen molecules. Individual molecules were approximately ellipsoidal with dimensions in the 20- to 60-nm range. Images of the glycogen molecular surfaces have a laminar appearance. The layered features seen on the surfaces of the molecules suggest that glycogen may grow from one edge as a laminar structure to form an ellipsoid rather than originating at a central point with radial growth of the oligosaccharide chains to form a sphere. The results of these studies indicate that STM can be used to determine details of polysaccharide structures.
https://openalex.org/W1514137851,"Male Wistar fed rats were chronically cannulated and fed ground chow for 2 h for 6 days. On the 7th post-operative day, blood was simultaneously drawn from the portal and hepatic veins over a 2-h feeding period. The position of the hepatic vein cannula was verified using a tritiated water washout technique. In separate experiments, 200 microCi of [3-3H]glucose was added to the food in order to determine the relative contribution of D-glucose and 3-C precursors to newly synthesized glycogen. The 22-h fasting plasma portal vein concentrations of D-glucose, L-lactate, and L-alanine were 4.8 +/- 0.03, 0.81 +/- 0.06, and 0.20 +/- 0.03 mM, respectively (n = 5). The fasting hepatic vein plasma concentrations were 5.1 +/- 0.2, 0.70 +/- 0.15 and 0.19 +/- 0.03 mM, respectively. The portal-hepatic vein gradients after 22 h were -0.24, +0.16, and +0.01 mM for D-glucose, L-lactate, and L-alanine, respectively. At 20 min after beginning the meal, the respective gradients were +2.2, +0.53, and +0.44 mM, indicating hepatic uptake of all glycogen precursors. Of the total carbon from the three major precursors entering the liver as C-6, D-glucose contributed 82%, while alanine and lactate contributed 18% at 20 min. As portal vein D-glucose and L-alanine levels exceeded 6.65 +/- 0.69 and 0.32 +/- 0.07 mM, respectively, the portal-hepatic venous gradient became positive and increased linearly with portal concentrations. The glycogen concentration in the liver increased from a 22-h fast value of 5 mumol of glucosyl units/g wet weight to 101 +/- 7 mumol/g 2 h after the meal. The mean specific activity of portal vein plasma of [3-3H]glucose was 11,490 +/- 1,180 dpm/mumol (+/- S.E.) and that in the glycogen isolated from liver was 8,175 +/- 785 dpm/mumol of glycosyl units 2 h after the meal. The specific activity of liver [3H]glycogen relative to glucose after the meal was 0.73 +/- 0.08. It was concluded that a minimum of 73% of the newly synthesized glycogen was formed from the uptake and direct phosphorylation of portal blood D-glucose by the liver without prior conversion of glucose to 3-C units."
https://openalex.org/W1595043654,We have investigated the importance of the TATA box element in the induction of transcription by the progesterone receptor. Transcription was analyzed from promoters containing a steroid response element upstream of a wild-type or mutated TATA box. Mutation of the TATA box resulted in a loss of correctly initiated transcripts and abolished binding of TATA factor to the TATA box in vitro but did not inhibit transcriptional activation by the progesterone receptor. Thus we conclude that the receptor is able to stimulate the rate of transcription in the absence of a functional TATA box.
