https://openalex.org/W2134590240,"The mechanism underlying chromosomal instability (CIN), an increased rate of gain or loss of whole chromosomes that is common in cancer cells, has been the subject of much debate. Long-term live-cell imaging now reveals that extra-centrosomal cancer cells pass through a transitory multipolar spindle stage, when abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments accumulate. Many attachment errors persist even after the extra centrosomes cluster to form proper bipolar spindles, increasing the likelihood of chromosome missegregation. The cover shows a transient multipolar spindle intermediate in a human cell with extra centrosomes. Microtubules are shown red, centrosomes green and chromosomes white. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of many tumours and correlates with the presence of extra centrosomes, but a direct mechanistic link between CIN and extra centrosomes has not been established. Live-cell imaging is now used to demonstrate that extra centrosomes can promote chromosome missegregation as a consequence of cells passing through a transient 'multipolar spindle intermediate'. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of many tumours and correlates with the presence of extra centrosomes1,2,3,4. However, a direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN has not been established. It has been proposed that extra centrosomes generate CIN by promoting multipolar anaphase, a highly abnormal division that produces three or more aneuploid daughter cells. Here we use long-term live-cell imaging to demonstrate that cells with multiple centrosomes rarely undergo multipolar cell divisions, and the progeny of these divisions are typically inviable. Thus, multipolar divisions cannot explain observed rates of CIN. In contrast, we observe that CIN cells with extra centrosomes routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions, but display a significantly increased frequency of lagging chromosomes during anaphase. To define the mechanism underlying this mitotic defect, we generated cells that differ only in their centrosome number. We demonstrate that extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to promote chromosome missegregation during bipolar cell division. These segregation errors are a consequence of cells passing through a transient ‘multipolar spindle intermediate’ in which merotelic kinetochore–microtubule attachment errors accumulate before centrosome clustering and anaphase. These findings provide a direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN, two common characteristics of solid tumours. We propose that this mechanism may be a common underlying cause of CIN in human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2052505493,"Antimicrobial effector mechanisms are central to the function of the innate immune response in host defense against microbial pathogens. In humans, activation of Toll-like receptor 2/1 (TLR2/1) on monocytes induces a vitamin D dependent antimicrobial activity against intracellular mycobacteria. Here, we report that TLR activation of monocytes triggers induction of the defensin beta 4 gene (DEFB4), requiring convergence of the IL-1beta and vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathways. TLR2/1 activation triggered IL-1beta activity, involving the upregulation of both IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor, and downregulation of the IL-1 receptor antagonist. TLR2/1L induction of IL-1beta was required for upregulation of DEFB4, but not cathelicidin, whereas VDR activation was required for expression of both antimicrobial genes. The differential requirements for induction of DEFB4 and cathelicidin were reflected by differences in their respective promoter regions; the DEFB4 promoter had one vitamin D response element (VDRE) and two NF-kappaB sites, whereas the cathelicidin promoter had three VDREs and no NF-kappaB sites. Transfection of NF-kappaB into primary monocytes synergized with 1,25D3 in the induction of DEFB4 expression. Knockdown of either DEFB4 or cathelicidin in primary monocytes resulted in the loss of TLR2/1-mediated antimicrobial activity against intracellular mycobacteria. Therefore, these data identify a novel mechanism of host defense requiring the induction of IL-1beta in synergy with vitamin D activation, for the TLR-induced antimicrobial pathway against an intracellular pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1984891974,"The visual system has an extraordinary capability to extract categorical information from complex natural scenes. For example, subjects are able to rapidly detect the presence of object categories such as animals or vehicles in new scenes that are presented very briefly. This is even true when subjects do not pay attention to the scenes and simultaneously perform an unrelated attentionally demanding task, a stark contrast to the capacity limitations predicted by most theories of visual attention. Here we show a neural basis for rapid natural scene categorization in the visual cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and an object categorization task in which subjects detected the presence of people or cars in briefly presented natural scenes. The multi-voxel pattern of neural activity in the object-selective cortex evoked by the natural scenes contained information about the presence of the target category, even when the scenes were task-irrelevant and presented outside the focus of spatial attention. These findings indicate that the rapid detection of categorical information in natural scenes is mediated by a category-specific biasing mechanism in object-selective cortex that operates in parallel across the visual field, and biases information processing in favour of objects belonging to the target object category."
https://openalex.org/W2058455075,"STIM1 and Orai1 have been reported to interact upon store depletion culminating in Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current activation. Recently, the essential region has been identified within the STIM1 C terminus that includes the second coiled-coil domain C-terminally extended by approximately 50 amino acids and exhibits a strong binding to the Orai1 C terminus. Based on the homology within the Orai family, an analogous scenario might be assumed for Orai2 as well as Orai3 channels as both are activated in a similar STIM1-dependent manner. A combined approach of electrophysiology and Foerster resonance energy transfer microscopy uncovered a general mechanism in the communication of STIM1 with Orai proteins that involved the conserved putative coiled-coil domains in the respective Orai C terminus and the second coiled-coil motif in the STIM1 C terminus. A coiled-coil single mutation in the Orai1 C terminus abrogated communication with the STIM1 C terminus, whereas an analogous mutation in Orai2 and Orai3 still allowed for their moderate activation. However, increasing coiled-coil probability by a gain of function deletion in Orai1 or by generating an Orai1-Orai3 chimera containing the Orai3 C terminus recovered stimulation to a similar extent as with Orai2/3. At the level of STIM1, decreasing probability of the second coiled-coil domain by a single mutation within the STIM1 C terminus abolished activation of Orai1 but still enabled partial stimulation of Orai2/3 channels. A double mutation within the second coiled-coil motif of the STIM1 C terminus fully disrupted communication with all three Orai channels. In aggregate, the impairment in the overall communication between STIM1 and Orai channels upon decreasing probabilities of either one of the putative coiled-coil domains in the C termini might be compatible with the concept of their functional, heteromeric interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1978008054,"Some fungal species are opportunistic pathogens that can cause infection in people with compromised immune systems. Activation of caspase-1 and the subsequent secretion of mature interleukin (IL)-1beta is a major signaling pathway of the innate immune system, but how yeasts induce caspase-1 activation is unknown. We show here that stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells with heat-killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the purified cell wall components zymosan and mannan induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion when combined with ATP. Macrophages deficient for the inflammasome adaptor ASC were defective in caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion, suggesting involvement of an ASC-dependent inflammasome. Indeed, caspase-1 activation was abrogated in macrophages lacking the NOD-like (NLR) protein Cryopyrin/Nalp3 and in wild type macrophages pretreated with the pannexin-1 inhibitor probenecid. IL-1beta secretion further required the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptors MyD88 and TRIF, and partially relied on TLR2. We previously showed that bacterial molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan induce activation of caspase-7 through the Cryopyrin inflammasome. Similarly, Cryopyrin and ASC were required for activation of caspase-7 in macrophages stimulated with zymosan or mannan and ATP. These results demonstrate that the conserved fungal components zymosan and mannan require ASC and Cryopyrin for caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion and suggest an important role for the Cryopyrin inflammasome during fungal infections."

GlcNAcylated proteins are crucial in regulating virtually all cellular processes, including signaling, cell cycle, and transcription. Here we show that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) is highly GlcNAcylated in vivo. In addition, we show that upon activation of HEK293 cells, hemagglutinin-tagged CaMKIV GlcNAcylation rapidly decreases, in a manner directly opposing its phosphorylation at Thr-200.

Unlike “traditional glycosylation,” O-GlcNAc is not elongated into more complex structures and is localized mostly in nucleocytoplasmic compartments. Similar to phosphorylation, GlcNAcylation is abundant, dynamic, and inducible and occurs on Ser and Thr residues (for review see Ref. 2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). To date, all O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are also phosphoproteins. Interestingly, many phosphorylation sites are also known GlcNAcylation sites (e.g. endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (3Du X.L. Edelstein D. Dimmeler S. Ju Q. Sui C. Brownlee M. J. Clin.

Several proteins can be concomitantly phosphorylated and GlcNAcylated or the adjacent phosphorylation and GlcNAcylation sites can regulate the addition of the other moiety (e.g. p53 (2Hart G.W.

Unlike phosphorylation, where more than 600 enzymes regulate the turnover of phosphate (12Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar), O-GlcNAc cycling in mammals is regulated by only one known gene encoding the catalytic subunit for O-GlcNAc transferase (13Kreppel L.K.

GlcNAcylation is crucial in regulating virtually all cellular processes, including signaling, cell cycle, and transcription, affecting protein-protein interactions, activity, stability, and expression (2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc transferase deletion in mice led to embryonic lethality (22Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G.

Recently, several studies have shown a direct link between GlcNAcylation and Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes (28Jones S.P. Zachara N.E. Ngoh G.A. Hill B.G. Teshima Y. Bhatnagar A. Hart G.W.

Calcium (Ca2+) is a central secondary messenger involved in regulating cytoskeletal proteins, ion pumps, and activities of enzymes, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs). Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a multifunctional Ser/Thr kinase found predominantly in the brain, T-cells, and testis. CaMKIV is activated in the presence of increased intracellular [Ca2+], acting as a potent mediator of Ca2+-induced gene expression. The regulation of CaMKIV activity is complex and involves a multistep process to achieve full activation (30Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Racioppi L. Means A.R. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 600-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). First, Ca2+/CaM binds to CaMKIV, exposing its activation loop to allow calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) (32Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). CaMKIV may then also undergo an autophosphorylation event on Ser-11 and Ser-12 in its N terminus (34Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CaMKIV has been shown to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of several proteins, such as c-AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), oncogene 18, AP-1 (activator protein 1), MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2), and O-GlcNAc transferase, among others. Interestingly, KCl-induced depolarization of neuroblastoma cells rapidly activates O-GlcNAc transferase to increase GlcNAcylation levels, suggesting a potential regulatory role for O-GlcNAc during Ca2+ signaling (35Song M. Kim H.S. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Kim I.H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we show that CaMKIV is highly GlcNAcylated in vivo. We also show that upon ionomycin treatment, CaMKIV GlcNAcylation decreases, whereas its interaction with O-GlcNAcase increases in a manner directly opposing the phosphorylation of Thr-200 on CaMKIV. Furthermore, we identify at least five sites of GlcNAcylation on CaMKIV. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have determined that the GlcNAcylation sites located in the active cleft of CaMKIV modulate the phosphorylation of CaMKIV at Thr-200 and its activity toward CREB. Our results strongly indicate that the O-GlcNAc modification participates in the regulation of CaMKIV activation and function. HEK293A cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (25 mm glucose; Mediatech) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). Jurkat human T-lymphocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin for the indicated times. Cerebella were dissected from rat brains (Pel-Freez) and homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm PUGNAc with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation and filtration. HEK293A cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The human CaMKIV cDNA was obtained from the ATCC and subcloned into pEF-HA (36Cheung W.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Recombinant GST-CREB was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected into lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm PUGNAc with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to remove debris. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the indicated antibodies and captured with GammaBind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitates were then washed with lysis buffer and submitted for enzymatic assays or eluted in Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis. Samples were separated on Criterion precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and the gels were subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 with either 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. The blocked membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against O-GlcNAc (CTD110.6), O-GlcNAcase, HA (HA.11; Covance), CaMKIV (Cell Signaling), or pT200 CaMKIV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CTD110.6 O-GlcNAc immunoblots were performed using bovine serum albumin as the blocking agent. Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used to probe for biotin labeling. The blots were then washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, developed using ECL (GE Healthcare), and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). NIH Image or ImageJ software were used for densitometric analysis of immunoblots, and all measurements were normalized against HA loading controls. Immunoprecipitated HA-CaMKIV was washed with lysis buffer, washed once with water, and submitted to the following treatments. Β-Elimination was performed overnight at 4 °C using the GlycoProfile Β-elimination kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. γ-Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) treatment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Β-GlcNAcase (Sigma) treatment was performed in 20 mm MES, pH 5.6, 50 mm NaCl for 2 h at 30 °C, followed by 12 h at 4 °C. All reactions were stopped and eluted with Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis. HA-CaMKIV was immunoprecipitated, washed with lysis buffer, and washed twice with reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 μm PUGNAc, and 5 mm MnCl2 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Next, 2 μl of Gal-T1 Y289L (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of 0.5 mm UDP-GalNAz (Invitrogen) were added to a reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with reaction buffer to remove excess UDP-GalNAz. The samples were then reacted with biotin alkyne (Invitrogen) or tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA) alkyne (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Galactosyltransferase labeling with UDP-[3H]galactose was performed as described previously (38Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reactions were eluted with Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis or gel-purified for site-mapping analysis. In-gel fluorescence was imaged and measured using a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitated HA-CaMKIV was labeled with GalNAz and reacted with biotin alkyne as described above (supplemental Fig. S1). The sample was gel-purified, trypsin-digested, and enriched for O-GlcNAc-containing peptides over streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen). Biotin-containing peptides were eluted from the streptavidin-agarose by Β-elimination followed by Michael addition (BEMAD) (39Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), to replace the GlcNAc-GalNAz-biotin moiety with DTT (Fig. 2A), and analyzed by an LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) coupled with a nano-two-dimensional liquid chromatography pump (Eksigent Technologies). The mass spectrometer was programmed to record a full precursor scan, followed by fragmentation and MS/MS scans of the top eight most intense ions. The data were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science) against the full human protein data base with DTT-modified Ser/Thr as variable modifications. The automated comparative modeling program SWISS-MODEL was used for homology modeling (40Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6039) Google Scholar). Using the first approach automated mode, SWISS-MODEL selected CaMKIG from the RCSB Protein Data Bank as best template by sequence similarity. Using the x-ray crystal structure of CaMKIG (Protein Data Bank code 2JAM) 4J. E. Debreczeni, A. Bullock, T. Keates, F. H. Niesen, E. Salah, L. Shrestha, C. Smee, F. Sobott, A. C. W. Pike, G.

Knapp, unpublished data. as template, SWISS-MODEL created a predicted model of the kinase domain of CaMKIV. The resulting Protein Data Bank code coordinates are found in supplemental Fig. S3. Figures and other representations of the predicted CaMKIV kinase domain structure were created using MacPyMol (DeLano Scientific). Sequence alignments, percent identity, and percent similarity scores were generated using Clone Manager (Sci-Ed software) and BLAST2 sequences using the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. Cells expressing various forms of HA-CaMKIV were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, and 1 μm PUGNAc with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to remove debris. Clarified lysates were incubated with 10 μl of Kinase-Bind γ-phosphate-linked high substitution ATP resin (Innova Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The binding reactions were washed with lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis. HA-CaMKIV and its mutants were immunoprecipitated, washed with lysis buffer, washed once with lysis buffer containing 500 mm LiCl, washed twice with lysis buffer, and then washed twice with reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, and 1 μm PUGNAc with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Recombinant GST-CREB (2 μg), 2 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 2 μm ATP were added to each reaction and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and subjected to autoradiography and immunoblot analysis. For experiments without ionomycin treatment, samples were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, and the length of exposure to film was significantly longer than ionomycin-stimulated samples. Immunoblots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. All experiments, excluding site-mapping analysis, were performed a minimum of three times. Error bars in all charts represent the mean ± S.E. The paired two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the statistical significance of any differences between the experimental samples and the control or 0-h samples. p values less than 0.05 were deemed statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. p values are indicated in each figure legend. To determine whether CaMKIV was GlcNAcylated, we used several approaches and controls to detect the O-GlcNAc modification. First, we transfected HEK293 cells with an HA-tagged form of CaMKIV, immunoprecipitated using anti-HA tag antibodies, and performed galactosyltransferase reactions using UDP-[3H]galactose. In this reaction, the radioactive galactose moiety is specifically transferred to terminal GlcNAc residues. Overexpressed HA-CaMKIV was labeled with [3H]galactose indicating the presence of terminal GlcNAc (Fig. 1A). Recently, a chemoenzymatic approach to detect O-GlcNAc was described using a mutant galactosyltransferase GalT1 Y289L and an azide derivative of UDP-GalNAc (UDP-GalNAz) as donor substrate (41Khidekel N. Arndt S. Lamarre-Vincent N. Lippert A. Poulin-Kerstien K.G. Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16162-16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The resulting azide-labeled proteins were chemically tagged with TAMRA alkyne for detection by in-gel fluorescence. HA-CaMKIV was strongly labeled with TAMRA (Fig. 1B). We were also able to detect GlcNAcylation of HA-CaMKIV using the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 (42Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). As a specificity control, we performed a reductive Β-elimination reaction under mild alkaline conditions to remove O-linked but not N-linked sugars. As expected, Β-elimination treatment completely abolished the O-GlcNAc signal on CaMKIV (Fig. 1C), showing the high specificity of the CTD110.6 antibody for O-GlcNAc. Under these mild Β-elimination conditions, very little protein degradation was observed. To further confirm that CaMKIV is GlcNAcylated, we treated HA-CaMKIV with Β-GlcNAcase and γ-phosphatase. Β-GlcNAcase treatment was sufficient to remove most of the O-GlcNAc from CaMKIV without changing its protein levels, whereas γ-phosphatase treatment completely abolished the slower migrating species, indicating that phosphorylation is responsible for altering CaMKIV mobility on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1D). In this experiment, the phosphorylated species of HA-CaMKIV does not appear to include phosphorylation at Thr-200 (data not shown), consistent with the cells being in a basal unstimulated state. Next, we investigated the presence of O-GlcNAc on endogenously expressed CaMKIV. Toward this end, we immunoprecipitated CaMKIV from rat cerebella and Jurkat human T-lymphocytes, because it had been shown previously that CaMKIV is highly expressed in these tissues (43Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Frangakis M.V. Chatila T. Wood E.R. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17592-17596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKIV was found to be GlcNAcylated in both rat cerebella (Fig. 1E) and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1F). The regulation of CaMKIV activity is complex and involves binding to Ca2+/CaM, auto-phosphorylation on multiple Ser residues at its N terminus, and phosphorylation in its activation loop on Thr-200 by the upstream kinase CaMKK (32Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 33Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation at Thr-200 by CaMKK increases the CaMKIV activity about 10-fold by decreasing the Km value for its substrates (34Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Thr-200 of CaMKIV has been shown to be fast and transient in response to ionomycin (45Anderson K.A. Noeldner P.K. Reece K. Wadzinski B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31708-31716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we observed increased CaMKIV Thr-200 phosphorylation upon ionomycin stimulation, peaking at 2 min and decreasing after 5 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, CaMKIV GlcNAcylation rapidly decreased at 2 min and returned to basal levels after 10 min, in a manner that directly opposed its phosphorylation at Thr-200 (Fig. 2, A and B). Based upon this observation, we sought to determine whether CaMKIV interacts with O-GlcNAcase during activation. Indeed, CaMKIV interacted with O-GlcNAcase, and this interaction increased with ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that O-GlcNAcase is recruited to CaMKIV to facilitate the removal of O-GlcNAc from CaMKIV during its activation. To determine whether phosphorylation at Thr-200 affects the GlcNAcylation of CaMKIV, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create Ala and Glu substitutions at Thr-200, to prevent and mimic constitutive phosphorylation at Thr-200, respectively. Indeed, the GlcNAcylation levels of the T200A mutant was increased 2-fold over wild-type CaMKIV, whereas the T200E mutant displayed less O-GlcNAc (Fig. 2, E and F), supporting a reciprocal relationship between the GlcNAcylation of CaMKIV and its phosphorylation at Thr-200. To explain how GlcNAcylation of CaMKIV could affect its phosphorylation at Thr-200, we identified the sites of GlcNAcylation on CaMKIV. Mapping O-GlcNAc sites has been one of the major obstacles in studying protein GlcNAcylation, mostly because O-GlcNAc is extremely labile during mass spectrometry analysis. Here we modified the newly developed chemoenzymatic labeling protocol, combining it with Β-elimination followed by Michael addition with DTT (BEMAD) for O-GlcNAc site-mapping (Fig. 3A) (10Wang Z. Pandey A. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1365-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2086489854,"Canonical Wnt signals are transduced through a Frizzled receptor and either the LRP5 or LRP6 co-receptor; such signals play central roles during development and in disease. We have previously shown that Lrp5 is required for ductal stem cell activity and that loss of Lrp5 delays normal mammary development and Wnt1-induced tumorigenesis. Here we show that canonical Wnt signals through the Lrp6 co-receptor are also required for normal mouse mammary gland development. Loss of Lrp6 compromises Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and interferes with mammary placode, fat pad, and branching development during embryogenesis. Heterozygosity for an inactivating mutation in Lrp6 is associated with a reduced number of terminal end buds and branches during postnatal development. While Lrp6 is expressed in both the basal and luminal mammary epithelium during embryogenesis, Lrp6 expression later becomes restricted to cells residing in the basal epithelial layer. Interestingly, these cells also express mammary stem cell markers. In humans, increased Lrp6 expression is associated with basal-like breast cancer. Taken together, our results suggest both overlapping and specific functions for Lrp5 and Lrp6 in the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2098293941,"We have previously shown that the Na/K-ATPase binds and inhibits Src. Here, we report the molecular mechanism of Na/K-ATPase-mediated Src regulation and the generation of a novel peptide Src inhibitor that targets the Na/K-ATPase/Src receptor complex and antagonizes ouabain-induced protein kinase cascades. First, the Na/K-ATPase inhibits Src kinase through the N terminus of the nucleotide-binding domain of the alpha1 subunit. Second, detailed mapping leads to the identification of a 20-amino acid peptide (NaKtide) that inhibits Src (IC50 = 70 nm) in an ATP concentration-independent manner. Moreover, NaKtide does not directly affect the ERK and protein kinase C family of kinases. It inhibits Lyn with a much lower potency (IC50 = 2.5 microm). Third, highly positively charged leader peptide conjugates including HIV-Tat-NaKtide (pNaKtide) readily enter cultured cells. Finally, the following functional studies of pNaKtide demonstrate that this conjugate can specifically target the Na/K-ATPase-interacting pool of Src and act as a potent ouabain antagonist in cultured cells: 1) pNaKtide, unlike PP2, resides in the membranes. Consistently, it affects the basal Src activity much less than that of PP2. 2) pNaKtide is effective in disrupting the formation of the Na/K-ATPase/Src receptor complex in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, it blocks ouabain-induced activation of Src, ERK, and hypertrophic growth in cardiac myocytes. 3) Unlike PP2, pNaKtide does not affect IGF-induced ERK activation in cardiac myocytes. Taken together, we suggest that pNaKtide may be used as a novel antagonist of ouabain for probing the physiological and pathological significance of the newly appreciated signaling function of Na/K-ATPase and cardiotonic steroids."

The release of the complete genomes of the angiosperm eudicots Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa, the monocot Orysa sativa, the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens,the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri and the red algae Cyanidioschyzon melorae provided an exceptional opportunity to study the evolution of this superfamily. Methodology In order to better understand the origin and the diversification of B3 domains in plants, we combined comparative phylogenetic analysis with exon/intron structure and duplication events. In addition, we investigated the conservation and divergence of the B3 domain during the origin and evolution of each family. Conclusions Our data indicate that showed that the B3 containing genes have undergone extensive duplication events, and that the REM family B3 domain has a highly diverged DNA binding. Our results also indicate that the founding member of the B3 gene family is likely to be similar to the ABI3/HSI genes found in C. reinhardtii and V. carteri. Among the B3 families, ABI3, HSI, RAV and ARF are most structurally conserved, whereas the REM family has experienced a rapid divergence. These results are discussed in light of their functional and evolutionary roles in plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2002756887,"Background The Vibrio parahaemolyticus type III secreted effector VopS contains a fic domain that covalently modifies Rho GTPase threonine with AMP to inhibit downstream signaling events in host cells. The VopS fic domain includes a conserved sequence motif (HPFx[D/E]GN[G/K]R) that contributes to AMPylation. Fic domains are found in a variety of species, including bacteria, a few archaea, and metazoan eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that the AMPylation activity extends to a eukaryotic fic domain in Drosophila melanogaster CG9523, and use sequence and structure based computational methods to identify related domains in doc toxins and the type III effector AvrB. The conserved sequence motif that contributes to AMPylation unites fic with doc. Although AvrB lacks this motif, its structure reveals a similar topology to the fic and doc folds. AvrB binds to a peptide fragment of its host virulence target in a similar manner as fic binds peptide substrate. AvrB also orients a phosphate group from a bound ADP ligand near the peptide-binding site and in a similar position as a bound fic phosphate. Conclusions/Significance The demonstrated eukaryotic fic domain AMPylation activity suggests that the VopS effector has exploited a novel host posttranslational modification. Fic domain-related structures give insight to the AMPylation active site and to the VopS fic domain interaction with its host GTPase target. These results suggest that fic, doc, and AvrB stem from a common ancestor that has evolved to AMPylate protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2064309373,"Potato is the third most important food crop worldwide. However, genetic and genomic research of potato has lagged behind other major crops due to the autopolyploidy and highly heterozygous nature associated with the potato genome. Reliable and technically undemanding techniques are not available for functional gene assays in potato. Here we report the development of a transient gene expression and silencing system in potato. Gene expression or RNAi-based gene silencing constructs were delivered into potato leaf cells using Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration. Agroinfiltration of various gene constructs consistently resulted in potato cell transformation and spread of the transgenic cells around infiltration zones. The efficiency of agroinfiltration was affected by potato genotypes, concentration of Agrobacterium, and plant growth conditions. We demonstrated that the agroinfiltration-based transient gene expression can be used to detect potato proteins in sub-cellular compartments in living cells. We established a double agroinfiltration procedure that allows to test whether a specific gene is associated with potato late blight resistance pathway mediated by the resistance gene RB. This procedure provides a powerful approach for high throughput functional assay for a large number of candidate genes in potato late blight resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2116088571,"Traditionally IFN/STAT1 signaling is connected with an anti-viral response and pro-apoptotic tumor-suppressor functions. Emerging functions of a constitutively activated IFN/STAT1 pathway suggest an association with an aggressive tumor phenotype. We hypothesized that tumor clones that constitutively overexpress this pathway are preferentially selected by the host microenvironment due to a resistance to STAT1-dependent cytotoxicity and demonstrate increased metastatic ability combined with increased resistance to genotoxic stress.Here we report that clones of B16F1 tumors grown in the lungs of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice demonstrate variable transcriptional levels of IFN/STAT1 pathway expression. Tumor cells that constitutively overexpress the IFN/STAT1 pathway (STAT1(H) genotype) are selected by the lung microenvironment. STAT1(H) tumor cells also demonstrate resistance to IFN-gamma (IFNgamma), ionizing radiation (IR), and doxorubicin relative to parental B16F1 and low expressors of the IFN/STAT1 pathway (STAT1(L) genotype). Stable knockdown of STAT1 reversed the aggressive phenotype and decreased both lung colonization and resistance to genotoxic stress.Our results identify a pathway activated by tumor-stromal interactions thereby selecting for pro-metastatic and therapy-resistant tumor clones. New therapies targeted against the IFN/STAT1 signaling pathway may provide an effective strategy to treat or sensitize aggressive tumor clones to conventional cancer therapies and potentially prevent distant organ colonization."
https://openalex.org/W1975183137,"Unlike the soma, which ages during the lifespan of multicellular organisms, the germ line traces an essentially immortal lineage. Genomic instability in somatic cells increases with age, and this decline in somatic maintenance might be regulated to facilitate resource reallocation towards reproduction at the expense of cellular senescence. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with increased longevity exhibit a soma-to-germline transformation of gene expression programs normally limited to the germ line. Decreased insulin-like signalling causes the somatic misexpression of the germline-limited pie-1 and pgl family of genes in intestinal and ectodermal tissues. The forkhead boxO1A (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16, the major transcriptional effector of insulin-like signalling, regulates pie-1 expression by directly binding to the pie-1 promoter. The somatic tissues of insulin-like mutants are more germline-like and protected from genotoxic stress. Gene inactivation of components of the cytosolic chaperonin complex that induce increased longevity also causes somatic misexpression of PGL-1. These results indicate that the acquisition of germline characteristics by the somatic cells of C. elegans mutants with increased longevity contributes to their increased health and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2149833139,"In Pseudomonas putida, genes for the glucose phosphorylative pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway are organized in two operons; one made up of the zwf, pgl, and eda genes and another consisting of the edd, glk, gltR2, and gltS genes. Divergently with respect to the edd gene is the gap-1 gene. Expression from P(zwf), P(edd), and P(gap) is modulated by HexR in response to the availability of glucose in the medium. To study the regulatory process in greater detail we purified HexR and showed that it is a monomer in solution. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry assays were done showing that HexR recognizes the P(edd), P(zwf), and P(gap-1) promoters with affinity in the nanomolar range. DNA footprinting assays identified the binding site between +30 and +1 at P(zwf), between +16 and +41 at P(edd), and between -6 and +18 at P(gap-1). Based on DNA sequence alignment of the target sites and isothermal titration calorimetry data, two monomers of HexR bind to a pseudopalindrome with a consensus sequence of 5'-TTGTN(7-8)ACAA-3'. Binding of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway intermediate 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate to HexR released the repressor from its target operators, whereas other chemicals such as glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and 6-phosphogluconate did not induce complex dissociation. The phosphorylated effector is likely to be recognized by a sugar isomerase domain located at the C-terminal end of HexR, whereas the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain of HexR exhibits high similarity to proteins of the RpiR family of regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2160839546,"Chorioamnionitis is the most significant source of prenatal inflammation and preterm delivery. Prematurity and prenatal inflammation are associated with compromised postnatal developmental outcomes, of the intestinal immune defence, gut barrier function and the vascular system. We developed a sheep model to study how the antenatal development of the gut was affected by gestation and/or by endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis.Chorioamnionitis was induced at different gestational ages (GA). Animals were sacrificed at low GA after 2d or 14d exposure to chorioamnionitis. Long term effects of 30d exposure to chorioamnionitis were studied in near term animals after induction of chorioamnionitis. The cellular distribution of tight junction protein ZO-1 was shown to be underdeveloped at low GA whereas endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis prevented the maturation of tight junctions during later gestation. Endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis did not induce an early (2d) inflammatory response in the gut in preterm animals. However, 14d after endotoxin administration preterm animals had increased numbers of T-lymphocytes, myeloperoxidase-positive cells and gammadelta T-cells which lasted till 30d after induction of chorioamnionitis in then near term animals. At early GA, low intestinal TLR-4 and MD-2 mRNA levels were detected which were further down regulated during endotoxin-induced chorioamnionitis. Predisposition to organ injury by ischemia was assessed by the vascular function of third-generation mesenteric arteries. Endotoxin-exposed animals of low GA had increased contractile response to the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in responses to acetylcholine. The administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor completely restored endothelial dysfunction suggesting reduced NO bioavailability which was not due to low expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.Our results indicate that the distribution of the tight junctional protein ZO-1, the immune defence and vascular function are immature at low GA and are further compromised by endotoxin-induced chorioamnionitis. This study suggests that both prematurity and inflammation in utero disturb fetal gut development, potentially predisposing to postnatal intestinal pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2008640098,"Prolonged macrolide antibiotic therapy at low doses improves clinical outcome in patients affected with diffuse panbronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis. Consensus is building that the therapeutic effects are due to anti-inflammatory, rather than anti-microbial activities, but the mode of action is likely complex. To gain insights into how the macrolide azithromycin (AZT) modulates inflammatory responses in airways, well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia were exposed to AZT alone, an inflammatory stimulus consisting of soluble factors from cystic fibrosis airways, or AZT followed by the inflammatory stimulus. RNA microarrays were conducted to identify global and specific gene expression changes. Analysis of gene expression changes revealed that the AZT treatment alone altered the gene profile of the cells, primarily by significantly increasing the expression of lipid/cholesterol genes and decreasing the expression of cell cycle/mitosis genes. The increase in cholesterol biosynthetic genes was confirmed by increased filipin staining, an index of free cholesterol, after AZT treatment. AZT also affected genes with inflammatory annotations, but the effect was variable (both up- and down-regulation) and gene specific. AZT pretreatment prevented the up-regulation of some genes, such as MUC5AC and MMP9, triggered by the inflammatory stimulus, but the up-regulation of other inflammatory genes, e.g., cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-8, was not affected. On the other hand, HLA genes were increased by AZT. Notably, secreted IL-8 protein levels did not reflect mRNA levels, and were, in fact, higher after AZT pretreatment in cultures exposed to the inflammatory stimulus, suggesting that AZT can affect inflammatory pathways other than by altering gene expression. These findings suggest that the specific effects of AZT on inflamed and non-inflamed airway epithelia are likely relevant to its clinical activity, and their apparent complexity may help explain the diverse immunomodulatory roles of macrolides."
https://openalex.org/W2049189105,"Sponges branch basally in the metazoan phylogenetic tree and are thus well positioned to provide insights into the evolution of mechanisms controlling animal development, likely to remain active in adult sponges. Of the four sponge clades, the Homoscleromorpha are of particular interest as they alone show the ""true"" epithelial organization seen in other metazoan phyla (the Eumetazoa). We have examined the deployment in sponges of Wnt signalling pathway components, since this pathway is an important regulator of many developmental patterning processes. We identified a reduced repertoire of three divergent Wnt ligand genes in the recently-sequenced Amphimedon queenslandica (demosponge) genome and two Wnts from our EST collection from the homoscleromorph Oscarella lobularis, along with well-conserved genes for intracellular pathway components (beta-catenin, GSK3beta). Remarkably, the two O. lobularis Wnt genes showed complementary expression patterns in relation to the evenly spaced ostia (canal openings) of the exopinacoderm (ectoderm), highly reminiscent of Wnt expression during skin appendage formation in vertebrates. Furthermore, experimental activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway using GSK3beta inhibitors provoked formation of ectopic ostia, as has been shown for epithelial appendages in Eumetazoa. We thus suggest that deployment of Wnt signalling is a common and perhaps ancient feature of metazoan epithelial patterning and morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2127863955,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani is a major public health problem in the developing world. But there is no effective and safe vaccine approved for clinical use against any form of leishmaniasis. Through reactivity with kala-azar patient and cured sera, polypeptides ranging from 91 to 31-kDa from L. donovani promastigotes were previously identified as potential protective vaccine candidates. In this study four polypeptides 91(LD91), 72 (LD72), 51(LD51) and 31 (LD31)-kDa were purified using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution. We compared the vaccine efficacy of these antigens encapsulated in cationic liposomes in BALB/c mice against challenge infection with L. donovani. Our results demonstrated that liposomal LD31 (74%-77%) and LD51 (72%-75%) vaccination reduced parasite burden to the greatest degree followed by liposomal LD72 (65%-67%) and LD91 (46%-49%). Analysis of the cytokine responses in immunized mice revealed that all the vaccinated groups produced prechallenge interferon-gamma, interleukin-12 and interleukin-4. Interestingly, the degree of reduction in parasite load could be predicted by the magnitude of the cytokine responses which correlated inversely with the parasite burden both in liver and spleen. The 31, 51 and 72-kDa bands were identified as ATP synthase alpha chain, beta-tubulin and heat shock 70-related protein 1 precursor of L. major, respectively using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. These three leishmanial antigens have not been described before as successful vaccine candidates examined against in vivo VL model. Thus, these antigens can be potential components of future antileishmaniasis vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2042746313,"CENP-C is a fundamental component of functional centromeres. The elucidation of its structure-function relationship with centromeric DNA and other kinetochore proteins is critical to the understanding of centromere assembly. CENP-C carries two regions, the central and the C-terminal domains, both of which are important for the ability of CENP-C to associate with the centromeric DNA. However, while the central region is largely divergent in CENP-C homologues, the C-terminal moiety contains two regions that are highly conserved from yeast to humans, named Mif2p homology domains (blocks II and III). The activity of these two domains in human CENP-C is not well defined. In this study we performed a functional dissection of C-terminal CENP-C region analyzing the role of single Mif2p homology domains through in vivo and in vitro assays. By immunofluorescence and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) we were able to elucidate the ability of the Mif2p homology domain II to target centromere and contact alpha satellite DNA. We also investigate the interactions with other conserved inner kinetochore proteins by means of coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation on cell nuclei. We found that the C-terminal region of CENP-C (Mif2p homology domain III) displays multiple activities ranging from the ability to form higher order structures like homo-dimers and homo-oligomers, to mediate interaction with CENP-A and histone H3. Overall, our findings support a model in which the Mif2p homology domains of CENP-C, by virtue of their ability to establish multiple contacts with DNA and centromere proteins, play a critical role in the structuring of kinethocore chromatin."

In a self-limiting transcriptional program, ATF4 transiently activates a wide range of downstream target genes involved in transport, cellular metabolism, and other cell functions. Simultaneous activation of other signal transduction pathways by amino acid deprivation led to the question of whether or not the increased abundance of ATF4 alone was sufficient to trigger the transcriptional control mechanisms. Using 293 cells that ectopically express ATF4 in a tetracycline-inducible manner showed that ATF4 target genes were activated in the absence of amino acid deprivation. Ectopic expression of ATF4 alone resulted in effective recruitment of the general transcription machinery, but some reduction in histone modification was observed. These data document that ATF4 alone is sufficient to trigger the amino acid-responsive transcriptional control program. However, the absolute amount of ectopic ATF4 required to achieve the same degree of transcriptional activation observed after amino acid limitation was greater, suggesting that other factors may serve to enhance ATF4 function.

Heme-regulated inhibitor is activated by heme deprivation, oxidative, and heat stresses. PKR (protein kinase RNA-dependent) can be triggered by double-strand RNA binding and is proposed to participate in the cellular anti-viral defense. PERK (RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) is a component of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress. GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) was originally found be activated during amino acid deprivation and can also be induced by UV irradiation and proteasome inhibition (1Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y.

Once phosphorylated by one of those four independent kinases, p-elF2α contributes to a cellular response program to respond to the perturbation or alternatively, to induce apoptosis (1Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). During this response, general protein synthesis declines because the guanine exchange factor eIF2B that catalyzes the formation of active eIF2-GTP from inactive eIF2α-GDP is inhibited by p-eIF2α (5Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, under these conditions translation of some mRNA species is increased, among them is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4).There are two short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the 5′-leader of the ATF4 mRNA (6Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 7Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Under nonstress conditions, after translation of uORF1, sufficient eIF2-GTP makes it possible to reinitiate translation from the uORF2, which is out of frame with ATF4, and therefore ATF4 synthesis is minimized. Conversely, stress-induced p-elF2α leads to limited eIF2-GTP and prolongs the duration for the scanning ribosome to reinitiate following uORF1. Consequently, uORF2 is skipped, and initiation at the ATF4 coding region is increased. Thus, ATF4 protein content is rapidly increased under the many conditions that lead to p-eIF2α production, including the amino acid response (AAR) following protein or amino acid limitation and the UPR following endoplasmic reticulum stress (8Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).As a member of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family, ATF4 can regulate gene transcription by forming a homodimer or heterodimer with other bZIP transcription factors (9Ameri K. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis with mammalian cells has shown that, as with its yeast counterpart GCN4, ATF4 activates a large number of genes that have a wide spectrum of functions (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y.

Several ATF4 target genes have been identified that contain a genomic sequence comprised of a half-site for C/EBP family members and a half-site for ATF members and will be referred to as a C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) (11Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Using the AAR as a model system to activate ATF4 synthesis, Chen et al. (12Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have proposed a self-limiting model that consists of two stages. During the first stage, increased ATF4 synthesis leads to enhanced binding to the CARE composite sites. This binding is associated with localized histone acetylation and subsequent recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery. Among the ATF4 target genes are the transcription factors ATF3 (13Pan Y. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 35106-35117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During the second stage of the ATF4 response, increased expression of ATF3, C/EBPΒ, and CHOP leads to their binding at the CARE site, which causes a subsequent suppression of transcription back toward the basal level. This self-limiting model for ATF4 action, originally reported for asparagine synthetase (ASNS), has been confirmed for several other CARE-containing genes (14Pan Y.X. Chen H. Thiaville M.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Lopez A.B. Wang C. Huang C.C. Yaman I. Li Y. Chakravarty K. Johnson P.F. Chiang C.M. Snider M.D. Wek R.C. Hatzoglou M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Although diverse stresses merge at the phosphorylation of eIF2a and up-regulation of ATF4, upstream signaling cascades triggered by those stresses can be quite varied (1Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In addition, microarray analysis has shown that a significant number of genes up-regulated during the AAR and UPR are ATF4-independent (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar, 10Lee J.I.

Metab. 2008; 26: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and others are GCN2-independent (20Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that ATF4 is a critical component of the AAR and UPR pathways, whether or not an initial stress, such as amino acid limitation, triggers other required pathways or signals that act in concert with ATF4 has not been extensively studied. One example, which has been observed in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, is the requirement of MAPK signaling for an optimal p-eIF2α/ATF4 response (21Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The relative lack of information on this topic leads to the following question: Is increased ATF4 alone sufficient to trigger the AAR transcriptional program, or does amino acid limitation trigger parallel signals that enhance or are required for ATF4 action?In the present studies we took advantage of a cell line, hereafter called ATF4–293, in which ectopic expression of ATF4 can be induced by adding tetracycline (Tet) in the absence of amino acid deprivation (22Ord D. Meerits K. Ord T. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3556-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although endogenous ATF4 expression and the phosphorylation of eIF2a were not affected by Tet treatment, ectopically expressed ATF4 alone was able to induce transcription from several CARE-containing genes. However, analysis revealed that ASNS transcription activity was not entirely proportional to the total abundance of overexpressed ATF4.DISCUSSIONThe present report demonstrates that an elevation of ATF4 protein content alone is sufficient to enhance transcription from a gene containing a CARE enhancer element made up of C/EBP and ATF half-sites. Thus, ATF4-dependent induction of these genes does not require additional signals from the UPR or AAR pathway. The additional novel observations are as follows. 1) Elevation of ATF4 protein content does not cause a “feed forward” response; that is, Tet-induced ATF4 did not increase eIF2α phosphorylation or endogenous ATF4 itself. 2) Ectopically expressed ATF4 translocates to the nucleus in the absence of AAR pathway activation. 3) Ectopically expressed ATF4 causes the recruitment of the general transcription machinery in a manner indistinguishable from that triggered by the AAR. 4) To achieve the same level of transcription activity requires a significantly greater increase in ectopic ATF4 protein compared with that produced after AAR activation. 5) For a similar level of ATF4, induction of ectopic ATF4 did not produce the same level of histone acetylation as did activation of the AAR pathway. This last result suggests that amino acid limitation may trigger one or more events that function to enhance histone modification and may thereby facilitate ATF4 action. However, increasing the ATF4 content further can somehow compensate and generate the same transcription activity.The demonstration that an elevation of ATF4 alone can activate genes containing CARE sequences documents the central nature of ATF4 to the transcriptional program following activation of either the AAR or the UPR pathway. The role of ATF4 as the primary activator is consistent with the high degree of conservation of the ATF half-site (TGATG) within the CARE composite sites that function as amino acid response elements (11Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C/EBP half-site among the CARE-containing genes is quite variable. Although there is evidence that C/EBPΒ may be the ATF4 dimerization partner for the ASNS (27Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Cat-1 genes (18Lopez A.B. Wang C. Huang C.C. Yaman I. Li Y. Chakravarty K. Johnson P.F. Chiang C.M. Snider M.D. Wek R.C. Hatzoglou M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), for most of the CARE-containing genes the identity of the ATF4 dimerization partner has not been definitively proven. It is possible that the binding of different bZIP proteins at the disparate C/EBP half-site results in a gain of specificity for the general ATF4 activation signal. This may also be a component of the mechanism by which a distinct subset of genes is activated by each of four different eIF2α kinases, which all trigger increased de novo ATF4 synthesis. For example, we demonstrated that following UPR activation ATF4 binds to the SNAT2 gene CARE site at a level equal to that observed following AAR activation, and yet there is no increase in SNAT2 transcription by the UPR (28Gjymishka A. Palii S.S. Shan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27736-27747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ATF4 dimerization partner for the SNAT2 CARE under these two conditions has not been established.Although the activation of the GCN2/p-eIF2α/ATF4 signaling cascade following amino acid deprivation is well documented, a few observations have raised the possibility that additional signaling pathways may also be activated by amino acid depletion. 1) It has been reported that amino acid limitation increases certain mRNA species in a GCN2-independent fashion (29Deval C. Chaveroux C. Maurin A.C. Cherasse Y. Parry L. Carraro V. Milenkovic D. Ferrara M. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Fafournoux P. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2) Among the GCN2-independent genes is insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (30Averous J. Maurin A.C. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Arliguie C. Fafournoux P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, it has been reported that rather than a CARE site, the rat insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter contains an upstream stimulatory factor-binding element that is responsible for the amino acid-regulated transcription (31Matsukawa T. Inoue Y. Oishi Y. Kato H. Noguchi T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4643-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3) The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (32López-Fontanals M. Rodríguez-Mulero S. Casado F.J. Dérijard B. Pastor-Anglada M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the MEK-ERK (21Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) arms of the MAPK pathway are increased in response to amino acid limitation. In the case of the MEK-ERK, it was shown in HepG2 hepatoma cells that both eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 synthesis were dependent on a parallel ERK activation by amino acid deprivation. ERK can activate 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) (33Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which in turn has been shown to phosphorylate and enhance ATF4 function in osteoblasts (34Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It is possible that RSK or other MAPK networks may serve to link GCN2-independent upstream signals, triggered by amino acid limitation, with the magnitude and/or the specificity of ATF4 transcriptional activity. This concept is consistent with the present observation that to achieve the same degree of gene activation, the absolute amount of ectopically expressed ATF4 is greater than that needed during amino acid limitation.Elevated ATF4 expression after amino acid deprivation induces de novo synthesis of C/EBPΒ (15Chen C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 35106-35117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and these factors then bind to CARE sequences to suppress activity (11Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 12Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

J. 2007; 401: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the level of C/EBPΒ binding to the ASNS promoter was reduced in the cells ectopically expressing ATF4 alone, the observation that both C/EBPΒ and ATF3 are recruited to the ASNS promoter after Tet induction of ATF4, documents that their synthesis and genomic action does not require factors other than ATF4. Collectively, the results presented in this report demonstrate that ATF4 alone is sufficient to trigger the transcriptional activation and subsequent suppression program that occurs in response to amino acid deprivation of mammalian cells. However, subtle modulation of the ATF4 signal at specific genes cannot be ruled out, and the observed differences in histone modification by endogenous versus ectopic ATF4 expression illustrate that further investigation is required to fully understand the complexity of the mechanisms associated with ATF4 action. Eukaryotic cells have evolved specific ways for coping with various kinds of stresses.

Several ATF4 target genes have been identified that contain a genomic sequence comprised of a half-site for C/EBP family members and a half-site for ATF members and will be referred to as a C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) (11Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Using the AAR as a model system to activate ATF4 synthesis, Chen et al. (12Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have proposed a self-limiting model that consists of two stages. During the first stage, increased ATF4 synthesis leads to enhanced binding to the CARE composite sites. This binding is associated with localized histone acetylation and subsequent recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery. Among the ATF4 target genes are the transcription factors ATF3 (13Pan Y. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 35106-35117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During the second stage of the ATF4 response, increased expression of ATF3, C/EBPΒ, and CHOP leads to their binding at the CARE site, which causes a subsequent suppression of transcription back toward the basal level. This self-limiting model for ATF4 action, originally reported for asparagine synthetase (ASNS), has been confirmed for several other CARE-containing genes (14Pan Y.X. Chen H. Thiaville M.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Lopez A.B. Wang C. Huang C.C. Yaman I. Li Y. Chakravarty K. Johnson P.F. Chiang C.M. Snider M.D. Wek R.C. Hatzoglou M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although diverse stresses merge at the phosphorylation of eIF2a and up-regulation of ATF4, upstream signaling cascades triggered by those stresses can be quite varied (1Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In addition, microarray analysis has shown that a significant number of genes up-regulated during the AAR and UPR are ATF4-independent (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar, 10Lee J.I.

Metab. 2008; 26: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and others are GCN2-independent (20Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that ATF4 is a critical component of the AAR and UPR pathways, whether or not an initial stress, such as amino acid limitation, triggers other required pathways or signals that act in concert with ATF4 has not been extensively studied. One example, which has been observed in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, is the requirement of MAPK signaling for an optimal p-eIF2α/ATF4 response (21Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The relative lack of information on this topic leads to the following question: Is increased ATF4 alone sufficient to trigger the AAR transcriptional program, or does amino acid limitation trigger parallel signals that enhance or are required for ATF4 action? In the present studies we took advantage of a cell line, hereafter called ATF4–293, in which ectopic expression of ATF4 can be induced by adding tetracycline (Tet) in the absence of amino acid deprivation (22Ord D. Meerits K. Ord T. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3556-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although endogenous ATF4 expression and the phosphorylation of eIF2a were not affected by Tet treatment, ectopically expressed ATF4 alone was able to induce transcription from several CARE-containing genes. However, analysis revealed that ASNS transcription activity was not entirely proportional to the total abundance of overexpressed ATF4. DISCUSSIONThe present report demonstrates that an elevation of ATF4 protein content alone is sufficient to enhance transcription from a gene containing a CARE enhancer element made up of C/EBP and ATF half-sites. Thus, ATF4-dependent induction of these genes does not require additional signals from the UPR or AAR pathway. The additional novel observations are as follows. 1) Elevation of ATF4 protein content does not cause a “feed forward” response; that is, Tet-induced ATF4 did not increase eIF2α phosphorylation or endogenous ATF4 itself. 2) Ectopically expressed ATF4 translocates to the nucleus in the absence of AAR pathway activation. 3) Ectopically expressed ATF4 causes the recruitment of the general transcription machinery in a manner indistinguishable from that triggered by the AAR. 4) To achieve the same level of transcription activity requires a significantly greater increase in ectopic ATF4 protein compared with that produced after AAR activation. 5) For a similar level of ATF4, induction of ectopic ATF4 did not produce the same level of histone acetylation as did activation of the AAR pathway. This last result suggests that amino acid limitation may trigger one or more events that function to enhance histone modification and may thereby facilitate ATF4 action. However, increasing the ATF4 content further can somehow compensate and generate the same transcription activity.The demonstration that an elevation of ATF4 alone can activate genes containing CARE sequences documents the central nature of ATF4 to the transcriptional program following activation of either the AAR or the UPR pathway. The role of ATF4 as the primary activator is consistent with the high degree of conservation of the ATF half-site (TGATG) within the CARE composite sites that function as amino acid response elements (11Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C/EBP half-site among the CARE-containing genes is quite variable. Although there is evidence that C/EBPΒ may be the ATF4 dimerization partner for the ASNS (27Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Cat-1 genes (18Lopez A.B. Wang C. Huang C.C. Yaman I. Li Y. Chakravarty K. Johnson P.F. Chiang C.M. Snider M.D. Wek R.C. Hatzoglou M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), for most of the CARE-containing genes the identity of the ATF4 dimerization partner has not been definitively proven. It is possible that the binding of different bZIP proteins at the disparate C/EBP half-site results in a gain of specificity for the general ATF4 activation signal. This may also be a component of the mechanism by which a distinct subset of genes is activated by each of four different eIF2α kinases, which all trigger increased de novo ATF4 synthesis. For example, we demonstrated that following UPR activation ATF4 binds to the SNAT2 gene CARE site at a level equal to that observed following AAR activation, and yet there is no increase in SNAT2 transcription by the UPR (28Gjymishka A. Palii S.S. Shan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27736-27747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ATF4 dimerization partner for the SNAT2 CARE under these two conditions has not been established.Although the activation of the GCN2/p-eIF2α/ATF4 signaling cascade following amino acid deprivation is well documented, a few observations have raised the possibility that additional signaling pathways may also be activated by amino acid depletion. 1) It has been reported that amino acid limitation increases certain mRNA species in a GCN2-independent fashion (29Deval C. Chaveroux C. Maurin A.C. Cherasse Y. Parry L. Carraro V. Milenkovic D. Ferrara M. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Fafournoux P. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2) Among the GCN2-independent genes is insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (30Averous J. Maurin A.C. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Arliguie C. Fafournoux P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, it has been reported that rather than a CARE site, the rat insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter contains an upstream stimulatory factor-binding element that is responsible for the amino acid-regulated transcription (31Matsukawa T. Inoue Y. Oishi Y. Kato H. Noguchi T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4643-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3) The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (32López-Fontanals M. Rodríguez-Mulero S. Casado F.J. Dérijard B. Pastor-Anglada M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the MEK-ERK (21Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) arms of the MAPK pathway are increased in response to amino acid limitation. In the case of the MEK-ERK, it was shown in HepG2 hepatoma cells that both eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 synthesis were dependent on a parallel ERK activation by amino acid deprivation. ERK can activate 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) (33Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which in turn has been shown to phosphorylate and enhance ATF4 function in osteoblasts (34Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It is possible that RSK or other MAPK networks may serve to link GCN2-independent upstream signals, triggered by amino acid limitation, with the magnitude and/or the specificity of ATF4 transcriptional activity. This concept is consistent with the present observation that to achieve the same degree of gene activation, the absolute amount of ectopically expressed ATF4 is greater than that needed during amino acid limitation.Elevated ATF4 expression after amino acid deprivation induces de novo synthesis of C/EBPΒ (15Chen C.

J. 2007; 401: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the level of C/EBPΒ binding to the ASNS promoter was reduced in the cells ectopically expressing ATF4 alone, the observation that both C/EBPΒ and ATF3 are recruited to the ASNS promoter after Tet induction of ATF4, documents that their synthesis and genomic action does not require factors other than ATF4. Collectively, the results presented in this report demonstrate that ATF4 alone is sufficient to trigger the transcriptional activation and subsequent suppression program that occurs in response to amino acid deprivation of mammalian cells. However, subtle modulation of the ATF4 signal at specific genes cannot be ruled out, and the observed differences in histone modification by endogenous versus ectopic ATF4 expression illustrate that further investigation is required to fully understand the complexity of the mechanisms associated with ATF4 action. The present report demonstrates that an elevation of ATF4 protein content alone is sufficient to enhance transcription from a gene containing a CARE enhancer element made up of C/EBP and ATF half-sites. Thus, ATF4-dependent induction of these genes does not require additional signals from the UPR or AAR pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2012598184,"Background Genome level analyses have enhanced our view of phylogenetics in many areas of the tree of life. With the production of whole genome DNA sequences of hundreds of organisms and large-scale EST databases a large number of candidate genes for inclusion into phylogenetic analysis have become available. In this work, we exploit the burgeoning genomic data being generated for plant genomes to address one of the more important plant phylogenetic questions concerning the hierarchical relationships of the several major seed plant lineages (angiosperms, Cycadales, Gingkoales, Gnetales, and Coniferales), which continues to be a work in progress, despite numerous studies using single, few or several genes and morphology datasets. Although most recent studies support the notion that gymnosperms and angiosperms are monophyletic and sister groups, they differ on the topological arrangements within each major group. Methodology We exploited the EST database to construct a supermatrix of DNA sequences (over 1,200 concatenated orthologous gene partitions for 17 taxa) to examine non-flowering seed plant relationships. This analysis employed programs that offer rapid and robust orthology determination of novel, short sequences from plant ESTs based on reference seed plant genomes. Our phylogenetic analysis retrieved an unbiased (with respect to gene choice), well-resolved and highly supported phylogenetic hypothesis that was robust to various outgroup combinations. Conclusions We evaluated character support and the relative contribution of numerous variables (e.g. gene number, missing data, partitioning schemes, taxon sampling and outgroup choice) on tree topology, stability and support metrics. Our results indicate that while missing characters and order of addition of genes to an analysis do not influence branch support, inadequate taxon sampling and limited choice of outgroup(s) can lead to spurious inference of phylogeny when dealing with phylogenomic scale data sets. As expected, support and resolution increases significantly as more informative characters are added, until reaching a threshold, beyond which support metrics stabilize, and the effect of adding conflicting characters is minimized."

Methodology We describe a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding the underlying disease model parameters through to the decision process. The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates. Conclusions Using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak, we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones, in terms of cost and resource efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification."
https://openalex.org/W2068912513,"Plaque disruption with superimposed thrombus is the predominant mechanism responsible for the onset of acute coronary syndromes. Studies have shown that plaque disruption and thrombotic occlusion are frequently separated in time. We established the histopathological characteristics of material aspirated during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a large consecutive ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) population.Thrombus aspiration during primary PCI was performed in 1,362 STEMI patients. Thrombus age was classified as fresh (<1 day), lytic (1-5 days), or organized (>5 day). Further, the presence of plaque was documented. The histopathological findings were related to the clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics. Material could be aspirated in 1,009 patients (74%). Components of plaque were found in 395 of these patients (39%). Fresh thrombus was found in 577 of 959 patients (60%) compared to 382 patients (40%) with lytic or organized thrombi. Distal embolization was present in 21% of patients with lytic thrombus compared to 12% and 15% of patients with fresh or organized thrombus.Material could be obtained in 74% of STEMI patients treated with thrombus aspiration during primary PCI. In 40% of patients thrombus age is older than 24 h, indicating that plaque disruption and thrombus formation occur significantly earlier than the onset of symptoms in many patients."
https://openalex.org/W2071609717,"Background The cellular prion protein (PrPC) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies in which the protein undergoes post-translational conversion to the infectious form (PrPSc). Although endocytosis appears to be required for this conversion, the mechanism of PrPC internalization is still debated, as caveolae/raft- and clathrin-dependent processes have all been reported to be involved. Methodology/Principal Findings We have investigated the mechanism of PrPC endocytosis in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells, which lack caveolin-1 (cav-1) and caveolae, and in FRT/cav-1 cells which form functional caveolae. We show that PrPC internalization requires activated Cdc-42 and is sensitive to cholesterol depletion but not to cav-1 expression suggesting a role for rafts but not for caveolae in PrPC endocytosis. PrPC internalization is also affected by knock down of clathrin and by the expression of dominant negative Eps15 and Dynamin 2 mutants, indicating the involvement of a clathrin-dependent pathway. Notably, PrPC co-immunoprecipitates with clathrin and remains associated with detergent-insoluble microdomains during internalization thus indicating that PrPC can enter the cell via multiple pathways and that rafts and clathrin cooperate in its internalization. Conclusions/Significance These findings are of particular interest if we consider that the internalization route/s undertaken by PrPC can be crucial for the ability of different prion strains to infect and to replicate in different cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2056489977,"Sialidase Neu4 is reported to be dominantly expressed in the mouse brain, but its functional significance is not fully understood. We previously demonstrated that sialidase Neu3, also rich in mouse brain, is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation with involvement in acceleration of neurite formation. To elucidate physiological functions of Neu4, as well as Neu3, we determined expression during mouse brain development by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression was relatively low in the embryonic stage and then rapidly increased at 3-14 days after birth, whereas Neu3 demonstrated high levels in the embryonic stage and down-regulation after birth. Murine Neu4 was found to possess two isoforms differing in expression levels, developmental pattern, and enzymatic character. Distinct from the human isoforms, the murine forms, to a different extent, both catalyzed the removal of sialic acid from gangliosides as well as glycoproteins, and one isoform seemed to act on polysialylated NCAM efficiently, despite the low activity toward ordinary substrates. In situ hybridization demonstrated Neu4 mRNA to be present mainly in the hippocampus in which NCAM is rich and decreases after birth. During retinoic acid-induced differentiation, Neu4 expression was down-regulated in Neuro2a cells. Overexpression of Neu4 resulted in suppression of neurite formation, and its knockdown showed the acceleration. Thin layer chromatography of the glycolipids from Neu4-transfected cells showed ganglioside compositions to be only slightly affected, although lectin blot analysis revealed increased binding to Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) lectin of a approximately 95-kDa glycoprotein, which decreased with cell differentiation. These results suggest that mouse Neu4 plays an important regulatory role in neurite formation, possibly through desialylation of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2133610610,"Background Sulindac is an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that affects prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2. Sulindac has also been of interest for more than decade as a chemopreventive for adenomatous colorectal polyps and colon cancer. Principal Findings Pretreatment of human colon and lung cancer cells with sulindac enhances killing by an oxidizing agent such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or hydrogen peroxide. This effect does not involve cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. However, under the conditions used, there is a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cancer cells and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that cell death is due to apoptosis, which was confirmed by Tunel assay. In contrast, this enhanced killing was not observed with normal lung or colon cells. Significance These results indicate that normal and cancer cells handle oxidative stress in different ways and sulindac can enhance this difference. The combination of sulindac and an oxidizing agent could have therapeutic value."
https://openalex.org/W2011557502,"A previously described wheat germ protein kinase (Yan, T. F., and Tao, M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7037–7043) was identified unambiguously as CK2 using mass spectrometry. CK2 is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein kinase that phosphorylates a wide range of substrates. In previous studies, this wheat germ kinase was shown to phosphorylate eIF2α, eIF3c, and three large subunit (60 S) ribosomal proteins (Browning, K. S., Yan, T. F., Lauer, S. J., Aquino, L. A., Tao, M., and Ravel, J. M. (1985) Plant Physiol. 77, 370–373). To further characterize the role of CK2 in the regulation of translation initiation, Arabidopsis thaliana catalytic (α1 and α2) and regulatory (β1, β2, β3, and β4) subunits of CK2 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant A. thaliana CK2β subunits spontaneously dimerize and assemble into holoenzymes in the presence of either CK2α1 or CK2α2 and exhibit autophosphorylation. The purified CK2 subunits were used to characterize the properties of the individual subunits and their ability to phosphorylate various plant protein substrates. CK2 was shown to phosphorylate eIF2α, eIF2β, eIF3c, eIF4B, eIF5, and histone deacetylase 2B but did not phosphorylate eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, eIFiso4E, or eIFiso4G. Differential phosphorylation was exhibited by CK2 in the presence of various regulatory β-subunits. Analysis of A. thaliana mutants either lacking or overexpressing CK2 subunits showed that the amount of eIF2β protein present in extracts was affected, which suggests that CK2 phosphorylation may play a role in eIF2β stability. These results provide evidence for a potential mechanism through which the expression and/or subcellular distribution of CK2 β-subunits could participate in the regulation of the initiation of translation and other physiological processes in plants.

These results provide evidence for a potential mechanism through which the expression and/or subcellular distribution of CK2 β-subunits could participate in the regulation of the initiation of translation and other physiological processes in plants. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase II) is a ubiquitous and highly conserved serine/threonine kinase found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells (1Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 2Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 3Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 4Olsten M.E. Litchfield D.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Olsten M.E. Weber J.E. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 274: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CK2 is essential for cell viability and is involved in many processes such as cell proliferation, transcriptional and translational control, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (2Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious control mechanism, low co-substrate specificity (both ATP and GTP can be used as phosphate donors), and the acidophilic nature of CK2 separate it biochemically from other protein kinases (1Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic nature of CK2 has garnered it a great deal of attention, as it has been found to phosphorylate over 300 substrates, including 60 transcription factors and over 50 proteins that regulate DNA/RNA structure and/or play a role in RNA synthesis and translation (3Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). For a large majority of these substrates, phosphorylation events have been observed both in vitro and in native proteins (3Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar).CK2 holoenzymes consist of two catalytic α-subunits that assemble with two regulatory β-subunits to form a tetrameric holoenzyme (6Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar, 7Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Sarno S. Pagano M.A. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there is a single β-subunit isoform that forms a homodimer, onto which two catalytic subunits assemble (α/α, α′/α′, or α/α′). Yeast also possess two distinct catalytic subunits (α and α′); however, there are also two distinct isoforms of the yeast regulatory CK2β subunits (8Reed J.C. Bidwai A.P. Glover C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18192-18200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, both the CK2β and CK2β′ subunits are required for formation of the β-β′-dimer (9Kubiński K. Domańska K. Sajnaga E. Mazur E. Zieliński R. Szyszka R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 295: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, there are three potential forms of CK2 holoenzymes in both yeast and mammalian systems. However, plants contain several isoforms for both catalytic and regulatory subunits, creating the potential for a wider variety of CK2 holoenzyme combinations that may have a role in regulating CK2 activity or substrate specificity (10Riera M. Peracchia G. Pagès M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The catalytic activity of the CK2 holoenzyme toward various substrates is generally higher than with the catalytic subunits alone (11Sarno S. Ghisellini P. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22509-22514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, some substrates are only phosphorylated in the presence of the CK2 holoenzyme, whereas others are only phosphorylated by the catalytic α-subunit monomer (12Benaim G. Villalobo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Pinna L.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is not currently known if various isoforms of plant CK2β subunits confer substrate specificity; however, by regulating the levels of specific CK2β subunits plants may be able to fine-tune the phosphorylation of substrates.A systematic study of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome recently identified four genes encoding CK2α subunits and four genes encoding CK2β subunits that exhibit diverse subcellular distribution (14Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Maize shows differential expression of three CK2β subunits during development (10Riera M. Peracchia G. Pagès M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and tobacco CK2 subunits are differentially expressed during the cell cycle (15Espunya M.C. López-Giráldez T. Hernan I. Carballo M. Martínez M.C. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 3183-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to their regulated expression, CK2β subunits appear to be ubiquitinated and degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway (16Zhang C. Vilk G. Canton D.A. Litchfield D.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3754-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of A. thaliana CK2β4 leads to ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway in a manner that is regulated by the circadian clock (17Perales M. Portolés S. Más P. Plant J. 2006; 46: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid data obtained from various maize CK2β subunits predicts that three CK2β isoforms are able to interact in vivo with one another (10Riera M. Peracchia G. Pagès M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and at least some isoforms of recombinant maize CK2β subunits have been shown to form homodimers in vitro (10Riera M. Peracchia G. Pagès M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Riera M. Pages M. Issinger O.G. Guerra B. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if this is the case for all isoforms of the plant β-subunits. Because plants possess multiple isoforms of the CK2 subunits, regulation of CK2 subunit expression/degradation and variations in the subcellular distribution of the CK2 isoforms present a potential mechanism for regulating the substrate specificity of CK2 through the formation of different CK2 holoenzyme complexes. This is the first study to clearly demonstrate the effects of different CK2β subunits on substrate specificity.Of particular interest is the ability of various plant CK2 isoforms to phosphorylate the translational machinery of plants. The fundamental processes of translation initiation are similar in all eukaryotes; however, there are some intriguing differences that exist between plants, mammals, and yeast. Some of the most notable differences that must be considered with plant translation are the apparent absence/ambiguity of key regulators as follows: eIF4E-binding proteins and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (19Browning K.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Gallie D.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 747-774Google Scholar). In most eukaryotic systems, these proteins control global rates of translation by regulating the formation of mRNA cap-binding complexes or eIF2 ternary complexes. However, neither of these mechanisms has been shown to function in plants to date. When one considers that both of these factors are potentially absent or have minor roles in regulation in plants, it becomes obvious some alternative mechanism(s) is likely employed for the regulation of protein synthesis during development and in response to environmental signals (19Browning K.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The extensive complement of CK2 subunits seen in plants presents one potential mechanism for the regulation of the plant translational machinery.A protein kinase isolated from wheat germ was shown to phosphorylate an unknown “target” protein (T-substrate), eIF2α, eIF3c, and three large subunit (60 S) ribosomal proteins (21Yan T.F. Tao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7044-7049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Browning K.S. Yan T.F. Lauer S.J. Aquino L.A. Tao M. Ravel J.M.

Although biochemical characterization of the kinase revealed casein kinase-like properties, the specific identity of the kinase was unknown. Using mass spectrometry, the study presented here unambiguously identifies the previously described protein kinase as CK2 and T-substrate as histone deacetylase 2B (HD2B). 2The abbreviations used are: HD2Bhistone deacetylase 2BMSmass spectrometryDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: HD2Bhistone deacetylase 2BMSmass spectrometryDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. In this work, two of the four CK2α subunits and all four CK2β subunits from A. thaliana were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. All four recombinant A. thaliana CK2β subunits spontaneously dimerized, assembled into holoenzymes with α-subunits, and exhibited autophosphorylation in the presence of catalytic subunits. In addition, we have shown that CK2 not only phosphorylates plant eIF2α and eIF3c, but holoenzyme and monomer forms of recombinant CK2 are capable of differentially phosphorylating plant eIF2β, eIF3c, eIF4B, and eIF5. Evidence was obtained that CK2 may be involved in the protein stability of eIF2β. The results presented here suggest that CK2 may play an important role in regulating translation initiation in plants as well as other cellular processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Wheat Germ Casein Kinase and T-substrateWheat germ kinase was purified from S30 (24Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Mayberry L.K. Browning K.S. Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2006; : 16K.1.1-16K.1.13Google Scholar) using DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) and phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) as described previously (23Yan T.F. Tao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7037-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein, eluted from the phosphocellulose column containing the peak of activity (8 ml containing 9.3 mg of protein), was concentrated to ∼1 ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (Millipore). The sample was then loaded onto a 126-ml Sephacryl S-200 HR column (GE Healthcare). Three fractions containing the peak kinase activity were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal filtration to a final volume of 200 μl. The purified kinase was divided into 25-μl aliquots, quick frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. A 48-kDa protein termed T-substrate, which was previously identified as an endogenous phosphoryl acceptor for the wheat germ kinase, was purified as described previously (21Yan T.F. Tao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7044-7049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Identification by Mass SpectrometryTo identify the protein responsible for kinase activity, 20 μl of the concentrated sample was run on a NuPAGE 12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) using MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Upon staining with Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen), the sample was found to contain five major protein bands. Each of these bands was cut from the gel and destained using 500 μl of deionized water. Each gel slice was dehydrated with 200 μl of acetonitrile (Sigma), reduced with 10 μl of 100 mm DTT for 30 min, and alkylated with 100 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min. The samples were washed with 200 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, before repeating the dehydration process. Trypsin (0.2 μg; Promega) suspended in 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following digestion, 40 μl of 5% formic acid in 100 mm NH4HCO3 was used to extract peptides from each sample. The purified 48-kDa protein band (T-substrate) was prepared for mass spectrometry in a similar manner.Protein identification was performed at the Analytical Instrumentation Facility Core, University of Texas (Dr. Maria Person, Director), using a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) as described previously (26Shen J. Pavone A. Mikulec C. Hensley S.C. Traner A. Chang T.K. Person M.D. Fischer S.M. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, each tryptic digest was dried to <5 μl in a SpeedVac (ThermoSavant), desalted with a Ziptip μ-C18 pipette tip (Millipore), and eluted with 1.5 μl of matrix onto three spots on the MALDI target. The matrix was 0.7 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Calibration Mixture 4700 (Applied Biosciences) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.Spectra were acquired automatically using a 4000 Series Explorer version 3.0 RC1. Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were obtained using 2000 laser shots over a mass range of 700–4000 and calibrated internally on trypsin autolysis peaks. The top 20 MS signals with minimum S/N 20 were selected for tandem MS fragmentation after exclusion of matrix, trypsin, and keratin peaks. GPS Explorer version 3.5 was used to perform additional peak processing and a data base search. Additional searches were performed with MASCOT version 2.0. Samples were searched against Swiss-Prot, Trembl, and EST other data bases.Cloning and Expression of A. thaliana CK2 SubunitsFor bacterial expression, appropriate primers were designed (see supplemental material) for cloning into pET23d (Novagen), such that each subunit could be expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag. Approximately 500 mg of A. thaliana flowers were ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 4 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA isolation was performed as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was made from total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 25-μl reverse transcription-PCR using ∼5 μg of RNA, 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), dNTPs (0.5 mm each), 10 mm DTT, and 20 μg/ml oligo(dT). Full-length A. thaliana CK2 subunit cDNAs were amplified in a thermal cycler as follows: 10 min at 95 °C; 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 55 °C; 1.5 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Each 50-μl reaction contained 2.5 units of FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend (Roche Applied Science), 5 μl of FastStart Reaction Buffer, 200 μm dNTP mix, 100 ng of first strand cDNA, and 10 pmol of each forward and reverse primer. PCR products from CK2 subunits α1 (At5g67380), α2 (At3g50000), β1 (At5g47080), β2 (At4g17640), β3 (At3g60250), and β4 (At2g44680) were cloned into pET23d(+) vector using NcoI/XhoI restriction sites. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA Core Facility, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas).Each CK2-pET23d subunit construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells for expression. Overnight cultures (50 ml of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) started from a single colony were used to inoculate two times 1 liter of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Invitrogen) and grown to an A600 of 0.5 at 37 °C. Expression of protein was induced with the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. Following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside induction, cells were grown for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Each E. coli cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of Buffer C (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 600 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole) containing 1 Complete protease inhibitor tablet (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The cells were disrupted by sonication three times for 30 s at 70% power and two times for 30 s at 90% power using a Vibra Cell sonicator (Sonics & Materials Inc.). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 184,048 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.Purification of His6-tagged ProteinsPurification of His6-tagged proteins was similar to previously described methods with the following modifications (27Mayberry L.K. Dennis M.D. Leah Allen M. Ruud Nitka K. Murphy P.A. Campbell L. Browning K.S. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 430: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). His6-tagged proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA with Buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 250 mm imidazole) containing 300 mm KCl for CK2α or 100 mm KCl for CK2β subunits. Fractions containing the highest amount of protein were immediately applied to a 1-ml phosphocellulose column (Whatman P11) equilibrated in either Buffer B-300 or Buffer B-100 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and KCl as indicated, where Buffer B-100 is Buffer B containing 100 mm KCl) for CK2α and CK2β subunits, respectively. CK2α subunits were then eluted with a 10× gradient (10 ml) of Buffer B containing 0.3–1 m KCl. CK2β subunits were eluted with a 10× gradient (10 ml) of Buffer B containing 0.1–0.5 m KCl. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing the highest purity and concentration of protein were pooled. CK2α fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in Buffer B-100. CK2β subunits were not dialyzed as this resulted in a significant loss of protein, presumably by binding of the protein to the dialysis tubing.Reconstitution of CK2 Holoenzymes in VitroCK2 subunits or holoenzymes (300 μg) were applied to an FPLC HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (126 ml bed volume; GE Healthcare) or FPLC HiLoad 16/60 Superdex S200 column (126 ml bed volume; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer B-180, and the elution was monitored by A280 for 120 ml. To analyze holoenzyme formation using gel filtration, CK2α and CK2β subunits were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio (∼164 μg of CK2α and ∼135 μg of CK2β), and the KCl concentration was adjusted to 180 mm using Buffer B and incubated on ice for 1 h prior to application to the column.To analyze the phosphorylation of initiation factors by CK2 holoenzymes, eight holoenzyme complexes were formed (CK2α1β1, CK2α1β2, CK2α1β3, CK2α1β4, CK2α2β1, CK2α2β2, CK2α2β3, and CK2α2β4). For each reaction, 50 pmol of either CK2α1 or CK2α2 was combined with 50 pmol of CK2β1, -β2, -β3, or -β4 in Buffer B-50 and incubated on ice for 1 h. To verify complex formation, 25 μl of each reaction was run on a 4–20% Tris-glycine nondenaturing gel (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Each of these holoenzyme preparations was used to evaluate the activity toward various substrates. Similar holoenzyme formation was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (∼100 cpm/pmol) to evaluate the autophosphorylation of CK2β subunits. CK2 holoenzyme combinations were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with a SilverSNAP kit (Pierce), dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare) overnight, and images analyzed using Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad).Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CK2 SubstratesTo obtain nonphosphorylated substrates, plant initiation factors and HD2B (T-substrate) were cloned and expressed in E. coli as described below for each factor. The coding region for each target was amplified, cloned into a pET vector (Novagen) for bacterial expression, and purified using either phosphocellulose or a Ni-NTA matrix. Constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA Core Facility, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas). Sequences of primers used are shown in the supplemental material.eIF2Wheat eIF2α was previously cloned into pET30a(+) for bacterial expression (28Chang L.Y. Yang W.Y. Browning K. Roth D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The eIF2α coding region was amplified from this construct and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET15b(+). This new His-eIF2α construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and expressed and purified as described above for CK2β subunits. A. thaliana His-eIF2α (At5g05470) was amplified from A. thaliana cDNA and cloned into pET23d(+) for expression with a C-terminal His6 tag. This construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli, and A. thaliana His-eIF2α was expressed and purified as described previously for wheat His-eIF2α. Wheat eIF2β was prepared as described previously (29Metz A.M. Browning K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recombinant A. thaliana wild-type eIF2β (At5g20920) was amplified from expressed sequence tag TO4524 and cloned into pET23a(+) using NcoI/SalI restriction sites. This construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli expression cells and purified as described previously for wheat eIF2β (29Metz A.M. Browning K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).eIF3cThe cDNA for wheat eIF3c was amplified from expressed sequence tag BJ257961 and cloned into pET23d (+). This construct adds a C-terminal His6 tag when using the NcoI/XhoI site. The plasmid was transformed into Arctic Express DE3(RIL) E. coli cells (Stratagene) and expressed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested, and His-eIF3c was purified as described previously for CK2β subunits.eIF4BThe cloning, expression, and purification of wheat eIF4B has been described previously (27Mayberry L.K.

The coding region of A. thaliana eIF5 (At1g77840) was amplified from cDNA and cloned into pET15b(+) using NcoI/BamHI restriction sites. This construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and expressed as described previously for wheat eIF5. The cell extract was diluted with Buffer B to 150 mm KCl and loaded onto a 2-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated in Buffer B-150. Recombinant A. thaliana eIF5 was eluted from the column using a 5× gradient (10 ml) from 150 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer B, and 10 μl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to evaluate the purity of the eluted eIF5. Peak eIF5 fractions were pooled and dialyzed in Buffer B-80. The sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml High Trap Q FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer B-80. The protein was eluted with a 10× gradient (10 ml) of 80–350 mm KCl in Buffer B, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to evaluate the purity. Fractions were stored at −80 °C.T-substrate/HD2BPrimers were designed for cloning A. thaliana HD2B cDNA (At5g22650) into the pET23d(+) expression vector with a C-terminal His6 tag using NcoI/XhoI restriction sites as described above. The His-HD2B construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and expressed and purified as described above for CK2β subunits.Phosphorylation of CK2 SubstratesFor translation initiation factor phosphorylation, a kinase assay was conducted using 10–50 pmol of purified translation initiation factor as substrate. Generally, 20 μl-incubation mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm DTT, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼100–250 cpm/pmol), 100–150 mm KCl, and ∼1 pmol of CK2. Incubation was at 30 °C for 20 min or as indicated. Each reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× SDS loading dye (2.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences).To compare the activity of the various forms of recombinant CK2, ∼1 μg of each substrate was incubated with 0.5 pmol of CK2α (monomer) or 0.25 pmol of holoenzyme (tetramer) at 25 °C for 15 min. Each reaction was treated as described previously and visualized by phosphorimaging. Quantitative densitometry was performed using Quantity One (Bio-Rad), and results were expressed as counts/mm2. Each reaction was performed in triplicate for the 10 recombinant CK2 kinase forms (CK2α1 only, CK2α2 only, CK2α1β1, CK2α1β2, CK2α1β3, CK2α1β4, CK2α2β1, CK2α2β2, CK2α2β3, and CK2α2β4).To quantify the number of phosphorylation sites present in each substrate, the phosphorylation reaction (50 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm DTT, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼100 cpm/pmol), and 100 mm KCl, 10 μg of substrate, 5 pmol of recombinant CK2α1, and an additional 5 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5, 15, or 30 min, stopped by the addition of 1 ml of HMK buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl), and immediately passed through a nitrocellulose filter (Microfiltration Systems, 0.45 μm) that had been pre-soaked in 1 mm KPO4, pH 6.8. Each filter was washed with ∼2 ml of cold HMK buffer, dried, and analyzed using a scintillation counter. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Each value was corrected for the amount of [γ-32P]ATP retained by the filter in the absence of substrate. CK2β appears to be a requisite for phosphorylation of eIF2β; therefore, the CK2α1β4 holoenzyme was used in pl"

To investigate the function of RDH12 within the network of retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (RDHs) present in retina, we studied the retinal phenotype of Rdh12-deficient mice. In vivo rates of all-trans-retinal reduction and 11-cis-retinal formation during recovery from bleaching were similar in Rdh12-deficient and wild-type mice matched for an Rpe65 polymorphism that impacts visual cycle efficiency. However, retinal homogenates from Rdh12-deficient mice exhibited markedly decreased capacity to reduce exogenous retinaldehydes in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo levels of the bisretinoid compound diretinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A2E) were increased in Rdh12-deficient mice of various genetic backgrounds. Conversely, in vivo levels of retinoic acid and total retinol were significantly decreased. Rdh12 transcript levels in wild-type mice homozygous for the Rpe65-Leu450 polymorphism were greater than in Rpe65-Met450 mice and increased during postnatal development in wild-type mice and Nrl-deficient mice having an all-cone retina. Rdh12-deficient mice did not exhibit increased retinal degeneration relative to wild-type mice at advanced ages, when bred on the light-sensitive BALB/c background, or when heterozygous for a null allele of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2+/−). Our findings suggest that a critical function of RDH12 is the reduction of all-trans-retinal that exceeds the reductive capacity of the photoreceptor outer segments.

Analyses of retinal organization and visual function in patients with mutations in RDH12 or RPE65, another Leber congenital amaurosis gene involved in retinoid metabolism, show distinctly different pathologies associated with defects in each gene that will be important to consider when developing targeted forms of therapy (6Jacobson S.G.

On the basis of in vitro assays showing reactivity toward retinaldehyde substrates and expression in photoreceptor cells, RDH12 was initially proposed to function in the reduction of all-trans-retinal released by bleached visual pigments (10Haeseleer F.

Subsequent in vitro studies showed that RDH12 can also act upon C9 aldehydes resulting from lipid photo-oxidation (11Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y.

In previous studies, we generated Rdh12-deficient mice and evaluated their retinal phenotype, finding grossly normal retinal histology, visual responses, retinoid content, and assays of oxidative stress (15Kurth I.

We also showed that RDH12 localizes to photoreceptor inner segments in humans and mice, distant from the phototransduction reactions occurring in the outer segment disc membranes. Based on this analysis, we concluded that RDH12 deficiency does not limit chromophore synthesis or visual cycle throughput, in agreement with Maeda et al. (16Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Sun W.

Similarly, earlier attempts to identify an RDH isoform essential for chromophore synthesis failed.

In each case, loss-of-function resulted in only minor slowing of dark adaptation without accompanying retinal degeneration, thus raising the possibility of redundancy in RDH function relative to the visual cycle mechanism. We now report that the retinas of Rdh12-deficient mice exhibit a markedly decreased capacity to reduce retinaldehyde substrates in vitro but do not show decreased synthesis of 11-cis-retinal in vivo or age-related degeneration on various genetic backgrounds. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which RDH12 contributes to the reduction all-trans-retinal that escapes conversion to all-trans-retinol by enzyme(s) present in the outer segments. Although fundamental differences exist between species, our findings in mice point to an important role of RDH12 in retinoid metabolism occurring in photoreceptor cells, and of likely relevance to disease pathology in the human retina, but which does not limit chromophore synthesis in vivo. Transgenic mice of the following genotypes were used for our studies: Rdh12−/− mice homozygous for a Rpe65-Leu450 (L/L) or Rpe65-Met450 (M/M) polymorphism on a mixed Sv129;C57BL/6 (pigmented) background (15Kurth I.

Primary antibodies used were: a rabbit anti-Rdh12 polyclonal antibody specific for the mouse protein (against 252SPFFKSTSQGAQ263) (15Kurth I. Thompson D.A. Rüther K. Feathers K.L. Chrispell J.D.

In brief, dark-adapted mice (∼3 months old) were subjected to bleaching light (5000 lux, 15 min), recovered in the dark for 0–60 min, and euthanized. Under dim red light, whole eyes were homogenized in chloroform:methanol:hydroxylamine, the organic phases were collected, and the solvent evaporated. The extracts were dissolved in hexane and chromatographed on a Supelcosil LC-31 analytical column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) developed with 95% hexane, 5% 1,4-dioxane. Absorbance peaks were identified by comparison with external standards, and molar quantities per eye were calculated by comparison with standard concentrations determined spectrophotometrically using published extinction coefficients (22Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and normalizing to total sample volumes. Retinaldehyde content was calculated as the sum of syn- and anti-retinal oximes. Data were analyzed and curves fitted using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.). Standards used were: all-trans-retinol (SigmaAldrich), 11-cis-retinol obtained by NaBH4 reduction of 11-cis-retinal (R.

In brief, posterior segments from 3–6 mouse eyes (from animals ∼3–6 months old) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and extracted with chloroform:methanol. After passage through a reverse-phase cartridge (C8 Sep-Pak, Millipore) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol and evaporation of solvent, the extracts were dissolved in 50% methanolic chloroform containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and chromatographed on Atlantis® dC18 (3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) and Delta Pak® C4 (5 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm) columns (Waters Corp.) using gradients of water and aceotnitrile with 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid. Molar quantity per eye was determined from peak areas using calibration curves constructed from known concentrations of synthesized standards and by normalizing to the total sample volume (26Sakai N.

HPLC analysis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry or UV analysis was used to quantitate retinoic acid and total retinol levels, respectively, present in the retinas of dark-adapted mice (∼5 months old) according to methods described previously (29Kane M.A. Folias A.E. Wang C. Napoli J.L. Anal Chem. 2008; 80: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Kane M.A. Folias A.E. Napoli J.L. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 378: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, retinas were homogenized in 0.9% NaCl, and 4,4-dimethyl-retinoic acid and retinyl acetate in acetonitrile were added as internal standards followed by the addition of ethanolic KOH. The samples were extracted with hexane, and the organic phase, containing nonpolar retinoids, was collected. The aqueous phase was acidified by the addition of HCl, and polar retinoids were extracted in hexane. After evaporation of the organic phases, the extracts were resuspended in acetonitrile. Total retinol content was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Zorbax SB-C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) developed with gradients of water, acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid with quantification by analysis of UV absorbance at 325 nm and comparison to standards. For retinoic acid analysis, extracts were subjected to HPLC on an Ascentis RP-Amide column (Supelco, 2.1 × 150 mm, 3 μm) using gradients of water, acetonitrile, 0.1% of formic acid; tandem mass spectrometry data were acquired with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization operated in positive ion mode. All retinoid standards except 4,4-dimethyl-retinoic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, with concentrations verified spectrophotometrically using published extinction coefficients (31Barua A.B. Furr H.C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mouse retina homogenates were assayed for retinal reductase activity with exogenous substrates. Light-adapted mice (∼2–5 months old) were euthanized, and dissected retinas from 4–8 animals were pooled and homogenized in 300 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells, and then the supernates were sonicated with a microtip probe (30 times for 1 s) on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the Lowry procedure (32Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7142) Google Scholar), and levels of Rdh12 and arrestin (a marker for total photoreceptor proteins) were evaluated by densitometric analysis of Western blots. Assay reactions (200 μl) were prepared that contained 20 μg of retinal protein, 200 μm all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal, and 200 μm NADPH in HEPES buffer (pH 8); reactions were incubated for 0–60 min at 32 °C (a reaction temperature that minimizes thermal isomerization of the retinoid substrates, as well as enzyme inactivation). All-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinol formation were quantitated using normal-phase HPLC analysis with comparison to standards, as described above, and the data were analyzed using SigmaPlot. Controls for recovery included samples containing known amounts of standard compounds as described previously (3Thompson D.A. Janecke A.R. Lange J. Feathers K.L. Hübner C.A. McHenry C.L.

Anesthetized mice (∼3 months old) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, the eyes were enucleated and post-fixed (total fixation time ≤ 15 min) and rinsed in phosphate buffer, and the anterior segments and lenses were removed. The posterior eyecups were transitioned through a sucrose series and flash-frozen in sucrose-OCT. Cryosections (18 μm) were permeabilized with 0.125% Triton X-100 in PBS, treated with biotin blocking reagents (Invitrogen), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum, and 0.125% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated over night at 4 °C with primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 0.125% Triton X-100 in PBS and washed. Sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400; Molecular Probes) for 3 h, washed, and incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor-488 or -555 (Molecular Probes, 1:500). Sections were washed, mounted in ProLong Gold containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) to stain nuclei, and imaged using an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope with FluoView FV500 data acquisition software. Anesthetized mice were perfused, and the eyes were enucleated, post-fixed for at least 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde or 2% paraformaldehyde plus 2% glutaraldehyde, and embedded in JB-4 plastic. Sections (5 μm) were stained with Lee’s stain and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with Nikon DMX1200 digital camera using the manufacturer’s data acquisition software. Measurements of retinal outer nuclear layer thickness on sections parallel to the vertical meridian of the eye were plotted versus distance from the optic nerve head for animals of various ages (33LaVail M.M.

Total RNA was isolated from mouse retinas (∼2–3 months old) using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and quality and quantity were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. First strand cDNAs were generated using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). Sequences present in the 3′-untranslated regions of transcripts of interest were amplified using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) with a Rotor-Gene3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 25 s, 57 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with steps 2–4 repeated 35 times. Samples in triplicate were each amplified in triplicate and normalized to the values for Hprt transcripts. Primers (sense, antisense) were as follows: Rdh12, 5′-GGCCAATCTGCTCTTCACTC-3′, 5′-ACTTTCCACTCAGGGGCTCTA-3′; Rdh11, 5′-CCACAGCAAACTAGCCAACA-3′, 5′-CCAACTGGCAATCACTGAAA-3; Rdh8, 5′-GATGTGGCCCAGGTCATT-3′, 5′-GACCAAGGTTGAGGAGGTGA-3′; Hprt, 5′-GCAAGCTTGCTGGTGAAAGGA-3′, 5′-CCTGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGGG-3′. Total retinal RNA from Rdh12−/− and wild-type mice (∼2 months old) was isolated as described above and converted into biotinylated, fragmented, and cleaned cRNA using Affymetrix reagents. Mouse genome arrays (Affymetrix 430_2.0) were hybridized with fragmented cRNA and processed as described (34Yoshida S. Mears A.J. Friedman J.S. Carter T. He S. Oh E. Jing Y. Farjo R. Fleury G. Barlow C. Hero A.O. Swaroop A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1487-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The arrays were optically read with a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner, and CHP/.CEL files were generated using the Affymetrix microarray suite of programs. The quality of the GeneChip hybridizations was excellent according to Affymetrix criteria. Normalization and calculation of signal intensities were performed using the Robust Multi-Chip Average software package (R-Project). Ratios of average signal intensity (log 2) were calculated for probe sets between pairs of genotypes and converted to average -fold change. Statistical validation was performed as described previously (34Yoshida S. Mears A.J. Friedman J.S. Carter T. He S. Oh E. Jing Y. Farjo R. Fleury G. Barlow C. Hero A.O. Swaroop A. Hum. Mol.

Affymetrix GeneChip data for flow-sorted GFP+ photoreceptor cells from wild-type and Nrl−/− mice at various developmental ages were generated as described previously (37Akimoto M. Cheng H. Zhu D.

The first step in the recycling aspect of the visual cycle is the conversion of all-trans-retinal, released from bleached visual pigments, to all-trans-retinol, which is returned to the RPE. In studies employing retinoid extraction and HPLC analysis, we showed previously that steady-state levels of visual cycle retinoids were similar in the eyes of Rdh12-deficient and wild-type mice heterozygous for the Rpe65-L450M (L/M) polymorphism that impacts rates of chromophore synthesis (15Kurth I. Thompson D.A. Rüther K. Feathers K.L. Chrispell J.D. Schroth J. McHenry C.L. Schweizer M. Skosyrski S. Gal A. Hübner C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have now used these methods to evaluate retinoid processing during dark adaptation in Rdh12-deficient mice homozygous for the Rpe65-Leu450 (L/L) variant associated with high visual cycle throughput (38Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During recovery in the dark after full bleaching, our results show that rates of all-trans-retinal reduction and 11-cis-retinal formation are not significantly different between Rdh12−/− and wild-type animals (Fig. 1). To determine the contribution of Rdh12 to the overall capacity of the mouse retina to reduce retinaldehyde substrates, we performed in vitro assays of retinal homogenates with exogenous all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal as substrate. Retinas from Rdh12−/− and wild-type mice on three different genetic backgrounds were evaluated: Rpe65-L/L or Rpe65-M/M on 129Sv:C57BL/6 (pigmented) and Rpe65-L/L on BALB/c (albino). For wild-type pigmented and albino mice that were Rpe65-L/L, we found that robust retinal reductase activity was present in assays with saturating levels of all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 2, A and C). Initial rates of all-trans-retinol formation were 0.51 and 0.62 pmol min−1 μg protein−1 in the pigmented and albino mice, respectively. Similarly, initial rates of 11-cis-retinol formation were 0.70 and 0.60 pmol min−1 μg protein−1. For Rdh12−/− mice, significantly lower retinal reductase activity was observed with both substrates (Fig. 2, A and C). Initial rates of all-trans-retinol formation were 0.052 and 0.057 pmol min−1 μg protein−1 in pigmented and albino mice, respectively, whereas 11-cis-retinol formation was undetectable. Mice on the Rpe65-M/M background exhibited lower RDH activity than Rpe65-L/L mice; however, the relative decrease in RDH activity seen in Rdh12−/− mice was similar (Fig. 2, B and D). In vitro assays of retina homogenates from Rdh11−/− mice exhibited retinoid reductase activity that was significantly greater than of Rdh12−/− mice on the same genetic background (pigmented Rpe65-L/L) (Fig. 3). At saturating substrate concentrations, initial rates of all-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinol formation in Rdh11−/− retinal homogenates were 0.57 and 0.99 pmol min−1 μg protein−1, respectively. The removal of all-trans-retinal from the photoreceptor outer segments requires its conversion to all-trans-retinol, with inefficient removal resulting in increased accumulation of A2E and other lipofuscin pigments in the RPE (39Sparrow J.R. Boulton M. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Rdh12 deficiency on lipofuscin accumulation, HPLC analysis of A2E and A2E isomers present in posterior eyecups was performed for pigmented and albino mice on the Rpe65-L/L background (Fig. 4). The data show that A2E levels (the sum of A2E and isomers) increased with age in both Rdh12−/− and wild-type animals at ∼3, 5, and 6 months of age. In addition, Rdh12−/− mice exhibited significantly increased A2E levels relative to wild-type at each age. Levels of A2E were also increased in Rdh12−/− mice on the Rpe65-M/M background (assayed at 5 months old), although levels were less than in Rpe65-L/L animals, as observed previously in studies of wild-type mice (24Kim S.R. Fishkin N. Kong J. Nakanishi K. Allikmets R. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11668-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of eyecups from pigmented Rdh11−/− mice showed only slightly elevated A2E levels. Rdh12−/− mice also exhibited similar increases in levels of atRAL dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine, another aldehyde derivative component of RPE lipofuscin (data not shown). Retinoic acid synthesis involves the oxidation of retinaldehydes in a reaction typically catalyzed by members of the family of aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 41Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rdh12 deficiency affects retinoic acid synthesis in the retina, directly or indirectly,"

Both hyperactivity and overexpression of these proteins have been observed in human cancers and have been implicated as important factors in metastasis. We previously showed that dietary n-6 fatty acids increase cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, such as type IV collagen. Here we report that in MDA-MB-435 human melanoma cells, arachidonic acid activates RhoA, and inhibition of RhoA signaling with either C3 exoenzyme or dominant negative Rho blocked arachidonic acid-induced cell adhesion. Inhibition of the Rho kinase (ROCK) with either small molecule inhibitors or ROCK II-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked the fatty acid-induced adhesion. However, unlike other systems, inhibition of ROCK did not block the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); instead, Rho activation depended on p38 MAPK activity and the presence of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which is phosphorylated downstream of p38 after arachidonic acid treatment. HSP27 associated with p115RhoGEF in fatty acid-treated cells, and this association was blocked when p38 was inhibited. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of HSP27 blocked the fatty acid-stimulated Rho activity. Expression of dominant negative p115-RhoGEF or p115RhoGEF-specific siRNA inhibited both RhoA activation and adhesion on type IV collagen, whereas a constitutively active p115RhoGEF restored the arachidonic acid stimulation in cells in which the p38 MAPK had been inhibited. These data suggest that n-6 dietary fatty acids stimulate a set of interactions that regulates cell adhesion through RhoA and ROCK II via a p38 MAPK-dependent association of HSP27 and p115RhoGEF.

The ability of tumor cells to metastasize to secondary sites is a hallmark of neoplastic disease. Unfortunately, this propensity to spread is the primary cause of morbidity and death in cancer patients (1Fidler I.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Metastasis is clearly a highly regulated, multistep process that occurs in a spatiotemporal manner (2Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2651-2660PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sugarbaker E.V. Curr. Probl.

To escape the restrictive compartment boundaries characteristic of adult tissue, separate intravasation and extravasation steps requiring alterations in co-adhesion, adhesion, invasion, and migration must occur. Execution of these biological processes, involving multiple proteins and cellular organelles, require highly coordinated cell signaling mechanisms. The Rho family of small GTPases regulates many facets of cytoskeletal rearrangements that facilitate cell attachment and migration (5Burridge K. Wennerberg K.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have been extensively studied for their ability to recapitulate the metastatic cascade in vivo and in vitro, although recent work indicates that the cells currently in use are most likely a human melanoma line (38Rae J.M.

Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous AA led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 and the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) via a p38 MAPK-dependent process (39Paine E.

When appropriate, the cells were treated with inhibitors H-1152 and Y27632 for 15 and 30 min, respectively. When C3 exoenzyme was used, cells were incubated with the inhibitor overnight before harvesting the cells. Arachidonic acid (30 μm) or vehicle (ethanol/KOH) was added to the cell suspension, and aliquots of the cells were added to a 96-well tissue culture plate previously coated with collagen type IV, poly-d-lysine, or bovine serum albumin. The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The adherent cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and solubilized. The absorbance of the wells at 595 nm was measured, and collagen IV adhesion was calculated as a percentage of absorbance in poly-d-lysine-coated wells after the bovine serum albumin background was subtracted. Cells were harvested, washed, and allowed to recover in serum-free medium for 30 min. After treatment with 30 μm arachidonic acid, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were clarified and incubated on a rocker for 1 h at 4 °C with the GST fusion protein containing the Rho binding domain of ROCK bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in LDS NuPage® sample buffer (Invitrogen), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies, as described (42Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. Treat. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Coverslips from Carolina Biological Supply Co. (Burlington, NC) were coated overnight with type IV collagen at a concentration of 6.4 μg/ml. Slides were blocked with 2% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin for 2 h and washed with serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium. Cells were transfected for 24 h with Rho and p115RhoGEF constructs using FuGENE 6. Cells were harvested, washed, allowed to recover in serum-free media for 30 min, and treated with 30 μm arachidonic acid. Cells were placed on the collagen-coated coverslips at 2 × 105 cells per coverslip. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and incubated for 45 min in 4% donkey serum in 0.1% gelatin blocking solution at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-HA or anti-V5 antibody (diluted 1:200). The slides were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:2000) and Alexa Fluor®594-labeled phalloidin (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. The slides were washed with PBS and mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with a Zeiss Pascal scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using a 100 × 1.4 NA oil Plan Neofluor Apochromat objective lens. Cells were harvested as described for the G protein pulldown assays, exposed to vehicle or arachidonic acid for 5 min, and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The cell lysates were precleared with rabbit IgG-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with a rabbit anti-HSP27 antibody overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The antibody complexes were pulled down using protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h, and the precipitates were washed 4 times with lysis buffer. The samples were denatured and immunoblotted as described for the small G protein pulldown assays. Previously we showed that arachidonic acid increases adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to type IV collagen (37Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). This increased adhesion is accompanied by a variety of cytoskeletal rearrangements typical of increased adhesion and cell motility. 3M. D. George, K. Olden, and J. D. Roberts, unpublished observation. These observations are similar to those seen in other cell types (e.g. Refs. 22Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M.

As these structural and functional changes are frequently dependent on altered activity of Rho family small GTPases, we examined human tumor cells exposed to fatty acids for changes in the activity of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. Rho activity in MDA-MB-435 cells significantly increased after arachidonic acid treatment, whereas total levels of Rho expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1, A and B). Several laboratories have shown that MDA-MB-435 cells exhibit significant levels of Rac activity (44Mira J.P. Benard V. Groffen J. Sanders L.C. Knaus U.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 45Baugher P.J. Krishnamoorthy L. Price J.E. Dharmawardhane S.F. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R965-R974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We confirmed this result and observed a slight decrease in Rac activity upon arachidonic acid treatment (supplemental Fig. S1A). Untreated MDA-MB-435 cells did not exhibit detectable levels of Cdc42 activity with or without arachidonic acid treatment (supplemental Fig. S1B). Three Rho isoforms, RhoA, -B, and -C, have been shown to function in cell motility and adhesion (46Wheeler A.P. Ridley A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We investigated changes in these isoforms by means of Rho-GTP pulldown assays followed by immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). Cells treated with arachidonic acid showed a significant increase in RhoA activity but not in RhoB or RhoC. A similar activation of RhoA by arachidonic acid occurred in the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line (supplemental Fig. S2). Given the well described role of Rho in cell adhesion, we hypothesized that Rho activation is required for arachidonic acid-induced adhesion to type IV collagen. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with cell-permeable C3 exoenzyme to block Rho signaling and measured arachidonic acid-induced cell adhesion to type IV collagen. C3 exoenzyme reduced arachidonic acid-induced adhesion to a level similar to that of untreated cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm these inhibitor results, cells were transfected with wild-type, constitutively active, or dominant negative RhoA-containing vectors and assayed for arachidonic acid-induced adhesion. Expression of a dominant negative RhoA completely blocked arachidonic acid-induced adhesion, whereas cells expressing wild-type RhoA showed a typical increase in adhesion to type IV collagen (Fig. 2B). Expression of a constitutively active RhoA also permitted arachidonic acid-induced adhesion (Fig. 2C) but did not increase the basal level of adhesion, indicating that active RhoA alone is not sufficient to enhance cell adhesion. This is consistent with our previous results showing that both MAPK and protein kinase C-dependent pathways must be activated, apparently independently, for induced cell adhesion by fatty acids (39Paine E.

Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452PubMed Google Scholar). In cells treated with arachidonic acid, MDA-MB-435 cells show an increase in focal adhesions and an altered morphology (supplemental Fig. S3, A–F). Arachidonic acid-treated cells exhibited short cortical actin stress fibers accompanied by actin arcs (supplemental Fig. S3, D–F), a type of actin cytoskeleton structure previously shown to correspond with Rho activity (19Dubash A.D. Wennerberg K. García-Mata R. Menold M.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3989-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell morphology and actin structure were similar in both non-transfected and HA-tagged wild-type RhoA-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S3, G–L). Additionally, a subset of HA-tagged RhoA was localized at the membrane, associated with cortical actin stress fibers and the tips of filapodial-like structures. Expression of dominant negative RhoA blocked the morphological and structural changes in response to fatty acid (supplemental Fig. S3, M–R). Rho GTPases frequently regulate cellular processes through downstream signals transduced by the Rho kinase, ROCK (47Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether adhesion of cells to type IV collagen induced by arachidonic acid depended on ROCK activity. We used both a pharmacological inhibitor as well as a genetic approach to block ROCK. Two ROCK inhibitors blocked arachidonic acid-induced adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, A and B). There are two ROCK isoforms, ROCK I and II. We investigated which isoforms were expressed in the MDA-MB-435 cells and found that ROCK II is the main isoform in these cells (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). Additionally, arachidonic acid-induced adhesion was blocked in cells transiently expressing two different short hairpin RNAs specifically targeting ROCK II (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that arachidonic acid-induced adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to type IV collagen requires both Rho activation and ROCK II signaling. Several proteins have been implicated as effectors of ROCK signaling, including myosin light chain (50Fukata Y. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 32-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), cofilin (51Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K.

Leung S.P. Masoudi H. Leung S. Wiseman S.M. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8210-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We examined each of these in MDA-MB-435 cells and did not identify any ROCK-dependent changes in phosphorylation after treatment with arachidonic acid (data not shown), indicating that although Rho/ROCK is critical for the fatty acid-induced adhesion, the signaling apparently functions through other downstream effectors. A number of studies have shown that the activation of Rho isoforms can lead to signaling through the MAPK pathways. We have shown that arachidonic acid induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and that its activity is required for adhesion to type IV collagen (39Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we asked if p38 MAPK functions upstream or downstream of Rho signaling after arachidonic acid exposure in these cells. Pharmacological inhibition (Y27632) of ROCK had no effect on arachidonic acid-induced phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, a p38 inhibitor, PD169316, blocked activation of RhoA in arachidonic acid-treated cells, whereas the inactive analog did not (Fig. 4B). These data are consistent with p38 MAPK functioning upstream of Rho activation in arachidonic acid-induced cell adhesion but do not define the mechanism. We (39Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K.

Recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples. A rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify HIV-1 from DBS is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy.We have developed a real-time LightCycler (rtLC) PCR assay to detect and quantify HIV-1 from DBS. HIV-1 RNA extracted from DBS was amplified in a one-step, single-tube system using primers specific for long-terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all HIV-1 clades. SYBR Green dye was used to quantify PCR amplicons and HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of HIV-1 RNA. This assay detected samples across clades, has a dynamic range of 5 log(10), and %CV <8% up to 4 log(10) dilution. Plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the Roche Ultrasensitive (r = 0.91) and branched DNA (r = 0.89) assays. The lower limit of detection (95%) was estimated to be 136 copies. The rtLC DBS assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays. Adaptation of the assay into other real-time systems demonstrated similar performance.The accuracy, reliability, genotype inclusivity and affordability, along with the small volumes of blood required for the assay suggest that the rtLC DBS assay will be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric HIV-1 infection in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2076720250,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), is one of many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated genes. Disease protein misfolding and aggregation, often within the nucleus of affected neurons, characterize polyglutamine disorders. Several evidences have implicated the nucleus as the primary site of pathogenesis for MJD. However, the molecular determinants for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of human ataxin-3 (Atx3), the protein which is mutated in patients with MJD, are not characterized. In order to characterize the nuclear shuttling activity of Atx3, we performed yeast nuclear import assays and found that Atx3 is actively imported into the nucleus, by means of a classical nuclear localizing sequence formed by a cluster of lysine and arginine residues. On the other hand, when active nuclear export was inhibited using leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, both endogenous Atx3 and transfected GFP-Atx3 accumulated inside the nucleus of a subpopulation of COS-7 cells, whereas both proteins are normally predominant in the cytoplasm. Additionally, using a Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay, we performed an extensive analysis of six putative aliphatic nuclear export motifs identified in Atx3 amino acid sequence. Although none of the tested peptide sequences were found to drive nuclear export when isolated, we have successfully mapped the region of Atx3 responsible for its CRM1-independent nuclear export activity. Curiously, the N-terminal Josephin domain alone is exported into the cytoplasm, but the nuclear export activity of Atx3 is significantly enhanced in a longer construct that is truncated after the two ubiquitin interaction motifs, upstream from the polyQ tract. Our data show that Atx3 is actively imported to and exported from the cell nucleus, and that its nuclear export activity is dependent on a motif located at its N-terminal region. Since pathological Atx3 aggregates in the nucleus of affected neurons in MJD, and there is in vivo evidence that nuclear localization of Atx3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in MJD, defects in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein may be involved in the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of expanded Atx3."
https://openalex.org/W1968426696,"The chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) induces DNA double-strand break (DSB) damage. In order to identify conserved genes that mediate DOX resistance, we screened the Saccharomyces cerevisiae diploid deletion collection and identified 376 deletion strains in which exposure to DOX was lethal or severely reduced growth fitness. This diploid screen identified 5-fold more DOX resistance genes than a comparable screen using the isogenic haploid derivative. Since DSB damage is repaired primarily by homologous recombination in yeast, and haploid cells lack an available DNA homolog in G1 and early S phase, this suggests that our diploid screen may have detected the loss of repair functions in G1 or early S phase prior to complete DNA replication. To test this, we compared the relative DOX sensitivity of 30 diploid deletion mutants identified under our screening conditions to their isogenic haploid counterpart, most of which (n = 26) were not detected in the haploid screen. For six mutants (bem1Δ, ctf4Δ, ctk1Δ, hfi1Δ,nup133Δ, tho2Δ) DOX-induced lethality was absent or greatly reduced in the haploid as compared to the isogenic diploid derivative. Moreover, unlike WT, all six diploid mutants displayed severe G1/S phase cell cycle progression defects when exposed to DOX and some were significantly enhanced (ctk1Δ and hfi1Δ) or deficient (tho2Δ) for recombination. Using these and other “THO2-like” hypo-recombinogenic, diploid-specific DOX sensitive mutants (mft1Δ, thp1Δ, thp2Δ) we utilized known genetic/proteomic interactions to construct an interactive functional genomic network which predicted additional DOX resistance genes not detected in the primary screen. Most (76%) of the DOX resistance genes detected in this diploid yeast screen are evolutionarily conserved suggesting the human orthologs are candidates for mediating DOX resistance by impacting on checkpoint and recombination functions in G1 and/or early S phases."
https://openalex.org/W2073961089,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are key regulators of intracellular signaling that interact with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily members as well as proapoptotic molecules such as Smac/DIABLO and caspases.

In this study, c-IAPs are shown to be highly unstable molecules that undergo autoubiquitination. The autoubiquitination of c-IAP1 is blocked upon coexpression with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, and this is achieved by inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity intrinsic to the RING of c-IAP1. Consistent with these observations, loss of TRAF2 results in a decrease in c-IAP1 levels. Stabilized c-IAP1 was found to sequester and prevent Smac/DIABLO from antagonizing X-linked IAP and protect against cell death.

Many IAP proteins, including c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, contain a carboxyl-terminal RING domain that can function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (7Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain in c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 was previously shown to negatively regulate the apoptotic inhibitory properties of c-IAP proteins and to promote autoubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1 (8Clem R.J.

A specialized property of the c-IAP proteins is their involvement in tumor necrosis family (TNF) signaling (10Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 11Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

Both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were discovered in a biochemical screen for factors associated with the type 2 TNF receptor. This association was found to be indirect and bridged by interactions with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), most notably TRAF1 and TRAF2 (11Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Though the consequences of the association between TRAF2 and c-IAP1 on TNF-mediated signaling have been investigated (12Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), less is known about the functional significance of the association between TRAF2 and c-IAP1 on cell death inhibition. Because both c-IAP1 and TRAF2 possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in their respective RING domains, it seemed that the association between these molecules might impact the protective properties of c-IAP1 and alter the apoptotic threshold. In this study, the role of TRAF2 in c-IAP1 stability and how the association of TRAF2 with c-IAP1 affects the apoptotic inhibitory properties of c-IAP1 were examined. The presence of TRAF2 greatly enhanced the stability of c-IAP1, and these data suggest that the interaction between TRAF2 and c-IAP1 inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity intrinsic to the RING domain of c-IAP1. Using stabilized c-IAP1, the anti-apoptotic activity of c-IAP1 was characterized, and it was found that c-IAP1 suppresses apoptosis to a degree comparable with XIAP. Furthermore, we show that c-IAP1 functions to prevent the IAP antagonist, Smac/DIABLO (13Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

HEK293 cells and MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol. HEK293 cells were treated with 35 μm MG-132 for 4 h. Following treatment with MG-132, cells were harvested, and immunoblot analysis was carried out as described below. Cells were transfected with pEBB-GFP, pcDNA3-Bax, and other indicated plasmids and incubated at 37 °C. Sixteen h following transfection, cell viability was determined by observing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescent cells using a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope. Adherent and floating cells were harvested, and caspase-3 assays were performed using a caspase assay kit (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AFC released was measured overtime at 37 °C using a CytoFluor 4000 multi-well plate reader (Applied Biosystems). A total of 20 measurements at 90-s intervals were taken for AFC release with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 508 nm. Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice to ensure complete lysis unless noted otherwise. Protein quantification was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer cell lysates of equal protein concentrations were prepared in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen NuPAGE LDS) separated on denaturing NuPAGE 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels, and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.02–0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) depending on the antibody requirements, followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies in 2.5% milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02–0.2% Tween, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize the blots on Kodak XAR film. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, normalized for protein content, and incubated with HA or XIAP antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-coupled agarose beads were then added to the lysates and incubated for an additional 1 h. Centrifugation was performed to recover agarose beads, followed by washing in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted by adding lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heating the samples for 10 min at 95 °C. Recovered proteins were subsequently separated by electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids, and 24 h following transfection, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription with random hexamer primers and MultiScribeTM reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) was performed on 100 ng of total RNA. The indicated target assays were performed on 1 μl of resulting cDNA. Each target assay was performed in triplicate and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Previous studies have shown that the cellular signaling regulators c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 can interact with TNF receptor superfamily members and that an association with TRAF proteins, primarily TRAF1 and TRAF2, mediates this interaction (10Shu H.B.

Although the interaction between c-IAP1 and TRAF2 was subsequently described to result in c-IAP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF2 (12Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), less is known about the functional consequences of the TRAF2·c-IAP1 interaction on c-IAP1 expression and cellular properties of c-IAP1. To further characterize the interaction between c-IAP1 and TRAF2, we examined how loss of TRAF2 might affect c-IAP1 expression. Interestingly, in TRAF2-deficient MEFs, a notable and specific reduction in endogenous c-IAP1 protein levels was observed, whereas levels of other proteins, including XIAP, remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). This finding suggested that TRAF2 might play a role in the regulation of c-IAP1 protein levels. Given the observed reduction in endogenous c-IAP1 protein levels in TRAF2-deficient fibroblasts, we sought to determine whether a reduction of TRAF2 in human cells would affect c-IAP1 using an RNA interference approach. Two siRNA oligonucleotides for TRAF2 were used individually or in combination to suppress TRAF2 protein levels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B) and in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Examination of c-IAP1 protein levels in the TRAF2 suppressed cells also revealed a reduction in endogenous c-IAP1 levels. Other IAP proteins, such as XIAP, were unaffected by a reduction in TRAF2 levels (Fig. 1, B and C). These data suggest that the interaction between c-IAP1 and TRAF2 alters the regulation of c-IAP1 protein levels. Because the stability of c-IAP1 appeared to be dependent on TRAF2, we sought to compare the relative expression levels of several IAP proteins. Plasmids encoding XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 with the same parental vector and epitope tag with no extraneous 5′ or 3′ sequences were transfected into HEK293 cells. Upon examination of cell lysates normalized for protein content, XIAP expression was consistently found to be significantly greater than c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 expression (Fig. 2A), suggesting that c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were unstable proteins. Because c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were poorly expressed under these conditions, we examined whether these proteins might be undergoing ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. HEK293 cells were treated with MG-132 to inhibit proteasomal activity and to determine whether c-IAP proteins undergo ubiquitination and degradation. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 protein levels were increased after MG-132 treatment in comparison with untreated cells that were transfected with c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the c-IAP proteins were sensitive to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To determine whether the ubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 was because of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in their RING domains, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace critical histidines within their RING domains (H588A for c-IAP1 and H574A for c-IAP2). Interestingly, the expression of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 variants deficient in their E3 ubiquitin ligase activities was greatly enhanced relative to their wild type counterparts and was comparable with that of wild type XIAP (Fig. 2C). Although loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domains resulted in stable forms of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, modification of the corresponding critical histidine in the RING domain of XIAP did not result in a change in the expression level of XIAP H467A compared with wild type XIAP. Collectively, these data indicate that when expressed alone in culture, both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 undergo RING-dependent autoubiquitination and degradation. Because a reduction in endogenous c-IAP1 protein levels was observed that corresponded to reduced TRAF2 protein levels, and c-IAP proteins were observed to undergo autoubiquitination mediated by their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity when expressed alone in culture, we sought to determine whether overexpression of any TRAF proteins might alter IAP protein levels. As shown in Fig. 3, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP were expressed with TRAF1–6. Surprisingly, expression of TRAF2 caused a marked enhancement in the expression of c-IAP1, whereas no other TRAF proteins significantly enhanced the expression of c-IAP proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). Although an enhanced expression of endogenous c-IAP1 was not consistently observed following ectopic expression of TRAF2, this is likely due to the less than complete transfection efficiency and expression of the transgene. TRAF1 slightly enhanced the expression of c-IAP1; however, this may be due to heterodimerization of TRAF1 with TRAF2, although this hypothesis is untested. Whereas enhanced expression of the c-IAP proteins, most notably c-IAP1, was observed in the presence of TRAF2, the expression of XIAP was unchanged by all tested TRAF proteins (Fig. 3C). The data thus far indicated that TRAF2 was capable of stabilizing c-IAP1. We therefore examined whether the enhanced expression of c-IAP1 in the presence of TRAF2 was associated with a decrease in c-IAP1 autoubiquitination (Fig. 4A). To investigate this hypothesis, the RING mutant of c-IAP1 was expressed with TRAF2 because the RING mutant of c-IAP1 is stable and does not undergo autoubiquitination. Coexpression of TRAF2 and the RING mutant of c-IAP1 (H588A) did not lead to additional enhancement of c-IAP1 H588A protein levels (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that the association of TRAF2 with c-IAP1 impairs the ability of c-IAP1 to undergo autoubiquination. TRAF2 has been previously reported to participate in the activation of several nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways (20Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), which in turn leads to the transcriptional activation of numerous genes involved in the acute phase of the inflammatory response, including BIRC2 (c-IAP1) and BIRC3 (c-IAP2) (20Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRAF2 might be affecting transcription of BIRC genes, a variant of TRAF2 lacking the amino-terminal RING domain of TRAF2 (ΔRING TRAF2) was utilized. This variant of TRAF2 has previously been shown to block NF-κB activation by various members of the TNF receptor superfamily, including type-2 TNF receptor, CD40, and CD30 (21Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 22Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, when the ΔRING TRAF2 variant was expressed with c-IAP1, an increase in c-IAP1 protein levels was also observed in comparison to c-IAP1 alone (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the RING domain of TRAF2 was not required for stabilization of c-IAP1, because the ΔRING TRAF2 variant could promote enhancement of c-IAP1 protein levels similar to that observed with full-length TRAF2. Furthermore, the increase in c-IAP1 protein levels observed in the presence of TRAF2 was not the result of NF-κB activation because ΔRING TRAF2 blocks NF-κB activation (21Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). To further examine whether TRAF2 was enhancing c-IAP1 post-translationally or by transcriptional up-regulation, RNA transcript levels of c-IAP1 were examined in the absence and presence of TRAF2 by quantitative analysis using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. No increase in c-IAP1 transcript levels was observed when TRAF2 was expressed with c-IAP1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Collectively, these results support that TRAF2-mediated c-IAP1 stabilization occurs not through NF-κB activation and transcriptional up-regulation, but through a post-translational interaction between TRAF2 and c-IAP1. Because either coexpression of c-IAP1 with TRAF2 or mutation of the RING domain within c-IAP1 produced a stabilized c-IAP1, we sought to determine whether stabilized c-IAP1 might be capable of conferring a cytoprotective effect. To activate a well described, caspase-dependent apoptotic program, Bax was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells (23Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown that XIAP can suppress this Bax-induced apoptotic process, which normally results in the cleave and activation of caspase-3 in this cell type (4Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, c-IAP1, stabilized by TRAF2 was cytoprotective against Bax-mediated apoptosis. A significant reduction in caspase-3 processing (Fig. 5B) and activity (Fig. 5C) in comparison to Bax expressed alone or c-IAP1 expressed without TRAF2 was observed with TRAF2-stabilized c-IAP1. The level of protection by c-IAP1 stabilized by TRAF2 was comparable with the level of protection observed for XIAP. The ubiquitin ligase-deficient variant of c-IAP1 (H588A) was also capable of robustly protecting cells from undergoing Bax-induced apoptosis, as shown in Fig. 5D. Furthermore, a significant decrease in caspase-3 processing (Fig. 5E) and activity (Fig. 5F) was also observed with H588A c-IAP1. Additionally, c-IAP1 stabilized by the ΔRING TRAF2 variant was capable of protecting against Bax-induced cell death to a level comparable with c-IAP1 stabilized by TRAF2 (data not shown), suggesting that TRAF2 was not providing protection from cell death by activating the NF-κB signaling pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that stabilized c-IAP1 is a potent inhibitor of cell death capable of protecting cells to a level observed with XIAP. To further examine the structural requirements of the stabilization effects of TRAF2 on c-IAP1, mutant versions of c-IAP1 were generated that have previously been shown to impair the interaction with TRAF2 (24Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1080-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Varfolomeev E. Wayson S.M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J. Vucic D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29022-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, a c-IAP1 double mutant (E64A/R65A) that appears to be abrogated in its ability to bind TRAF2 was still found to be stabilized by coexpression of TRAF2. Interestingly, a deletion construct lacking the entire BIR1 domain was robustly expressed, even in the absence of TRAF2, and in coprecipitation studies was found to be unable to associate with TRAF2 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that separate components within BIR1 participate in TRAF binding and destabilization. Taken together, these observations suggest that the ability of TRAF2 to stabilize c-IAP1 does not require a direct interaction but rather might involve a mechanism by which TRAF2 competes for a common factor, such as a component of the ubiquitination machinery. To evaluate the specificity of the protective effects of TRAF2-stabilized c-IAP1, the protective effects of c-IAP1/TRAF2 combinations were examined using two different proapoptotic stimuli induced by ectopic expression. Caspase-3 activation induced by an intrinsic apoptotic stimulus (Bax; Fig. 6B) or an extrinsic/receptor-mediated stimulus (26Lewis J. Burstein E. Reffey S.B. Bratton S.B. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9023-9029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fas/CD95; Fig. 6C), were both blocked by c-IAP1 expression when stabilized by TRAF2, and the E64A/R65A c-IAP1 mutant incapable of interacting with TRAF2 was similarly capable of suppressing caspase-3 levels. Prior reports suggest that c-IAP proteins function to inhibit cell death without directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of caspases (2Eckelman B.P. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3254-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Ditzel M. Meier P. Nat.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and our observations that stabilized c-IAP1 can protect against Bax induced cell death, the binding interaction between c-IAP1 and Smac/DIABLO was examined to determine whether c-IAP1 was capable of protecting cells indirectly, for example by sequestering Smac/DIABLO away from endogenous XIAP. This hypothesis was tested by transfecting increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding c-IAP1 H588A, immunoprecipitating either XIAP or c-IAP1 from cell lysates, and immunoblotting for Smac/DIABLO in precipitated complexes (Fig. 7). Interestingly, as the concentration of plasmid encoding c-IAP1 was increased, the amount of endogenous Smac/DIABLO that was precipitated with c-IAP1 was increased. At the same time, the amount of endogenous Smac/DIABLO that was precipitated with endogenous XIAP was reduced (Fig. 7). These data indicate that stabilized c-IAP1 can competitively inhibit the interaction between Smac/DIABLO and XIAP. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which c-IAP proteins are regulated and found that TRAF2 stabilized c-IAP1 (Fig. 3). We demonstrated that stabilized c-IAP1 was capable of inhibiting cell death to a level comparable with the potent cell death inhibitor XIAP (Fig. 5). Whereas XIAP is considered the major mammalian cell death inhibitor because it is capable of binding to and inhibiting caspases, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were shown to bind but not inhibit the enzymatic activity of caspases (2Eckelman B.P. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3254-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Ditzel M. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that c-IAP1 might instead interfere with the binding of the XIAP antagonist, Smac/DIABLO, and function to sequester Smac/DIABLO from neutralizing the apoptotic inhibition of XIAP (2Eckelman B.P. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3254-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Ditzel M. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using stabilized c-IAP1, the anti-apoptotic properties of c-IAP1 were examined. As demonstrated here, c-IAP1 can sequester Smac/DIABLO and competitively interfere with Smac/DIABLO binding to XIAP, releasing XIAP to inhibit caspases (Fig. 7). Therefore, these findings provide evidence that stabilized c-IAP1 is capable of protecting against cell death; however, the mechanism by which stabilized c-IAP1 protects against cell death is distinct from the protective mechanism utilized by XIAP. Our studies describe a mechanism by which c-IAP1 inhibits cell death and clarify how IAP proteins function to promote cell survival. Although c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are members of the IAP family because they both contain three baculovirus IAP repeat domains, the structural motif used to define IAP proteins, it is now evident that these molecules participate in additional signaling pathways. The observation that c-IAP1 can function as a putative oncogene through synergizing with c-Myc (28Xu L. Zhu J. Hu X. Zhu H. Kim H.T. LaBaer J. Goldberg A. Yuan J. Mol.

Because it is clear that c-IAP proteins may be an important target for cancer therapeutics, it is critical that all cellular roles of c-IAP proteins, both nonapoptotic and anti-apoptotic, are thoroughly investigated because it is evident that c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are multifunctional proteins that play important roles in cell survival and proliferation, as well as other potential signaling cascades. Given that c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 have the potential to regulate signaling to NF-κB through interactions with TRAFs, as well as associate with Smac/DIABLO, which can regulate caspase-mediated apoptosis and caspase-independent signaling, it is not surprising that numerous forms of cancer may utilize c-IAP1 to drive oncogenesis. Whereas the anti-apoptotic and NF-κB mediated cell proliferation roles for c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are now more defined, it will be imperative to differentiate which of these roles are critical for the oncogenic function.

https://openalex.org/W1979603999,"The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) was originally identified as a pre-B cell stimulatory factor but has been recently implicated in several other key steps in differentiation and morphogenesis. In addition, SDF1 as well as FGF signalling pathways have recently been shown to be involved in the control of epimorphic regeneration. In this report, we address the question of a possible interaction between the two signalling pathways during adult fin regeneration in zebrafish. Using a combination of pharmaceutical and genetic tools, we show that during epimorphic regeneration, expression of sdf1, as well as of its cognate receptors, cxcr4a, cxcr4b and cxcr7 are controlled by FGF signalling. We further show that, Sdf1a negatively regulates the expression of fgf20a. Together, these results lead us to propose that: 1) the function of Fgf in blastema formation is, at least in part, relayed by the chemokine Sdf1a, and that 2) Sdf1 exerts negative feedback on the Fgf pathway, which contributes to a transient expression of Fgf20a downstream genes at the beginning of regeneration. However this feedback control can be bypassed since the Sdf1 null mutants regenerate their fin, though slower. Very few mutants for the regeneration process were isolated so far, illustrating the difficulty in identifying genes that are indispensable for regeneration. This observation supports the idea that the regeneration process involves a delicate balance between multiple pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1995113359,"Background Metabolism of energy nutrients by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is implicated in the aging process. Polymorphisms in core ETC proteins may have an effect on longevity. Here we investigate the cytochrome b (cytb) polymorphism at amino acid 7 (cytbI7T) that distinguishes human mitochondrial haplogroup H from haplogroup U. Principal Findings We compared longevity of individuals in these two haplogroups during historical extremes of caloric intake. Haplogroup H exhibits significantly increased longevity during historical caloric restriction compared to haplogroup U (p = 0.02) while during caloric abundance they are not different. The historical effects of natural selection on the cytb protein were estimated with the software TreeSAAP using a phylogenetic reconstruction for 107 mammal taxa from all major mammalian lineages using 13 complete protein-coding mitochondrial gene sequences. With this framework, we compared the biochemical shifts produced by cytbI7T with historical evolutionary pressure on and near this polymorphic site throughout mammalian evolution to characterize the role cytbI7T had on the ETC during times of restricted caloric intake. Significance Our results suggest the relationship between caloric restriction and increased longevity in human mitochondrial haplogroup H is determined by cytbI7T which likely enhances the ability of water to replenish the Qi binding site and decreases the time ubisemiquinone is at the Qo site, resulting in a decrease in the average production rate of radical oxygen species (ROS)."
https://openalex.org/W2118096701,"Many vertebrates, including the goldfish, exhibit seasonal reproductive rhythms, which are a result of interactions between external environmental stimuli and internal endocrine systems in the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. While it is long believed that differential expression of neuroendocrine genes contributes to establishing seasonal reproductive rhythms, no systems-level investigation has yet been conducted.In the present study, by analyzing multiple female goldfish brain microarray datasets, we have characterized global gene expression patterns for a seasonal cycle. A core set of genes (873 genes) in the hypothalamus were identified to be differentially expressed between May, August and December, which correspond to physiologically distinct stages that are sexually mature (prespawning), sexual regression, and early gonadal redevelopment, respectively. Expression changes of these genes are also shared by another brain region, the telencephalon, as revealed by multivariate analysis. More importantly, by examining one dataset obtained from fish in October who were kept under long-daylength photoperiod (16 h) typical of the springtime breeding season (May), we observed that the expression of identified genes appears regulated by photoperiod, a major factor controlling vertebrate reproductive cyclicity. Gene ontology analysis revealed that hormone genes and genes functionally involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway and transmission of nerve impulses are significantly enriched in an expression pattern, whose transition is located between prespawning and sexually regressed stages. The existence of seasonal expression patterns was verified for several genes including isotocin, ependymin II, GABA(A) gamma2 receptor, calmodulin, and aromatase b by independent samplings of goldfish brains from six seasonal time points and real-time PCR assays.Using both theoretical and experimental strategies, we report for the first time global gene expression patterns throughout a breeding season which may account for dynamic neuroendocrine regulation of seasonal reproductive development."
https://openalex.org/W2143322392,"Experimental protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are increasingly being exploited in diverse ways for biological discovery. Accordingly, it is vital to discern their underlying natures by identifying and classifying the various types of deterministic (specific) and probabilistic (nonspecific) interactions detected. To this end, we have analyzed PPI networks determined using a range of high-throughput experimental techniques with the aim of systematically quantifying any biases that arise from the varying cellular abundances of the proteins. We confirm that PPI networks determined using affinity purification methods for yeast and Escherichia coli incorporate a correlation between protein degree, or number of interactions, and cellular abundance. The observed correlations are small but statistically significant and occur in both unprocessed (raw) and processed (high-confidence) data sets. In contrast, the yeast two-hybrid system yields networks that contain no such relationship. While previously commented based on mRNA abundance, our more extensive analysis based on protein abundance confirms a systematic difference between PPI networks determined from the two technologies. We additionally demonstrate that the centrality-lethality rule, which implies that higher-degree proteins are more likely to be essential, may be misleading, as protein abundance measurements identify essential proteins to be more prevalent than nonessential proteins. In fact, we generally find that when there is a degree/abundance correlation, the degree distributions of nonessential and essential proteins are also disparate. Conversely, when there is no degree/abundance correlation, the degree distributions of nonessential and essential proteins are not different. However, we show that essentiality manifests itself as a biological property in all of the yeast PPI networks investigated here via enrichments of interactions between essential proteins. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying natures of the various high-throughput technologies utilized to detect PPIs and should lead to more effective strategies for the inference and analysis of high-quality PPI data sets."
https://openalex.org/W1965002619,"Morbidity associated with primary headache disorders is a major public health problem with an overall prevalence of 46%. Tension-type headache and migraine are the two most prevalent causes. However, headache has not been sufficiently studied as a cause of morbidity in the developing world. Literature on prevalence and classification of these disorders in South Asia is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe the classification and clinical features of headache patients who seek medical advice in Pakistan.Medical records of 255 consecutive patients who presented to a headache clinic at a tertiary care hospital were reviewed. Demographic details, onset and lifetime duration of illness, pattern of headache, associated features and family history were recorded. International Classification of Headache Disorders version 2 was applied. 66% of all patients were women and 81% of them were between 16 and 49 years of age. Migraine was the most common disorder (206 patients) followed by tension-type headache (58 patients), medication-overuse headache (6 patients) and cluster headache (4 patients). Chronic daily headache was seen in 99 patients. Patients with tension-type headache suffered from more frequent episodes of headache than patients with migraine (p<0.001). Duration of each headache episode was higher in women with menstrually related migraine (p = 0.015). Median age at presentation and at onset was lower in patients with migraine who reported a first-degree family history of the disease (p = 0.003 and p<0.001 respectively).Patients who seek medical advice for headache in Pakistan are usually in their most productive ages. Migraine and tension-type headache are the most common clinical presentations of headache. Onset of migraine is earlier in patients with first-degree family history. Menstrually related migraine affects women with headache episodes of longer duration than other patients and it warrants special therapeutic consideration. Follow-up studies to describe epidemiology and burden of headache in Pakistan are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1998312410,"Replacement of wild-type mosquito populations with genetically modified versions is being explored as a potential strategy to control vector-borne diseases. Due to lower expected relative fitness of transgenic individuals, transgenes must be driven into populations for these scenarios to be successful. Several gene drive mechanisms exist in a theoretical sense but none are currently workable in mosquitoes. Even if strategies were workable, it would be very difficult to recall released transgenes in the event of unforeseen consequences. What is needed is a way to test transgenes in the field for feasibility, efficacy and safety prior to releasing an active drive mechanism.We outline a method, termed Multi-locus assortment (MLA), to spread transgenes into vector populations by the release of genetically-modified mosquitoes carrying multiple stable transgene inserts. Simulations indicate that [1] insects do not have to carry transgenes at more than 4 loci, [2] transgenes can be maintained at high levels by sequential small releases, the frequency of which depends on the construct fitness cost, and [3] in the case of unforeseen negative non-target effects, transgenes can be eliminated from the population by halting transgenic releases and/or mass releases of wild-type insects. We also discuss potential methods to create MLA mosquito strains in the laboratory.While not as efficient as active drive mechanisms, MLA has other advantages: [1] MLA strains can be constructed for some mosquito species with currently-available technology, [2] MLA will allow the ecological components of transgenic mosquito releases to be tested before actual gene drive mechanisms are ready to be deployed, [3] since MLA is not self-propagating, the risk of an accidental premature release into nature is minimized, and [4] in the case that active gene drive mechanisms prove impossible to develop, the MLA approach can be used as a back-up transgene dispersal mechanism for disease control efforts in some systems."

ALDH2 denitrates GTN to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate and nitrite but also catalyzes reduction of GTN to NO. To elucidate the relationship between ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion and established ALDH2 activities (dehydrogenase, esterase), we compared the function of the wild type (WT) enzyme with mutants lacking either the reactive Cys-302 (C302S) or the general base Glu-268 (E268Q). Although the C302S mutation led to >90% loss of all enzyme activities, the E268Q mutant exhibited virtually unaffected rates of GTN denitration despite low dehydrogenase and esterase activities. The nucleotide co-factor NAD caused a pronounced increase in the rates of 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate formation by WT-ALDH2 but inhibited the reaction catalyzed by the E268Q mutant. GTN bioactivation measured as activation of purified soluble guanylate cyclase or release of NO in the presence of WT- or E268Q-ALDH2 was markedly potentiated by superoxide dismutase, suggesting that bioavailability of GTN-derived NO is limited by co-generation of superoxide.

J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 883-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial isoform (ALDH2), a homotetrameric protein with subunits of ∼54 kDa, appears to be essential for detoxification of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, as indicated by significantly lowered alcohol tolerance of individuals expressing a low activity mutant of the protein (2Crabb D.W. Edenberg H.J. Bosron W.F. Li T.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aldehyde oxidation by ALDH2 is thought to involve nucleophilic reaction of the substrate with a critical cysteine residue in the active site (Cys-302 in the human protein), resulting in formation of a thiohemiacetal intermediate, followed by hydride transfer to NAD, yielding a thioester intermediate that is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid product in a reaction that involves activation of H2O by an adjacent glutamate residue (Glu-268). In addition to aldehyde oxidation, ALDH2 catalyzes ester hydrolysis (4Mann C.J. Weiner H. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The esterase activity is stimulated by NAD, but the co-factor is not essential for the reaction, which is initiated by nucleophilic attack of the substrate by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thioester and release of the corresponding alcohol by hydrolysis of the intermediate through activation of water by Glu-268 (4Mann C.J. Weiner H. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The beneficial therapeutic effects of the antianginal drug GTN are thought to involve bioactivation of the organic nitrate in vascular smooth muscle to yield NO or a related species that activates sGC, resulting in cGMP-mediated vasorelaxation (5Fung H.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a seminal paper published in 2002, Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) discovered that ALDH2 essentially contributes to vascular GTN bioactivation, and this has been confirmed in numerous later studies (for review see Ref. 7Mayer B. Beretta M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 155: 170-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) proposed that GTN denitration involves the established esterase activity of ALDH2, i.e. nucleophilic attack of a nitro group of GTN by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thionitrate intermediate and release of the corresponding alcohol, preferentially 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (1,2-GDN). The thionitrate intermediate would then release nitrite either through nucleophilic attack of one of the adjacent cysteine residues (Cys-301 or Cys-303), resulting in formation of a disulfide in the active site, or through Glu-268-aided hydrolysis yielding a sulfenic acid derivative of Cys-302, which could undergo S-thiolation (8Biswas S. Chida A.S. Rahman I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) to form a cysteinyl disulfide with one of the adjacent cysteine residues. This mechanism would be compatible both with the effect of NAD, which is not essential but increases reaction rates, and with GTN-triggered enzyme inactivation that is partially prevented by reduced thiols with two SH groups like DTT or dihydrolipoic acid. According to a brief statement in a paper on the structure of the East Asian (E487K) variant, mutation of Cys-302 and Glu-268 resulted in an almost complete loss of GTN reductase activity of ALDH2 (3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but so far the proposed role of these residues in GTN metabolism has not been thoroughly studied, and the mechanism underlying bioactivation of the nitrate is still unknown.DISCUSSIONThis study revealed several interesting and unexpected features of ALDH2-catalyzed bioactivation of GTN: (i) E268 is essential for aldehyde oxidation and ester hydrolysis but not for GTN denitration, (ii) E268Q-ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion is inhibited by NAD, and (iii) the ALDH2/GTN reaction results in mechanism-based superoxide formation that limits NO bioavailability and is significantly reduced upon mutation of Glu-268. In their original report Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) proposed a reaction of GTN with the nucleophilic Cys-302 residue of ALDH2 as the initial step of GTN bioconversion. Our results with C302S-ALDH2 support this proposal, even though residual GTN reductase activity of the mutant (∼10% of WT) suggests minor contributions of other nucleophilic residues, e.g. Cys-301 or Cys-303, to the overall reaction. The loss of aldehyde dehydrogenase and esterase activities upon mutation of Glu-268 agrees well with a previous report showing that this residue is essentially involved in hydride transfer, activation of Cys-302, hydrolysis of thioester intermediates (19Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and, of note, GTN denitration measured in the presence of NAD (3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the presence of NAD as hydride acceptor is obligatory for the dehydrogenase reaction, significant ester hydrolysis occurs also in the absence of NAD, indicating that the nucleotide is not an essential co-factor but accelerates reaction rates through a conformational change of the active site (see below). Surprisingly, NAD did not stimulate but inhibited the residual esterase activity of E268Q-ALDH2 by ∼90%. The divergent effects of NAD were also apparent in GTN denitration assays showing identical reaction rates of WT- and E268Q-ALDH2 in the absence of NAD, whereas the nicotinamide increased the activity of WT but decreased GTN denitration by the E268Q mutant. The effect of NAD on WT-ALDH2 was mainly because of an increase in apparent GTN affinity, resulting in diminished stimulation by the nucleotide with increasing GTN concentrations as observed previously (14Kollau A. Hofer A. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Keung W.M. Schmidt K. Brunner F. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). With the mutant, the inhibitory effect of NAD was not overcome by high GTN, but at increasing protein concentrations the E268Q variant exhibited significant activity even in the presence of NAD.Structural Basis for the Divergent Effects of NADIn the apo form of WT-ALDH2 two different side chain conformations of E268 have been observed (Protein Data Bank code 1o05) (20Hurley T.D. Perez-Miller S. Breen H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); in the first the carboxylate points toward Cys-302, whereas it is more remote (∼6.5 Å) in the second conformation. The latter state is supposed to be catalytically competent by accommodating and activating a water molecule positioned between the carboxylate and the thioester intermediate (19Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among the eight crystallographically independent active sites in the apo structure, five have the Glu-268 side chain in the “active” and three in the “inactive” conformation. The situation changes completely when NAD is bound (with the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety in the hydrolysis conformation), because all Glu-268 side chains are in the active conformation (Protein Data Bank codes 1o00, 1o01, and 1o02) (19Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This shift in the equilibrium in favor of the active conformation could explain the observed increase in esterase activity. Additional effects on the activity caused by interactions of the esterase substrate or the tetrahedral intermediate with the bound co-factor cannot be excluded. Similarly, alternate conformations have also been observed for the nicotinamide moiety in structures of ALDH2 with bound co-factor. In one conformation, termed “hydride transfer conformation,” the pyridine ring is close to Cys-302, whereas in the other, the “hydrolysis conformation,” it has moved away toward the entrance to the active site. It has been hypothesized that NAD can be bound in both states somewhat favoring the “hydride transfer” conformation. In the latter state, the nicotinamide ring is positioned between Glu-268 and Cys-302, which is very well compatible with hydride transfer (hence the name) but incompatible with hydrolysis of an acyl enzyme intermediate at Cys-302. The opposite applies to the other NAD conformation (19Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).A possible explanation for the decrease of the esterolytic activity of the E268Q variant of ALDH2 upon NAD binding is, again, a shift in the equilibrium between the two co-factor conformations. If the hydride transfer conformation is relatively favored by the enzyme variant over the hydrolysis conformation, this would lead to the observed activity loss. In WT-ALDH2, Glu-268 forms a single hydrogen bond to the nicotinamide in the hydride transfer conformation. Thus, a shift toward this co-factor conformation (which inhibits ester hydrolysis) could be accomplished by additional interactions possible for a glutamine compared with a glutamate side chain (e.g. two hydrogen bonds formed with the carboxamide of the co-factor).Formation of GTN-derived NOFormation of 1,2-GDN correlated reasonably well with GTN bioactivation assayed as NO release or sGC activation in the presence of SOD, suggesting that 1,2-GDN and NO are derived from a common reaction intermediate, presumably a thionitrate involving Cys-302 or, to minor extent, one of the adjacent cysteine residues. The mechanism of NO formation is unknown, but our data indicate that the thionitrate intermediate is converted through two distinct pathways that both yield 1,2-GDN but either nitrite or NO as co-products. The three-electron reduction pathway yielding NO appears to account for 5–10% of total GTN turnover catalyzed by WT-ALDH2. However, in the reaction catalyzed by E268Q-ALDH2 in the presence of NAD, fractional NO formation increased to up to 50% of total turnover, suggesting that the two pathways are not necessarily linked. Although this pronounced increase in relative NO formation occurred under conditions of very low rates of GTN denitration, there was no obvious correlation between the rates of GTN turnover and the fraction of GTN converted to NO. At present we can only conclude that the partitioning between the two- and three-electron reduction pathways of GTN denitration appears to be determined by the active site structure involving Glu-268 of human ALDH2.The present study showing significant cGMP accumulation in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of GTN strongly suggests that ALDH2-catalyzed three-electron reduction of GTN to yield NO mediates vascular GTN bioactivity in vivo. However, this may not be the complete story, because several laboratories failed to detect GTN-derived NO in blood vessels (21Kleschyov A.L. Oelze M. Daiber A. Huang Y. Mollnau H. Schulz E. Sydow K. Fichtlscherer B. Mülsch A. Münzel T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: e104-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Núñez C. Víctor V.M. Tur R. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Moncada S. Esplugues J.V. D'Ocón P. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Miller M.R. Grant S. Wadsworth R.M. J. Vasc. Res. 2008; 45: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There are several possibilities to explain this discrepancy. First, despite the impressive activation of sGC that we observed in the course of the ALDH2/GTN reaction, we cannot rule out the possibility that ALDH2-catalyzed NO formation is a peculiarity of the purified enzyme unrelated to vascular GTN bioactivation. Second, GTN-derived NO could be converted efficiently to a stable transport form that delivers NO to cytosolic sGC without significant release of free NO. Finally, taking into account that a considerable amount of vascular ALDH2 is found in soluble fractions of blood vessels (24DiFabio J. Ji Y. Vasiliou V. Thatcher G.R. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), GTN bioactivation may occur in the cytosol rather than in mitochondria and involve local interaction of ALDH2 with sGC. Further work is needed to clarify this issue.Mechanism-based Superoxide FormationOur data provide strong evidence for co-generation of superoxide that limits the bioavailability of GTN-derived NO. First, SOD markedly potentiated sGC activation by GTN without having any effect on the rates of GTN denitration or turnover-dependent enzyme inactivation (Fig. 7). Second, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN turnover compromised NO stimulation of sGC, and this was prevented by the superoxide scavengers SOD and hydralazine. Finally, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism resulted in significant oxidation of hydroethidine that was inhibited by SOD and chloral hydrate. The source of the apparent superoxide generation is unknown. The two- and three-electron reduction pathways of GTN metabolism probably involve cysteine oxidation and could give rise to formation of reactive cysteine oxides, e.g. disulfide anion radical intermediates, that reduce O2 to superoxide (25Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Accordingly, lower reactivity of a critical cysteine residue in ALDH2 lacking the general base Glu-268 could explain reduced superoxide formation by the E268Q mutant and thus the observed increase in NO bioavailability as compared with the WT enzyme that was apparent as significant formation of detectable NO in the absence of SOD (Fig. 2).Despite ample evidence that exposure of blood vessels to GTN causes superoxide formation that limits NO bioavailability in nitrate tolerance and beneficial effects of antioxidants documented by both animal and clinical studies, the actual source of superoxide in the vasculature is still a matter of debate (27Münzel T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 883-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial isoform (ALDH2), a homotetrameric protein with subunits of ∼54 kDa, appears to be essential for detoxification of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, as indicated by significantly lowered alcohol tolerance of individuals expressing a low activity mutant of the protein (2Crabb D.W. Edenberg H.J. Bosron W.F. Li T.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aldehyde oxidation by ALDH2 is thought to involve nucleophilic reaction of the substrate with a critical cysteine residue in the active site (Cys-302 in the human protein), resulting in formation of a thiohemiacetal intermediate, followed by hydride transfer to NAD, yielding a thioester intermediate that is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid product in a reaction that involves activation of H2O by an adjacent glutamate residue (Glu-268). In addition to aldehyde oxidation, ALDH2 catalyzes ester hydrolysis (4Mann C.J. Weiner H. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The esterase activity is stimulated by NAD, but the co-factor is not essential for the reaction, which is initiated by nucleophilic attack of the substrate by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thioester and release of the corresponding alcohol by hydrolysis of the intermediate through activation of water by Glu-268 (4Mann C.J. Weiner H. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate 2,2-diethyl-1-nitroso-oxyhydrazine (DEA/NONOate) dithiothreitol glyceryl dinitrate glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide soluble guanylate cyclase 3-morpholino sydnonimine triethanolamine superoxide dismutase wild type diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid. mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate 2,2-diethyl-1-nitroso-oxyhydrazine (DEA/NONOate) dithiothreitol glyceryl dinitrate glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide soluble guanylate cyclase 3-morpholino sydnonimine triethanolamine superoxide dismutase wild type diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid. The beneficial therapeutic effects of the antianginal drug GTN are thought to involve bioactivation of the organic nitrate in vascular smooth muscle to yield NO or a related species that activates sGC, resulting in cGMP-mediated vasorelaxation (5Fung H.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a seminal paper published in 2002, Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) discovered that ALDH2 essentially contributes to vascular GTN bioactivation, and this has been confirmed in numerous later studies (for review see Ref. 7Mayer B. Beretta M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 155: 170-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) proposed that GTN denitration involves the established esterase activity of ALDH2, i.e. nucleophilic attack of a nitro group of GTN by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thionitrate intermediate and release of the corresponding alcohol, preferentially 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (1,2-GDN). The thionitrate intermediate would then release nitrite either through nucleophilic attack of one of the adjacent cysteine residues (Cys-301 or Cys-303), resulting in formation of a disulfide in the active site, or through Glu-268-aided hydrolysis yielding a sulfenic acid derivative of Cys-302, which could undergo S-thiolation (8Biswas S. Chida A.S. Rahman I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) to form a cysteinyl disulfide with one of the adjacent cysteine residues. This mechanism would be compatible both with the effect of NAD, which is not essential but increases reaction rates, and with GTN-triggered enzyme inactivation that is partially prevented by reduced thiols with two SH groups like DTT or dihydrolipoic acid. According to a brief statement in a paper on the structure of the East Asian (E487K) variant, mutation of Cys-302 and Glu-268 resulted in an almost complete loss of GTN reductase activity of ALDH2 (3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but so far the proposed role of these residues in GTN metabolism has not been thoroughly studied, and the mechanism underlying bioactivation of the nitrate is still unknown. DISCUSSIONThis study revealed several interesting and unexpected features of ALDH2-catalyzed bioactivation of GTN: (i) E268 is essential for aldehyde oxidation and ester hydrolysis but not for GTN denitration, (ii) E268Q-ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion is inhibited by NAD, and (iii) the ALDH2/GTN reaction results in mechanism-based superoxide formation that limits NO bioavailability and is significantly reduced upon mutation of Glu-268. In their original report Stamler and co-workers (6Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) proposed a reaction of GTN with the nucleophilic Cys-302 residue of ALDH2 as the initial step of GTN bioconversion. Our results with C302S-ALDH2 support this proposal, even though residual GTN reductase activity of the mutant (∼10% of WT) suggests minor contributions of other nucleophilic residues, e.g. Cys-301 or Cys-303, to the overall reaction. The loss of aldehyde dehydrogenase and esterase activities upon mutation of Glu-268 agrees well with a previous report showing that this residue is essentially involved in hydride transfer, activation of Cys-302, hydrolysis of thioester intermediates (19Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and, of note, GTN denitration measured in the presence of NAD (3Larson H.N. Zhou J. Chen Z. Stamler J.S. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12940-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the presence of NAD as hydride acceptor is obligatory for the dehydrogenase reaction, significant ester hydrolysis occurs also in the absence of NAD, indicating that the nucleotide is not an essenti"
https://openalex.org/W2017011797,"We propose a modification of the well-known Armitage trend test to address the problems associated with hidden population structure and hidden relatedness in genome-wide case-control association studies.The new test adopts beneficial traits from three existing testing strategies: the principal components, mixed model, and genomic control while avoiding some of their disadvantageous characteristics, such as the tendency of the principal components method to over-correct in certain situations or the failure of the genomic control approach to reorder the adjusted tests based on their degree of alignment with the underlying hidden structure. The new procedure is based on Gauss-Markov estimators derived from a straightforward linear model with an imposed variance structure proportional to an empirical relatedness matrix. Lastly, conceptual and analytical similarities to and distinctions from other approaches are emphasized throughout.Our simulations show that the power performance of the proposed test is quite promising compared to the considered competing strategies. The power gains are especially large when small differential differences between cases and controls are present; a likely scenario when public controls are used in multiple studies.The proposed modified approach attains high power more consistently than that of the existing commonly implemented tests. Its performance improvement is most apparent when small but detectable systematic differences between cases and controls exist."
https://openalex.org/W2005153840,"Background Ly-6 superfamily members have a conserved Ly-6 domain that is defined by a distinct disulfide bonding pattern between eight or ten cysteine residues. These members are divided into membrane-type and secretory-type proteins. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel Ly-6 domain protein, secreted protein of Ly-6 domain 1 (SOLD1), from bovine placenta. Principal Findings SOLD1 mRNA was expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells and the protein was secreted into and localized in the extracellular matrix of the mesenchyme in cotyledonary villi. SOLD1 bound mainly with type I collagen telopeptide. We confirmed secretion of SOLD1 from the basolateral surface of a bovine trophoblast cell line (BT-1). It may be related to the organization of the extra-cellular matrix in the mesenchyme of fetal villi. Since trophoblast mononucleate cells are epithelial cells, their polar organization is expected to have a crucial role in the SOLD1 secretion system. We established that SOLD1 is an intronless bovine gene containing the Alu retrotransposon, which was integrated via cytoplasmic reverse transcription. Conclusion We identified a novel retrotransposon-like Ly-6 domain protein in bovine placenta. SOLD1 is a crucial secreted protein that is involved in the organization of the mesenchyme of the cotyledonary villi. Furthermore, the gene encoding SOLD1 has an interesting genomic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2086621874,"Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in several differentiation processes and possibly in adipocyte differentiation. To search for genes that show methylation change during adipogenesis, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells was performed using a method called microarray-based integrated analysis of methylation by isoschizomers (MIAMI). The MIAMI revealed that Hpa II sites of exon 1 in a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 19 (ARHGEF19; WGEF) gene were demethylated during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Deletion of the region containing cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites that showed methylation change suppressed transcriptional activity in the reporter assay, indicating that this region regulates WGEF transcription. WGEF expression in 3T3-L1 cells was reduced during adipocyte differentiation, and high-fat diet-induced obese mice also showed lower expression of WGEF gene than control mice in white adipose tissue. Additionally, forced expression of WGEF in 3T3-L1 cells down-regulated the expression of adipogenic marker genes and inhibited the adipogenic program. This study clarified that adipogenesis was regulated by WGEF expression through DNA methylation change."
https://openalex.org/W1979503253,"Background Chronic fatiguing illness remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown pathogenesis. We attempted to identify biomarkers for chronic fatiguing illness using microarrays to query the transcriptome in peripheral blood leukocytes. Methods Cases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue. Biological sampling conditions were standardized and RNA stabilizing media were used. These methodological features provide rigorous control for bias resulting from case-control mismatched ancestry and experimental error. Individual gene expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Findings There were no significant differences in gene expression for any transcript. Conclusions Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify a biomarker for chronic fatiguing illness in the transcriptome of peripheral blood leukocytes suggesting that positive findings in prior studies may have resulted from experimental bias."
https://openalex.org/W2081407713,"When a sponsor funds a study of two competing drugs in a head-to-head comparison, the results and conclusions are likely to favor the sponsor's drug. Thiazolidinediones, oral medications used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, are one of the most costly choices of oral anti-diabetic medications, yet they do not demonstrate clinically relevant differences in achieving lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels compared to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Our aim is to examine associations between research funding source, study design characteristics aimed at reducing bias, and other factors with the results and conclusions of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of thiazolidinediones compared to other oral hypoglycemic agents.This is a cross-sectional study of 61 published RCTs comparing a thiazolidinedione (glitazone) to another anti-diabetic drug or placebo for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Data on study design characteristics, funding source, author's financial ties, results for primary outcomes, and author conclusions were extracted. Univariate logistic regression identified associations between independent variables and results and conclusions that favored the glitazone. Of the RCTs, 59% (36/61) were funded by industry, 39% (24/61) did not disclose any funding. Common study design weaknesses included inadequate blinding and lack of concealment of allocation. Trials that reported favorable glycemic control results for the glitazone were more likely to have adequate blinding (OR (95% CI) = 5.42 (1.46, 21.19), p = 0.008) and have a corresponding author with financial ties to the glitazone manufacturer (OR (95% CI) = 4.12 (1.05, 19.53); p = 0.04). Trials with conclusions favoring the glitazone were less likely to be funded by a comparator drug company than a glitazone company (OR (95% CI) = 0.026 (0, 0.40), p = 0.003) and less likely to be published in journals with higher impact factors (OR (95% CI) = 0.79 (0.62, 0.97), p = 0.011). One limitation of our study is that we categorized studies as funded by industry based on each article's disclosure which could underestimate the number of industry sponsored studies and personal ties of investigators. Additionally, our study did not include any head-to-head comparisons of one glitazone to another.Published RCT comparisons of glitazones with other anti-diabetic drugs or placebo are predominantly industry supported and this support, as well as the financial ties of study authors, appears to be associated with favorable findings."
https://openalex.org/W2137379553,"Background Hemoglobin C differs from normal hemoglobin A by a glutamate-to-lysine substitution at position 6 of beta globin and is oxidatively unstable. Compared to homozygous AA erythrocytes, homozygous CC erythrocytes contain higher levels of membrane-associated hemichromes and more extensively clustered band 3 proteins. These findings suggest that CC erythrocytes have a different membrane matrix than AA erythrocytes. Methodology and Findings We found that AA and CC erythrocytes differ in their membrane lipid composition, and that a subset of CC erythrocytes expresses increased levels of externalized phosphatidylserine. Detergent membrane analyses for raft marker proteins indicated that CC erythrocyte membranes are more resistant to detergent solubilization. These data suggest that membrane raft organization is modified in CC erythrocytes. In addition, the average zeta potential (a measure of surface electrochemical potential) of CC erythrocytes was ≈2 mV lower than that of AA erythrocytes, indicating that substantial rearrangements occur in the membrane matrix of CC erythrocytes. We were able to recapitulate this low zeta potential phenotype in AA erythrocytes by treating them with NaNO2 to oxidize hemoglobin A molecules and increase levels of membrane-associated hemichromes. Conclusion Our data support the possibility that increased hemichrome deposition and altered lipid composition induce molecular rearrangements in CC erythrocyte membranes, resulting in a unique membrane structure."
https://openalex.org/W1967790132,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine constitutively expressed by urothelial cells. During inflammatory stimuli, MIF is released into the lumen complexed to other proteins and these complexes can bind to urothelial cell-surface receptors to activate signaling pathways. Since MIF is complexed to alpha1-inhibitor III (A1-I3; a member of the alpha2-macroglubulin family) and glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a receptor for A1-I3 the goals of this study were to determine if substance P elicits urothelial cell-surface expression of GRP78 and to assess the functional role of CD74 (receptor for MIF) or GRP78 in substance P-induced bladder inflammatory changes.Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats received either saline or substance P (s.c.), bladders were collected 1 hour after treatment and processed for histology or protein/mRNA. The expression of GRP78 at urothelial cell-surface was determined by performing in vivo biotinylation of urothelial cell-surface proteins. Finally, in order to determine the effects of receptor blockade on substance P-induced MIF release and inflammatory changes, rats received either intraluminal antibodies to CD74, GRP78, both, or non-specific IgG (as a control). GRP78 and MIF immunostaining was simultaneously visualized in umbrella cells only after substance P treatment. Immunoprecipitation studies showed GRP78-MIF complexes increased after substance P while in vivo biotinylation confirmed substance P-induced GRP78 cell-surface expression in urothelial cells. Intraluminal blockade of CD74 and/or GRP78 prevented substance P-induced changes, including bladder edema, intraluminal MIF release by urothelial cells and production of inflammatory cytokines by urothelial cells.GRP78 is expressed on the surface of urothelial cells after substance P treatment where it can bind MIF complexes. Blocking CD74 (receptor for MIF) and/or GRP78 prevented substance P-induced inflammatory changes in bladder and urothelium, indicating that these urothelial receptors are effective targets for disrupting MIF-mediated bladder inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1989707914,"Nicotinic receptors (AChRs) play key roles in synaptic transmission. We explored activation of neuronal α7 and mammalian muscle AChRs by morantel and oxantel. Our results revealed a novel action of morantel as a high efficacy and more potent agonist than ACh of α7 receptors. The EC50 for activation by morantel of both α7 and α7-5HT3A receptors is 7-fold lower than that determined for ACh. The minimum morantel concentration required to activate α7-5HT3A channels is 6-fold lower than that of ACh, and activation episodes are more prolonged than in the presence of ACh. By contrast, oxantel is a weak agonist of α7 and α7-5HT3A, and both drugs are very low efficacy agonists of muscle AChRs. The replacement of Gln57 in α7 by glycine, which is found in the equivalent position of the muscle AChR, decreases the efficacy for activation and turns morantel into a partial agonist. The reverse mutation in the muscle AChR (ϵG57Q) increases 7-fold the efficacy of morantel. The mutations do not affect activation by ACh or oxantel, indicating that this position is selective for morantel. In silico studies show that the tetrahydropyrimidinyl group, common to both drugs, is close to Trp149 of the principal face of the binding site, whereas the other cyclic group is proximal to Gln57 of the complementary face in morantel but not in oxantel. Thus, position 57 at the complementary face is a key determinant of the high selectivity of morantel for α7. These results provide new information for further progress in drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2021600866,"(+/-) SKF83959, like many other arylbenzazepines, elicits powerful neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo. The neuroprotective action of the compound was found to partially depend on its D(1)-like dopamine receptor agonistic activity. The precise mechanism for the (+/-) SKF83959-mediated neuroprotection remains elusive. We report here that (+/-) SKF83959 is a potent blocker for delayed rectifier K(+) channel. (+/-) SKF83959 inhibited the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K)) dose-dependently in rat hippocampal neurons. The IC(50) value for inhibition of I(K) was 41.9+/-2.3 microM (Hill coefficient = 1.81+/-0.13, n = 6), whereas that for inhibition of I(A) was 307.9+/-38.5 microM (Hill coefficient = 1.37+/-0.08, n = 6). Thus, (+/-) SKF83959 is 7.3-fold more potent in suppressing I(K) than I(A). Moreover, the inhibition of I(K) by (+/-) SKF83959 was voltage-dependent and not related to dopamine receptors. The rapidly onset of inhibition and recovery suggests that the inhibition resulted from a direct interaction of (+/-) SKF83959 with the K(+) channel. The intracellular application of (+/-) SKF83959 had no effects of on I(K), indicating that the compound most likely acts at the outer mouth of the pore of K(+) channel. We also tested the enantiomers of (+/-) SKF83959, R-(+) SKF83959 (MCL-201), and S-(-) SKF83959 (MCL-202), as well as SKF38393; all these compounds inhibited I(K). However, (+/-) SKF83959, at either 0.1 or 1 mM, exhibited the strongest inhibition on the currents among all tested drug. The present findings not only revealed a new potent blocker of I(K) , but also provided a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective action of arylbenzazepines such as (+/-) SKF83959."
