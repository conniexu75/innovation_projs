https://openalex.org/W3127145950,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding of the RNA virus and its interactions with host proteins could improve therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. By using icSHAPE, we determined the structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells and from refolded RNAs, as well as the regulatory untranslated regions of SARS-CoV-2 and six other coronaviruses. We validated several structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells. The structural data informed a deep-learning tool to predict 42 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Strikingly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the structural elements and FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA binding proteins dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells derived from human liver and lung tumors. Our findings thus shed light on coronavirus and reveal multiple candidate therapeutics for COVID-19 treatment."

The mechanisms behind this association are incompletely understood. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cell division rates are increased in mice and humans with atherosclerosis. Mathematical analysis demonstrates that increased stem cell proliferation expedites somatic evolution and expansion of clones with driver mutations. The experimentally determined division rate elevation in atherosclerosis patients is sufficient to produce a 3.5-fold increased risk of clonal hematopoiesis by age 70. We confirm the accuracy of our theoretical framework in mouse models of atherosclerosis and sleep fragmentation by showing that expansion of competitively transplanted Tet2-/- cells is accelerated under conditions of chronically elevated hematopoietic activity. Hence, increased hematopoietic stem cell proliferation is an important factor contributing to the association between cardiovascular disease and clonal hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W3132791498,"Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in cancer immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell (TEFF)-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of TEFF biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining TEFF biology through the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced TEFF responses without compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained TEFF lineage differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more efficient Runx3-driven TEFF biology. CD8+ T cells lacking Fli1 provided substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8+ T cell transcriptional landscape from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven TEFF cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Fli1 improves TEFF differentiation and protective immunity in infections and cancer."

The Korean government aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through stay-at-home strategies and maintaining social distance, which are likely to result in major changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of citizens. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors in Koreans over 20 years old. Methods The study sample consisted of 104 adults in South Korea aged over 20 years. An online survey was conducted between August and October 2020, in which participants were asked to complete the Yonsei Lifestyle Profile to assess lifestyle changes, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale abbreviated version. To investigate the changes in people’s lifestyles, depression, and quality of life post COVID-19, descriptive statistics were calculated for these indicators before and after the onset of the pandemic. The p-value was two-sided, and values &lt;0.05, were regarded as statistically significant. Results There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities, including activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. However, there were no significant changes in nutrition, except in the consumption of carbohydrates and minerals. Participants reported that their quality of life and mental health had decreased after the pandemic struck. Conclusions We obtained novel data on the changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of South Korean adults before and after the onset of the pandemic. The results of our study may assist health policymakers and practitioners in the development of health education or relevant interventions to deal with the pandemic situation as well as future crises."
https://openalex.org/W3130290615,"<h2>Summary</h2> How early events in effector T cell (T<sub>EFF</sub>) subsets tune memory T cell (T<sub>MEM</sub>) responses remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigated metabolic factors in fate determination of T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>MEM</sub> cells using <i>in vivo</i> pooled CRISPR screening, focusing on negative regulators of T<sub>MEM</sub> responses. We found that amino acid transporters Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 dampened the magnitude of T<sub>MEM</sub> differentiation, in part through modulating mTORC1 signaling. By integrating genetic and systems approaches, we identified cellular and metabolic heterogeneity among T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, with terminal effector differentiation associated with establishment of metabolic quiescence and exit from the cell cycle. Importantly, Pofut1 (protein-O-fucosyltransferase-1) linked GDP-fucose availability to downstream Notch-Rbpj signaling, and perturbation of this nutrient signaling axis blocked terminal effector differentiation but drove context-dependent T<sub>EFF</sub> proliferation and T<sub>MEM</sub> development. Our study establishes that nutrient uptake and signaling are key determinants of T cell fate and shape the quantity and quality of T<sub>MEM</sub> responses."
https://openalex.org/W3133141459,"Although enteric helminth infections modulate immunity to mucosal pathogens, their effects on systemic microbes remain less established. Here, we observe increased mortality in mice coinfected with the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) and West Nile virus (WNV). This enhanced susceptibility is associated with altered gut morphology and transit, translocation of commensal bacteria, impaired WNV-specific T cell responses, and increased virus infection in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. These outcomes were due to type 2 immune skewing, because coinfection in Stat6-/- mice rescues mortality, treatment of helminth-free WNV-infected mice with interleukin (IL)-4 mirrors coinfection, and IL-4 receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells mediates the susceptibility phenotypes. Moreover, tuft cell-deficient mice show improved outcomes with coinfection, whereas treatment of helminth-free mice with tuft cell-derived cytokine IL-25 or ligand succinate worsens WNV disease. Thus, helminth activation of tuft cell-IL-4-receptor circuits in the gut exacerbates infection and disease of a neurotropic flavivirus."
https://openalex.org/W3034904927,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed the global public health importance of robust diagnostic testing. To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability, an efficient method is urgently needed. Objectives To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We evaluated pooling approach on both direct clinical and NA samples. The standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 was employed targeting the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. The experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples and extracted RNA spiked with up to 9 negative samples. For the direct clinical samples viral NA was extracted from each pool to a final extraction volume of 200μL, and subsequently both samples tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Results We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the original sample, corresponding to high, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies per reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend pooling of 4/5 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 5 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the Ct value samples spiked, and result in a 137% increase in testing efficiency. Conclusions The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community. We recommend clinical sample pooling of 4 or 5 in 1. However, we don’t advise pooling of clinical samples when disease prevalence is greater than 7%; particularly when sample size is large."

This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its prognostic value. We retrieved all consecutive patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine departments in a tertiary medical center from February 9 th , 2020 to August 28 th with a diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 559 adult patients were hospitalized in the Sheba Medical Center with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 320 (57.24%) of whom were tested for troponin levels within 24-hours of admission, and 91 (28.44%) had elevated levels. Predictors for elevated troponin levels were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.06), female sex (OR, 3.03; 95% CI 1.54–6.25), low systolic blood pressure (OR, 5.91; 95% CI 2.42–14.44) and increased creatinine level (OR, 2.88; 95% CI 1.44–5.73). The risk for death (hazard ratio [HR] 4.32, 95% CI 2.08–8.99) and a composite outcome of invasive ventilation support and death (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.15–3.37) was significantly higher among patients who had elevated troponin levels. In conclusion, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, elevated troponin levels are associated with poor prognosis. Hence, troponin levels may be used as an additional tool for risk stratification and a decision guide in patients hospitalized with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3132924759,"Background Self-focused attention and safety behaviours are both associated with adolescent social anxiety. In adults, experimental studies have indicated that the processes are causally implicated in social anxiety, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a youth sample. Methods This experiment explored this possibility by asking high and low socially anxious adolescents (N = 57) to undertake conversations under different conditions. During one conversation they were instructed to focus on themselves and use safety behaviours, and in the other they focused externally and did not use safety behaviours. Self-report, conversation partner report and independent assessor ratings were taken. Results Self-focus and safety behaviours increased feelings and appearance of anxiety and undermined performance for all participants, but only high socially anxious participants reported habitually using self-focus and safety behaviours. Conclusions The findings provide support for the causal role of self-focus and safety behaviours in adolescent social anxiety and point to the potential clinical value of techniques reversing them to treat the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3133157217,"Despite most Indonesian women now receiving antenatal care on the nationally recommended four occasions and being delivered by skilled birth attendants, the nation’s maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is estimated as 177 per 100,000 live births. Recent research in a rural district of Indonesia has indicated that poor service quality due to organizational and personnel factors is now a major determinant of this high MMR. The present research is an in-depth analysis of possible health service organizational and quality of care related causes of death among 30 women admitted to a peak referral hospital in a major Indonesian city. Despite their condition being complex or deteriorating, most of these women arrived at the hospital in a state where it was feasible to prevent death with good quality care. Poor application of protocols, poor information flow from frontline hospitals to the peak referral hospital, delays in emergency care, and delays in management of deteriorating patients were the main contributing factors to these deaths. Pyramidal referrals also contributed, as many women were initially referred to hospitals where their condition could not be effectively managed. While generic quality improvement measures, particularly training and monitoring for rigorous application of clinical protocols (including forward planning for deteriorating patients) will help improve the situation, the districts and hospitals need to develop capacity to assess their local situation. Unless local organisational factors, staff knowledge and skill, blood and blood product availability, and local reasons for delays in providing care are identified, it may not be possible to effectively reduce the adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3133161739,"Acrylamide (AA), is an important contaminant formed during food processing under high temperature. Due to its potential neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity effects, this food contaminant has been recognized as a human health concern. Previous studies showed that acrylamide-induced toxicity is associated with active metabolite of acrylamide by cytochrome P450 enzyme, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage. In the current study, we investigated the role of oxidative stress in acrylamide’s genotoxicity and therapeutic potential role of ellagic acid (EA) in human lymphocytes. Human lymphocytes were simultaneously treated with different concentrations of EA (10, 25 and 50 μM) and acrylamide (50 μM) for 4 h at 37°C. After 4 hours of incubation, the toxicity parameters such cytotoxicity, ROS formation, oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, lysosomal membrane integrity, mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm) collapse and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were analyzed using biochemical and flow cytometry evaluations. It has been found that acrylamide (50 μM) significantly increased cytotoxicity, ROS formation, GSH oxidation, lipid peroxidation, MMP collapse, lysosomal and DNA damage in human lymphocytes. On the other hand, cotreatment with EA (25 and 50 μM) inhibited AA-induced oxidative stress which subsequently led to decreasing of the cytotoxicity, GSH oxidation, lipid peroxidation, MMP collapse, lysosomal and DNA damage. Together, these results suggest that probably the co-exposure of EA with foods containing acrylamide could decrease mitochondrial, lysosomal and DNA damages, and oxidative stress induced by acrylamide in human body."
https://openalex.org/W3130608611,"The dramatic changes in people’s daily lives caused by the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have had a huge impact on their emotions and behaviors. This study aimed to examine psychosocial responses to COVID-19 using network analysis. A total of 1,500 urban residents of South Korea, selected from an online public panel, were surveyed using self-rating questionnaires addressing daily life changes, fear of infection, and distress related to COVID-19. Participants also completed a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale survey. We constructed regularized partial correlation networks, estimated global and local network metrics, tested network accuracy and stability, and compared the estimated networks between men and women. The network of the psychosocial responses consisted of 24 nodes that were classified into five groups: ‘fear of infection’, ‘difficulty with outside activities’, ‘economic loss’, ‘altered eating and sleeping’, and ‘adaptive stress’. The node centralities indicated that ‘distress in obtaining daily necessities’ and ‘concern about harming others’ were the most important issues in people’s responses to COVID-19. These nodes were connected by a negative edge, reflecting individual- and community-level issues, respectively. The overall level of perceived stress was linked to the network by the connection node ‘anger toward others or society’, which was associated with economic problems in men, but with distress from changes in daily activities in women. The results suggest that two contrasting feelings—personal insecurity regarding basic needs and a collectivistic orientation—play roles in the response to unusual experiences and distress due to COVID-19. This study also showed that public anger could arise from the psychological stress under the conditions imposed by COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3130610305,"With the development of information technology and the Internet, users can conveniently use roaming services without time and space restrictions. This roaming service is initiated by establishing a session key between a home node, which exists in a home network, and a mobile node, which exists in a foreign network. However, in the process of verifying a legitimate user and establishing a session key, various security threats and privacy exposure issues can arise. This study demonstrates that the authentication scheme for the roaming service proposed in the existing Global Mobility Network (GLOMONET) environment has several vulnerabilities and, hence, is impractical. In addition, the scheme does not satisfy the privacy of the session key or user’s identity or password. Accordingly, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme to compensate for these vulnerabilities and secure a high level of privacy, such as non-traceability. In addition, formal and informal analyses are conducted to examine the safety of the proposed scheme. Based on the results of our analyses, we prove that the proposed scheme is highly secure and applicable to the actual GLOMONET environment."
https://openalex.org/W3129350988,"In Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, nivolumab might provide overall survival benefits for patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, it is effective only in a limited number of patients. The Glasgow prognostic score is an indicator of the systematic inflammatory response and nutritional status. This study aimed to investigate the ability of the Glasgow prognostic score and other markers to predict the outcomes of patients treated with nivolumab. We reviewed the medical records of patients treated for advanced gastric cancer and who received nivolumab between February 2015 and June 2019 at Hyogo Cancer Center. The patients were categorized into two groups according to their Glasgow prognostic scores. Overall, 53.3% and 46.7% of the patients were assigned to groups with Glasgow prognostic scores of 0 and 1/2, respectively. The median durations of progression-free and overall survival of the participants were 2.3 and 5.7 months, respectively. The patients with a Glasgow prognostic score of 0 had significantly higher median overall survival than those with scores of 1 or 2 (16.4 vs. 4.2 months; p = 0.0006). This observation suggests that a pretreatment Glasgow prognostic score of 0 is associated with better outcomes, and this scoring system may be used as a predictor of outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with nivolumab."
https://openalex.org/W3130070408,"Bivalve shells are increasingly used as archives for high-resolution paleoclimate analyses. However, there is still an urgent need for quantitative temperature proxies that work without knowledge of the water chemistry–as is required for δ 18 O-based paleothermometry–and can better withstand diagenetic overprint. Recently, microstructural properties have been identified as a potential candidate fulfilling these requirements. So far, only few different microstructure categories (nacreous, prismatic and crossed-lamellar) of some short-lived species have been studied in detail, and in all such studies, the size and/or shape of individual biomineral units was found to increase with water temperature. Here, we explore whether the same applies to properties of the crossed-acicular microstructure in the hinge plate of Arctica islandica , the microstructurally most uniform shell portion in this species. In order to focus solely on the effect of temperature on microstructural properties, this study uses bivalves that grew their shells under controlled temperature conditions (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15°C) in the laboratory. With increasing temperature, the size of the largest individual biomineral units and the relative proportion of shell occupied by the crystalline phase increased. The size of the largest pores, a specific microstructural feature of A . islandica , whose potential role in biomineralization is discussed here, increased exponentially with culturing temperature. This study employs scanning electron microscopy in combination with automated image processing software, including an innovative machine learning–based image segmentation method. The new method greatly facilitates the recognition of microstructural entities and enables a faster and more reliable microstructural analysis than previously used techniques. Results of this study establish the new microstructural temperature proxy in the crossed-acicular microstructures of A . islandica and point to an overarching control mechanism of temperature on the micrometer-scale architecture of bivalve shells across species boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W3130714188,"A critical examination of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA’s) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) database provided an opportunity for the largest evaluation to date of landfilled waste decomposition kinetics with respect to different US climate regimes. In this paper, 5–8 years of annual methane collection data from 114 closed landfills located in 29 states were used to estimate site-specific waste decay rates (k) and methane collection potentials (L c ). These sites account for approximately 9% of all landfills required to report GHG emissions to the US EPA annually. The mean methane collection potential (L c ) for the sites located in regions with less than 635 mm (25 in) annual rainfall was significantly (p&lt;0.002) lower than the mean methane collection potential of the sites located in regions with more than 635 mm (25 in) annual precipitation (49 and 73 m 3 methane Mg -1 waste, respectively). This finding suggests that a fraction of the in-place biodegradable waste may not be decomposing, potentially due to a lack of adequate moisture content of landfills located in arid regions. The results of this evaluation offer insight that challenges assumptions of the traditional landfill methane estimation approach, especially in arid climates, that all methane corresponding to the total methane generation potential of the buried solid waste will be produced. Decay rates showed a significant correlation with annual precipitation, with an average k of 0.043 year -1 for arid regions (&lt; 508 mm (20 in) year -1 ), 0.074 year -1 for regions with 508–1,016 mm (20–40 in) annual precipitation, and 0.09 year -1 in wet regions (&gt; 1,016 mm (40 in) year -1 ). The data suggest that waste is decaying faster than the model default values, which in turn suggests that a larger fraction of methane is produced during a landfill’s operating life (relative to post-closure)."
https://openalex.org/W3131392410,"Aim Calculating a modelled workload based on objective measures. Exploring the relation between this modelled workload and workload as perceived by nurses, including the effects of specific job demands, job resources and personal resources on the relation. Design Academic hospital in the Netherlands. Six surgical wards, capacity 15–30 beds. Data collected over 15 consecutive day shifts. Methods Modelled workload is calculated as a ratio of required care time, based on patient characteristics, baseline care time and time for non-patient related activities, and allocated care time, based on the amount of available nurses. Both required and allocated care time are corrected for nurse proficiency. Five dimensions of perceived workload were determined by questionnaires. Both the modelled and the perceived workloads were measured on a daily basis. Linear mixed effects models study the longitudinal relation between this modelled and workload as perceived by nurses and the effects of personal resources, job resources and job demands. ANOVA and post-hoc tests were used to identify differences in modelled workload between wards. Results Modelled workload varies roughly between 70 and 170%. Significant differences in modelled workload between wards were found but confidence intervals were wide. Modelled workload is positively associated with all five perceived workload measures (work pace, amount of work, mental load, emotional load, physical load). In addition to modelled workload, the job resource support of colleagues and job demands time spent on direct patient care and time spent on registration had the biggest significant effects on perceived workload. Conclusions The modelled workload does not exactly predict perceived workload, however there is a correlation between the two. The modelled workload can be used to detect differences in workload between wards, which may be useful in distributing workload more evenly in order prevent issues of over- and understaffing and organizational justice. Extra effort to promote team work is likely to have a positive effect on perceived workload. Nurse management can stimulate team cohesion, especially when workload is high. Registered nurses perceive a higher workload than other nurses. When the proportion of direct patient care in a workday is higher, the perceived workload is also higher. Further research is recommended. The findings of this research can help nursing management in allocating resources and directing their attention to the most relevant factors for balancing workload."
https://openalex.org/W3130563705,"Urine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a valuable non-invasive biomarker with broad potential clinical applications, but there is no consensus on its optimal pre-analytical methodology, including the DNA extraction step. Due to its short length (majority of fragments &lt;100 bp) and low concentration (ng/mL), urine cfDNA is not efficiently recovered by conventional silica-based extraction methods. To maximize sensitivity of urine cfDNA assays, we developed an ultrasensitive hybridization method that uses sequence-specific oligonucleotide capture probes immobilized on magnetic beads to improve extraction of short cfDNA from large-volume urine samples. Our hybridization method recovers near 100% (95% CI: 82.6–117.6%) of target-specific DNA from 10 mL urine, independent of fragment length (25–150 bp), and has a limit of detection of ≤5 copies of double-stranded DNA (0.5 copies/mL). Pairing hybridization with an ultrashort qPCR design, we can efficiently capture and amplify fragments as short as 25 bp. Our method enables amplification of cfDNA from 10 mL urine in a single qPCR well, tolerates variation in sample composition, and effectively removes non-target DNA. Our hybridization protocol improves upon both existing silica-based urine cfDNA extraction methods and previous hybridization-based sample preparation protocols. Two key innovations contribute to the strong performance of our method: a two-probe system enabling recovery of both strands of double-stranded DNA and dual biotinylated capture probes, which ensure consistent, high recovery by facilitating optimal probe density on the bead surface, improving thermostability of the probe-bead linkage, and eliminating interference by endogenous biotin. We originally designed the hybridization method for tuberculosis diagnosis from urine cfDNA, but expect that it will be versatile across urine cfDNA targets, and may be useful for other cfDNA sample types and applications beyond cfDNA. To make our hybridization method accessible to new users, we present a detailed protocol and straightforward guidelines for designing new capture probes."

This study aimed to evaluate how the pandemic altered the experience of healthcare, acute illness, and care transitions among hospitalized patients with substance use disorder (SUD). Methods We performed a qualitative study at an academic medical center in Portland, Oregon, in Spring 2020. We conducted semi-structured interviews, and conducted a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach, at a semantic level. Results We enrolled 27 participants, and identified four main themes: 1) shuttered community resources threatened patients’ basic survival adaptations; 2) changes in outpatient care increased reliance on hospitals as safety nets; 3) hospital policy changes made staying in the hospital harder than usual; and, 4) care transitions out of the hospital were highly uncertain. Discussion Hospitalized adults with SUD were further marginalized during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Systems must address the needs of marginalized patients in future disruptive events."
https://openalex.org/W3132552161,"Background Chagas disease is a vector borne infection of poverty endemic to Latin America which affects an estimated 40,000 women of child-bearing age in the United States (US). In the US Chagas disease is concentrated among individuals who have lived in endemic areas. Prenatal diagnosis and treatment are needed to prevent congenital transmission. The objective of this study was to assess perceived barriers to Chagas disease screening among prenatal care providers in Obstetrics/Gynecology and Family Medicine Departments of a tertiary care safety-net hospital caring for a significant at-risk population. Methodology/Principal findings An anonymous survey was distributed to 178 Obstetrics/Gynecology and Family Medicine practitioners. Of the 66 respondents, 39% thought Chagas screening was very important, and 48% somewhat important as a public health initiative. One third judged screening patients during clinic visits as very important. Most respondents (64%) reported being familiar with Chagas disease. However, only 32% knew how to order a test and only 22% reported knowing what to do if a test was positive. Conclusions/Significance These findings will be incorporated into measures to facilitate full implementation of Chagas screening, and can inform initiatives at other centers who wish to address this deeply neglected infection among their patient families. Greater integration of information on Chagas disease screening and treatment in medical and nursing education curricula can contribute to addressing this disease with the focus that its potentially fatal sequelae merit."
https://openalex.org/W3130532581,"The disease-initiating molecular events for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial retinal disease affecting many millions of elderly individuals worldwide, are still unknown. Of the over 30 risk and protective loci so far associated with AMD through whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) gene locus represents one of the most highly associated risk regions for AMD. A unique insertion/deletion (in/del) sequence located immediately upstream of the High Temperature Requirement A1 (HTRA1) gene in this region confers high risk for AMD. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we identified that two Gtf2i-β/δ transcription factor isoforms bind to the cis-element 5′- ATTAATAACC-3′ contained in this in/del sequence. The binding of these transcription factors leads to enhanced upregulation of transcription of the secretory serine protease HTRA1 in transfected cells and AMD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of Htra1 in mice using a CAG-promoter demonstrated increased blood concentration of Htra1 protein, caused upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and produced a choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-like phenotype. Finally, a comparison of 478 AMD patients to 481 healthy, age-matched controls from Japan, India, Australia, and the USA showed a statistically increased level of secreted HTRA1 blood concentration in AMD patients compared with age-matched controls. Taken together, these results suggest a common mechanism across ethnicities whereby increased systemic blood circulation of secreted serine protease HTRA1 leads to subsequent degradation of Bruch's membrane and eventual CNV in AMD.

However, the most highly associated locus is the AMD-associated linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, which stretches approximately 10.5 Kbp between the ARMS2 and HTRA1 genes on chromosome 10.

Overexpression of HTRA1 leads to ultrastructural changes in the elastic layer of Bruch’s membrane via cleavage of extracellular matrix components.PLoS One. 2011; 6e22959Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HTRA1 is a secreted serine protease known to inhibit transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) signaling, an important regulator of angiogenesis by degradation (5Yang Z. Camp N.J. Sun H. Tong Z. Gibbs D. Cameron D.J. Chen H. Zhao Y. Pearson E. Li X. Chien J. DeWan A. Harmon J. Bernstein P.S. Shridhar V. et al.A variant of the HTRA1 gene increases susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration.Science. 2006; 314: 992-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The aqueous levels of active TGF-β2 are lower in the retina of AMD patients compared with controls (20Tosi G.M. Neri G. Caldi E. Fusco F. Bacci T. Tarantello A. Nuti E. Marigliani D. Baiocchi S. Traversi C. Barbarino M. Eandi C.M. Parolini B. Mundo L. Santucci A. et al.TGF-β concentrations and activity are down-regulated in the aqueous humor of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.Sci. Rep. 2018; 88053Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and TGF-β2 knockout mice exhibit abnormal ocular morphogenesis phenotypes in the retina (21Saika S. Saika S. Liu C.Y. Azhar M. Sanford L.P. Doetschman T. Gendron R.L. Kao C.W.C. Kao W.W.Y. Tgfβ2 in corneal morphogenesis during mouse embryonic development.Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Considering the crucial roles of TGF-β2/activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/SMAD2/3 signaling in neovascularization, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of HTRA1 upregulation involving the in/del sequence is important in understanding the development of CNV in AMD. In this study, we identified the transcription factors binding to the in/del of the 3′UTR region of ARMS2. We also observed that overexpression of these transcription factors induced HTRA1 transcription in iPSCs derived from AMD patients as well as in the blood of CNV mice ubiquitously overexpressing Htra1. Further study demonstrated a significant increase of HTRA1 protein concentration in blood in both GA and CNV AMD patients carrying the in/del sequence compared with age-matched controls, indicating that AMD is also associated with an increase of blood circulating HTRA1. Isolation of in/del binding transcription factor(s) was performed by EMSA using the nuclear extract from 661W cell line (Fig. 1, A and B). Of all the listed in/del interacting proteins, multifunctional general transcription factor IIi (Gtf2i) was identified with the most number of peptide hits (Table 1). This transcription factor commonly targets the c-fos cis-element binding nucleotide sequence (22Kim D.W. Cochran B.H.

Immunol. 2009; 39: 2584-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A consensus c-fos cis-element 5′-ATTAATAACC-3′ was identified in the in/del sequence by JASPAR 2018 (Figs. 1A and S1). Gtf2i was the only transcription factor among all listed peptides, where this cis-element binding sequence was found within the in/del sequence. An anti-Gtf2i antibody was used to confirm Gtf2i binding to DNA probes 6 and 7 on the EMSA blot during western blotting (WB) that confirmed the single Gtf2i signal (Fig. 1C). The elongation factor 1 (EF1) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) isolated by non-in/del sequence DNA probes 1–5 were not detected by WB (Fig. S2). Each isoform of Gtf2i (α, β, γ, δ, ε) (26Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I: Complex formation, nuclear translocation, and differential gene regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was TA cloned and assayed for binding with in/del probes by WB (Fig. 1, D–F). Only two isoforms (Gtf2i-β and -δ) were confirmed binding to DNA probe 6 (Fig. 1G). Isoform Gtf2i-β is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in 661W cells, while isoform Gtf2i-δ is detected exclusively in the nucleus of the 661W cell line (Fig. 1H).Table 1List of in/del and

https://openalex.org/W3131631649,"Background &amp; aims Chronic abdominal pain is the primary symptom of chronic pancreatitis, but unfortunately it is difficult to treat. Vagal nerve stimulation studies have provided evidence of anti-nociceptive effect in several chronic pain conditions. We investigated the pain-relieving effects of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation in comparison to sham treatment in chronic pancreatitis patients. Methods We conducted a randomised double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover trial in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a two-week period of cervical transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation using the gammaCore device followed by a two-week sham stimulation, or vice versa. We measured clinical and experimental endpoints before and after each treatment. The primary clinical endpoint was pain relief, documented in a pain diary using a visual analogue scale. Secondary clinical endpoints included Patients’ Global Impression of Change score, quality of life and Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. Secondary experimental endpoints included cardiac vagal tone and heart rate. Results No differences in pain scores were seen in response to two weeks transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation as compared to sham treatment (difference in average pain score (visual analogue scale): 0.17, 95%CI (-0.86;1.20), P = 0.7). Similarly, no differences were seen for secondary clinical endpoints, except from an increase in the appetite loss score (13.9, 95%CI (0.5:27.3), P = 0.04). However, improvements in maximum pain scores were seen for transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation and sham treatments as compared to their respective baselines: vagal nerve stimulation (-1.3±1.7, 95%CI (-2.21:-0.42), P = 0.007), sham (-1.3±1.9, 95%CI (-2.28:-0.25), P = 0.018). Finally, heart rate was decreased after two weeks transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation in comparison to sham treatment (-3.7 beats/min, 95%CI (-6.7:-0.6), P = 0.02). Conclusion In this sham-controlled crossover study, we found no evidence that two weeks transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation induces pain relief in patients with chronic pancreatitis.

https://openalex.org/W3131792828,"Seed dispersal is a key component of the interactions between plants and animals. There is little research on the effects of lizard seed dispersal, which is more common on islands than elsewhere. In this study, the effects of the passage of Capparis spinosa seeds through Teratoscincus roborowskii lizard digestive tracts on the seed coats, water uptake rates and germination rates were investigated. In addition, the spatial patterns of fecal deposition by lizards in various microhabitats were assessed. Our results showed that the mean retention time (MRT) of mealworms was significantly longer than that of C . spinosa seeds in both adult and juvenile lizards. The defecation rate of C . spinosa tended to be lower than that of mealworms, which might be beneficial for seed dispersal. It was determined that the longer MRT of C . spinosa seeds enhanced the permeability of the seed coats, which promoted fast water uptake, broke seed dormancy and increased the seed germination rate. Furthermore, the seeds that passed through the digestive tracts of lizards were deposited in favorable germination microhabitats. By enhancing seed germination and depositing intact and viable seeds in safe potential recruitment sites, the lizard T . roborowskii acts, at least qualitatively, as an effective disperser of C . spinosa ."
https://openalex.org/W3132808663,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTb) is endemic in Bangladesh but the true prevalence has not yet been reported. Our objectives for this study were to determine the true prevalence and identify risk factors for bTb at the animal- and herd-level in Bangladesh. A total of 510 cows were randomly selected during January 2018 to December 2018. Caudal fold (CFT) and comparative cervical tuberculin tests (CCT) were serially interpreted. Animal- and herd-level risk factor data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. The hierarchical true prevalence of bTb was estimated within a Bayesian framework. The herd- and animal-level risk factors were identified using mixed effects logistic regression. The apparent prevalence of bTb was 20.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 17.3; 24.3] based on CFT. The animal-level true prevalence of bTb was 21.9 (13.0; 32.4). The herd-level true prevalence in different regions varied from 41.9% to 88.8%. The region-level true prevalence was 49.9 (13.8; 91.2). There is a 100% certainty that herds from Bhaluka and Mymensingh Sadar upazilas are not free from bTb. The odds of bTb were 3.9 times (1.2; 12.6) higher in herds having more than four cows than those with ≤ 4 cows. On the other hand, the risk of bTb was 3.3 times higher (1.0; 10.5) in non-grazing cows than grazing cows. Crossbred cows were 2.9 times (1.5; 5.9) more likely to be infected with bTb than indigenous cows. The risk of bTb in animals with cough was 2.3 times (1.2; 4.3) higher than those without cough. Crossbred, non-grazing cows with cough should be targeted for bTb surveillance. Herds of the Mymensingh, Sadar and Bhaluka regions should be emphasized for bTb control programs. Estimation of Bayesian hierarchical true prevalence facilitates identification of areas with higher prevalence and can be used to indicate regions that where true prevalence exceeds a pre-specified critical threshold."
https://openalex.org/W3132960476,"Denervation reduces the abundance of Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA) in skeletal muscle, while reinnervation increases it. Primary human skeletal muscle cells, the most widely used model to study human skeletal muscle in vitro , are usually cultured as myoblasts or myotubes without neurons and typically do not contract spontaneously, which might affect their ability to express and regulate NKA. We determined how differentiation, de novo innervation, and electrical pulse stimulation affect expression of NKA (α and β) subunits and NKA regulators FXYD1 (phospholemman) and FXYD5 (dysadherin). Differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes under low serum conditions increased expression of myogenic markers CD56 (NCAM1), desmin, myosin heavy chains, dihydropyridine receptor subunit α 1S , and SERCA2 as well as NKAα2 and FXYD1, while it decreased expression of FXYD5 mRNA. Myotubes, which were innervated de novo by motor neurons in co-culture with the embryonic rat spinal cord explants, started to contract spontaneously within 7–10 days. A short-term co-culture (10–11 days) promoted mRNA expression of myokines, such as IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-15, but did not affect mRNA expression of NKA, FXYDs, or myokines, such as musclin, cathepsin B, meteorin-like protein, or SPARC. A long-term co-culture (21 days) increased the protein abundance of NKAα1, NKAα2, FXYD1, and phospho-FXYD1 Ser68 without attendant changes in mRNA levels. Suppression of neuromuscular transmission with α-bungarotoxin or tubocurarine for 24 h did not alter NKA or FXYD mRNA expression. Electrical pulse stimulation (48 h) of non-innervated myotubes promoted mRNA expression of NKAβ2, NKAβ3, FXYD1, and FXYD5. In conclusion, low serum concentration promotes NKAα2 and FXYD1 expression, while de novo innervation is not essential for upregulation of NKAα2 and FXYD1 mRNA in cultured myotubes. Finally, although innervation and EPS both stimulate contractions of myotubes, they exert distinct effects on the expression of NKA and FXYDs."

The dysfunctional activity of DC-SIGN receptor because of missense SNPs can lead to cause dengue haemorrhage fever, HIV-1 infection etc. Out of 11 transcripts of CD209, all missense SNPs of canonical transcript were retrieved from Ensembl database and evaluated by their deleteriousness by using Polyphen-2, PMut, SIFT, MutPred, PROVEAN and PhD-SNP together with stimulation of its complete 3D structure. 10 nsSNPs were chosen depending on both the significance value of nsSNP and their prediction among SNPs evaluating servers which are based on different algorithms. Moreover, the position and native role of 10 nsSNPs in wild 3D model has been described which assist to acknowledge their importance. This study urges the researcher's community to experimentally validate these SNPs and their association in causing the diseases like dengue fever, Tuberculosis etc."
https://openalex.org/W3130360934,"The prevalence of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is gradually increasing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming increasingly common as a modality used to diagnose TMD. Edema and osteonecrosis in the bone marrow of the mandibular condyle have been considered to be precursors of osteoarthritis, but these changes are not evaluated accurately and quantitatively on routine MRI. The iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL-IQ) method, as a cutting-edge MRI technique, can separate fat and water using three asymmetric echo times and the three-point Dixon method. The purpose of this study was to analyze the quantitative fat fraction (FF) in the mandibular condyle head using the IDEAL-IQ method. Seventy-nine people who underwent MRI using IDEAL-IQ were investigated and divided into 1) the control group, without TMD symptoms, and 2) the TMD group, with unilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. In both groups, the FF of the condyle head in the TMJ was analyzed by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. In the TMD group, 29 people underwent cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and the presence or absence of bony changes in the condylar head was evaluated. The FF measurements of the condyle head using IDEAL-IQ showed excellent inter-observer and intra-observer agreement. The average FF of the TMD group was significantly lower than that of the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). In the TMD group, the average FF values of joints with pain and joints with bony changes were significantly lower than those of joints without pain or bony changes, respectively ( p &lt; 0.05). The FF using IDEAL-IQ in the TMJ can be helpful for the quantitative diagnosis of TMD."
https://openalex.org/W3130799811,"Introduction Development of white spot lesions (WSLs) during orthodontic treatment is a common risk factor. Fixation of the orthodontic appliances with glass ionomer cements could reduce the prevalence of WSL’s due to their fluoride release capacities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of fluoride release properties from resin-modified and conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs). Methods The resin-modified GICs Fuji ORTHO LC (GC Orthodontics), Meron Plus QM (VOCO), as well as the conventional GICs Fuji ORTHO (GC Orthodontics), Meron (VOCO) and Ketac Cem Easymix (3M ESPE) were tested in this study. The different types of GICs were applied to hydroxyapatite discs according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored in a solution of TISAB III (Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer III) and fluoride-free water at 37°C. Fluoride measurements were made after 5 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, 14 days, 28 days, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months. One factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the overall comparison of the cumulative fluoride release (from measurement times of 5 minutes to 6 months) between the different materials with the overall level of significance set to 0.05. Tukey’s post hoc test was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons in the cumulative fluoride release between the different materials. Results The cumulative fluoride release (mean ± sd) in descending order was: Fuji ORTHO LC (221.7 ± 10.29 ppm), Fuji ORTHO (191.5 ± 15.03 ppm), Meron Plus QM (173.0 ± 5.89 ppm), Meron (161.3 ± 7.84 ppm) and Ketac Cem Easymix (154.6 ± 6.09 ppm) within 6 months. Analysis of variance detected a significant difference in the cumulative fluoride release between at least two of the materials (rounded p-value &lt; 0.001). Pairwise analysis with Tukey’s post hoc test showed a significant difference in the cumulative fluoride release for all the comparisons except M and MPQM (p = 0.061) and KCE and M (p = 0.517). Conclusion Fluoride ions were released cumulatively over the entire test period for all products. When comparing the two products from the same company (Fuji ORTHO LC vs. Fuji ORTHO from GC Orthodontics Europe GmbH and Meron Plus QM vs. Meron from VOCO GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), it can be said that the resin-modified GICs have a higher release than conventional GICs. The highest individual fluoride release of all GICs was at 24 hours. A general statement, whether resin-modified or conventional GICs have a higher release of fluoride cannot be made."
https://openalex.org/W3131110002,"In study, it was aimed to determine the stress effects that can be caused by transporting and altitude in sheep. Karayaka sheeps were used in the study. Karayaka sheeps are a valuable breed of meat quality and fleece, which is raised in the Black Sea region. The live weight of the sheep (n = 30) while hungry was determined before transport and sea level. Average live weight was determined as 55.64 ± 4.66 kg. Blood samples were collected just before (sea level) and just after transport (1500 meters above sea level). Transportation distance was approximately 182 km and duration was 5 hours. According to the findings, cortisol was not affected by transport stress and altitude (P&gt;0.05) and Triiyodotironin (T3) (P&lt;0.039) and Tyrosine (T4) (P&lt;0.000) were affected significantly. Malondialchehyche (MDA), which is one of the oxidative stress parameters, was significantly affected (P&lt;0.039) and Protein Carbonyl (PC) values were not affected by transport and altitude (P&gt;0.184). As a result of this study, it was determined that transportation and altitude in sheep causes stress. Stress-reducing measures should be taken in the exposure of sheep to altitude differences and in transportation. Antioxidant nutritional supplements should be made in order not to negatively affect the meat quality in sheep."
https://openalex.org/W3132853463,"Study objectives Although associations between sleep quality and environmental factors and nutrient intake have been reported, interactions between these factors have not been elucidated in detail. Therefore, this cross-sectional study examined the effects of regular exercise and nutrient intake on sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is the most frequently used index for sleep evaluation. Methods The participants included 378 individuals aged 40 years or older living in Shika Town, Ishikawa Prefecture. Of these individuals, 185 met the inclusion criteria. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing lifestyle habits and frequency and duration of exercise, the PSQI, and the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) on nutrient intake. Results A two-way analysis of covariance on regular exercise and PSQI scores indicated that protein intake (17.13% of energy) was significantly higher in the regular exercise and PSQI ≤10 groups than in the non-regular exercise or PSQI ≥11 groups ( p = 0.002). In a multiple logistic regression analysis with PSQI scores (≤10 and ≥11), protein intake was a significant independent variable in any of the models adjusted for confounding factors such as age, sex, body mass index, current smoker, and current drinker (OR: 1.357, 95% CI: 1.081, 1.704, p = 0.009) in the regular exercise group but not in the non-regular exercise group. Conclusions We identified a positive relationship between sleep quality and protein intake in the regular exercise group. These findings suggest that regular exercise at least twice a week for 30 minutes or longer combined with high protein intake contributes to good sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W3133478664,"Thermoregulation is critical for ectotherms as it allows them to maintain their body temperature close to an optimum for ecological performance. Thermoregulation includes a range of behaviors that aim at regulating body temperature within a range centered around the thermal preference. Thermal preference is typically measured in a thermal gradient in fully-hydrated and post-absorptive animals. Short-term effects of the hydric environment on thermal preferences in such set-ups have been rarely quantified in dry-skinned ectotherms, despite accumulating evidence that dehydration might trade-off with behavioral thermoregulation. Using experiments performed under controlled conditions in climatic chambers, we demonstrate that thermal preferences of a ground-dwelling, actively foraging lizard ( Zootoca vivipara ) are weakly decreased by a daily restriction in free-standing water availability (less than 0.5°C contrast). The influence of air humidity during the day on thermal preferences depends on time of the day and sex of the lizard, and is generally weaker than those of of free-standing water (less than 1°C contrast). This shows that short-term dehydration can influence, albeit weakly, thermal preferences under some circumstances in this species. Environmental humidity conditions are important methodological factors to consider in the analysis of thermal preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3129491123,"Younger age at menarche (AAM) is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) for young women. Considering that continuous trends in decreasing AAM and increasing BMI are found in many countries, we attempted to assess whether the observed negative association between AAM and young adult BMI is causal. We included 4,093 women from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) and Healthy twin Study (HTS) with relevant epidemiologic data and genome-wide marker information. To mitigate the remarkable differences in AAM across generations, we converted the AAM to a generation-standardized AAM (gsAAM). To test causality, we applied the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, using a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 14 AAM-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We constructed MR models adjusting for education level and validated the results using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outliers test (MR-PRESSO), and MR-Egger regression methods. We found a null association using observed AAM and BMI level (conventional regression; -0.05 [95% CIs -0.10–0.00] per 1-year higher AAM). This null association was replicated when gsAAM was applied instead of AAM. Using the two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach employing a univariate GRS, the association was also negated for both AAM and gsAAM, regardless of model specifications. All the MR diagnostics suggested statistically insignificant associations, but weakly negative trends, without evidence of confounding from pleiotropy. We did not observe a causal association between AAM and young adult BMI whether we considered the birth cohort effect or not. Our study alone does not exclude the possibility of existing a weak negative association, considering the modest power of our study design."
https://openalex.org/W3130338821,"Purpose To study a robust and reproducible procedure to investigate a relation between focal brain radiotherapy (RT) low doses, neurocognitive impairment and late White Matter and Gray Matter alterations, as shown by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), in children. Methods and materials Forty-five patients (23 males and 22 females, median age at RT 6.2 years, median age at evaluations 11.1 years) who had received focal RT for brain tumors were recruited for DTI exams and neurocognitive tests. Patients’ brains were parceled in 116 regions of interest (ROIs) using an available segmented atlas. After the development of an ad hoc, home-made, multimodal and highly deformable registration framework, we collected mean RT doses and DTI metrics values for each ROI. The pattern of association between cognitive scores or domains and dose or DTI values was assessed in each ROI through both considering and excluding ROIs with mean doses higher than 75% of the prescription. Subsequently, a preliminary threshold value of dose discriminating patients with and without neurocognitive impairment was selected for the most relevant associations. Results The workflow allowed us to identify 10 ROIs where RT dose and DTI metrics were significantly associated with cognitive tests results (p&lt;0.05). In 5/10 ROIs, RT dose and cognitive tests were associated with p&lt;0.01 and preliminary RT threshold dose values, implying a possible cognitive or neuropsychological damage, were calculated. The analysis of domains showed that the most involved one was the “school-related activities”. Conclusion This analysis, despite being conducted on a retrospective cohort of children, shows that the identification of critical brain structures and respective radiation dose thresholds is achievable by combining, with appropriate methodological tools, the large amount of data arising from different sources. This supported the design of a prospective study to gain stronger evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3131668151,"Incivilities are pervasive among workers in healthcare institutions. Previously identified effects include deterioration of employee physical and mental health, absenteeism, burnout, and turnover, as well as reduced patient safety and quality of care. This study documented factors related to organizational civility at an academic health sciences center (AHSC) as the basis for future intervention work. We used a cross-sectional research design to conduct an online survey at four of five campuses of an AHSC. Using the Organizational Civility Scale (OCS), we assessed differences across gender, race (White and non-White) and job type (faculty or staff) in the eleven subscales (frequency of incivility, perceptions of organizational climate, existence of civility resources, importance of civility resources, feelings about current employment, employee satisfaction, sources of stress, coping strategies, overall levels of stress/coping ability, and overall civility rating). Significant gender differences were found in six of the eleven subscales: perception of organizational climate ( p &lt; .001), existence of civility resources ( p = .001), importance of civility resources ( p &lt; .001), frequency of incivilities ( p &lt; .001), employee satisfaction ( p = .002), and overall civility rating ( p = .007). Significant differences between respondents by self-identified race were found only in one subscale: existence of civility resources ( p = .048). Significant differences were found between faculty and staff in four subscales: perception of organizational climate ( p = .001), importance of civility resources ( p = .02), employee satisfaction ( p = .01), and overall levels of stress ( p = .03). Results suggest that gender and employment type differences exist in the perception of organizational climate at the academic health center, while significant racial differences only occurred in reference to reported existence of civility resources. Attention to these differences should be incorporated into the development of programs to address the problem."
https://openalex.org/W3131940854,"Background The handling of unknown weights, which is common in daily routines either at work or during leisure time, is suspected to be highly associated with the incidence of low back pain (LBP). Objectives To investigate the effects of knowledge and magnitude of a load (to be lifted) on brain responses, autonomic nervous activity, and trapezius and erector spinae muscle activity. Methods A randomized, within-subjects experiment involving manual lifting was conducted, wherein 10 participants lifted three different weights (1.1, 5, and 15 kg) under two conditions: either having or not having prior knowledge of the weight to be lifted. Results The results revealed that the lifting of unknown weights caused increased average heart rate and percentage of maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC) but decreased average inter-beat interval, very-low-frequency power, low-frequency power, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio. Regardless of the weight magnitude, lifting of unknown weights was associated with smaller theta activities in the power spectrum density (PSD) of the central region, smaller alpha activities in the PSD of the frontal region, and smaller beta activities in the PSDs of both the frontal and central regions. Moreover, smaller alpha and beta activities in the PSD of the parietal region were associated only with lifting of unknown lightweights. Conclusions Uncertainty regarding the weight to be lifted could be considered as a stress-adding variable that may increase the required physical demand to be sustained during manual lifting tasks. The findings of this study stress the importance of eliminating uncertainty associated with handling unknown weights, such as in the cases of handling patients and dispatching luggage. This can be achieved through preliminary self-sensing of the load to be lifted, or the cautious disclosure of the actual weight of manually lifted objects, for example, through clear labeling and/or a coding system."
https://openalex.org/W3133246358,"Avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV) is associated with hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome, big liver and spleen disease and hepatic rupture haemorrhage syndrome. However, the knowledge about aHEV in commercial layer chickens in Nigeria is scarce. In this study, 460 serum samples obtained from 36 apparently healthy commercial layer chicken flocks in three states (Ogun, Osun and Oyo States) of southwestern Nigeria were analysed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of anti-aHEV immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies. In total, the overall seroprevalence of anti-aHEV antibodies was 14.6%. The serological analysis revealed that 75% of the flocks examined were positive for anti-aHEV IgY antibodies from chickens of various ages in all three states. The percentage of the seropositive chickens in the three states varied from flock to flock ranging from 60% to 88.8% and seropositive chickens were detected at any age (24–52 weeks of age) without significant differences between the age groups. This is the first report assessing the presence of aHEV antibodies in chickens from Nigeria. The detection of anti-aHEV antibodies in commercial layer chickens in this study emphasizes the importance of serosurveillance in disease monitoring due to the economic threat posed by aHEV as a result of decreased egg production and increased mortality in affected commercial layer chicken farms. However, further studies are essential to reveal the clinical implications and to assess the real burden of aHEV in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3129425871,"Introduction The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of vaccination of infants with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children under 5 years of age in the Czech Republic. Material and methods The present study includes all IPD cases reported in children aged 0–4 years within the surveillance program in 2007–2017. The impact of PCV is analysed for five categories of IPD: cases caused by all serotypes, cases caused by PCV7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F), cases caused by three additional PCV10 serotypes (1, 5, and 7F), cases caused by three additional PCV13 serotypes (3, 6A, and 19A), and cases caused by non-PCV serotypes. To assess the impact of PCV, the study period was divided into the pre-vaccination period 2007–2008 and post-vaccination period 2009–2017, which was divided into three three-year parts: 2009–2011, 2012–2014, and 2015–2017. Analysis of differences between periods was based on the Poisson regression model where the population numbers were handled as an offset. Results The annual incidence of IPD in children under 5 years of age caused by all serotypes has had a downward trend since 2007: it dropped from 8.52/100 000 in 2007 to 2.67/100 000 in 2017, with slight increases in 2010 and 2013. All three post-vaccination periods show significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) incidences in comparison to the pre-vaccination period, but they do not statistically significantly differ from each other. Conclusions IPD surveillance data in the Czech Republic show that after the introduction of PCV vaccination of infants, there has been a significant decrease in the IPD incidence of children under 5 years of age. Continued IPD surveillance is essential to monitor for possible post-vaccination serotype replacement."
https://openalex.org/W3130196709,"Autophagy plays a critical role in plant heat tolerance in part by targeting heat-induced nonnative proteins for degradation. Autophagy also regulates metabolism, signaling and other processes and it is less understood how the broad function of autophagy affects plant heat stress responses. To address this issue, we performed transcriptome profiling of Arabidopsis wild-type and autophagy-deficient atg5 mutant in response to heat stress. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between wild-type and atg5 mutant even under normal conditions. These DEGs are involved not only in metabolism, hormone signaling, stress responses but also in regulation of nucleotide processing and DNA repair. Intriguingly, we found that heat treatment resulted in more robust changes in gene expression in wild-type than in the atg5 mutant plants. The dampening effect of autophagy deficiency on heat-regulated gene expression was associated with already altered expression of many heat-regulated DEGs prior to heat stress in the atg5 mutant. Altered expression of a large number of genes involved in metabolism and signaling in the autophagy mutant prior to heat stress may affect plant response to heat stress. Furthermore, autophagy played a positive role in the expression of defense- and stress-related genes during the early stage of heat stress responses but had little effect on heat-induced expression of heat shock genes. Taken together, these results indicate that the broad role of autophagy in metabolism, cellular homeostasis and other processes can also potentially affect plant heat stress responses and heat tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3133096998,"Angiogenesis plays an essential role in many pathological processes such as tumor growth, wound healing, and keloid development. Low oxygen level is the main driving stimulus for angiogenesis. In an animal tissue, the oxygen level is mainly determined by three effects—the oxygen delivery through blood flow in a refined vessel network, the oxygen diffusion from blood to tissue, and the oxygen consumption in cells. Evaluation of the oxygen field is usually the bottleneck in large scale modeling and simulation of angiogenesis and related physiological processes. In this work, a fast numerical method is developed for the simulation of oxygen supply in tissue with a large-scale complex vessel network. This method employs an implicit finite-difference scheme to compute the oxygen field. By virtue of an oxygen source distribution technique from vessel center lines to mesh points and a corresponding post-processing technique that eliminate the local numerical error induced by source distribution, square mesh with relatively large mesh sizes can be applied while sufficient numerical accuracy is maintained. The new method has computational complexity which is slightly higher than linear with respect to the number of mesh points and has a convergence order which is slightly lower than second order with respect to the mesh size. With this new method, accurate evaluation of the oxygen field in a fully vascularized tissue on the scale of centimeter becomes possible."
https://openalex.org/W3130334779,"Background Critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock could benefit from ventricular assist device support using the Impella microaxial blood pump. However, recent studies suggested Impella not to improve outcomes. We, therefore, evaluated outcomes and predictors in a real-world scenario. Methods In this retrospective single-center trial, 125 patients suffering from cardiac arrest/cardiogenic shock between 2008 and 2018 were analyzed. 93 Patients had a prior successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary endpoint was hospital mortality. Associations of covariates with the primary endpoint were assessed by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and optimal cut-offs (using Youden index) were obtained. Results Hospital mortality was high (81%). Baseline lactate was 4.7mmol/L [IQR = 7.1mmol/L]. In multivariable logistic regression, only age (aOR 1.13 95%CI 1.06–1.20; p&lt;0.001) and lactate (aOR 1.23 95%CI 1.004–1.516; p = 0.046) were associated with hospital mortality, and the respective optimal cut-offs were &gt;3.3mmol/L and age &gt;66 years. Patients were retrospectively stratified into three risk groups: Patients aged ≤66 years and lactate ≤3.3mmol (low-risk; n = 22); patients aged &gt;66 years or lactate &gt;3.3mmol/L (medium-risk; n = 52); and patients both aged &gt;66 years and lactate &gt;3.3mmol/L (high-risk, n = 51). Risk of death increased from 41% in the low-risk group, to 79% in the medium risk group and 100% in the high-risk group. The predictive abilities of this model were high (AUC 0.84; 95% 0.77–0.92). Conclusion Mortality was high in this real-world collective of severely ill cardiogenic shock patients. Better patient selection is warranted to avoid unethical use of Impella. Age and lactate might help to improve patient selection."
https://openalex.org/W3130940828,"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae are a major global threat in healthcare facilities. The propagation of carbapenem resistance determinants can occur through vertical transmission, with genetic elements being transmitted by the host bacterium, or by horizontal transmission, with the same genetic elements being transferred among distinct bacterial hosts. This work aimed to track carbapenem resistance transmission by K . pneumoniae in a healthcare facility. The study involved a polyphasic approach based on conjugation assays, resistance phenotype and genotype analyses, whole genome sequencing, and plasmid characterization by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and optical DNA mapping. Out of 40 K . pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered over two years, five were carbapenem- and multidrug-resistant and belonged to multilocus sequence type ST147. These isolates harboured the carbapenemase encoding bla KPC-3 gene, integrated in conjugative plasmids of 140 kbp or 55 kbp, belonging to replicon types incFIA/incFIIK or incN/incFIIK, respectively. The two distinct plasmids encoding the bla KPC-3 gene were associated with distinct genetic lineages, as confirmed by optical DNA mapping and whole genome sequence analyses. These results suggested vertical (bacterial strain-based) transmission of the carbapenem-resistance genetic elements. Determination of the mode of transmission of antibiotic resistance in healthcare facilities, only possible based on polyphasic approaches as described here, is essential to control resistance propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3131759210,"Internet of Things (IoT) is the growing invention in the current development of different domains like industries, e-health, and education, etc. Semantic web of things (SWoT) is an extension of IoT that enhance the communication by behaving intelligently. SWoT comprises 7 layered architecture. The perception layer is an important layer for collecting data from devices and to communicate with its associated layer. The data loss at the perception layer is very common due to inadequate resources, unpredictable link, noise, collision, and unexpected damage. To address this problem, we propose a method based on Compressive Sensing which recovers and estimates sensory data from a low-rank structure. The contribution of this paper is three folds. Firstly, we determine the problem of data acquisition and data loss at semantic sensory nodes in SWoT. Secondly, we introduce a compressive sensing based framework for SWoT that recovers the data accurately using low-rank features. Thirdly, the data estimation method is utilized to reduce the volume of the data. Proposed Compressive Sensing based Data Recoverability and Estimation (CS-RE) method is evaluated and compared with the existing reconstruction methods. The simulation results on real sensory datasets depict that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of error ratio and data recoverability accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3130121230,"Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and is therefore considered to be an important ALS drug target. Identifying potential drug leads that bind to SOD1 and characterizing their interactions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is complicated by the fact that SOD1 is a homodimer. Creating a monomeric version of SOD1 could alleviate these issues. A specially designed monomeric form of human superoxide dismutase (T2M4SOD1) was cloned into E . coli and its expression significantly enhanced using a number of novel DNA sequence, leader peptide and growth condition optimizations. Uniformly 15 N-labeled T2M4SOD1 was prepared from minimal media using 15 NH 4 Cl as the 15 N source. The T2M4SOD1 monomer (both 15 N labeled and unlabeled) was correctly folded as confirmed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and active as confirmed by an in-gel enzymatic assay. To demonstrate the utility of this new SOD1 expression system for NMR-based drug screening, eight pyrimidine compounds were tested for binding to T2M4SOD1 by monitoring changes in their 1 H NMR and/or 19 F-NMR spectra. Weak binding to 5-fluorouridine (FUrd) was observed via line broadening, but very minimal spectral changes were seen with uridine, 5-bromouridine or trifluridine. On the other hand, 1 H-NMR spectra of T2M4SOD1 with uracil or three halogenated derivatives of uracil changed dramatically suggesting that the pyrimidine moiety is the crucial binding component of FUrd. Interestingly, no change in tryptophan 32 (Trp32), the putative receptor for FUrd, was detected in the 15 N-NMR spectra of 15 N-T2M4SOD1 when mixed with these uracil analogs. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) studies indicate that interaction with Trp32 of SOD1 is predicted to be weak and that there was hydrogen bonding with the nearby aspartate (Asp96), potentiating the Trp32-uracil interaction. These studies demonstrate that monomeric T2M4SOD1 can be readily used to explore small molecule interactions via NMR."
https://openalex.org/W3131321530,"Influenza virus mutates quickly and unpredictably creating emerging pathogenic strains that are difficult to detect, diagnose, and characterize. Conventional tools to study and characterize virus, such as next generation sequencing, genome amplification (RT-PCR), and serological antibody testing, are not adequately suited to rapidly mutating pathogens like Influenza virus where the success of infection heavily depends on the phenotypic expression of surface glycoproteins. Bridging the gap between genome and pathogenic expression remains a challenge. Using sialic acid as a universal Influenza virus binding receptor, a novel virus avidin-biotin complex-based capture coating was developed and characterized that may be used to create future diagnostic and interrogation platforms for viable whole Influenza virus. First, fluorescent FITC probe studies were used to optimize coating component concentrations. Then atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to profile the surface characteristics of the novel capture coating, acquire topographical imaging of Influenza particles immobilized by the coating, and calculate the capture efficiency of the coating (over 90%) for all four representative human Influenza virus strains tested."
https://openalex.org/W3132561741,"Prolactin is a peptide hormone produced in the anterior pituitary, which increase in several physiological and pathological situations. It is unclear if hyperprolactinaemia may affect glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Twenty-five patients with hyperprolactinemia and 22 healthy control subjects were included in the study. The groups had similar age and gender distribution. A panel of hormonal and haematological analyses, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes and immunoglobulins were measured by routine clinical methods. IgG was purified from serum by Protein G Sepharose. Sialic acid was released from IgG by use of neuraminidase followed by quantification on high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Tryptic glycopeptides of IgG was analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Hormone and immunoglobulin levels were similar in the two groups, except for IgA and prolactin. Significantly higher IgG1 and IgG2/3 galactosylation was found in the patient group with hyperprolactinaemia compared to controls. (A significant correlation between prolactin and IgG2/3 galactosylation (Rs 0.61, p&lt;0.001) was found for samples with prolactin values below 2000 mIU/L. The relative amount of sialylated and bisecting glycans on IgG did not differ between patients and controls. The four macroprolactinaemic patients showed decreased relative amount of bisecting IgG2/3 glycans. Hyperprolactinaemia was found to be associated with increased galactosylation of IgG1and IgG2/3. This may have impact on IgG interactions with Fc-receptors, complement and lectins, and consequently lead to an altered immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3132586658,"While several areas in the United States have asked nurses and physicians who are not in the labor force to return to help with the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the characteristics of these clinicians that may present barriers to returning. We studied age, disability, and household composition of clinicians not in the workforce using the American Community Survey from 2014 to 2018, a nationally-representative survey of US households administered by the US Census. Overall, we found that, for nurses and physicians not in the labor force, over three-quarters were 55 and over and about 15 percent had a disability. For female nurses and physicians not in the labor force, over half of those ages 20–54 had a child under 15 at home and over half of those ages 65+ had another adult 65 and over at home. These characteristics may present challenges and risks to returning."
https://openalex.org/W3133060278,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dispensing is strongly associated with treatment adherence. Among illicit drug-using populations, whom experience greater structural barriers to adherence, directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAAT) is often regarded as a stronger predictor of optimal adherence over self-administered medications. In Vancouver, Canada, people living with HIV (PLHIV) who use drugs and live in low-income housing are a critical population for treatment support. This group is typically able to access two key DAAT models, daily delivery and daily pickup, in addition to ART self-administration. This ethno-epidemiological qualitative study explores how key dispensing models impact ART adherence among PLHIV who use drugs living in low-income housing, and how this is framed by structural vulnerability. Semi-structured interviews lasting 30-45 minutes were conducted between February and May 2018 with 31 PLHIV who use drugs recruited from an ongoing prospective cohort of PLHIV who use drugs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using QSR International's NVivo 12 software. Interviews focused on housing, drug use, and HIV management. Models that constrained agency were found to have negative impacts on adherence and quality of life. Treatment interruptions were framed by structural vulnerabilities (e.g., housing vulnerability) that impacted ability to maintain adherence under certain dispensing models, and led participants to consider other models. Participants using DAAT models which accounted for their structural vulnerabilities (e.g., mobility issues, housing instability), credited these models for their treatment adherence, but also acknowledged factors that constrained agency, and the negative impacts this could have on both adherence, and quality of life. Being able to integrate ART into an established routine is key to supporting ART adherence. ART models that account for the structural vulnerability of PLHIV who use drugs and live in low-income housing are necessary and housing-based supports could be critical, but the impacts of such models on agency must be considered to ensure optimal adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3130525101,"This research investigated the spatial association between socioenvironmental factors and gastroschisis in Brazilian triple side border. A geographic analysis for gastroschisis prevalence was performed considering census sector units using Global Moran Index, Local Indicator of Spatial Association Analysis and Getis Ord statistics. Sociodemographic factors included rate of adolescent and parturients over 35 years; population with no income and above 5 minimum wages; rate of late prenatal; and proximity to power transmission lines. Logistic regression models were applied to verify the association between socio-environmental factors and prevalence of gastroschisis. No global spatial correlation was observed in the distribution of gastroschisis (Moran´s I = 0.006; p = 0.319). However, multiple logistic regression showed census sectors with positive cases had higher probability to power transmission lines proximity (OR 3,47; CI 95% 1,11–10,79; p = 0,031). Yet, spatial scan statistic showed low risk for gastroschisis in southern city region (OR = 0; p = 0.035) in opposite to power transmission lines location. The study design does not allow us to attest the causality between power transmission lines and gastroschisis but these findings support the potential exposure risk of pregnant to electromagnetic fields."
