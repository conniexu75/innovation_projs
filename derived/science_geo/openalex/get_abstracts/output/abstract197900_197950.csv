The isolation and recognition in recent years of 97 per cent of the proteins of bovine skim milk as specific chemical and biological entities (1) have made it possible now to determine which of these proteins are synthesized in the mammary gland. Various investigators (2-7) have shown with several species that intravenously injected radioactive precursors are incorporated rapidly into the milk proteins in the lactating mammary gland. Proteins synthesized in the gland and removed periodically by the milking process contain a notably higher level of activity up to 24 hours than proteins synthesized elsewhere and diluted by an existing protein pool. Black and Kleiber (5) have shown, with the aid of carbonate-CY4, that in the cow in the early hours it is chiefly the non-essential amino acids which incorporate the activity. Campbell and Work (2) and Askonas et al. (3) found with the rabbit and the goat that the total casein isolated from milk taken within a few hours after the intravenous administration of radioactive amino acids contains a higher level of activity than the total whey proteins. On the assumption that all of the casein was synthesized in the gland, this result was interpreted to indicate that some, at least, of the whey proteins must have a different origin. Part of the difference was accounted for by the immune globulins’ which apparently enter the gland in a bound state from the blood, probably as the intact protein (6). Askonas et al. (7) subse-"

Among the techniques used for disrupting mitochondria have been ultrasonic disintegration, freezing-thawing, dispersion with a variety of chemical agents, and variations in pH values. Although slight oxidative phosphorylation (low P:O) was sometimes achieved (a), such treatment preserved only the oxidative portion of the system. Cooper and Lehninger (1) recently obtained a lipoprotein complex from digitonin extracts of rat liver mitochondria which was considerably more active than intact mitochondria on a weight basis. The present study describes a multienzyme preparation from rat brain mitochondria which is similar to Cooper and Lehninger’s Fraction P-l (1) in many respects, but at the same time exhibits certain distinct differences. After work with a variety of dispersing agents, including digitonin, it was found that the detergent Tritonl yielded the most active and consistent preparations. In addition to oxidizing such substrates as pyruvate and glutamate, the submitochondrial fraction from rat brain yields P: 0 ratios closely approaching those of intact mitochondria."
