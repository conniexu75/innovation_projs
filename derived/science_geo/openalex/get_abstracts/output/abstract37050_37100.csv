https://openalex.org/W2098862614,"Glycosphingolipids added exogenously to 3T3 cells in culture were shown to inhibit cell growth, alter the membrane affinity to platelet-derived growth factor binding, and reduce platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated membrane phosphorylation (Bremer, E., Hakomori, S., Bowen-Pope, D. F., Raines, E., and Ross, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6818-6825). This approach has been extended to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor of human epidermoid carcinoma cell lines KB and A431. GM3 and GM1 gangliosides inhibited both KB cell and A431 cell growth, although GM3 was a much stronger inhibitor of both KB and A431 cell growth. Neither GM3 nor GM1 had any affect on the binding of 125I-EGF to its cell surface receptor. However, GM3 and, to a much lower extent, GM1 were capable of inhibiting EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in membrane preparations of both KB and A431 cells. Further characterization of GM3-sensitive receptor phosphorylation was performed in A431 cells, which had a higher content of the EGF receptor. The following results were of particular interest. (i) EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and its inhibition by GM3 were also demonstrated on isolated EGF receptor after adsorption on the anti-receptor antibody-Sepharose complex, and the receptor phosphorylation was enhanced on addition of phosphatidylethanolamine. (ii) Phosphoamino acid analysis of the EGF receptor indicated that the reduction of phosphorylation induced by GM3 was entirely in the phosphotyrosine and not in the phosphoserine nor phosphothreonine content. (iii) The inhibitory effect of GM3 on EGF-dependent receptor phosphorylation could be reproduced in membranes isolated from A431 cells that had been cultured in medium containing 50 nmol/ml GM3 to effect cell growth inhibition. The membrane fraction isolated from such growth-arrested cells was found to be less responsive to EGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation. These results suggest that membrane lipids, especially GM3, can modulate EGF receptor phosphorylation in vitro as well as in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2012383791,"Transcription from the c-fos promoter and from minimal promoter constructs carrying the phorbol ester-responsive element [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) responsive element (TRE)] corresponding to the sequence in the human collagenase gene is activated by elevated levels of the oncogene products v-src, c-Ha-ras, activated c-Ha-ras, and v-mos, as well as by phorbol ester. Elevated c- or v-fos expression stimulates TRE-dependent transcription but represses the c-fos promoter. Antisense fos sequences abolish basal and induced transcription from TRE constructs and derepress the c-fos promoter. These results establish a key role for fos in signal transduction and implicate the fos protein as a trans-activating and -repressing molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1520012696,"The developmental expression of the multiple isozymes of Na,K-ATPase in rat brain, heart, lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle from fetal (14 days gestation) to adult (55 days) was investigated at the molecular level with cDNA probes specific for the multiple catalytic alpha isoform (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3) and beta subunit mRNAs. Northern and RNA slot blot analyses revealed that these mRNAs are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The multiple alpha isoform and beta subunit mRNAs appear to be regulated coordinately during ontogenesis with maximum expression occurring between 15 and 25 days of age for brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, whereas peak expression in lung was observed between 2 and 4 days of neonatal life. Brain tissue showed between 10- and 17-fold increases in the levels of expression for the three individual alpha isoform mRNAs. The alpha 3 mRNA was found to be the predominant alpha isoform transcript in fetal as well as adult brain. Examination of heart tissue showed alpha 1 mRNA to be the major catalytic subunit during development. However, a developmentally regulated transition in alpha 2 and alpha 3 mRNA expression was observed in heart between 7 and 14 days after birth. The alpha 3 mRNA was expressed primarily in fetal and neonatal heart tissue, while alpha 2 mRNA was expressed in juvenile and adult tissue. In kidney and lung, alpha 1 mRNA was the predominant alpha isoform transcript showing temporary increases in expression of 2- and 4-fold, respectively, during development. In contrast to the other tissues, muscle expressed predominantly alpha 2 mRNA following birth, the levels increasing approximately 89-fold during myogenesis. Thus, each tissue examined exhibits a distinct pattern of expression for the Na,K-ATPase catalytic alpha isoforms during ontogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2104062445,"The rise in cytosolic free Ca2+, shape change, superoxide formation, and granule exocytosis induced in human neutrophils by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and by a newly discovered activating peptide, neutrophil-activating factor, termed NAF, were compared. NAF was effective in the concentration range of 0.1-10 nM and was 10-to 100-fold more potent than fMLP. In qualitative terms, the single responses to either stimulus were remarkably similar: they showed virtually identical onset and initial kinetics, and were all inhibited by pretreatment of the neutrophils with Bordetella pertussis toxin. In addition, the respiratory burst elicited by either stimulus was inhibited by 17-hydroxywortmannin and staurosporine. Two conclusions are drawn from these results: 1) neutrophil activation by NAF (as by fMLP) is dependent on a GTP-binding protein and on protein kinase C; 2) a similar, or even identical, mechanism of signal transduction must be assumed on stimulation of human neutrophils with NAF, fMLP, and other chemotactic agonists. Human monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets did not show cytosolic free Ca2+ changes when exposed to NAF, which suggests that NAF is selective for the neutrophils.— Thelen, M.; Peveri, P.; Kernen, P.; von Tscharner, V; Walz, A.; Baggiolini, M.

https://openalex.org/W1967419673,"Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants indicate that neither topoisomerase I nor II appears to be essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. However, plasmids carrying transcriptionally active genes are found to be extremely negatively supercoiled when isolated from mutants lacking topoisomerase I. Supercoiling occurs during transcriptional elongation rather than during transcriptional activation. It takes place in the absence of topoisomerase I and does not seem to be dependent on topoisomerase II since it can occur at the nonpermissive temperature in a top1-top2 ts mutant. Whether this change in linking number is due to an unusual form of topoisomerase II or whether it is due to a new enzyme has yet to be determined. The results suggest that topoisomerase I is normally required to relax transcriptionally induced supercoils. A model is discussed which considers the role of topoisomerases in the movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1976249889,"The use in vivo of an alternative 5′ splice site sequestered within a short stem of potential RNA secondary structure is determined by the length of the loop. Above a threshold length of loop, the alternative site is used despite the potential structure. In contrast, the alternative site is used very little or not at all during splicing in vitro with all lengths of loop that we have tested. A model is proposed which suggests that pre-mRNA is free to fold only within a limited period after transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2014729294,"We have developed an experimental approach to distinguish the 40-60 endogenous C-type proviruses of mice and to determine their association with well characterized developmental and physiological mutations. The hairless (hr) mutation causes a variety of pleiotropic effects. Using oligonucleotide probes specific for different classes of murine leukemia virus, we have identified and cloned a provirus present in HRS/J hr/hr animals but absent in HRS/J +/+. Genetic analyses showed perfect concordance between the hr phenotype and the presence of the provirus in a number of inbred and congenic strains of mice. Molecular analysis of a haired revertant established the causal relationship since it revealed the excision of most of the proviral genome leaving behind one long terminal repeat. These findings show that virus integration caused the hairless mutation and point to the utility of naturally occurring retroviral integrations for accessing the genome of the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2067376193,"The mating-type alleles A and a of Neurospora crassa control mating in the sexual cycle and function in establishing heterokaryon incompatibility in the vegetative cycle. The A and a alleles were cloned, and they were shown to encode both the sexual functions and vegetative incompatibility. The mating-type clones contain nonhomologous DNA segments that are flanked by common DNA sequences. Neurospora crassa and all heterothallic and pseudohomothallic Neurospora species contain a single copy of one mating-type sequence or the other within each haploid genome. The six known self-fertile homothallic isolates contain an A homolog, but only one species also contains a homologous sequences. Homothallism in these species is not due to mating-type switching, as it is in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1503186166,"Mossbauer and EPR studies of a highly active hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase isolated from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b are reported. The Mossbauer spectra of the oxidized (as isolated) hydroxylase show iron in a diamagnetic cluster containing an even number of Fe3+ sites. The parameters are consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled binuclear cluster similar to those of hemerythrin and purple acid phosphatases. Upon partial reduction of the hydroxylase, an S = 1/2 EPR spectrum with g values at 1.94, 1.86, and 1.75 (gav = 1.85) is observed. Such spectra are characteristic of oxo-bridged iron dimers in the mixed valent Fe(II).Fe(III) state. Further reduction leads to the appearance of a novel EPR resonance at g = 15. Comparison with an inorganic model compound for mu-oxo-bridged binuclear iron suggests that the g = 15 signal is characteristic of the doubly reduced state of the cluster in the protein. In this state, the Mossbauer spectra exhibit two quadrupole doublets typical of high spin Fe2+, consistent with the Fe(II).Fe(II) form of the cluster. The spectral features of the iron center of the hydroxylase in three oxidation states are all similar to those reported for mu-oxo (or mu-hydroxo)-bridged binuclear iron clusters. Since no known monooxygenase contains such a cluster, a new oxygenase mechanism is suggested. Three different preparative methods yielded hydroxylases spanning a 9-fold range in specific activity, yet the same cluster concentration and spectral characteristics were observed. Thus, other parameters than those measured here have a major influence on the activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043306215,"The sevenless (sev) gene determines the fate of a single photoreceptor cell type in the eye of Drosophila. It encodes a putative cell-surface protein with homology to tyrosine kinases. Here we have determined the complete structure of the sev gene and have demonstrated that the role of the sev protein in this developmental decision is critically dependent on the tyrosine kinase function. In comparison with other known tyrosine kinases, the sev gene product is unique in size and structure. It is a polypeptide of 2554 amino acids with two putative transmembrane segments. A single amino acid substitution in the ATP-binding site of the putative kinase domain results in the synthesis of an inactive sev protein unable to determine cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1511714820,"The STE2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 431-residue protein containing seven hydrophobic segments that is thought to be an essential component of the cell-surface receptor for alpha-factor in MATa haploids. Methods were devised to prepare membrane fractions from MATa cells that retained high levels of alpha-factor binding activity, consistent with the view that the alpha-factor receptor resides in the plasma membrane. To demonstrate that the membrane constituent responsible for alpha-factor binding was the STE2 polypeptide, specific antibodies were generated and used to identify STE2-related polypeptides by radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under conditions of complete solubilization, the major form of the STE2 gene product detected was a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 49,000. Affinity labeling of yeast membrane preparations by chemical cross-linking to 35S-alpha-factor indicated that a molecule of 49,000 molecular weight was the major alpha-factor-binding species. This alpha-factor-binding species was shown to be the product of the STE2 gene in three ways. First, MATa haploids carrying the STE2 gene on a multicopy plasmid overproduced alpha-factor binding activity about 15-fold. Second, MATa cells completely lacking a STE2 gene showed only nonspecific binding of alpha-factor (equivalent to the level displayed by MAT alpha haploids) and possessed no species that could be cross-linked to 35S-alpha-factor. Third, MATa cells expressing a truncated but functional STE2 gene (in which the COOH-terminal 135-hydrophilic residues were deleted) produced a protein detected by cross-linking to 35S-alpha-factor of apparent molecular weight 33,000, close to the size expected for the predicted abbreviated STE2 polypeptide. These findings demonstrate unequivocally that the STE2 gene product is the membrane component responsible for the ligand recognition function of the yeast alpha-factor receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1510877630,"Abstract The effect of the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine on cytoplasmic concentration ([Ca2+]i was examined at the single cell level in clonal pancreatic beta-cells (HIT). Cells were loaded with the indicator dye fura 2, and [Ca2+]i was measured by microfluorimetry. Carbamylcholine induced changes in that differed from cell to cell and provoked in some cells oscillatory fluctuations. During a transient, free rose to a peak within 1-3 s. The frequency of the oscillations increased with agonist concentration. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i occurred in the absence of external Ca2+. When cells were perifused for a sufficient period of time without carbamylcholine, near identical responses were elicited in each cell by successive applications of the agonist. Thus, individual cells displayed characteristic and reproducible responses with respect to amplitude, frequency, and shape of the transients as well as latency in onset of the initial rise. We propose that the biological response to a agonist in a given cell is not only determined by the frequency and amplitude of oscillations but is governed by the unique pattern of the signal of each cell, which may be termed Ca2+ fingerprint."
https://openalex.org/W1562377494,"The effect of prostaglandins (PG) on free cytosolic calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) and cAMP levels was studied in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106. PGF2 alpha and PGE2, but not 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, induced an increase in [Ca2+]i which was mainly due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The EC50 for PGF2 alpha was approximately 7 nM, whereas that for PGE2 was approximately 1.8 microM. Maximal doses of PGF2 alpha increased [Ca2+]i to higher levels than PGE2. Both active PGs also stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover in UMR-106 cells. The effects of the two PGs were independent of each other and appear to involve separate receptors for each PG. PGE2 was a very potent stimulator of cAMP production and increased cAMP by approximately 80-fold with an EC50 of 0.073 microM. PGF2 alpha was a very poor stimulator of cAMP production; 25 microM PGF2 alpha increased cAMP by 5-fold. The increase in cellular cAMP levels activated a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel which resulted in a secondary, slow increase in [Ca2+]i. High concentrations of both PGs (10-50 microM) inhibited this channel independent of their effect on cAMP levels. Pretreatment of the cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibited the PG-mediated increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover and the increase in [Ca2+]i. However, pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate had no effect on the PGE2-mediated increase in cAMP. The latter finding, together with the dose responses for PGE2-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i and cAMP levels, suggests the presence of two subclasses of PGE2 receptors: one coupled to adenylate cyclase and the other to phospholipase C. With respect to osteoblast function, the cAMP signaling system is antiproliferative, whereas the Ca2+ messenger system, although having no proliferative effect by itself, tempers cAMP's antiproliferative effect."
https://openalex.org/W108550376,"By introduction of deletions and/or insertions, we have defined a small DNA fragment (1.58 kilobase pairs) which contains the ant gene. Thus, transformants of all plasmid constructs containing this segment exhibit Antup phenotype, i.e. growth is Li+-resistant and Na+/H+ antiporter activity is increased in isolated everted membrane vesicles. Utilizing the T7 promoter expression system, we also found that this fragment encodes for a single protein of 35 kDa. The DNA fragment has been sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 1085 base pairs. Analysis of the sequence of the predicted protein suggests the presence of 10 putative transmembrane segments in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1566938829,"Agents such as prostaglandins E1 and I2 which elevate cAMP levels in platelets also increase cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. Since much of the cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in human platelets is due to the cGMP-inhibited isozyme (Macphee, C. H., Harrison, S. A., and Beavo, J. A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 6600-6663), we examined the regulation of this isozyme by prostaglandins E1 and I2 in intact platelets. Because this isozyme is a minor component of platelet protein, normally requiring several thousand-fold purification to achieve homogeneity, a specific monoclonal antibody (CGI-5) was utilized to identify and isolate the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase activity. Treatment of intact platelets with the prostaglandins promoted an increase in the phosphorylation state of the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase and a corresponding increase in phosphodiesterase activity. The effect on activity and phosphorylation of the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase was observed within 2 min after intact platelets were exposed to the prostaglandins. The half-maximal effective dose for prostaglandin I2 (10 nM) was approximately 10-fold lower than that for prostaglandin E1. The phosphorylated, cGMP-inhibited isozyme migrated as a 110-kDa peptide following sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Direct in vitro phosphorylation of the platelet cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused a similar increase in phosphodiesterase activity. Treatment with PKI peptide, a specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, blocked the phosphorylation and the effect on activity. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that the effects of prostaglandins E1 and I2 on platelet phosphodiesterase activity are mediated by a direct cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase isozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1501012449,"Calcium and protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) have been proposed to act as signals in triggering superoxide anion (O2-) generation by neutrophils. We have probed the adequacy and necessity of calcium and diacylglycerol (DG), activators of protein kinase C, in eliciting O2- generation and degranulation. Activation of neutrophils by the ligand 10(-7) M fMet-Leu-Phe triggered elevation of cytosolic calcium (fura-2) and a rapid, biphasic increase in labeled DG in [14C]glycerol and [3H]arachidonate prelabeled cells. Buffering of the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium with MAPTAM (a cell permeant EGTA analogue) inhibited O2- generation by 90% and degranulation by 50%, concordant with a role of calcium in signaling. However, buffering the increase in calcium also decreased DG. Since phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate breakdown in response to fMet-Leu-Phe was not inhibited and phosphatidic acid levels were enhanced in MAPTAM pretreated cells, the removal of calcium may enhance further DG metabolism. Thus, a requirement for calcium could not be differentiated from a requirement for DG, and the profound inhibition of O2- generation in the presence of MAPTAM may reflect removal of DG. Four stimuli, fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-7) M leukotriene B4, 100 micrograms/ml concanavalin A, and 200 nM ionomycin elevated cytosolic calcium and triggered release of specific granules, but only fMet-Leu-Phe and concanavalin A triggered substantial O2- generation. Nevertheless, all four stimuli significantly increased labeled DG. Therefore, elevated DG and elevated calcium may be necessary but do not appear adequate to elicit O2- generation. Only fMet-Leu-Phe and concanavalin A triggered generation of phosphatidic acid (PA) together with DG. Correlation of O2- generation with PA may reflect a requirement for PA per se or for a specific pool of DG that can be further metabolized to PA."
https://openalex.org/W1540348039,"The requirement for TonB protein in a variety of membrane-related processes suggests that TonB is an envelope protein. Consistent with this suggestion, the deduced TonB amino acid sequence (Postle, K., and Good, R. F., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 5235-5239) contains an amino-terminal region similar to leader (signal) sequences of exported proteins, although its charged region falls outside the rules which characterize these sequences (von Heijne, G. (1985) J. Mol. Biol. 184, 99-105). The deduced TonB amino acid sequence contains three potential methionine start codons in the first six codons of the open reading frame. In this report, we show, by Edman degradation of [35S]methionine-labeled protein, that TonB protein synthesized in vitro initiates at the third of these methionine codons. A method for detecting TonB synthesized in vivo has been developed that involves expression of TonB from the lambda PL promoter and pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. TonB synthesized in vivo has a chemical half-life of 10 min at 42 degrees C. It is exported from the cytoplasm, as determined by proteinase K accessibility experiments. It fractionates with spheroplasts under conditions where maltose-binding protein fractionates with the periplasm. It has the same mobility in three different polyacrylamide gel systems as TonB synthesized in vitro. We concluded that the amino terminus of TonB is uncleaved following its export from the cytoplasm and that TonB is a membrane-associated protein. Characterization of a tonB-phoA gene fusion suggests that the amino-terminal 41 amino acids of TonB are sufficient to promote export of the fusion protein and presumably TonB as well. Models for TonB orientation within the cell envelope are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2001481989,"The central portion (region P) of the 742-nucleotide noncoding 5' end of poliovirus allows the RNA to initiate protein synthesis in the absence of the usual 5' 7-methylguanosine capping group. Poliovirus 5' noncoding region was fused to a reporter gene and transfected into cells. There was extensive augmentation of the expression of this gene by poliovirus-mediated inhibition of cap-dependent protein synthesis. That the construct initiated in a cap-independent manner was verified through in vitro experiments. Small lesions throughout region P blocked its initiation function, implying that a coherent functional unit, hundreds of nucleotides long, is responsible for cap-independent initiation by poliovirus RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2092531131,"The bacterial transposable element Tn5 was observed to undergo high-frequency sequence inversion when integrated into the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome. Deletion analysis of the IS50 elements through which this recombination event occurred demonstrated the absence of cis-acting signals involved in the inversion process. Several observations suggested an intimate association of the recombination mechanism with HSV-1 DNA replication, including the ability of the seven viral genes that are essential for HSV-1 DNA synthesis to mediate Tn5 inversion in the absence of any other viral functions. Comparable results were obtained by using duplicate copies of the L-S junction of the HSV-1 genome. Thus inversion of the L and S components of the HSV-1 genome during productive infection does not appear to be a site-specific process, but rather is the result of generalized recombination mediated by the complex of gene products that replicate the viral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1591828201,"Dehydration represents a strong stimulus for the secretory activity of hypothalamic vasopressinergic neurons and induces a sustained rise in hypothalamic [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP) mRNA. We now report that, in addition to the change in mRNA accumulation, this stimulus leads to an increase in the size of the mature AVP gene transcripts. Using Northern blot analysis in conjunction with internal RNA size markers, we demonstrate here that a 6-day period of salt imbibition induced a gradual size increase of AVP mRNA from 810 to a maximum of 930 bases. This change was fully reversed by day 30 following termination of the salt treatment. Any alteration of the mRNA capping or polyadenylation sites was ruled out by S1 mapping. However, poly(A) tail removal reduced AVP mRNA of all treatment groups to exactly the same size (600 bases). It is concluded that the dehydration-induced size change is due to a greater than 50% increase of the mean steady state length of the poly(A) tail. It remains to be determined to what extent the observed increase in poly(A) tail length may have an effect on AVP mRNA stability or translational efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1483148680,"Hepatic triglyceride lipase (H-TGL) was isolated from human postheparin plasma by column chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an amino-terminal sequence of Leu-Gly-Gln-Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro-Glu. Partial amino acid sequences of seven cyanogen bromide peptides were obtained. A human hepatoma cDNA library was screened with synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the partial protein sequence. The cloned H-TGL cDNA of 1569 nucleotides predicts a mature protein of 477 amino acids plus a leader sequence of 22 amino acids. Blot hybridization analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA with a putative H-TGL cDNA clone gave a single hybridizing band of 1.7 kilobases. The protein contains four consensus N-glycosylation sequences based on the cDNA sequence. Comparison of the enzyme sequence with that of other lipases reveals highly conserved sequences in regions of putative lipid and heparin binding. The carboxyl terminus of H-TGL contains a highly basic sequence which is not reported to be present in rat H-TGL or other members of the lipase gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1666667592,"The relevance of phosphoinositide remodeling to calcium movements and to the physiological response of superoxide anion (O2-) generation was probed in neutrophils stimulated by the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe and the lectin concanavalin A. fMet-Leu-Phe and concanavalin A triggered O2- generation but elicited different patterns of calcium mobilization and phosphoinositide remodeling. fMet-Leu-Phe (10(-7) M) triggered a rise in cytosolic calcium by mobilization of intracellular calcium (fura-2) and increased calcium permeability (45Ca uptake), while concanavalin A (100 micrograms/ml) elicited a rise in cytosolic calcium, primarily by uptake of extracellular calcium (45Ca uptake). fMet-Leu-Phe triggered rapid breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol, and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). In contrast concanavalin A triggered breakdown of phosphatidylinositol, but not PIP2, nor was there a significant increase in IP3. However, both fMet-Leu-Phe and concanavalin A triggered a rapid biphasic increase in levels of labeled diacylglycerol (in [3H]arachidonate or [14C]glycerol prelabeled cells) and a 3-fold increase in [32P] phosphatidic acid. These results are concordant with a role for PIP2 breakdown and generation of IP3 specifically in intracellular calcium mobilization but not for other aspects of the signaling pathway for O2- generation. Calcium permeability changes were associated with elevated diacylglycerol and [32P]phosphatidic acid, although a cause and effect relationship is not apparent. Ligands such as concanavalin A enhance cytosolic calcium and trigger generation of O2- without significant PIP2 remodeling; elevated diacylglycerol and cytosolic calcium are the common events associated with ligand-induced O2- generation."
https://openalex.org/W1581415510,"The purified catalytic subunit (C) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced a 2-fold activation of the low Km phosphodiesterase in crude microsomes (P-2 pellet) of rat adipocytes. This activation was C subunit concentration-dependent, ATP-dependent, blocked by a specific peptide inhibitor, and lost if the C subunit was first heat denatured. The concentration of ATP necessary for half-maximal activation of the low Km phosphodiesterase was 4.50 +/- 1.1 microM, which was nearly the same as the known Km of C subunit for ATP (3.1 microM) using other substrates. The concentration of C subunit producing half-maximal activation of phosphodiesterase was 0.22 +/- 0.04 microM, slightly less than the measured concentration of total C subunit in adipocytes (0.45 microM). The activation of the low Km phosphodiesterase by C subunit was specific, since on an equimolar basis, myosin light chain kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II did not activate the enzyme. The percent stimulation of phosphodiesterase by C subunit was about the same as that produced by incubation of adipocytes with a cAMP analog, and the enzyme first activated in vivo with the analog was not activated to the same extent (on a percentage basis) by in vitro treatment with C subunit. Treatment of the crude microsomes with trypsin resulted in transfer of phosphodiesterase catalytic activity from the particulate to the supernatant fraction, but the enzyme in the supernatant was minimally activated by C subunit, suggesting either loss or dislocation of the regulatory component. The C subunit-mediated activation of phosphodiesterase was preserved after either transfer of phosphodiesterase activity to the supernatant fraction by nonionic detergents or partial purification of the transferred enzyme. The present findings are consistent with the suggestion that protein kinase regulates the concentration of cAMP through phosphodiesterase activation and provide direct evidence that the mechanism of activation involves phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1480232957,Genomic clones containing the complete gene encoding human fibroblast interstitial collagenase were isolated from a lambda phage human DNA library. The gene is comprised from 10 exons and spans 8.2 kilobase pairs. We have mapped the relative positions and determined the DNA sequence of all the exon/intron borders of the gene. The organization of the human interstitial collagenase gene is very similar to that of rabbit collagenase and of two other extracellular matrix (ECM) metalloproteases: rat stromelysin (transin) and rat transin 2. All four genes are organized into 10 exons of virtually identical size while the length of the 3' proximal introns is subject to variation. The protein sequence comprising the putative active center is coded for by exon 5 of all four genes and contains a strongly conserved zinc binding site. This observation suggests that the organization of the ECM metalloprotease genes reflect the structure of the functional domains of the enzyme proteins. The structural data accumulated so far provides evidence for the existence of a gene family coding for secreted ECM metalloproteases and suggests that gene duplication played an important role in its formation.
https://openalex.org/W1586011710,Signal and stop transfer sequences are discrete regions within a polypeptide chain able to initiate or terminate translocation of the protein across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have investigated the role of these topogenic sequences in the biogenesis of polytopic transmembrane proteins. Plasmids encoding various patterns of well-characterized signal and stop transfer sequences fused to a set of topogenically inert passenger domains were constructed. These molecules were expressed by transcription-translation in a cell-free system or by microinjection of transcripts into Xenopus oocytes. The observed orientation with respect to the membrane was dependent on the order of signal and stop transfer sequences in the coding region. These results were used to test the hypothesis that a protein can achieve polytopic transmembrane orientation using combinations of simple topogenic sequences. We conclude that some (but not all) patterns of signal and stop transfer sequences confer polytopic orientation to proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.
https://openalex.org/W1585752997,"Conjugation of ubiquitin to certain proteins can trigger their degradation. A major question concerns the structural features of a protein which make it susceptible to ubiquitin ligation. Recent studies have shown that the selection of proteins for degradation occurs most probably on a binding site of the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). It was shown that a free alpha-NH2 group is one important feature of the protein structure recognized by the ubiquitin-ligating enzyme. Proteins with basic or bulky hydrophobic residues in the NH2-terminal position are recognized by the ligase, marked by ubiquitin, and degraded. This is not true, however, for proteins with an acidic residue in this position. We have previously shown that a tRNA-dependent post-translational conjugation of arginine to acidic NH2 termini of proteins is essential for their degradation via the ubiquitin pathway, and we speculated that this modification is required for their recognition by the ligase. In the present study we have partially purified from rabbit reticulocytes the modifying enzyme, arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase, and characterized it. We have separated the enzyme from other known components of the ubiquitin system and shown that it is specifically required for degradation of proteins with either an aspartate or glutamate residue in their NH2-terminal position. We have shown that the action of the transferase is required for conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate and most probably for its recognition by the ligase. The enzyme in its native form has a molecular mass of about 360 kDa. It appears to be a complex between several molecules of arginyl-tRNA synthetase and arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1492542140,"Vaccinia virus early transcription factor (VETF) is required for efficient expression of the early class of viral genes in vitro. The factor copurified with an ATPase activity that was stimulated by DNA. In this report we show that the ATPase remains associated with the factor upon glycerol gradient sedimentation. Under these conditions VETF sedimented at a rate of 7.6 S suggesting that it may be a heterodimer of the Mr 82,000 and 77,000 polypeptides. Of the common nucleoside triphosphates, only ATP and dATP were hydrolyzed by the VETF-associated ATPase. The ATP analog gamma-thio ATP was not a substrate. The VETF-associated ATPase activity was stimulated up to 30-fold by the presence of polynucleotides. DNA was a much more effective cofactor for the ATPase than was RNA, and duplex polydeoxyribonucleotides were preferred. The enzymatic and physical properties of the VETF-associated ATPase distinguished it from all three vaccinia ATPase activities previously described, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolases I and II, and capping enzyme. Except for the preference for double-stranded DNA, the substrate and cofactor requirements of the VETF-associated ATPase most closely resembled those of nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I. However, VETF-ATPase was not inhibited by polyclonal antibody to the latter enzyme. The association of an ATPase with an early gene transcription factor may explain the previously described requirement for ATP hydrolysis in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1491208962,"We have isolated two overlapping cDNA clones that encompass the entire structural gene for pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase from maize. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence has revealed that the cDNA clones include an insert of a total of 3,171 nucleotides without a poly(A) tail and encode a polypeptide that contains 947 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 102,673. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase protein with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence shows that the mature form of pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase in the maize chloroplast consists of 876 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 95,353. The amino acid composition of the deduced sequence of pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase is in good agreement with that of the purified enzyme. The region that contains the active and regulatory sites of pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase can be found in the deduced sequence of amino acids. We have predicted the secondary structure and calculated the hydropathy pattern of this region. The extra 71 residues at the N terminus of the deduced sequence of amino acid residues corresponds to the transit peptide which is indispensable for the transport of the precursor protein into chloroplasts. We have compared the primary structure of the pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase transit peptide to those of other proteins and found sequences similar to the consensus sequences found in other transit peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1512107418,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an Zn(II)-containing dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. Using oligonucleotide probes based on the amino acid sequence of mouse kidney ACE, cDNA encoding this protein has been isolated. One cDNA, ACE.31, encodes the N-terminal 332 amino acids of mouse ACE, a portion of the protein containing a putative 34-amino acid leader sequence and the N terminus of the mature protein. Northern analyses with cloned ACE cDNA revealed that both mouse kidney and lung express two ACE mRNAs, one of 4900 and another of 4150 bases. Southern analysis suggests that cDNA ACE.31 is the product of a single gene, and thus these data add evidence to the hypothesis that the converting enzymes produced by epithelial and endothelial cells are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1557159213,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was characterized with the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. At 4 degrees C binding of 125I-t-PA to Hep G2 cells is rapid, specific, saturable, and reflective of a homogeneous population of 76,000 high-affinity surface sites per cell (Kd = 3.7 nM). The kinetics of 125I-t-PA binding to its receptor are characterized by rate constants for association (k1 = 1.2 x 10(6) min-1 M-1) and dissociation (k-1 = 0.001 min-1). A specific glycosylation pattern does not appear to be required for binding. Binding does not appear to be mediated by other recognized hepatic receptor systems. At 37 degrees C a single cohort of bound 125I-t-PA molecules disappears rapidly from the cell surface. Ligand then accumulates intracellularly. Thereafter, the intracellular concentration of ligand declines simultaneously with the release of ligand degradation products into the media. In the continued presence of 125I-t-PA at 37 degrees C the concentration of cell-associated ligand plateaus after 30 min with the concomitant appearance of low molecular weight 125I-labeled fragments in the media. Cumulative degradation then increases linearly with time. Under steady state conditions half-maximal ligand uptake and degradation is 26.6 nM and maximal rate of catabolism is 1.2 pmol/10(6) cells/h. At saturating ligand concentrations uptake and degradation by Hep G2 cells continue linearly for at least 6 h even in the absence of protein synthesis. During this period the cumulative ligand uptake exceeds the total cellular capacity of binding sites, consistent with receptor recycling. We conclude that t-PA clearance in human Hep G2 cells involves ligand binding, uptake, and degradation mediated by a novel high-capacity, high-affinity specific receptor system."
https://openalex.org/W1504338510,"A cDNA clone encoding skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was isolated from a rat skeletal muscle library using oligonucleotide probes. The total length of the rat skeletal muscle MLCK cDNA was 2823 base pairs with an open reading frame of 1830 base pairs. The deduced sequence of the 610-amino acid protein exhibited 96% amino acid identity to rabbit skeletal muscle MLCK in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule, which contains the catalytic and the calmodulin-binding domains, and 58% identity in the amino-terminal region. Analysis of total rat mRNA revealed a single mRNA species of 3.4 kilobases that was unique to skeletal muscle. Further analysis of skeletal muscle tissue using fast-twitch glycolytic, fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic, and slow-twitch oxidative fibers isolated from rat leg revealed that the mRNA level for MLCK varied among the three fiber types. The results of kinase assays performed on the fibers showed that MLCK activity levels paralleled the MLCK mRNA levels found in each of the three types of skeletal muscle fibers studied. Fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (gastrocnemius red) and slow-twitch oxidative (soleus) exhibited 60 and 13%, respectively, of the enzymatic activity present in fast-twitch glycolytic (gastrocnemius white) fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2147946178,"Highly purified preparations of dnaA46 protein have permitted its biochemical characterization in comparison with the activities of wild type dnaA protein. We have determined that dnaA46 protein was reduced in its ability to bind to DNA fragments containing oriC. This mutant protein was also defective in binding ATP and was inactive for replication of oriC-containing plasmids in purified enzyme systems. In contrast, dnaA46 protein was active for oriC plasmid replication when added to reactions containing a crude enzyme fraction deficient in dnaA protein. One or more proteins have been identified which appear to interact with dnaA46 protein prior to DNA synthesis. These studies suggest that this interaction is thermolabile. Stimulation of dnaA46 protein activity resulted in a reduction of the prolonged lag prior to DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1528611173,"We have prepared site-specific antibodies toward human insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and epidermal growth factor receptors with chemically synthesized peptides derived from the cDNA-predicted amino acid sequences of these receptors. Two classes of antibodies were produced toward each receptor: one toward the carboxyl termini and the other against the kinase domains containing sequences homologous to the tyrosyl phosphorylation site of the product of src gene (pp60v-src). Both classes of antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated the appropriate 125I-ligand-receptor complexes and [35S]methionine-labeled receptors with almost equal potencies. Antibodies toward the kinase domains inhibited both autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of the corresponding receptors in a cell-free system, whereas antibodies toward the carboxyl termini did not. Microinjection of the kinase-inhibitory antibodies into the cytoplasm of human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells blocked the ability of the corresponding ligand to induce membrane ruffling. In contrast, these inhibitory antibodies did not block the ability of noncorresponding ligands to induce the same response. Furthermore, control immunoglobulin and antibodies toward the carboxyl termini did not block this biological response. These results support a role for the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activities of these growth factor receptors in mediating their biological effects and suggest that the regions homologous to the tyrosyl phosphorylation site of pp60v-src are important for these kinase activities both in cell-free and intact cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1594855314,"We placed the cDNAs encoding one of the short types of alpha s (alpha s-1) with Asp-Ser in positions 70 and 71 and one of the long types of alpha s (alpha s-2) in which Asp-Ser are substituted with a string of 16 amino acids, into the pGEM-3 transcription vector downstream from its T7 RNA polymerase promoter, obtained transcripts and translated the mRNAs using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, to determine if the molecules would be synthesized and, if so, whether they would be active as assessed in cyc- reconstitution assays. The translation products obtained from both alpha s RNAs were a mixture of primarily three polypeptides of which one (approximately 40-50% of total) represented the complete translation product and the other two appeared to be due to internal translation starts at Met60, before the splice difference between the RNAs, and the other at the first Met after the splice difference. Lysates incubated with short or long alpha s RNA when added to cyc- membranes reconstituted fluoride and GTP[gamma S]-stimulated activities. Thus, in vitro synthesized alpha s subunits are active in interacting both with guanine nucleotides and the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. On incubation without and with the receptor agonist isoproterenol, using GTP as sole added guanine nucleotide, both types of alpha s subunits reconstituted the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Thus, the synthetic alpha s also interact with receptors, and by inference with beta-gamma dimers, shown previously to be needed for activation by receptor. Quantitative assays in which the activity of the synthetic alpha s-1 was compared to that of native purified human erythrocyte type-1 Gs, indicated that the two products are equipotent within a 2-fold margin of error. Thus, the lysate made fully active alpha s subunits, and alpha s subunits require no post-translational modifications dependent on microsomal processes. This approach may be useful in studying biological functions of other cloned alpha subunits of G proteins."

Under conditions of induced expression, similar amounts of dnaA46 and dnaA5 gene products and less of the dnaA204 gene product were observed. Facilitated by elevated expression levels, an improved method for purification of dnaA+ protein and the purification of dnaA46 protein have been obtained. The replication activity of dnaA46 protein did not appear to be thermolabile upon prior incubation at various temperatures. Thermolabile replication activity was observed under conditions of coupled DNA synthesis. In contrast with the wild type protein, DNA synthesis dependent on dnaA46 protein showed a pronounced lag before incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1488761279,"Proline-rich proteins (PRPs) in the salivary glands of mice, rats, and hamsters are encoded by tissue-specific inducible multigene families. Mouse PRP genes are located on chromosome 8, and transcription is dramatically induced (about 70-fold) by isoproterenol treatment. Clones containing two nonallelic PRP genes (MP2 and M14) were isolated from cosmid and phage libraries of CD-1 mouse genomic DNA. The cloned regions comprise a contiguous block of 77 kilobase pairs of the mouse genome. Restriction mapping established the physical lineage of PRP genes MP2 and M14, and they are tandemly arrayed. The DNA sequence analysis presented in this report suggests that genes M14 and MP2 (Ann, D. K., and Carlson, D. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15863-15872) arose via a gene duplication of a common ancestor. Two major differences between M14 and MP2 were observed. PRP gene MP2 has 13 tandemly arrayed 42-nucleotide repeats in exon II, whereas M14 has 17 repeats, and PRP gene M14 has an insertion by transposition of a 2-kilobase pair member of the long interspersed repeated DNA (LINE) family (LIMd) into intron I. The evolution of this PRP multigene family has been dominated by intra-exonic amplification of repeating nucleotide units coding for these and other proline-rich repeated peptides and by gene duplication. The LIMd element gives rise to heterogenous EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII restriction enzyme patterns, and this insertion is also present in BALB/c, C57BL/6J, and DBA/2J mice."
https://openalex.org/W1604175695,"Abstract The presence of a cation inhibitory site on the dephosphoform of the H+, K+ -ATPase was confirmed by comparing the effects of K+ and NH4+ on overall activity and on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Inhibition of ATPase activity was pronounced at high cation/ATP ratios, but NH4+ was much less effective. At 60 mM cation, although the ATPase activity was greater in the presence of NH4+ (17.1 mumol/mg.h) as compared to K+ (5.1 mumol/mg.h), dephosphorylation of preformed phosphoenzyme was faster with K+ (2101 min-1) than with NH4+ (1401 min-1). Increasing K+ concentrations at the cytosolic face of the enzyme, at constant ATP, decreased the rate of phosphorylation from 1343 to 360 min-1 at 25 mM K+. Increasing ATP concentrations in the presence of constant K+ concentrations accelerated ATPase activity and increased the steady-state phosphoenzyme level. Therefore, inhibition by cations was due to cation stabilization of a dephospho form of the enzyme at a cytosolically accessible cation-binding site. ATP promoted cation dissociation from this site. In ion-permeable vesicles, increasing K+ concentrations, at constant ATP, activated and then inhibited ATPase activity, with a K0.5(I) of 22 mM. In intact, ion-impermeable inside-out vesicles, in the presence of valinomycin, ATPase activity increased up to 175 mM K+. Collapse of this potential by the addition of the electrogenic protonophore 3,3',4', 5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide restored the K+ inhibition of ATPase activity. Thus, the cation inhibition of the ATPase activity appears to be voltage-sensitive; and hence, its connection to the voltage sensitivity of acid secretion demonstrated in intact gastric mucosa is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1525561900,"The rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin by myosin light chain kinase and by two myosin light chain phosphatases (gizzard phosphatase IV and aorta phosphatase) are measured in various conditions; the relationship between the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myosin and the myosin conformation is also studied. The rate of dephosphorylation of myosin was completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 and ATP at low ionic strength where phosphorylated myosin forms a folded conformation. The inhibition was released when myosin formed either an extended monomer or filaments. The rate of phosphorylation of myosin was also affected by the conformation of myosin. The rate for a folded myosin was slower than those for an extended monomer and filamentous myosin. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of heavy meromyosin, subfragment-1, and the isolated 20,000-dalton light chain are not inhibited at low ionic strength, and the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was decreased with increasing ionic strength. KCl dependence of the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myosin was normalized by using KCl dependence of subfragment-1, and it was found that the marked inhibition of the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myosin is closely related to the change from an extended to a folded conformation of myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1594636322,"Angiotensin II stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells results in initial, rapid diacylglycerol (DG) formation from the polyphosphoinositides accompanied by intracellular acidification, as well as a more sustained DG accumulation which is accompanied by a prolonged intracellular alkalinization. To determine whether intracellular pH (pHi) modulates DG accumulation, NH4Cl and potassium acetate were used to alter pHi and DG formation was measured. NH4Cl (10 mM) increased pHi from 7.15 +/- 0.05 to 7.34 +/- 0.02 pH units and markedly enhanced the sustained (5 min), but not the initial (15 s), phase of DG formation in response to 100 nM angiotensin II (65 +/- 13% increase). Conversely, intracellular acidification with Na+-free buffer and potassium acetate (20 mM) decreased pHi to 6.93 +/- 0.08 and reduced subsequent angiotensin II-induced sustained DG formation by 82 +/- 9%. In intact cells, inhibition of angiotensin II-stimulated alkalinization by incubation in Na+-free buffer or by addition of the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor dimethylamiloride (10 microM) decreased the ability of the cell to sustain DG formation, suggesting that active Na+/H+ exchange is necessary for continued DG formation. Thus, it seems that sustained, angiotensin II-induced diacylglycerol accumulation is regulated by intracellular alkalinization secondary to Na+/H+ exchange in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W28763923,"The target size for opioid receptor binding was studied after manipulations known to affect the interactions between receptor and GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). Addition of GTP or its analogs to the binding reaction, exposure of intact cells to pertussis toxin prior to irradiation, or treatment of irradiated membranes with N-ethylmaleimide did not change the target size (approximately equal to 100 kDa) for opioid receptors in NG 108-15 cells and rat brain. These data suggest that the 100-kDa species does not include an active subunit of a G-protein or alternatively that GTP does not promote the dissociation of the receptor-G-protein complex. The presence of Na+ (100 mM) in the radioligand binding assay induced a biphasic decay curve for agonist binding and a flattening of the monoexponential decay curve for a partial agonist. In both cases the effect was explained by an irradiation-induced loss of the low affinity state of the opioid receptor produced by the addition of Na+. This suggests that an allosteric inhibitor that mediates the effect of sodium on the receptor is destroyed at low doses of irradiation, leaving receptors which are no longer regulated by sodium. The effect of Na+ on target size was slightly increased by the simultaneous addition of GTP but was not altered by pertussis toxin treatment. Thus, the sodium unit is distinct from G-proteins and may represent a new component of the opioid receptor complex. Assuming a simple bimolecular model of one Na+ unit/receptor, the size of this inhibitor can be measured as 168 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1565741264,"We examined the pH sensitivity of the H+/organic cation antiport system in brush-border membranes isolated from rat renal cortex. The uptake of tetraethylammonium, a typical organic cation, in the absence of an H+ gradient had a marked pH dependence with an optimum pH of 7.0, while the uptake of p-aminohippurate, an organic anion, and D-glucose was almost consistent in the pH range of 6.0-8.0. The decreased tetraethylammonium uptake by brush-border membrane vesicles, suspended in an acidic pH buffer or an alkaline pH buffer, was completely recovered by subsequent treatment of the vesicles with a pH 7.0 buffer. The pH sensitivity of tetraethylammonium uptake was not changed in the presence of either carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a protonophore, or valinomycin (voltage-clamped condition). Kinetic parameters of tetraethylammonium uptake were changed in a pH-dependent manner, although Eadie-Hofstee plots of tetraethylammonium uptake were linear in the pH range of 6.0-8.0, indicating the existence of one mode of transport system at various pH values. At an acidic pH, the Km was increased without any change in Vmax value, compared with the values at pH 7.0. On the other hand, at an alkaline pH, the Vmax was decreased without a change in Km value. These results suggest that the H+/organic cation antiport system in renal brush-border membranes is very sensitive to pH (optimum pH of 7.0), in contrast to organic anion and D-glucose transport systems, and that pH is an important factor to regulate the activity of the H+/organic cation antiport system, as well as H+ gradient (a driving force)."
https://openalex.org/W324231377,"Abstract Recently, studies on the 5'-ends of actin mRNAs in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, have demonstrated that three of the four mature actin transcripts contain a 22-nucleotide leader sequence which is acquired by trans-splicing from a novel 100-nucleotide RNA. In the course of our studies of the ubiquitin genes in C. elegans (R. W. Graham and E. P. M. Candido, manuscript in preparation) we were led to the possibility that the major ubiquitin transcript in this organism might also contain a trans-spliced leader sequence. The 5'-noncoding region of the major ubiquitin gene (UbiA) contains a 3'-splice consensus sequence six nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon; however, sequencing of a further 1.6 kilobases upstream failed to reveal the existence of any potential 5'-splice sites in the correct relationship to known promoter elements. Furthermore, S1 and Northern blot analyses using probes complementary to upstream regions failed to detect the ubiquitin transcript. Primer extension experiments on total RNA using an oligonucleotide which hybridized to the ubiquitin transcript downstream of the 3'-splice site demonstrated the existence of a 22-nucleotide leader sequence not present in the ubiquitin gene 5'-region. Thus we show here that the 2500-nucleotide mRNA encoding a polyubiquitin precursor protein contains a 22-nucleotide leader sequence identical to that found in several C. elegans actin mRNAs and which is most likely acquired by a trans-splicing mechanism. In addition we have localized the site of transcript initiation for UbiA by S1 nuclease mapping."

https://openalex.org/W1581150233,"Abstract Circulating Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors have been implicated in volume-expanded forms of hypertension. Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell Na+/K+-ATPase has been demonstrated to elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels and enhance contractility, thus providing a mechanism of raised peripheral resistance. In cells chronically subjected to Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition, however, new Na+/K+-ATPase molecules are synthesized, which then restore the intracellular milieu to preinsult conditions. Restoral of the preinsult intracellular milieu in vascular smooth muscle cells would then be expected to lead to the reduction of muscle cell contractility and peripheral resistance. Thus circulating Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors may not be effective in eliciting chronic forms of hypertension unless the target cell homeostatic response is impaired. We demonstrate an apparent such impairment in Dahl salt-sensitive rats, a genetic model of salt-sensitive hypertension."

When hepatoma 7777 (McA-RH 7777) cells were labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-hepatoma poly(A) polymerase antibodies and analysis of the RNAs in the immunoprecipitate, only one labeled small nuclear RNA corresponding to U1 RNA was found. Preimmune sera did not form a complex with U1 RNA. Hepatoma poly(A) polymerase antisera did not immunoprecipitate U1 RNA or any other small nuclear RNA from a cell line (H4-11-EC3) which does not contain the tumor-type poly(A) polymerase. Immunoblot analysis of hepatoma 7777 nuclear extract or purified poly(A) polymerase with anti-ribonucleoprotein antisera did not show any cross-reactivity of the latter sera with poly(A) polymerase. The major RNA immunoprecipitated from the hepatoma nuclear extracts using trimethyl cap (m3G) antisera corresponded to the RNA immunoprecipitated with poly(A) polymerase antisera. These data indicate that U1 RNA is closely associated with poly(A) polymerase and suggest the potential involvement of this RNA in the cleavage/polyadenylation of mRNA precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1575117322,"Rapid, unidirectional Ca2+ influx was examined in isolated brown adipocytes by short incubations (30 s) with 45Ca2+. Ca2+ uptake was found to be large in the resting brown adipocyte, but was markedly inhibited when the cells were presented with norepinephrine. Specific alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was without effect on Ca2+ uptake. The effect of norepinephrine (which had an EC50 of 140 nM) could be inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade and could be mimicked by forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator) and theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor). Exogenous free fatty acids such as octanoate and palmitate (classical stimulators of respiration in brown adipocytes) were also able to dramatically inhibit Ca2+ uptake by the cells. The artificial mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) induced a large reduction in cellular Ca2+ uptake (even in the presence of the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin), and in the presence of FCCP the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on Ca2+ uptake was significantly reduced. The effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on Ca2+ uptake was not directly caused by the large increase in respiration that occurs in response to norepinephrine because the respiratory inhibitor rotenone did not affect the Ca2+ response of the cells to the hormone. The evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocyte metabolism leads to a partial inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial Ca2+ pool and we discuss the possibility that this represents the effect of a reduced membrane potential (and thus reduced Ca2+ uniport activity) in the partially uncoupled mitochondria of the thermogenically active brown adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1602044999,"NusA protein is a transcription elongation and termination factor that acts to enhance pausing of RNA chain growth by RNA polymerase at specific sites on DNA templates. We demonstrate that this enhancement of pausing in tR1, the transcription termination site between genes cro and cII of phage lambda, is inhibited by DNA oligonucleotides complementary to a segment of the nascent RNA just preceding the sequence that is thought to be a part of the stem of an RNA hairpin that is responsible for pausing, but not by oligonucleotides complementary to segments containing the boxA sequence or the sequences up to 40 nucleotides upstream from boxA. The results are consistent with a model proposed by Landick and Yanofsky (Landick, R., and Yanofsky, C. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 363-377) in which the NusA protein acting as a subunit of RNA polymerase in the elongation complex contacts a structure near the 3' end of the nascent transcript and uses the binding energy to shift the equilibrium between elongation and paused conformational isomers of the transcription complex in favor of the paused isomer."
