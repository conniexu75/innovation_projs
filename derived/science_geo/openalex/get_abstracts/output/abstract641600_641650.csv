https://openalex.org/W2981347614,"Microglia dynamically survey the brain parenchyma. Microglial processes interact with neuronal elements; however, what role neuronal network activity plays in regulating microglial dynamics is not entirely clear. Most studies of microglial dynamics use either slice preparations or in vivo imaging in anesthetized mice. Here we demonstrate that microglia in awake mice have a relatively reduced process area and surveillance territory and that reduced neuronal activity under general anesthesia increases microglial process velocity, extension and territory surveillance. Similarly, reductions in local neuronal activity through sensory deprivation or optogenetic inhibition increase microglial process surveillance. Using pharmacological and chemogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that reduced norepinephrine signaling is necessary for these increases in microglial process surveillance. These findings indicate that under basal physiological conditions, noradrenergic tone in awake mice suppresses microglial process surveillance. Our results emphasize the importance of awake imaging for studying microglia-neuron interactions and demonstrate how neuronal activity influences microglial process dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2980678765,"Microglia are the brain's resident innate immune cells and also have a role in synaptic plasticity. Microglial processes continuously survey the brain parenchyma, interact with synaptic elements and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that control surveillance and its role in synaptic plasticity are poorly understood. Microglial dynamics in vivo have been primarily studied in anesthetized animals. Here we report that microglial surveillance and injury response are reduced in awake mice as compared to anesthetized mice, suggesting that arousal state modulates microglial function. Pharmacologic stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors recapitulated these observations and disrupted experience-dependent plasticity, and these effects required the presence of β2-adrenergic receptors in microglia. These results indicate that microglial roles in surveillance and synaptic plasticity in the mouse brain are modulated by noradrenergic tone fluctuations between arousal states and emphasize the need to understand the effect of disruptions of adrenergic signaling in neurodevelopment and neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2980879969,"Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness, emotions and learning. We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets underlying brain development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2980338959,"Learning drives behavioral adaptations necessary for survival. While plasticity of excitatory projection neurons during associative learning has been extensively studied, little is known about the contributions of local interneurons. Using fear conditioning as a model for associative learning, we found that behaviorally relevant, salient stimuli cause learning by tapping into a local microcircuit consisting of precisely connected subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. By employing deep-brain calcium imaging and optogenetics, we demonstrate that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons in the basolateral amygdala are activated by aversive events and provide a mandatory disinhibitory signal for associative learning. Notably, VIP interneuron responses during learning are strongly modulated by expectations. Our findings indicate that VIP interneurons are a central component of a dynamic circuit motif that mediates adaptive disinhibitory gating to specifically learn about unexpected, salient events, thereby ensuring appropriate behavioral adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2981275313,"Since 2012, the United States of America has experienced a biennial spike in pediatric acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)1–6. Epidemiologic evidence suggests non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) are a potential etiology, yet EV RNA is rarely detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)2. CSF from children with AFM (n = 42) and other pediatric neurologic disease controls (n = 58) were investigated for intrathecal antiviral antibodies, using a phage display library expressing 481,966 overlapping peptides derived from all known vertebrate and arboviruses (VirScan). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of AFM CSF RNA (n = 20 cases) was also performed, both unbiased sequencing and with targeted enrichment for EVs. Using VirScan, the viral family significantly enriched by the CSF of AFM cases relative to controls was Picornaviridae, with the most enriched Picornaviridae peptides belonging to the genus Enterovirus (n = 29/42 cases versus 4/58 controls). EV VP1 ELISA confirmed this finding (n = 22/26 cases versus 7/50 controls). mNGS did not detect additional EV RNA. Despite rare detection of EV RNA, pan-viral serology frequently identified high levels of CSF EV-specific antibodies in AFM compared with controls, providing further evidence for a causal role of non-polio EVs in AFM. Antibodies in CSF specific for viral peptides implicate enteroviruses in acute flaccid myelitis."

https://openalex.org/W2980725598,"Dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is mediated by two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, has been implicated in several neurological disorders1-3. Individuals carrying loss-of-function mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, a negative regulator of mTOR signaling, are prone to developing macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), seizures and intellectual disability2,4,5. It is generally believed that the neurological symptoms associated with loss of PTEN and other mTORopathies (for example, mutations in the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 or TSC2) are due to hyperactivation of mTORC1-mediated protein synthesis1,2,4,6,7. Using molecular genetics, we unexpectedly found that genetic deletion of mTORC2 (but not mTORC1) activity prolonged lifespan, suppressed seizures, rescued ASD-like behaviors and long-term memory, and normalized metabolic changes in the brain of mice lacking Pten. In a more therapeutically oriented approach, we found that administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting mTORC2's defining component Rictor specifically inhibits mTORC2 activity and reverses the behavioral and neurophysiological abnormalities in adolescent Pten-deficient mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that mTORC2 is the major driver underlying the neuropathophysiology associated with Pten-deficiency, and its therapeutic reduction could represent a promising and broadly effective translational therapy for neurological disorders where mTOR signaling is dysregulated."
https://openalex.org/W2981754274,"Cells of the adult nucleus pulposus (NP) are critically important in maintaining overall disc health and function. NP cells reside in a soft, gelatinous matrix that dehydrates and becomes increasingly fibrotic with age. Such changes result in physical cues of matrix stiffness that may be potent regulators of NP cell phenotype and may contribute to a transition toward a senescent and fibroblastic NP cell with a limited capacity for repair. Here, we investigate the mechanosignaling cues generated from changes in matrix stiffness in directing NP cell phenotype and identify mechanisms that can potentially preserve a biosynthetically active, juvenile NP cell phenotype. Using a laminin-functionalized polyethylene glycol hydrogel, we show that when NP cells form rounded, multicell clusters, they are able to maintain cytosolic localization of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A, a coactivator of serum-response factor (SRF), known to promote fibroblast-like behaviors in many cells. Upon preservation of a rounded shape, human NP cells similarly showed cytosolic retention of transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralogue PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) with associated decline in activation of its transcription factor TEA domain family member-binding domain (TEAD). When changes in cell shape occur, leading to a more spread, fibrotic morphology associated with stronger F-actin alignment, SRF and TEAD are up-regulated. However, targeted deletion of either cofactor was not sufficient to overcome shape-mediated changes observed in transcriptional activation of SRF or TEAD. Findings show that substrate stiffness-induced promotion of F-actin alignment occurs concomitantly with a flattened, spread morphology, decreased NP marker expression, and reduced biosynthetic activity. This work indicates cell shape is a stronger indicator of SRF and TEAD mechanosignaling pathways than coactivators MRTF-A and YAP/TAZ, respectively, and may play a role in the degeneration-associated loss of NP cellularity and phenotype.-Fearing, B.

https://openalex.org/W2981587894,"A core collection is a subset that represents genetic diversity of the total collection. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of major food and feed crops. It is the world's most cultivated annual herbaceous legume. Constructing a core collection for soybean could play a pivotal role in conserving and utilizing its genetic variability for research and breeding programs. To construct and evaluate a Korean soybean core collection, genotypic and phenotypic data as well as population structure, were analyzed. The Korean soybean core collection consisted of 430 accessions selected from 2,872 collections based on Affymetrix Axiom® 180k SoyaSNP array data. The core collection represented 99% of genotypic diversity of the total collection. Analysis of population structure clustered the core collection into five subpopulations. Accessions from South Korea and North Korea were distributed across five subpopulations. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that only 2.01% of genetic variation could be explained by geographic origins while 16.18% of genetic variation was accounted for by subpopulations. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) for days to flowering, flower color, pubescent color, and growth habit confirmed that the core collection had the same genetic diversity for tested traits as the total collection. The Korean soybean core collection was constructed based on genotypic information of the 180k SNP data. Size and phenotypic diversity of the core collection accounted for approximately 14.9% and 18.1% of the total collection, respectively. GWAS of core and total collections successfully confirmed loci associated with tested traits. Consequently, the present study showed that the Korean soybean core collection could provide fundamental and practical material and information for both soybean genetic research and breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2981735527,"Purpose Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is a valuable method for cell-based research but can provide unpredictable, misleading data about in vivo responses. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture environment to mimic tumor characteristics and cell-cell interactions to better characterize the tumor formation response to chemotherapy. Materials and methods We fabricated the 3D cell culture samples using a 3D cell bio printer and the bladder cancer cell line 5637. T24 cells were used for 2D cell culture. Then, rapamycin and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) were used to examine their cancer inhibition effects using the two bladder cancer cell lines. Cell-cell interaction was measured by measuring e-cadherin and n-cadherin secreted via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Results We constructed a 3D cell scaffold using gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and compared cell survival in 3D and 2D cell cultures. 3D cell cultures showed higher cancer cell proliferation rates than 2D cell cultures, and the 3D cell culture environment showed higher cell-to-cell interactions through the secretion of E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Assessment of the effects of drugs for bladder cancer such as rapamycin and BCG showed that the effect in the 2D cell culture environment was more exaggerated than that in the 3D cell culture environment. Conclusions We fabricated 3D scaffolds with bladder cancer cells using a 3D bio printer, and the 3D scaffolds were similar to bladder cancer tissue. This technique can be used to create a cancer cell-like environment for a drug screening platform."
https://openalex.org/W2981387499,"Fermented cereal-based foods play a crucial role in attaining food and nutrition security for resource-poor populations in sub-Saharan Africa. These products are widely produced by spontaneous fermentation using of cereal grains as raw material. They have a unique taste and flavour, are rich sources of energy and their non-alcoholic nature makes them ideal for consumption by the entire population, including children. Lactic acid bacteria dominate the fermentation process and lead to a low pH of around 4, which suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria, thereby increasing the shelf-life and safety of the food. Knowledge about processing practices, consumption patterns and bacterial communities is essential to regulate processing and design appropriate mixes of micro-organisms to produce starter cultures for commercial production of standard-quality fermented foods that meet desired quality characteristics. In four regions of Zambia, we surveyed processing practices and consumption patterns of a spontaneously fermented cereal-based beverage called Munkoyo, commonly produced in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Variations in processing practices exist in cooking time of the unfermented maize porridge and time allowed for fermentation. Consumption is mainly at household level and the product is considered as an energy drink. Characterisation of the bacterial communities of over 90 samples with 16S amplicon sequencing on DNA extracted from the entire bacterial community revealed six dominant families, namely Streptococcaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactabacillales, Bacillaceae and Aeromonadaceae, and a Shannon index of up to 1.18 with an effective number of 3.44 bacterial species. Bacterial communities that underlie the fermentation in Munkoyo differ in their composition for the different regions using common processing steps, suggesting that different combinations of bacteria can be used to achieve successful Munkoyo fermentation. Analysis of aroma profiles in 15 different samples from two different Provinces showed that aldehydes, esters, organic acids, alkanes, alkenes and alcohols dominated."
https://openalex.org/W2982193672,"Altered airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in airways are characteristic features of remodeling in asthma. Increased ECM production modulates ASM cell proliferation and leads to airway remodeling. Our previous studies showed that ASM from patients with asthma exhibited increased expression of estrogen receptor (ER)‐β, which upon activation down‐regulated ASM proliferation, implicating an important role for estrogen signaling in airway physiology. There is no current information on the effect of differential ER activation on ECM production. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ER‐α vs. ER‐β activation on ECM production, deposition, and underlying pathways. Primary human ASM cells isolated from asthmatics and nonasthmatics were treated with E 2 , an ER‐α agonist [propylpyrazoletriol (PPT)], and an ER‐β agonist [WAY‐200070 (WAY)] with TNF‐α or platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF) followed by evaluation of ECM production and deposition. Expression of proteins and genes corresponding to ECM were measured using Western blotting and quantitative RT‐PCR with subsequent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Molecular mechanisms of ER activation in regulating ECM were evaluated by luciferase reporter assays for activator protein 1 (AP‐1) and NF‐κB. TNF‐α or PDGF significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) increased ECM deposition and MMP activity in human ASM cells, which was significantly reduced with WAY treatment but not with PPT. Furthermore, TNF‐α‐ or PDGF‐induced ECM gene expression in ASM cells was significantly reduced with WAY ( P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, WAY significantly down‐regulated the activation of NF‐κB( P &lt; 0.001) and AP‐1 ( P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) in ASM cells from asthmatics and nonasthmatics. Overall, we demonstrate differential ER signaling in controlling ECM production and deposition. Activation of ER‐β diminishes ECM deposition via suppressing the NF‐κB pathway activity and might serve as a novel target to blunt airway remodeling.—Ambhore, N. S., Kalidhindi, R. S.

https://openalex.org/W2981647484,"The cause of antiseizure drug (ASD) resistance in epilepsy is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that is partly responsible for limited ASD brain uptake, which is thought to contribute to ASD resistance. We previously demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the prostaglandin E receptor, prostanoid E receptor subtype 1, are involved in seizure-mediated P-gp up-regulation. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting microsomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthase-1 (mPGES-1), the enzyme generating PGE2, prevents blood-brain barrier P-gp up-regulation after status epilepticus (SE). To test our hypothesis, we exposed isolated brain capillaries to glutamate ex vivo and used a combined in vivo-ex vivo approach by isolating brain capillaries from humanized mPGES-1 mice to study P-gp levels. We demonstrate that glutamate signaling through the NMDA receptor, cytosolic phospholipase A2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 increases P-gp protein expression and transport activity levels. We show that mPGES-1 is expressed in human, rat, and mouse brain capillaries. We show that BI1029539, an mPGES-1 inhibitor, prevented up-regulation of P-gp expression and transport activity in capillaries exposed to glutamate and in capillaries from humanized mPGES-1 mice after SE. Our data provide key signaling steps underlying seizure-induced P-gp up-regulation and suggest that mPGES-1 inhibitors could potentially prevent P-gp up-regulation in epilepsy.-Soldner, E. L. B., Hartz, A. M. S., Akanuma, S.-I., Pekcec, A., Doods, H., Kryscio, R. J., Hosoya, K.-I., Bauer, B.

https://openalex.org/W2982276576,"Strategic science communicators need to select tactics that can help them achieve both their short-term communication objectives and long-term behavioral goals. However, little previous research has sought to develop theory aimed at understanding what makes it more likely that a communicator will prioritize specific communication tactics. The current study aims to advance the development of a theory of strategic science communication as planned behavior based on the Integrated Behavioral Model. It does so in the context of exploring Canadian scientists’ self-reported willingness to prioritize six different tactics as a function of attitudinal, normative, and efficacy beliefs. The results suggest that scientists’ beliefs about ethicality, norms, response efficacy, and self-efficacy, are all meaningful predictors of willingness to prioritize specific tactics. Differences between scientists in terms of demographics and related variables provide only limited benefit in predicting such willingness."
https://openalex.org/W2981732760,"Gut microbiota is closely related to age. Studies from Europe and the U.S. identified featured microbiota in different age groups for the elderly. Asian studies mainly focused on people living in longevity areas. Featured microbiota for the elderly people of different age groups, especially in the centenarian in the general population, has not been well investigated in China.We conducted a comparative study by including 198 subjects of three age groups (65-70, 90-99, and 100+ years) in East China. Information regarding age, sex, height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, food preference, smoking status and alcohol consumption were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Fecal samples for each participant were collected as well. 16S rRNA gene sequencing were employed to analyze the gut microbiota composition. Logistic regression with LASSO feature selection was used to identify featured taxa in different age groups and to assess their potential interactions with other factors such as lifestyle.The gut microbiota of the 90-99 year and 100+ year age groups showed more diversity, robustness, and richness compared with the 65-70 year age group. PCoA analysis showed a clear separation between the 65-70 and 100+ year age groups. At the species level, Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides merdae, Ruminococcus gnavus, Coprococcus and Clostridium perfringens increased, but Bacteroides vulgatus, Ruminococcus sp.5139BFAA and Clostridium sp.AT5 decreased in the 90-99 year age group. The age differences in gut microbiota were similar across the strata of smoking, alcohol consumption status and food preference.Our study demonstrated age differences in many aspects of gut microbiota, such as overall diversity, microbiota structure, and relative abundance of key taxa. Moreover, the gut microbiota of centenarian was significantly different from those of younger age groups of the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2981409367,"Child malnutrition and maternal obesity are serious public health issues in Sri Lanka. This study explores the associations between socioeconomic status and the double burden of malnutrition among school-aged children and within their household. A total of 543 primary school children aged 5–10 years (204 boys and 339 girls) in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka, were included in the analysis. The nutritional statuses of thinness, normal, overweight, and obesity for children and mothers were defined according to WHO growth references and body mass index. Maternal education, household equivalent income, and maternal employment were used as socioeconomic status indicators. The proportion of child thinness and overweight was 19.3% and 13.4%, respectively, and that of maternal overweight (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2) was 36.5%. A positive correlation was found between maternal body mass index and the child’s body mass index for age z-score in older boys and younger girls. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that lower education of mothers posed a higher association with child thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.08–5.00). Mothers with overweight and obesity were less likely to have a child with thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval: 0.16–0.58). Maternal employment status and household equivalent income were not significantly, but marginally, associated with child overweight and obesity. Socioeconomic inequality combined with maternal nutritional status affected child malnutrition. These findings suggest that the underlying circumstances within households should be considered to improve child malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2980655481,"In this paper, a set of Dombi power partitioned Heronian mean operators of q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (qROFNs) are presented, and a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method based on these operators is proposed. First, the operational rules of qROFNs based on the Dombi t-conorm and t-norm are introduced. A q-rung orthopair fuzzy Dombi partitioned Heronian mean (qROFDPHM) operator and its weighted form are then established in accordance with these rules. To reduce the negative effect of unreasonable attribute values on the aggregation results of these operators, a q-rung orthopair fuzzy Dombi power partitioned Heronian mean operator and its weighted form are constructed by combining qROFDPHM operator with the power average operator. A method to solve MAGDM problems based on qROFNs and the constructed operators is designed. Finally, a practical example is described, and experiments and comparisons are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The demonstration results show that the method is feasible, effective, and flexible; has satisfying expressiveness; and can consider all the interrelationships among different attributes and reduce the negative influence of biased attribute values."
https://openalex.org/W2981471228,"Background Despite recent declines in consumption of sugary beverages, energy drinks (ED) and sodas continue to contribute a substantial amount of sugar and caffeine to the diet of youth. Consumption of these beverages has been linked with electronic device use, however in-depth associations between sugar and caffeine intake from energy drinks and sodas with various electronic devices are not clear. Objective Describe the relationship of soda and energy drink consumption and associated added sugar and caffeine intake with electronic device use among adolescents. Methods Secondary data from the 2013–2016 cycles of Monitoring the Future Survey, a national, repeated, cross-sectional study, were analyzed. Information on energy drink and soda consumption by students in grades 8 and 10 (n = 32,418) from 252–263 schools randomly sampled from all US states was used. Results Soda and energy drink consumption decreased each year from 2013–2016 while daily use of electronic devices remained stable. An additional hour/day of TV was linked to a 6.92g (6.31,7.48; p<0.001) increase in sugar intake and a 32% (OR = 1.32; 1.29,1.35; p < .001) higher risk of exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) recommended sugar intakes. Further, each hour/day of TV was linked to a 28% increased risk of exceeding caffeine recommendations (OR = 1.25–1.31; p<0.001). Each hour per day talking on a cellphone was associated with an increased risk of exceeding WHO sugar and caffeine intakes by 14% (OR = 1.11–1.16; p<0.001) and 18% (OR = 1.15–1.21; p<0.001) respectively. Video game use was only weakly linked to caffeine intake. Computer use for school was associated with lower likelihood of exceeding sugar intake cut-offs. Conclusion While a trend towards reduced energy drink and soda intake from 2013–2016 was evident, greater electronic device use, especially TV time, was linked to higher intake of beverage-derived added sugar and caffeine amongst adolescents. Addressing these behaviours through counselling or health promotion could potentially help to reduce excess sugar and caffeine intake from sodas and energy drinks among this population."
https://openalex.org/W2981983581,"Knowledge of the geographical distribution of soils is indispensable for policy and decision makers to achieve the goal of increasing agricultural production and reduce poverty, particularly in the Global South. A study was conducted to better understand the soilscapes of the Giba catchment (900-3300 m a.s.l.; 5133 km2) in northern Ethiopia, so as to sustain soil use and management. To characterise the chemical and physical properties of the different benchmark soils and to classify them in line with the World Reference Base of Soil Resources, 141 soil profile pits and 1381 soil augerings at representative sites were analysed. The dominant soil units identified are Leptosol and bare rock (19% coverage), Vertic Cambisol (14%), Regosol and Cambisol (10%), Skeletic/Leptic Cambisol and Regosol (9%), Rendzic Leptosol (7%), Calcaric/Calcic Vertisol (6%), Chromic Luvisol (6%) and Chromic/Pellic Vertisol (5%). Together these eight soil units cover almost 75% of the catchment. Topography and parent material are the major influencing factors that explain the soil distribution. Besides these two factors, land cover that is strongly impacted by human activities, may not be overlooked. Our soil suitability study shows that currently, after thousands of years of agricultural land use, a new dynamic equilibrium has come into existence in the soilscape, in which ca. 40% of the catchment is very suitable, and 25% is moderately suitable for agricultural production. In view of such large suitable areas, the Giba catchment has a good agricultural potential if soil erosion rates can be controlled, soil fertility (particularly nitrogen) increased, available water optimally used, and henceforth crop yields increased."

The objective of this survey was to evaluate the therapeutic and regenerative potential of stem cells from adipose tissue (ASCs) in the milk production recovery repair of tissue injury in mastitis goats treated with antimicrobial agents prior to cell therapy. After the diagnosis of mastitis and treatment with gentamicin, eight lactating goats were selected for cellular and subsequent therapy, physical-chemical analysis of milk, ultrasonographic and histopathological examinations. The ASCs were taken from the subcutaneous fat of a young goat cultivated in vitro, marked with Qdots-655 and injected in the left mammary gland, being the right mammary gland used as the control. After 30 days the ultrasonographic and histopathological analyzes were repeated and, in the first lactation period, the physical-chemical analysis of the milk was reapeated. Before the cellular therapy, the physical-chemical quality of the milk was compromised and the ultrasonographic and histopathological analysis revealed a chronic inflammatory process and fibrous tissue. The marking of the ASCs with Qdots enabled the tracking, by fluorescence microscopy (BX41-OLYMPUS), in the mammary tissue. In the ASCs therapy, cultures showed high cellularity and characteristics favorable to preclinical studies; with the therapy the physical-chemical parameters of the milk, fat, protein, temperature and pH showed significant differences among the groups; five animals treated with ASCs reconstituted the functionality of the gland and the connective tissue reduced in quantity and inflammatory infiltrate cells. ASCs have potential for the possible regeneration of fibrous mastitis lesions in the mammary gland, however, it would be necessary to increase injection time for the histopathological analysis, since the reconstitution of the glandular acini within the assessed period was not finalized. ASCs can be used to reestablish milk production in goat with chronic mastitis repair mammary lesions, with potential to be a promising clinical alternative for animal rehabilitation for productivity."

We sought to evaluate the influence of sarcopenia in patients with locally advanced, not metastasized, gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer undergoing curative treatment (perioperative chemotherapy and surgery) on morbidity and mortality in order to identify patients in need for nutritional intervention. Patients and methods Two-centre study, conducted in the Frankfurt University Clinic and Krankenhaus Nordwest (Frankfurt) as part of the University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT). 47/83 patients were treated in the FLOT trial (NCT01216644). Patients´ charts were reviewed for clinical data. Two consecutive CT scans were retrospectively analyzed to determine the degree of sarcopenia. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression. Results 60 patients (72.3%) were male and 23 (27.7%) female. 45 patients (54.2%) had GEJ type 1–3 and 38 (45.8%) gastric tumors, respectively. Sarcopenic patients were significantly older than non-sarcopenic patients (mean age 65.1 years vs. 59.5 years, p = 0.042), terminated the chemotherapy significantly earlier (50% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.037) and showed higher Clavien-Dindo scores, indicating more severe perioperative complications (score ≥3 43.3 vs. 17.0%, p = 0.019). Sarcopenic patients had a significantly shorter survival than non-sarcopenic patients (139.6 ± 19.5 [95% CI, 101.3–177.9] vs. 206.7 ± 13.8 [95% CI, 179.5–233.8] weeks, p = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, besides UICC stage, sarcopenia significantly influenced survival.

A total of 89 isolates identified as Strep. uberis from 86 dairy cows with CM in 17 dairy herds of Southeastern Brazil were genotyped using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. After genotyping, two clusters (I and II) were created according to RAPD types. A commercial broth microdilution test was used to determine the susceptibility of Strep. uberis isolates to 8 antimicrobials (ampicillin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, erythromycin, penicillin, penicillin+novobiocin, pirlimycin and tetracycline). For each antimicrobial, we determined the minimal inhibitory concentrations that inhibit 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of Strep. uberis strains. Differences in AMS among genotypic clusters were evaluated using mixed regression models. Overall, a great polymorphism (56 RAPD-types) was found among Strep. uberis isolates, although a higher genetic similarity (based on the PCR bands features) was observed within herds after genotypic clustering. No differences in AMS were observed among clusters. Strep. uberis isolated from bovine CM were resistant to most antimicrobials, with the exception of cephalothin and penicillin+novobiocin."

The increasing variability in the local climate due to global climate changes and the increasing severity of the ENSO phenomenon threatens rice production in the region, which has consequences for local and global food security. Though existing mapping efforts delineate the consequences of saline water intrusion during El Niño and flooding events during La Niña in the basin, research to predict future impacts in rice production is rather limited. The current work uses ORYZA, an ecophysiological model, combined with historical climate data, climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and 8.5 and climate-related risk maps to project the aggregate productivity and rice production impacts by the year 2050. Results show that in years of average salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop in the MRD would experience an average annual decrease of 720,450 tons for 2020-2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the baseline of 2005-2016 average and another 1.17 million tons under the RCP8.5 scenario. The autumn-winter crop would decrease by 331,480 tons under RCP4.5 and 462,720 tons under RCP8.5. In years of severe salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop would decrease by 2.13 million tons (10.29% lower than the projection for an average year) under RCP4.5 and 2.5 million tons (13.62%) under RCP8.5. Under severe conditions, the autumn-winter crop would have an average decrease of 1.3 million tons (7.36%) under RCP4.5 and 1.4 million tons (10.88%) for the RCP8.5 scenario. Given that most of the rice produced in this area is exported, a decline in rice supply at this scale would likely have implications on the global market price of rice affecting global food security. Such decline will also have implications for the rural economy and food security of Vietnam. Suggestions for corrective measures to reduce the impacts are briefly discussed."

The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) of each eye was measured, and binary images of the choroid were evaluated to compare the mean choroidal area and the luminal area.The mean SFCT was 170.5±75.3 μm in the eyes with OIS, 154.8±62.9 μm in the ipsilateral eyes with symptomatic CAS, and 277.5±73.2 μm in the right eyes of the control group patients (P<0.001). The mean choroidal area was 494,478.6±181,846.2 μm2 in the eyes with OIS, 453,750.0±196,725.8 μm2 in the ipsilateral eyes with symptomatic CAS, and 720,520±281,319.5 μm2 in the control group eyes (P = 0.036). The mean luminal area was 333,185.7±112,665.9 μm2 in the eyes with OIS, 313,983.3±132,032.1 μm2 in the ipsilateral eyes with symptomatic CAS, and 480,325.0±185,112.6 μm2 in the control group eyes (P = 0.046). The mean SFCT, mean choroidal area, and mean luminal area were significantly smaller in the eyes with OIS (P = 0.017, P = 0.005, and P = 0.004, respectively), and those with symptomatic CAS (P = 0.020, P = 0.016, and P = 0.021, respectively) than in the unaffected contralateral eyes. There were no significant differences between the eyes in the control group (P = 0.984, P = 284, and P = 0.413, respectively).The mean SFCT, mean choroidal area, and mean luminal area were significantly thinner in the eyes with OIS and the ipsilateral eyes with symptomatic CAS, compared with the control group eyes. The eyes with OIS and those with symptomatic CAS had significantly thinner SFCT, and smaller choroidal area and luminal area than the unaffected contralateral eyes. Choroid may reflect the vascular status of the carotid artery, indicated by choroidal thinning and decreasing choroidal area, especially luminal area."
https://openalex.org/W2982090664,"In the present global economic crisis and continued rapid urbanization, street food (SF) vending has grown into a practical source of income for people in the developing world. SF are not only appreciated for their unique flavours, convenience, and affordability they also contribute to the economy of the country, the perseverance of cultural and social heritage of society, as well as the potential for maintaining and improving the nutritional status of populations. This study aimed to develop a street food vending model (SFVM) that encompasses healthy and safe food options for consumers including hygiene and safety guidelines and viable business and operations for vendors. An evidence-based approach, i.e. ""systematically collected proof"", was used to inform the development of this model. Phase 1 included two surveys, one of street food vendors (N = 831) and the other of consumers (N = 1047). These surveys obtained data regarding the vendors' operations and food items they sold and the consumers' purchases and their nutrition knowledge. In Phase 2, interviews and focus groups were conducted with government officials. Additionally, regulations and policies regarding street vending were reviewed to determine available regulations and policies for street food vending. In Phase 3, data from the two phases were integrated and participatory action methods involving street food vendors used to validate the findings and inform the development of a SFVM by engaging in focus group discussions with street food vendors (N = 28). The components of the proposed SFVM comprised four parts, namely a food and nutrition component, a hygiene component, a business component and a vending cart. These components serve as a guide and considers various elements of the socioecological framework, namely intrapersonal/individual and interpersonal factors, the physical environment/community as well as the policy environment. The development of this model can serve as an example to countries which have large street food vending components and wish to optimize their value by making them safe and healthy for consumers. Thus, allowing vendors to trade under optimal conditions giving due consideration to regulations and policy."

The aim of the current study was to elucidate the physiologic and biochemical roles of p38γ in the heart. Expression and subcellular localization of p38 isoforms was determined in mouse hearts. Comparisons of the cardiac function and structure of wild-type and p38γ knockout (KO) mice at baseline and after abdominal aortic banding demonstrated that KO mice developed less ventricular hypertrophy and that contractile function is better preserved. To identify potential substrates of p38γ, we generated an analog-sensitive mutant to affinity tag endogenous myocardial proteins. Among other proteins, this technique identified calpastatin as a direct p38γ substrate. Moreover, phosphorylation of calpastatin by p38γ impaired its ability to inhibit the protease, calpain. We have identified p38γ as an important determinant of the progression of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy after aortic banding in mice. In addition, we have identified calpastatin, among other substrates, as a novel direct target of p38γ that may contribute to the protection observed in p38γKO mice.—Loonat, A. A., Martin, E.

https://openalex.org/W2981474234,"The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) revealed that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening could reduce lung cancer mortality in heavy smokers. Lung screening with LDCT was implemented in July 2019 as part of the National Cancer Screening Program in Korea for heavy smokers who meet NLST criteria [smokers aged 55-74 years with 30 pack-years (PY) or more, excluding former smokers with more than 15 years since smoking cessation]. This study evaluated NLST-eligible heavy smokers' adherence to general medical checkup and cancer screening guidelines.Using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2010 to 2012, we compared adherence of Korean adults (55-74 years, n = 5,480) to general medical checkup and cancer (gastric, colorectal, breast, and cervical) screening guidelines according to self-reported smoking status. Smoking and PY data were available, but no data indicating when former smokers ceased smoking were available. Accordingly, smoking status was only classified as NLST (smokers with a history ≥ 30 PY) and non-NLST. Individuals who met NLST criteria were subdivided into current (NLST-current) and former smokers (NLST-former). Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate adherence to screening recommendations as a function of the study group (NLST-current, NLST-former, non-NLST) using possible covariates (sociodemographic factors, health-related behaviors, comorbidities, and self-reported health status).Weighted prevalence of NLST-current was 9.7%, of NLST-former was 9.6%, and of non-NLST was 80.7%. Overall screening rates were 70.7% (medical checkup), 59.1% (stomach cancer), 58.1% (colorectal cancer), 59.1% (breast cancer), and 48.9% (cervical cancer). Adherence to colorectal cancer screening and medical checkup was lower in NLST-current than non-NLST (AOR 0.59; 95% CI 0.44-0.78 for colorectal cancer; AOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.95 for medical checkup). Screening practices for other cancers were not different.Current heavy smokers meeting NLST criteria were less likely to have colorectal cancer screening or general medical checkup. Understanding the screening practices of this target population might enable the development of more effective plans to implement lung screening and improve screening compliance for other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2981975346,"Bioprospection for potential microbial biocontrol agents associated with three major insect pests of economic relevance for olive cultivation in the Mediterranean area, namely the olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, the olive moth, Prays oleae, and the olive psyllid, Euphyllura olivina, led to the isolation of several strains of readily cultivable Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria from Tunisian olive orchards. Determination of 16S ribosomal RNA encoding sequences identified the bacteria as members of the taxonomic genus Providencia (Enterobacterales; Morganellaceae). A more detailed molecular taxonomic analysis based on a previously established set of protein-encoding marker genes together with DNA-DNA hybridization and metabolic profiling studies led to the conclusion that the new isolates should be organized in a new species within this genus. With reference to their original insect association, the designation ""Providencia entomophila"" is proposed here for this hypothetical new taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2982143458,"Maintaining sustainable fisheries requires understanding the influence of technological advances on catch efficiency, as technological creep can ultimately contribute to increased efficiency. Fisheries using light sources for attraction could be widely impacted by the shift to light emitting diode (LED) light systems. We studied the transition from kerosene lanterns to LED lamps in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, examining factors that led to adoption as well as the impact of the new light sources on fish catch and composition. We used a combination of field experiments with catch assessments, fisher surveys, underwater light spectra measurements, and cost assessments to evaluate the impact of switching from kerosene to LED lamps. Overall, we found a very rapid rate of adoption of homemade outdoor LED light systems in Lake Tanganyika. Most of the batteries used to power these lamps were charged from the city power grid, rather than photovoltaic cells, although the potential exists for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The LED light spectra was distinct from the kerosene light and penetrated much deeper into the water column. Regardless of light type, most of the fish caught within the two dominant species were below maturity. Although the LED lamps were associated with a slight increase in catch, environmental factors, particularly distance offshore, were generally more important in determining fish catch size and composition. The main advantages of the LED lamps were the lower operating costs and their robustness in bad weather. Thus, the primary effect of the use of battery-powered LED lighting systems to attract fish in Lake Tanganyika appears to reduce economic costs and increasing efficiency. However, overall the lake’s fishery remains vulnerable to overfishing."
https://openalex.org/W2981413711,"Dengue fever is an acute febrile infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). Despite the significant public health concerns posed by DENV, there are currently no effective anti-DENV therapeutic agents. To develop such drugs, a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms of DENV infection is needed. Both lipid metabolism and lipid synthesis are activated in DENV-infected cells, so we used lipid screening to identify potential antiviral lipid molecules. We identified 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylinositol (SAPI), which is the most abundant endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species, as an anti-DENV lipid molecule. SAPI suppressed the cytopathic effects induced by DENV2 infection as well as the replication of all DENV serotypes without inhibiting the entry of DENV2 into host cells. However, no other PI molecular species or PI metabolites, including lysophosphatidylinositols and phosphoinositides, displayed anti-DENV2 activity. Furthermore, SAPI suppressed the production of DENV2 infection-induced cytokines and chemokines, including C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)5, CCL20, C-X-C chemokine ligand 8, IL-6, and IFN-β. SAPI also suppressed the TNF-α production induced by LPS stimulation in macrophage cells differentiated from THP-1 cells. Our results demonstrated that SAPI is an endogenous inhibitor of DENV and modulated inflammatory responses in DENV2-infected cells, at least in part via TLR 4.-Sanaki, T., Wakabayashi, M., Yoshioka, T., Yoshida, R., Shishido, T., Hall, W.

https://openalex.org/W2981561690,"Oocyte cryopreservation is useful for preserving fertility and storing genetic resources. However, the small number of oocytes acquired using conventional treatment to induce superovulation and the reduction of fertility due to cryopreservation represent significant problems. Herein, we vitrified the oocytes derived through high-yield superovulation using inhibin antiserum and equine chorionic gonadotropin (IAS + eCG: IASe) and examined the yield of cryopreserved oocytes and survival rates relative to those of vitrified–warmed mouse oocytes derived through conventional superovulation using equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of N-acetyl cysteine on the fertility and developmental potential of vitrified–warmed oocytes derived using IASe. Compared with eCG, IASe increased the yield of cryopreserved oocytes and achieved equivalent survival rates. N-acetyl cysteine (0.5 mM) increased the fertilization rate of vitrified–warmed oocytes derived using IASe. Vitrification decreased thiol levels in the zona pellucida (ZP), while warming followed by N-acetyl cysteine treatment increased free thiol levels in ZP. Moreover, N-acetyl cysteine treatment recovered zona hardening by cleaving disulfide bonds and promoting the expansion of ZP. Two-cell embryos derived via in vitro fertilization using N-acetyl cysteine developed into normal pups through embryo transfer. Therefore, we developed an efficient technique for the production of cryopreserved oocytes using IASe through superovulation and found that N-acetyl cysteine improves the fertility of vitrified–warmed oocytes by cleaving the disulfide bonds and promoting the expansion of ZP."
https://openalex.org/W2981689439,"Household contact studies of tuberculosis (TB) are a common way to study disease transmission dynamics. However these studies lack a mechanism for accounting for community transmission, which is known to be significant, particularly in high burden settings. We illustrate a statistical approach for estimating both the correlates with transmission of TB in a household setting and the probability of community transmission using a modified Bayesian mixed-effects model. This is applied to two household contact studies in Vitória, Brazil from 2008–2013 and Kampala, Uganda from 1995–2004 that enrolled households with an individual that was recently diagnosed with pulmonary TB. We estimate the probability of community transmission to be higher in Uganda (ranging from 0.21 to 0.69, depending on HHC age and HIV status of the index case) than in Brazil (ranging from 0.13 for young children to 0.50 in adults). These estimates are consistent with a higher overall burden of disease in Uganda compared to Brazil. Our method also estimates an increasing risk of community-acquired TB with age of the household contact, consistent with existing literature. This approach is a useful way to integrate the role of the community in understanding TB disease transmission dynamics in household contact studies."

We assessed the magnitude and determinants of self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results in adults aged 15-59 years old in Mozambique.We performed a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 Mozambique Immunization indicators, Malaria and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA 2015). Eligible adults (15-59 years) from each selected household were interviewed and data on sociodemographic characteristics, HIV knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, and HIV testing history were collected. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results. Population representative estimates were calculated.13,028 (90.8%) of 14,343 eligible participants were interviewed. A total of 6,654 (51.1%) respondents had previously been tested for HIV and were included in the analysis. Of these, 308 (4.6%; 95% CI: 3.70-5.77) self-reported not having received HIV test results. In the multivariable analysis, previous sexually transmitted infection (aOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.44-5.31), HIV stigmatizing attitudes (aOR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.14-3.37), and lack of decision-making power towards health care seeking (aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.39-4.52) were associated with non-receipt of HIV test results. Whereas, secondary or higher education (aOR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12-0.54), higher HIV knowledge (aOR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26-0.86), and age between 30-34 and 35-39 years old (aOR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.80; and aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.27-0.90, respectively), were associated with receipt of HIV test results.In this nationally representative survey, self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results was high and of public health relevance.

Limited information is available with regard to potential resistance mechanisms to b-AP15/VLX1570. Results We found that b-AP15-induced cell death is cell-cycle dependent and that non-cycling tumor cells may evade b-AP15-induced cell death. Such non-cycling cells may re-enter the proliferative state to form colonies of drug-sensitive cells. Long-term selection of cells with b-AP15 resulted in limited drug resistance (~2-fold) that could be reversed by buthionine sulphoximine, implying altered glutathione (GSH) metabolism as a resistance mechanism. In contrast, drug uptake and overexpression of drug efflux transporters were found not to be associated with b-AP15 resistance. Conclusions The proteasome DUB inhibitors b-AP15/VLX1570 are cell cycle-active. The slow and incomplete development of resistance towards these compounds is an attractive feature in view of future clinical use."

Little is known about the effect of exogenous factors (including enteric pathogens) on the colonic TPP uptake process. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effect of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection on colonic uptake of TPP. We used human-derived colonic epithelial NCM460 cells and mice in our investigation. The results showed that infecting NCM460 cells with live EHEC (but not with heat-killed EHEC, EHEC culture supernatant, or with non-pathogenic E. Coli) to lead to a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated TPP uptake, as well as in level of expression of the TPPT protein and mRNA. Similarly, infecting mice with EHEC led to a significant inhibition in colonic TPP uptake and in level of expression of TPPT protein and mRNA. The inhibitory effect of EHEC on TPP uptake by NCM460 was found to be associated with reduction in the rate of transcription of the SLC44A4 gene as indicated by the significant reduction in the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter transfected into EHEC infected cells. The latter was also associated with a marked reduction in the level of expression of the transcription factors CREB-1 and ELF3, which are known to drive the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter. Finally, blocking the ERK1/2 and NF-kB signaling pathways in NCM460 cells significantly reversed the level of EHEC inhibition in TPP uptake and TPPT expression. Collectively, these findings show, for the first time, that EHEC infection significantly inhibit colonic uptake of TPP, and that this effect appears to be exerted at the level of SLC44A4 transcription and involves the ERK1/2 and NF-kB signaling pathways."

To better understand how long-term immunosuppression impacts the immune control of this EBV re-emergence, we systematically compared 10 clinically stable KTRs to 30 healthy controls (HCs). The EBV-specific T cell responses were determined in both groups by multiparameter flow cytometry with intra cellular cytokine staining (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15) and ELISpot-IFNγ assays (KTRs n = 7; HCs n = 7). The T/B/NK cell counts (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 30) and the NK/T cell differentiation and activation phenotypes (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15/30) were also measured. We show that in KTRs, the Th1 effector CD4+ T cell responses against latent EBV proteins are weak (2/7 responders). Conversely, the frequencies total EBV-specific CD8+T cells are conserved in KTRs (n = 10) and span a wider range of EBNA-3A peptides (5/7responders) than in HCs (5/7responders). Those modifications of the EBV-specific T cell response were associated with a profound CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in KTRs compared to HCs, involving the naïve CD4+ T cell subset, and a persistent activation of highly-differentiated senescent CD8+ T cells. The proportion of total NK / CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 was also increased in KTRs. Noteworthy, PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells normalized with time after transplantation. In conclusion, we show modifications of the EBV-specific cellular immunity in long term transplant recipients. This may be the result of both persistent EBV antigenic stimulation and profound immunosuppression induced by anti-rejection treatments. These findings provide new insights into the immunopathology of EBV infection after renal transplantation."

Selective inhibition of HDAC6 activity might be a potential treatment for AKI. In our lab, N-hydroxy-6-(4-(methyl(2-methylquinazolin-4-yl)amino)phenoxy)nicotinamide (F7) has been synthesized and inhibited HDAC6 activity with the IC50 of 5.8 nM. However, whether F7 possessed favorable renoprotection against rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI and the involved mechanisms remained unclear. In the study, glycerol-injected mice developed severe AKI symptoms as indicated by acute renal dysfunction and pathological changes, accompanied by the overexpression of HDAC6 in tubular epithelial cells. Pretreatment with F7 at a dose of 40 mg/kg/d for 3 days significantly attenuated serum creatinine, serum urea, renal tubular damage and suppressed renal inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, F7 enhanced the acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin to reduce HDAC6 activity. Glycerol-induced AKI triggered multiple signal mediators of NF-κB pathway as well as the elevation of ERK1/2 protein and p38 phosphorylation. Glycerol also induced the high expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-6 in kidney and human renal proximal tubule HK-2 cells. Treatment of F7 notably improved above-mentioned inflammatory responses in the injured kidney tissue and HK-2 cell. Overall, these data highlighted that 2-methylquinazoline derivative F7 inhibited renal HDAC6 activity and inflammatory responses to protect against rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI."

https://openalex.org/W2981969643,"This study sought to investigate whether force perceptual bias was affected by differences in posture while steering an automobile using a psychophysical experiment to examine the relationship with muscle activity. The human perceptual characteristics of weight and force are known to be nonlinear, and a perceptual bias can occur, that is, bias that causes a perception of something that is larger or smaller than the actual scale. This is considered to be caused by physical and/or psychological conditions. Sense of effort is believed to be one influential factor. It is known to correlate with muscle activity intensity, and bias may be caused by muscle activity changes. In the current study, we hypothesized that force perceptual bias would depend on posture due to the intensity of muscle activity changes caused by changing postures during steering operation. By investigating this hypothesis, we can clarify the relationship between sense of effort and muscle activity. To investigate this issue, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to confirm postural dependence, and estimated muscle activity using a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model simulation with postural and arm force data during the experiment. In addition, prediction of bias was conducted based on a simulation in the psychophysical experiment using these data. The results revealed that bias existed, as measured by differences in postures. Additionally, a significant moderate correlation was found between the predicted bias and the actual bias, indicating the existence of a relationship between muscle activity and bias."
https://openalex.org/W2981525164,"Evidence of perpetrators' biological or situational circumstances has been increasingly brought to bear in courtrooms. Yet, research findings are mixed as to whether this information influences folk evaluations of perpetrators' dispositions, and subsequently, evaluations of their deserved punishments. Previous research has not clearly dissociated the effects of information about perpetrators' genetic endowment versus their environmental circumstances. Additionally, most research has focused exclusively on violations involving extreme physical harm, often using mock capital sentences cases as examples. To address these gaps in the literature, we employed a ""switched-at-birth"" paradigm to investigate whether positive or negative information about perpetrators' genetic or environmental backgrounds influence evaluations of a perpetrator's mental states, character, and deserved punishment. Across three studies, we varied whether the transgression involved direct harm, an impure act that caused no harm, or a case of moral luck. The results indicate that negative genetic and environmental backgrounds influenced participants' evaluations of perpetrators' intentions, free will, and character, but did not influence participants' punishment decisions. Overall, these results replicate and extend existing findings suggesting that perpetrators' supposed extenuating circumstances may not mitigate the punishment that others assign to them."

The current study examines whether strengthening of community-led organizations and community collectivization have been instrumental in reducing the financial vulnerability and empowering FSWs in terms of their self-efficacy, confidence, and individual agency in India.This study used a panel data of 2085 FSWs selected from 38 COs across five states of India. Two rounds of data (Round 1 in 2015 and Round 2 in 2017) were collected among FSWs. Data were collected both at CO and individual level. CO level data was used to assess the CO strength. Individual level data was used to measure financial security, community collectivization, and individual empowerment.There was a significant improvement in CO strength and community collectivization from Round 1 to Round 2. High CO strength has led to improved financial security among FSWs (R2: 85% vs. R1: 51%, AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.5-4.1) from Round 1 to Round 2. High collective efficacy and community ownership have improved the financial security of FSWs during the inter-survey period. Further, the improvement in financial security in the inter-survey period led to increased or sustained individual empowerment (in terms of self-confidence, self-efficacy, and individual agency) among FSWs.Institutional strengthening and community mobilization programs are key to address the structural issues and the decrease of financial vulnerability among FSWs. In addition, enhanced financial security is very important to sustain or improve the individual empowerment of FSWs.

In the brain, NAA is considered an important energy metabolite for lipid synthesis. However, the role of NAA in peripheral tissues remained elusive. Therefore, we characterized the metabolic phenotype of knockout (ko) and adipose tissue‐specific (ako) Nat8l ‐ko mice as well as NAA‐supplemented mice on various diets. We identified an important role of NAA availability in the brain during adolescence, as 75% of Nat8l ‐ko mice died on fat‐free diet (FFD) after weaning but could be rescued by NAA supplementation. In adult life, NAA deficiency promotes a beneficial metabolic phenotype, as Nat8l ‐ko and Nat8l ‐ako mice showed reduced body weight, increased energy expenditure, and improved glucose tolerance on chow, high‐fat, and FFDs. Furthermore, Nat8l ‐deficient adipocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, and an induction of browning. Conversely, NAA‐treated wild‐type mice showed reduced adipocyte respiration and lipolysis and increased de novo lipogenesis, culminating in reduced energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, our data point to a possible role of NAA as modulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and suggest NAA as a critical energy metabolite for adipocyte and whole‐body energy homeostasis.—Hofer, D.

https://openalex.org/W2981535732,"The study on the impact of video lecturing on clicker-assisted English flipped class was necessary because it has seldom been explored.This study studied the impact of video lecturing on student satisfaction and English proficiency, plus correlations between student satisfaction levels and English proficiency.Randomly recruited Chinese participants (Female N = 44; Male N = 43) from a university in China received both pre and post College English Test Band 4 and satisfaction measurements, together with a semi-structured interview.We concluded that the video-assisted class could cause significantly higher English proficiency than the non-video-assisted class (F = 23.17, p < .001, Partialη2 = .216); there were significant differences between video- and non-video-assisted cohorts for post interaction (F = 8.37, p = .005, Partialη2 = .093), post efficacy (F = 7.68, p = .007, Partialη2 = .086), and post regulation (F = 16.34, p < .001, Partialη2 = .166); there were strong, positive relationships between post English proficiency and post student interaction (R2 = .70; β = .84; p < .01), self-efficacy (R2 = .57; β = .75; p < .01) and self-regulation (R2 = .59; β = .77; p < .01) levels in both cohorts at the .05 level. However, no strong, positive correlations were found in both cohorts at the .05 level between pre English proficiency and pre student interaction (R2 = .00; β = .05; p = .33), self-efficacy [R2 = .03;β = -.17 (negative); p = .05] and self-regulation [R2 = .05;β = -.23 (negative); p = .01] levels. Future research into video-assisted English flipped class may need interdisciplinary cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2981858793,"Liver transplant (LT) programs in Germany increasingly face a multiethnic patient population. To date no outcome data for LT in patients with a history of migration is available for Germany. This complicates decision-making before wait-listing such patients. We conducted a single-center cohort analysis of all primary LT between April 2007 and December 2015, stratified for the history of migration to investigate differences in the outcome. We found transplant rates resembling the proportion of persons with a history of migration in the general public in the region of our center. Differences were found concerning age at LT and prevalence of underlying diseases. Re-Transplant rates, Kaplan-Meier Estimates for overall survival, also after stratification for viral hepatitis, sex, ethnicity or presence of a language-barrier showed no statistical differences. The multivariate analysis showed no migration-related covariate associated with a negative outcome. These results stand in contrast to most of the previous evidence from North America and the UK and need to be taken into consideration during the wait-listing process of patients with a history of migration in need of a LT in centers in the Eurotransplant region."
https://openalex.org/W2981951478,"The relationship among blood donation, cognition in blood donation and health condition of blood donors remains unclear. Based on our hypothesis, this study aimed to explore the mediating effect of cognition in blood donation on the relationship between blood donation and blood donors' health status.A total of 837 participants who had prior experience in donating whole blood were recruited into a cross-sectional survey. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Questionnaire on Cognition in Non-remunerated Blood Donation were used to evaluate the health status and the level of cognition in blood donation, respectively. Blood donation referred to the cumulative times of blood donation. The mediating effect of cognition in blood donation was analyzed by applying a path model.The results revealed that blood donation was positively related to the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) of SF-36, and cognition in blood donation was shown to have a partial mediating effect on the relationship between blood donation and both PCS and MCS. The effect size of cognition in blood donation was 24.63% in PCS and 26.72% in MCS.Blood donation is positively correlated with SF-36 outcomes (PCS and MCS) of blood donors, and cognition in blood donation plays a partial mediating effect in the relationship between blood donation and PCS and MCS."
https://openalex.org/W2981784861,"Urothelial cancer (UC) is one of the most common cancers in Europe and is also one of the costliest to treat. When first line therapies show initial success, around 50% of cancers relapse and proceed to metastasis. In this study we assessed the Protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (PIAS)1 as a potential therapeutic target in urothelial cancer. PIAS1 is a key regulator of STAT1 signalling and may be implicated in carcinogenesis. In contrast to other cancer types PIAS1 protein expression is not significantly different in malignant areas of UC specimens compared to non-malignant tissue. In addition, we found that down-regulation and overexpression of PIAS1 had no effect on the viability or colony forming ability of tested cell lines. Whilst other studies of PIAS1 suggest an important biological role in cancer, this study shows that PIAS1 has no influence on reducing the cytotoxic effects of Cisplatin or cell recovery after DNA damage induced by irradiation. Taken together, these in vitro data demonstrate that PIAS1 is not a promising therapeutic target in UC cancer as previously shown in different entities such as prostate cancer (PCa)."
https://openalex.org/W2981391922,"On-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) has been associated with better inflammatory markers profile and survival than low-flux hemodialysis (HD). This study aimed at determining the effect of HDF vs HD on hs-TnT and echocardiography parameters evolution at one year follow-up.Patients were randomized from 2007 to 2013 to HD or HDF in accordance with the CONvective TRAnsport STudy protocol initially as part of the Montreal cohort and subsequently as part of a local cohort. Pre-dialysis hs-TnT were analyzed at baseline and 1-year follow-up.A total of 54 HDF patients and 59 HD patients were included. At baseline, median hs-TnT value was 49 ng/L (IQR 31-89) in the HDF group vs. 60 ng/L (36-96) in the HD group (p = 0.370). At one year follow-up, median hs-TnT remained stable in the HDF group (p = 0.707 vs. baseline), but significantly increased to 62 ng/L (40-104) in the HD group (p = 0.021 vs. baseline). The median variation (delta) in hs-TnT values was -3 ng/L (IQR -7-+8) in the HDF group vs. +8 ng/L (-5 -+25) in the HD group (p = 0.042). In the HDF group, LVEF increased from 60.0% (IQR 55.0-65.0) at baseline to 65.0% (60.0-65.5) at 1-year follow-up (p = 0.040) whereas it remained stable in the HD group (LVEF of 60.0% [IQR 55.0-65.0] at baseline and 65.0% [55.0-65.0] at 1-year follow-up [p = 0.312]).High-efficiency HDF is associated with stability in hs-TnT values, whereas low-flux HD is associated with significant increase in hs-TnT levels."
https://openalex.org/W2981695669,"Introduction Obesity and overweight strongly contribute to increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and are becoming a worldwide health issue. The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in Latin America. Child obesity is a major issue. Fast food is strongly suspected of contributing to this epidemic of obesity, although there is a lack of evidence. Methods We studied the correlation between the number of McDonald restaurants and overweight and obesity prevalence by region stratified by gender and age. Data on prevalences were obtained within national studies conducted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Three age sub-groups were analyzed: 5 to 9-year-olds, 10 to 19-year-olds and over 19-year-olds. Results There was a very strong positive correlation between overweight rates and the number of McDonald restaurants for both males and females between 5 and 9 years old (R2 respectively = 0.92 and 0.84) and a strong positive correlation for females between 10 and 19 years old (R2 = 0.68). There was a very strong positive correlation between obesity rates and the number of McDonald restaurants for males between 5 and 9 years old (R2 = 0.95). This positive correlation was strong for both males and females between 10 and 19 years old (R2 respectively = 0.77 and 0.63). Other correlations were not significant. Conclusion A strong correlation between the prevalence of overweight and obesity and the number of McDonald restaurants was found for Brazilian children and was most important within the group of youngest children. These results should be taken into consideration by education and prevention campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2982235553,"In acute ischemic stroke, blood pressure (BP) tends to rise initially and fall to a baseline level within 24-48 hours. Previous studies reported several different effects of BPs during acute ischemic stroke on clinical outcomes, which was partly due to the different time intervals from stroke onset to BP measurement.All patients with acute ischemic stroke (onset ≤3 hours) who lived independently before the stroke, were consecutively enrolled for a 62-month period. BPs at 0, 12, and 24 hours after admission were collected. A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 at discharge. For different standards of BP management, patients were grouped and analyzed according to intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and favorable outcome.Among the 446 enrolled patients, 227 patients underwent IV tPA treatment and 216 had mRS score 0-2 at discharge. Patients with favorable outcomes had lower initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, less frequent progressive neurological deficits, and lower systolic BP (SBP) 12 and 24 hours after admission than patients with unfavorable outcomes, regardless of whether they underwent tPA treatment or not (p <0.05). The BP decreased over a period of 24 hours after admission. In logistic regression analysis, the independent variables associated with favorable outcome were the initial NIHSS score, a progressive neurological deficit, a previous stroke, and the SBP 24 hours after admission in the patients who underwent tPA treatment and the initial NIHSS score and a progressive neurological deficit in the patients who did not undergo tPA treatment (p <0.05).The SBPs at 12 and 24 hours after admission were lower in acute stroke patients with favorable outcomes than in the other patients, regardless of whether the patients underwent tPA therapy and the SBP at 24 hours was an independent predictor of favorable outcomes among the patients who underwent tPA treatment."
