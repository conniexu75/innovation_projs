https://openalex.org/W2159511216,"Solid-phase chemistry, photolabile protecting groups, and photolithography have been combined to achieve light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical synthesis to yield a highly diverse set of chemical products. Binary masking, one of many possible combinatorial synthesis strategies, yields 2n compounds in n chemical steps. An array of 1024 peptides was synthesized in ten steps, and its interaction with a monoclonal antibody was assayed by epifluorescence microscopy. High-density arrays formed by light-directed synthesis are potentially rich sources of chemical diversity for discovering new ligands that bind to biological receptors and for elucidating principles governing molecular interactions. The generality of this approach is illustrated by the light-directed synthesis of a dinucleotide. Spatially directed synthesis of complex compounds could also be used for microfabrication of devices."

https://openalex.org/W2083217753,"An inducible rabbit endothelial adhesion molecule that is selective for mononuclear leukocytes has been identified. This adhesion protein was expressed on the surface of activated cultured endothelium in two forms, 118 and 98 kilodaltons, the amino-terminal sequence of each being highly homologous to human VCAM-1. In dietary hypercholesterolemic and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit models of atherosclerosis, this adhesion molecule was found to be expressed in a localized fashion by aortic endothelium that overlies early foam cell lesions. This lesion-localized expression suggests a potential endothelium-dependent mechanism for mononuclear leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis and may provide a molecular marker for early atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4240367950,"Using a sensitive assay for RNA expression, we identified several abnormally spliced transcripts in which exons from a candidate tumor suppressor gene (DCC) were scrambled during the splicing process in vivo. Cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified segments of the abnormally spliced transcripts showed that exons were joined accurately at consensus splice sites, but in an order different from that present in the primary transcript. Four scrambled transcripts were identified, each involving a different pair of exons. The scrambled transcripts were found at relatively low levels in a variety of normal and neoplastic cells of rodent and human origin, primarily in the nonpolyadenylated component of cytoplasmic RNA. These results demonstrate that the splicing process does not always pair sequential exons in the order predicted from their positions in genomic DNA, thus creating a novel type of RNA product."

https://openalex.org/W2136633961,"Individual classes of neural cells differentiate at distinct locations in the developing vertebrate nervous system. We provide evidence that the pattern of cell differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the chick neural tube is regulated by signals derived from two ventral midline cell groups, the notochord and floor plate. Grafting an additional notochord or floor plate to ectopic positions, or deleting both cell groups, resulted in changes in the fate and position of neural cell types, defined by expression of specific antigens. These results suggest that the differentiation of neural cells is controlled, in part, by their position with respect to the notochord and floor plate."
https://openalex.org/W1983501834,"Many growth factors regulate the cytoplasmic Raf-1 protein kinase, consistent with its having a central role in transduction of growth signals. The kinase is ubiquitously expressed and can promote proliferation, presumably in a manner dependent on growth-factor receptors and membrane-associated oncogenes. We have now examined the dependence of serum- and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-regulated NIH/3T3 cell growth on RAF-1 kinase to determine whether Raf-1 is essential for receptor signalling. We inhibited Raf-1 function by expressing c-raf-1 antisense RNA or kinase-defective c-raf-1 mutants. Antisense RNA for c-raf-1 interferes with proliferation of normal NIH/3T3 cells and reverts raf-transformed cells. In revertant cells, DNA replication induced by serum or TPA was eliminated or reduced proportionately to the reduction in Raf protein levels. Expression of a kinase-defective Raf-1 mutant (craf301) or a regulatory domain fragment (HCR) inhibited serum-induced NIH/3T3-cell proliferation and raf transformation even more efficiently. Inhibition by antisense RNA or craf301 blocked proliferation and transformation by Ki- and Ha-ras oncogenes. We conclude that raf functions as an essential signal transducer downstream of serum growth factor receptors, protein kinase C and ras."

Hu-PBL-SCID mice infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) contained virus that was recoverable by culture from the peritoneal cavity, spleen, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes for up to 16 weeks after infection; viral sequences were also detected by in situ hybridization and by amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mice could be infected with multiple strains of HIV-1, including LAV-1/Bru, IIIB, MN, SF2, and SF13. HIV-1 infection affected the concentration of human immunoglobulin and the number of CD4+ T cells in the mice. These results support the use of the hu-PBL-SCID mouse for studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2030825429,"Rotationally resonant magnetization exchange, a new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique for measuring internuclear distances between like spins in solids, was used to determine the distance between the C-8 and C-18 carbons of retinal in two model compounds and in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. Magnetization transfer between inequivalent spins with an isotropic shift separation, delta, is driven by magic angle spinning at a speed omega r that matches the rotational resonance condition delta = n omega r, where n is a small integer. The distances measured in this way for both the 6-s-cis- and 6-s-trans-retinoic acid model compounds agreed well with crystallographically known distances. In bacteriorhodopsin the exchange trajectory between C-8 and C-18 was in good agreement with the internuclear distance for a 6-s-trans configuration [4.2 angstroms (A)] and inconsistent with that for a 6-s-cis configuration (3.1 A). The results illustrate that rotational resonance can be used for structural studies in membrane proteins and in other situations where diffraction and solution NMR techniques yield limited information."
https://openalex.org/W2065867057,"GAL4 derivatives containing an activation domain alleviated repression of a promoter during nucleosome assembly. A GAL4 derivative lacking an activation domain stably bound the promoter during nucleosome assembly but was not sufficient to preserve promoter function. The activation domain of GAL4 derivatives was essential for preserving promoter function, and thus the transcriptional stimulatory activity attributable to these activation domains increased dramatically during nucleosome assembly. Furthermore, promoter-bound activation domains allowed the formation of preinitiation complexes after nucleosome assembly. Finally, GAL4 derivatives containing activation domains significantly stimulated transcription through bacterially produced yeast TFIID only from nucleosome-assembled templates. These data indicate that acidic activation domains stimulate transcription by enhancing the ability of basal transcription factors to compete with nucleosomes for occupancy of the promoter."

https://openalex.org/W2061699094,"Transfer of a normal Chinese hamster X chromosome (carried in a mouse A9 donor cell line) to a nickel-transformed Chinese hamster cell line with an Xq chromosome deletion resulted in senescense of these previously immortal cells. At early passages of the A9/CX donor cells, the hamster X chromosome was highly active, inducing senescence in 100% of the colonies obtained after its transfer into the nickel-transformed cells. However, senescence was reduced to 50% when Chinese hamster X chromosomes were transferred from later passage A9 cells. Full senescing activity of the intact hamster X chromosome was restored by treatment of the donor mouse cells with 5-azacytidine, which induced demethylation of DNA. These results suggest that a senescence gene or genes, which may be located on the Chinese hamster X chromosome, can be regulated by DNA methylation, and that escape from senescence and possibly loss of tumor suppressor gene activity can occur by epigenetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2009962187,"When humans listen to pairs of thnes they hear additional tones, or distortion products, that are not present in the stimulus. Two-tone distortion products are also known as combination tones, because their pitches match combinations of the primary frequencies (f1 and f2, f2 greater than f1), such as f2-f1, (n + 1)f1-nf2 and (n + 1)f2-nf1 (n = 1, 2, 3...). Physiological correlates of the perceived distortion products exist in responses of auditory-nerve fibres and inner hair cells and in otoacoustic emissions (sounds generated by the cochlea, recordable at the ear canal). Because the middle ear responds linearly to sound and neural responses to distortion products can be abolished by damage to hair cells at cochlear sites preferentially tuned to the frequencies of the primary tones, it was hypothesized that distortion products are generated at these sites and propagate mechanically along the basilar membrane to the location tuned to the distortion-product frequency. But until now, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have failed. Here we report the use of a new laser-velocimetry technique to demonstrate two-tone distortion in basilar-membrane motion at low and moderate stimulus intensities."
https://openalex.org/W1963787703,"We have completed a long-range restriction map of the terminal region of the short arm of human chromosome 16 (16p13.3) by physically linking a distal genetic locus (α-globin) with two recently isolated probes to telomere-associated repeats (TelBam3.4 and TelBam11). Comparison of 47 chromosomes has revealed major polymorphic length variation in this region: we have Identified three alleles in which the α-globin genes lie 170 kb, 350 kb, or 430 kb from the telomere. The two most common alleles contain different terminal segments, starting 145 kb distal to the α-globin genes. Beyond this boundary these alleles are non-homologous, yet each contains sequences related to other (different) chromosome termini. This chromosome size polymorphism has probably arisen by occasional exchanges between the subtelomeric regions of nonhomologous chromosomes; analogous length variation is likely to be present at other human telomeres."

https://openalex.org/W2025004563,"Rhodopsin and the visual pigments are a distinct group within the family of G-protein-linked receptors in that they have a covalently bound ligand, the 11-cis-retinal chromophore, whereas all of the other receptors bind their agonists through noncovalent interactions. The retinal chromophore in rhodopsin is bound by means of a protonated Schiff base linkage to the epsilon-amino group of Lys-296. Two rhodopsin mutants have been constructed, K296G and K296A, in which the covalent linkage to the chromophore is removed. Both mutants form a pigment with an absorption spectrum close to that of the wild type when reconstituted with the Schiff base of an n-alkylamine and 11-cis-retinal. In addition, the pigment formed from K296G and the n-propylamine Schiff base of 11-cis-retinal was found to activate transducin in a light-dependent manner, with 30 to 40% of the specific activity measured for the wild-type protein. It appears that the covalent bond is not essential for binding of the chromophore or for catalytic activation of transducin."
https://openalex.org/W1981937815,"Mustached bats orient and find insects by emitting ultrasonic pulses and analyzing the returning echoes. Neurons in the Doppler-shifted constant-frequency (DSCF) and frequency-modulated (FM-FM) areas of the auditory cortex form maps of echo frequency (target velocity) and echo delay (target range), respectively. Bats were trained to discriminate changes in echo frequency or delay, and then these areas were selectively inactivated with muscimol. Inactivation of the DSCF area disrupted frequency but not delay discriminations; inactivation of the FM-FM area disrupted delay but not frequency discriminations. Thus, focal inactivation of specific cortical maps produces specific disruptions in the perception of biosonar signals."

https://openalex.org/W2027324878,Artificial networks can be used to identify hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra of complex oligosaccharides. Feed-forward neural networks with back-propagation of errors can distinguish between spectra of oligosaccharides that differ by only one glycosyl residue in twenty. The artificial neural networks use features of the strongly overlapping region of the spectra (hump region) as well as features of the resolved regions of the spectra (structural reporter groups) to recognize spectra and efficiently recognized 1H-NMR spectra even when the spectra were perturbed by minor variations in their chemical shifts. Identification of spectra by neural network-based pattern recognition techniques required less than 0.1 second. It is anticipated that artificial neural networks can be used to identify the structures of any complex carbohydrate that has been previously characterized and for which a 1H-NMR spectrum is available.
https://openalex.org/W1596298885,"When the enzymatically active A-fragment of diphtheria toxin is translocated to the cytosol, the B-fragment inserts into the membrane in such a way that a 25-kDa polypeptide becomes shielded from proteases added to the external medium. We have attempted to determine the boundaries of this polypeptide within the toxin B-fragment as well as the topology of the B-fragment in the membrane. Chemical cleavage of the 25-kDa polypeptide with hydroxylamine and o-iodosobenzoic acid yielded fragments of sizes indicating that the 25-kDa polypeptide starts at residue approximately 300 and extends to the COOH-terminal end. Experiments where the toxin was labeled with [35S]cysteine at distinct positions of the B-fragment supported this conclusion. Treatment of cells with inserted B-fragment with L-1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and with V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus yielded protected 27- and 30-kDa fragments in addition to 25 kDa, indicating that the region 240-264 is also at the outside. The topology of the inserted B-fragment is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2005660376,"The limited competence of embryonic tissue to respond to an inductive signal has an essential, regulatory function in embryonic induction. The molecular basis for the competence of Xenopus ectoderm to differentiate into neural tissue was investigated. Dorsal mesoderm or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) caused in vivo activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and neural differentiation mainly in dorsal ectoderm and to a lesser extent in ventral ectoderm. These data correlate with the observations that PKC preparations from dorsal and ventral ectoderm differ, the dorsal PKC preparation being more susceptible to activation by TPA and diolein than is the ventral PKC preparation. Monoclonal antibodies against the bovine PKC alpha plus beta or gamma isozymes immunostained dorsal and ventral ectoderm, respectively, which suggests different localizations of PKC isozymes. These results suggest that PKC participates in the establishment of embryonic competence."
https://openalex.org/W2045877975,"The reaction of ninhydrin with amino acids can be used in carbon isotopic studies of protein. The reaction can be applied to extract as carbon dioxide only peptide-bonded carbon in proteinaceous material, thus avoiding most, if not all, contaminants. Test radiocarbon dates on ancient bone indicate that the method provides reliable ages, and stable carbon isotopic data suggest that our understanding of isotopic dietary reconstruction needs detailed examination. The technique should also be useful in biochemical tracing experiments and in global carbon budget studies, and the underlying principle may be applicable to other isotopes and molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2010029146,"Differential translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) with stable secondary structure in the 5′ untranslated leader may contribute to the dramatic changes in protein synthetic patterns that occur during oogenesis and early development. Plasmids that contained the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and which encoded mRNA with (hpCAT) or without (CAT) a stable hairpin secondary structure in the 5′ noncoding region were transcribed in vitro, and the resulting mRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes, eggs, and early embryos. During early oogenesis, hpCAT mRNA was translated at less than 3 percent of the efficiency of CAT mRNA. The relative translational potential of hpCAT reached 100 percent in the newly fertilized egg and returned to approximately 3 percent after the midblastula transition."
https://openalex.org/W1577283936,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells are cytolytic lymphocytes known to produce a pore-forming protein, named perforin or cytolysin, that lyses target cells by creating large pores on the target plasma membrane. Besides perforin, the granules of CTL and NK cells contain a family of serine esterases. Perforin has also been localized in granulated metrial gland (GMG) cells of the murine embryo implantation site by light microscopic immunostaining. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling with antibodies against perforin and a serine esterase (MTSP 1 or granzyme A) shows that GMG cells contain both perforin and serine esterases in the fine granular matrix of their granules. Perforin has been located in all of the granules, whereas gold particles corresponding to serine esterases have been found in most of the granules. Results from the double immunogold technique indicate that perforin and serine esterases colocalize to most of the same granules in GMG cells. This study supports the view that GMG cells are related to cytolytic lymphocytes."

Policies in response to population aging range from attempts in Singapore to reverse it by encouraging more births to efforts in Japan to accommodate it by increasing employment opportunities for older workers. The population of the United States, which had a longer postwar baby boom, is aging more slowly than these two countries and may be able to learn from the East Asian experience with aging policies."
https://openalex.org/W1597436937,"Collagen IV contains an amino-terminal tetramerization domain (7 S) that is involved in aggregation and cross-linking as part of the process of self-assembly of the collagen IV matrix of basement membranes. We determined the structure and location of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of the 7 S tetramer. Two glycopeptides, GP-1 and GP-2, were isolated from tryptic digests of the 7 S tetramer and were characterized. GP-1 and GP-2 are derived from the alpha 1(IV) chain and the alpha 2(IV) chain, respectively. Each glycopeptide contained one sequence, -Asn-Xaa-Thr-, which was shown to be N-glycosylated at Asn, corresponding to position 126 of the alpha 1 chains and 138 of the alpha 2 chain. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the oligosaccharide is a biantennary N-acetyllactosamine type of N-linked oligosaccharide with a broad heterogeneity in the presence of the sugar residues at their nonreducing termini as indicated. [formula: see text] The location of the Asn-linked oligosaccharide units and Hyl-linked disaccharide units and their orientation with respect to the surface of the triple helix were calculated using two models. We conclude that both units are important determinants in the assembly of the 7 S tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W2131578575,"We recently demonstrated a rapid up-regulation of serum retinol-retinol binding protein-transthyretin concentration in rats with short-term acute renal failure. We examine the effect of retinoic acid and apo-retinol binding protein (apo-RBP) on the up-regulation of serum retinol in renal failure. Injection of retinoic acid (10 μg) into rats with acute renal failure or sham-operated rats increased circulatory retinoic acid concentration 29-fold within 2 h but did not influence serum retinol concentration in either group. Injection of a large dose of retinoic acid (100 μg) decreased serum retinol concentration in rats with acute renal failure (19%) and sham-operated rats (29%). These results suggest that changes in serum retinoic acid concentration within the near-physiological range have no effect on regulation of hepatic retinol release. Injection of a large dose of retinoic acid may depress serum retinol indirectly via a retinol sparing effect in target tissues. In rats with renal failure the serum retinol concentration, elevated 44–52% above that of sham-operated controls, was also increased to 70–164% above controls by the injection of 52–63 μg of apo-RBP. This suggests that circulatory apo-RBP can upregulate serum retinol. Circulatory apo-RBP may be a positive physiological feedback signal from peripheral tissues for hepatic release of retinol.—Gerlach, T. H.; Zile, M. H.

https://openalex.org/W2125254733,"Band 3 is a ubiquitous membrane transport protein found in Golgi, mitochondrial, nuclear, and cell membranes. It is the most heavily used anion transport system in the body because it is responsible for CO2 exchange in all tissues and organs and for acid-base balance. The anion transport regions are mapped along the band 3 molecule using synthetic peptides (pep) from extracellular regions of band 3 and/or suspected anion transport regions. Assays include anion transport/inhibition and immunoblotting with anti-idiotypic antibodies to a transport inhibitor. Results indicate that anion binding/transport regions of band 3 reside within residues 549-594, (588-594 being the most active) and 804-839 (822-839 being the most active), and 869-883. Pep-COOH (residues 812-827), which is part of senescent cell antigen, is an anion binding site with most of the activity localized to residues 813-818 (the six amino acids on the amino side of pep-COOH). The stilbene disulfonate inhibitors of transport bind to peptide 812-830, and possibly peptides 788-805 and 800-818, as determined with anti-idiotypic antibodies. Residues 538-554, which have been reported to be a transport segment of band 3, do not bind sulfate. Band 3 external loops containing residues 539-553 and 812-830, and internal segments containing residues 588-594 and 869-883, are in close spacial proximity in the membrane. The contribution of lysine and/or arginine to anion transport is examined by synthesizing peptides in which glycines or arginines are substituted for lysines or arginines. Lysines can contribute to anion binding but are not required."
