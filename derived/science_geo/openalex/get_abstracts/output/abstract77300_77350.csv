https://openalex.org/W2120613619,"A sex-linked familial neurological disease consisting of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, choreoathetosis, and compulsive aggressive behavior is associated with a loss of an enzyme that participates in purine metabolism, namely, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The production of excessive uric acid in this disorder implies that the enzyme is involved in the normal regulation of purine biosynthesis. This is the first example of a relation between a specific enzyme defect and abnormal compulsive behavior. It is also the first enzyme defect in purine metabolism demonstrated in a neurological disease."

There is a positive component whose latency is determined by the point in time at which ambiguity is reduced, and whose shape and amplitude are influenced by whether it is the presence or absence of an external event which delivers the information."

https://openalex.org/W1974202128,"The preferred directions of 102 direction-selective ganglion cells in the rabbit retina have been determined. Cells of the ""on-off"" type form four nonoverlapping groups; cells of the ""on"" type fall into three groups. The on-off groups appear to correspond to the directions of apparent object displacement produced by contractions of the four rectus muscles. Each group of cells could, without further processing, provide the error signal for a visual servo-systerm minimizing retinal image motion."
https://openalex.org/W2156478618,"Detailed studies of the behavior of captive white-footed mice have cast a number of old problems in new perspectives. Many responses of small captive mammals cannot be interpreted at face value because of severe distortions of behavior that are caused by depriving the wild animal of natural outlets for activity. Confined animals are likely to seize upon and repeatedly exercise virtually any opportunities to modify (and alter their relationships with) their surroundings. In addition they have a strong tendency to counteract nonvolitional and ""unexpected"" deviations from the status quo. As a result, their responses do not bear an immutable relationship to the nature of the stimulus or other variable being modified; stimuli and activities that are rewarding in certain circumstances are avoided in others. These aspects of behavior have been illustrated by studies of nest occupancy, running in motordriven wheels, and control of intensity of illumination. The results of the control-of-illumination studies suggest the complex interplay of tendencies to modify features of the environment, to avoid conditions imposed compulsorily, and to select preferred levels of illumination. The importance of split-second timing, coordination, and quick reflex actions in the running of activity wheels is indicated by the fact that experienced white-footed mice prefer running in square ""wheels"" and wheels with hurdles to running in plain round wheels. The relatively conservative behavior of these mice in selecting between multiple sources of food and water and different types of activity wheels suggests the need for careful experimental design in free-choice studies with inexperienced animals. The tendency of trained animals to give some so-called ""incorrect"" responses even after long experience can be interpreted most reasonably in terms of the adaptive value of a certain degree of variability of behavior in the wild. White-footed mice readily master complex regimes in which several different levers and shutters must be pressed or rotated in certain sequences within seconds for different rewards. They quickly learn to traverse mazes containing hundreds of blind alleys and do so frequently without extrinsic reward. It is unlikely that these remarkable learning performances even begin to approach the capacities of the animals. When two female mice having markedly different solitary behavior patterns were placed in consort, the behavior of each changed, becoming more like that of the other, and the animals showed a strong tendency to remain in each other's company. The behavior of mice in enclosures of great extent casts doubt upon the postulate that hunger and thirst play leading roles in the motivation of wide-ranging locomotor movements. Accordingly, studies of deprived domestic animals in simple mazes may have but limited significance for understanding the behavior of wild and relatively unconfined animals. The existence of marked individual differences between mice selected at random from wild populations sounds the need for a cautious approach in the interpretation of results obtained with highly inbred domestic animals. The relatively uniform behavior of inbred strains represents only a small fragment of the total response spectrum for the species and probably has minimal significance for adaptation and evolution in the wild. When allowed to control the intensity of illumination by operating a series of switches, white-footed mice establish a roughly 24-hour regime consistent with that experienced in the wild, namely dim light during periods of activity and very dim light during periods of inactivity. Consistent with this finding, when exposed to a dim-dark light cycle, the mice are active during the dim phase, not in darkness. Artificial twilight transitions of both constant and varying color temperature have several marked effects upon the activity of white-footed mice. The existence of a strong orienting influence of dim light on the direction of wheel-running suggests that mice in the wild use the twilight sun and the moon (and possibly other celestial light sources) as navigational references."

Sulfate ions in the oceans are enriched in oxygen-18 by 9.5 per mille relative to mean ocean water and show only minor variations, probably because the exchange rate with water is slow enough to prevent local equilibrium with surface waters. Sulfate ions in saline lakes and brines have oxygen-18 enrichment of from 7 to 23 per mille relative to mean ocean water;the value of the highest enrichment observed is about the same as that of atmospheric oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2019600453,"Fish of the genus Ictalurus can find distant chemical clues by means of taste alone, and they exhibit true gradient searching in the absence of a current. Neither unilateral nor bilateral deprivation of the sense of smell impaired their searching ability, but unilateral deprivation of taste receptors which are spread over body and barbels of the animals caused pro nounced circling toward the intact side. The relation of swimming paths of the fish to the chemical in the water suggested that comparisons of concentrations were made in time and space."

https://openalex.org/W2034886041,The distal end of a hominoid humerus was recovered from early Pleistocene sediments in the Kanapoi drainage near the southern end of Lake Rudolf. Lava capping the sediments yielded a potassium/argon date of 2.5 million years. The fragment can be distinguished on inspection from gorilla and orangutan; discriminate analysis of humeri of Homo and Pan assigns it as hominid. From other evidence we consider it more likely to represent Australopithecus s.s. than Paranthropus.

These findings suggest that the waveform of evoked responses is not determined solely by the set of peripheral receptors which is stimulated, but it also reflects the perceptual content of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2010691187,"Sexual hormone A, which induces antheridial branching in male strains of Achlya, also elicits a rise in cellulase. The peak of induced cellulase corresponds in time with the appearance of branches that are the male sexual organ primordia; only those strains that branch in response to the hormone show a concomitant rise in cellulase. The response to the hormone is inhibited by compounds that block protein synthesis, for example, p-fluorophenylalanine and puromycin. Vegetative branching, induced by substrates such as casein hydrolysate, is also accompanied by a rise in cellulase."

The growth of Walker tumor 256 in this composite matrix is com pared with that found in a matrix composed of either cellulose sponge alone or collagen sponge alone. The composite matrix is superior to either one. Collagen coated cellulose sponge may provide a simple tool for the study of social interaction of cells in the formation of organized elementary tissue structures.

These ribosome-RNA complexes formed in vitro appear analogous to those assembled during polysome formation in vivo. When ribosomes are prepared from L cells exposed to homologous interferon, their capacity to associate with cell messenger is preserved, while their ability to interact with viral RNA is markedly reduced. The ribosomes from cells exposed to interferon are thus altered selectively to permit only certain messages to be bound and translated."

The cell's ability to compress the gas reveals its turgor pressure directly-save for a small correction due to capillarity. The method gives a lower limit to turgor pressure for the same cell in the normal state. The common method, incipient plasmolysis, gives an upper limit. On Nitella axillaris cells the two methods limit the turgor pressure at 5.1 to 5.7 atmospheres. The manometric method is also applicable to growing cells, where osmotic equilibrium is not present."

https://openalex.org/W2000637659,"Man's intelligent behavior is due in part to his ability to select, classify, and abstract significant information reaching him from his environment by way of his senses. This function, pattern recognition, has become a major focus of research by scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence. At the lowest level, pattern recognition reduces to pattern classification, which consists of the separation, into desired classes, of groups of objects, sounds, odors, events, properties, and the like; the separations are based on sets of measurements made on the entities being classified. The pattern classifier is composed of a data filter and a categorizer. The data filter selects the distinguishing features and represents them as sets of real numbers; each set is termed a pattern. The categorizer assigns each pattern to one of several desired classes. Patterns can be represented geometrically as points in an n-dimensional space; the n coordinates of each point are the numerical values of the features selected to represent the pattern. A pattern classification system separates an n-dimensional space into regions, each of which ideally contains points of only one class. One method to effect this separation is by means of ldquo;trainablerdquo; categorizers-major components of adaptive machines. They consist of networks whose internal parameters are varied according to a set of fixed rules during a training cycle. A statistically large sample of known patterns are presented, one at a time, to the networks; internal corrections are made each time a pattern is erroneously classified. Classifica-tion performance tends to improve as the set of known patterns is cycled repetitively through the machine. Finally, the adequacy of adaptation is tested by a separate set of similar patterns which have not been used in the training process. A number of different machine organizations and training rules have been developed and are being applied successfully to numerous classification problems. More difficult recognition problems requiring the aid of logioal tests and analysis, search and association, use the digital computer programmed to supplement the functions of the adaptive classifier."

https://openalex.org/W2057828049,"Adenosine triphosphate and magnesium (MgATP) inhibit contraction by binding to a specific relaxing site on natural actomyosin gel. This inhibitory control site is distinct from the active sites where MgATP causes contraction. In high concentrations of MgATP, calcium triggers contraction by releasing the protein from substrate inhibition, allowing the contractile reactions to occur. Heating the protein for 5 minutes at 43°C selectively inactivates the relaxing site. After this treatment, actomyosin with MgATP contracts as well without calcium as with it. That this effect of heat is prevented and reversed by dithiothreitol (an agent that reduces disulfide bonds) indicates that the structure of the relaxing site depends on certain labile sulfhydryl groups, which may be those of tropomyosin. When these are oxidized to disulfide bonds, the site loses its activity; when the disulfide bonds are reduced, the site regains its activity."
