https://openalex.org/W2113282092,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by opportunistic infections and by ‘opportunistic neoplasms’ (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma)1. Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals. A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen2 (also termed T4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients3–5 is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS because of the high frequency of isolation4 and the prevalence of specific antibodies6–8 in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD4+ cells with HTLV-III or LAV-1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD4+ cells, were not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD4. Hence, we conclude that the CD4 antigen is an essential and specific component of the receptor for the causative agent of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2033722975,"A short sequence of amino acids including Lys-128 is required for the normal nuclear accumulation of wild-type and deleted forms of SV40 large T antigen. A cytoplasmic large T mutant that lacks sequences from around Lys-128 localizes to the nucleus if the missing sequence is attached to its amino terminus. The implication that the sequence element around Lys-128 acts as an autonomous signal capable of specifying nuclear location was tested directly by transferring it to the amino termini of beta-galactosidase and of pyruvate kinase, normally a cytoplasmic protein. Sequences that included the putative signal induced each of the fusion proteins to accumulate completely in the nucleus but had no discernible effect when Lys-128 was replaced by Thr. By reducing the size of the transposed sequence we conclude that Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val can act as a nuclear location signal. The sequence may represent a prototype of similar sequences in other nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2088622701,"Two distinct nonoverlapping enhancer elements can be defined within the polyoma enhancer region. In mouse fibroblasts, element A provides a 3-fold higher enhancement of the alpha 2-collagen promoter than element B. In mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, element B shows the same efficiency as in fibroblasts, whereas that of element A decreases by a factor of 3.5. Moreover, a single point mutation (PyEC F9.1) increases the efficiency of element B in both cell types, making it superior to element A in embryonal carcinoma cells. The core of element A is located within a 35 bp region tandem duplicated in several wild-type strains, mostly homologous to a crucial repeated sequence of adenovirus E1a enhancer (Hearing and Shenk, 1983). Element B contains the consensus sequence of Weiher et al. (1982). These two homologies are precisely adjacent to the two DNAase l-hypersensitive sites present in viral chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2059533489,"We have constructed retrovirus vectors containing two genes, each with its own promoter, whose products can be selected in vivo. In cell clones harboring a single copy of this bicistronic provirus, we find that the 3' gene is usually suppressed when there is selection for expression of the 5' gene, and the 5' gene is usually suppressed when there is selection for expression of the 3' gene. We find that the suppression is epigenetic, reversible, and cis-acting, and is influenced by the strength or position of the different promoters. This type of gene suppression is novel for its action on a gene that can be either upstream or downstream to an adjacent active gene."
https://openalex.org/W1575011694,"We used a nuclear RNA transcript elongation assay to show that cAMP analogs and dexamethasone cause a selective increase of transcription of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene in H4IIE hepatoma cells. 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP increased transcription within 5 min and the maximal rate, generally 10-15-fold above the basal rate, was attained by 30 min. This increase was of sufficient magnitude to account for the effect on mRNAPEPCK (for example, where PEPCK is phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) accumulation. After the initial increase, and with continued presence of cAMP, transcription of this gene declined to a new steady-state level which was 2-3 times the basal value. The effect of cAMP analogs on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription was obtained in the absence of protein synthesis. This, and the rapidity of the response, indicates that the effect of cAMP is exerted directly on the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. Dexamethasone results in a specific, 6-fold increase of transcription, sufficient to account for the increase of mRNAPEPCK which follows treatment of H4IIE cells with this glucocorticoid. When 1 nM insulin was added to either untreated H4IIE cells, or cells first treated with a cAMP analog or dexamethasone, there was a marked reduction of cytoplasmic mRNAPEPCK. The inhibitory effect of insulin was readily reversible, as cells regained the basal level of mRNAPEPCK and full responsiveness to cAMP within 1 h after removing insulin. The transcript elongation assay was used to show that insulin inhibits transcription of the gene coding for mRNAPEPCK. The concentration of insulin required for 50% inhibition was 2-5 pM, whereas approximately 200 pM of proinsulin was required to achieve the same inhibition of transcription. This effect was specific, since insulin did not affect the synthesis of total RNA; it was rapid, as 5 nM insulin decreased the rate of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription by 50% within 15 min; and it also does not require ongoing protein synthesis. The magnitude and kinetics of the response suggest that the primary action of insulin in the regulation of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis is exerted at the level of mRNAPEPCK transcription. The insulin-mediated inhibition of mRNAPEPCK transcription was noted in untreated cells and in cells first treated with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, dexamethasone, or both of these agents. Hence, among these compounds, insulin is the dominant regulatory molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2078089931,"E. coli integration host factor (IHF) both participates directly in phage lambda site-specific recombination and regulates the expression of phage and bacterial genes. Using protection from nuclease and chemical attack as an assay, we examined the interaction of IHF with DNA. We found that IHF is a specific DNA binding protein that interacts with three distinct segments of attP, the recombination site carried by phage lambda. We also found that specific IHF binding sites are located in non-att DNA. Several non-att IHF binding sites that we have identified are adjacent to genes whose expression is altered in IHF mutants. From comparison of the sequences protected by IHF, we suggest that the critical determinant in specific IHF-DNA interaction is contained in the sequence T.PyAA...PuTTGaT.A.PuTT...PyAACtA."
https://openalex.org/W2000955810,"Transcripts from an ADC1-actin gene fusion containing the yeast actin intron are efficiently spliced in vivo. Four distinct forms of the excised actin intron are found in poly(A)- RNA from yeast carrying this transcription unit on a multicopy plasmid. Two of them migrate abnormally slowly in polyacrylamide gels, and one of these contains a block to reverse transcription at the conserved UACUAAC sequence (TACTAAC box). We also detect a larger RNA in the poly(A)+ fraction with abnormal gel mobility and the same reverse transcriptase block. Analysis of the major species of excised actin intron, labeled with 32P in vivo, reveals the presence of a branch at the third A in the UACUAAC sequence. This A is linked via a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond to the downstream C, and via a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to a G, presumably from the 5' end of the intron. Thus this intron RNA is in the form of a lariat."
https://openalex.org/W1964845842,"The electrophysiological properties of glial cells were examined in primary culture in the presence of tetraethylammonium and Ba2+, a treatment that reduces K+ permeability of the membrane and enhances currents through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Under these conditions, glial cells showed both spontaneous action potentials and action potentials evoked by the injections of current. These responses appear to represent entry of Ba2+ through Ca2+ channels because they were resistant to tetrodotoxin but were blocked by Mn2+ or Cd2+."

https://openalex.org/W2024194876,"Conventional genetic analysis of the transcription of rDNA in yeast is precluded because the genes are highly reiterated. As an alternative strategy to determine which sequences modulate transcription of pre-rRNA, a series of artificial rRNA genes containing a fragment of DNA from E. coli bacteriophage T7 were introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Correct transcription of the artificial genes was observed. Three regions of ribosomal spacer are found to affect transcription of rRNA. Sequences within 210 bp of the 5′ terminus of 35S rRNA support low levels of transcription, but at multiple initiation points. Sequences from −210 to −2230 direct correct initiation and increase somewhat the efficiency of transcription. Most striking is that sequences from −2230 to −2420 stimulate transcription 15-fold. The function of this major promoter element is absolutely orientation-dependent but relatively independent of position. Its activity is blocked when an rRNA transcription termination sequence is placed between it and the site of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2073323729,"The expression of both a PDGF-like growth factor and functional PDGF receptors within a clonal human osteosarcoma cell line (U-2 OS CI 6) is demonstrated. These molecules are able to interact and induce tyrosine-specific phosphorylation and early actin reorganization in the osteosarcoma cells, effects similar to those that PDGF induces in normal responsive cells. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against phosphotyrosine revealed that a 115 kd protein was constitutively phosphorylated in U-2 OS CI 6 cells. A phosphorylated protein of similar apparent molecular weight has been found in human fibroblasts, but only after stimulation with PDGF. These data indicate that the PDGF-receptor-dependent pathway is constitutively activated in this cell line. Extracellularly added PDGF antibodies did not, however, affect the transformed properties or growth rate of U-2 OS CI 6 cells in vitro. This indicates that autocrine PDGF receptor activation may be insignificant for maintaining the transformed state of this tumor cell line, or that autocrine receptor activation occurs in a compartment where it is inaccessible to extracellularly added antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2105439186,"We describe two novel types of mutations which decrease transcription of a tRNA operon in Salmonella typhimurium. One mutation consists of a 3 bp deletion at position -70 from the transcription start site. The second mutation is a single bp insertion between the -10 region and the transcription start site. The region around position -70 shows unusual physical properties. DNA fragments carrying the wild-type version of this region exhibit abnormally low electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels. This anomalous electrophoretic behavior is corrected if gels are run at high temperature or if the fragments contain the 3 bp deletion at -70. Our results indicate the existence of an unusual DNA conformation, probably involving DNA bending, in the region preceding the tRNA operon promoter. This structure is apparently disrupted by the 3 bp deletion. The transcriptional defect of the -70 mutant suggests a role for the unusual conformation in promoter function."

https://openalex.org/W2039115958,"Two-stage incubations and the selective inhibitory effects of N-ethylmaleimide have revealed three steps in the transport of the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein (G protein) between compartments of the Golgi. These are ""priming"" of the donor membrane, making G protein available for transfer to the acceptor Golgi stack; ""transfer"" of G protein to the acceptor stack to form a prefusion complex in which G protein is still separate from the GlcNAc transferase; and ""fusion,"" the steps that result in the delivery of G protein to the same cisternal membranes that contain the GlcNAc transferase. Electron microscopy shows that priming of the donor membrane is accompanied by the formation of a uniform population of small (60-80 nm diameter) vesicles that bud from the rims of the cisternae of the Golgi stacks. This suggests the working hypothesis that the above steps correspond to stages in the budding and fusion of transport vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1986427478,"Analysis of the rabbit β-globin transcripts present in the steady-state RNA population of fetal liver reveals that there is no strict order in the removal of the two introns from the pre-mRNA, though IVS1 seems to be preferentially eliminated first. The population of RNA molecules contains, among other splicing products, two forms of full-length IVS2 (and presumably of IVS1), released from exon sequences. One of these forms is linear, while the other has a lariat structure (circle with tail), which results from looping of the intron sequence to itself and formation of a covalent bond between the 5′ end and an internal IVS2 position at a distance of 31 bases from the 3′ splice site. This branching point maps at the penultimate position of the heptamer TGCTAAC. Branched Y-forms of IVS2, presumably resulting from nicking of the lariat loop (in vivo or during purification) are also detected. Comparison of in vivo RNA with in vitro splicing products reveals corresponding lariat forms. However, the in vivo linear intron species are absent from the in vitro products, which, in contrast, contain more than one intron conformer."
https://openalex.org/W2043249063,"The transposable Ty elements consist of a central core, epsilon, flanked by direct repeats called deltas. In wild-type strains Ty transcripts initiate in one delta and terminate in the other. Insertion mutations caused by Ty elements have a wide variety of phenotypes, ranging from inhibition of gene expression to constitutive gene expression. Mutations in the SPT3 gene suppress these effects of Ty and delta insertion mutations on adjacent genes. In spt3 null mutants the Ty transcription pattern for the entire ensemble of Ty elements is changed. The delta-delta transcripts are absent and initiation begins at a position 800 bp into the epsilon region. In these spt3 strains, transcription that initiates in solo deltas and proceeds into adjacent structural genes is also abolished. The requirement of SPT3 for normal transcription from delta can explain the ability of spt3 mutations to suppress the mutations caused by Ty and delta insertions. In SPT3 strains transcription from the delta into adjacent sequences interferes with normal expression of those sequences, whereas in spt3 strains the aberrant transcript is not made. spt3 mutations also lead to defects in diploid formation and sporulation, suggesting that SPT3 is important for the expression of genes in addition to Ty elements."
https://openalex.org/W1486735920,"Association of 125I-nerve growth factor (NGF) with PC12 pheochromocytoma cells was studied. Surface-bound and internalized NGF were distinguished by differential release of the former at low pH, high salt. Binding to the surface was rapid; at 0.2 nM (5 ng/ml) 125I-NGF, this was near-maximal within 5 min. Internalization, in contrast, did not start until about 2 min after NGF exposure and, thereafter, proceeded linearly for at least 1/2-1 h. By the latter time, approximately 75% of total bound NGF was within rather than on the surface of the cells. Binding versus concentration experiments indicated two distinct classes of surface binding sites. For both naive cells and cells treated with NGF for at least a week (primed cells), about 7% of the receptors had an apparent binding constant of about 0.3 nM; the remaining sites half-saturated at approximately 4 nM NGF. The number of each type of site was 3--4-fold higher/mg of protein in primed cells. For both naive and primed cultures, internalization appeared to be mediated by a single class of uptake sites which half-saturated at about 0.3 nM. The maximal rate of uptake by primed cells (200 fmol/h/mg protein) was about twice that for naive cells. Light and electron microscopic autoradiography indicated that the density of binding was substantially higher in primed cultures and that this increase took place over a time course of days to weeks. These findings suggest that NGF brings about long-term increases in its own high- and low-affinity surface receptors, but is internalized only via the high-affinity sites."
https://openalex.org/W2082540988,"A human papovavirus, JCV, is the etiologic agent of the fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The JCV 98-base-pair tandem repeats, located to the late side of the viral replication origin, were shown to be a transcriptional regulatory element with enhancer-like activity in human fetal glial cells. These tandem repeats share significant homology with the 82-nucleotide rat brain-specific identifier RNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1969108251,"We have used Neurospora nuclear mutant cyt-18-1, which accumulates a number of unspliced mitochondrial precursor RNAs, to identify rapidly mitochondrial introns that are self-splicing in vitro. Incubation of deproteinized whole mitochondrial RNA from the mutant with 32P-GTP resulted in strong labeling of a 1.3 kb RNA, subsequently identified as cytochrome b (cob) intron 1, and weaker labeling of additional RNAs. Self-splicing of cob intron 1, including precise cleavage and ligation, was confirmed using an in vitro transcript synthesized from the SP6 promoter. The in vitro splicing reaction was shown to be analogous to that for the Tetrahymena nuclear rRNA intron. Since splicing of cob intron 1 is inhibited in a recessive nuclear mutant, we infer that this essentially RNA-catalyzed splicing reaction must be facilitated by a protein in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2022936243,"We have isolated viable mutants of bacteriophage lambda that have in-frame deletions in gene H, which codes for a minor tail protein. They produce correspondingly smaller but active gene H protein products and assemble shorter-tailed phage particles. The deficiency in tail length for each mutant corresponds to the calculated shortening of the gene H protein caused by the deletion. These results show that the H protein determines tail length and argue strongly for a scheme in which the H protein is a ruler or template that measures length during tail assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1984743175,"Yeast mRNA introns contain a conserved sequence, TACTAAC, required for splicing. We previously identified a putative splicing intermediate characterized by a stop to reverse transcriptase at the TACTAAC box of the wild-type rp51A (ribosomal protein 51A gene) intron. We now show that this stop is due to a branch and occurs at the identical nucleotide in the actin intron TACTAAC box. We show further that the putative intermediate contains a complete intron and the 3′ exon, but is missing the 5′ exon. This RNA is largely in the form of a lariat. The lariat and the other putative splicing intermediates detected (two forms, of different molecular weights, of the excised intron and the free 5′ exon) are compatible with the view that the cut at the 5′ junction and lariat formation are early steps in yeast mRNA splicing and that substantial similarities exist between yeast and mammalian mRNA splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2045792180,"Active genes are known to have an altered chromatin structure that is preferentially sensitive to digestion with DNAase I. We find that when chicken red blood cells are incubated in media containing the topoisomerase II inhibitor novobiocin, the preferential DNAase I sensitivity of the active beta-globin genes is reversed in vivo with as little as 20 min of drug treatment. Control experiments suggest that inhibition of a topoisomerase II is responsible for this alteration in active gene conformation. Reversal of DNAase I sensitivity can also be induced in vitro by partial cleavage of the nuclear DNA with staphylococcal nuclease. We propose that the altered structure around active genes is maintained by continuous DNA supercoiling and that in the absence of this superhelical tension active chromatin reverts to a less DNAase I-sensitive ground state."

https://openalex.org/W2012681636,"The myb, ets-containing avian acute leukemia virus E26 transforms myeloblasts, erythroblasts, and fibroblasts in culture and causes a mixed erythroid/myeloid leukemia in chicks. We report the isolation and characterization of four E26 mutants that are temperature-sensitive (ts) for myeloblast transformation. At the permissive temperature, tsE26-transformed myeloid cells resemble macrophage precursors and proliferate rapidly, provided the growth medium contains chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF). When shifted to the nonpermissive temperature the cells stop growing and differentiate into macrophage-like cells, as determined by their expression of morphological, functional, and antigenic markers of normal macrophages. They also lose their responsiveness to cMGF and secrete a cMGF-like factor. Ts mutants of E26 retain their leukemogenicity and their ability to transform both erythroblasts and fibroblasts at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that the myb oncogene of E26 causes myeloblast transformation and that ets is responsible for erythroblast and fibroblast transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1531354789,"The ability of apolipoprotein (apo-) B48 to interact with lipoprotein receptors was investigated using three different types of lipoproteins. First, canine chylomicron remnants, which contained apo-B48 as their primary apoprotein constituent, were generated by the hydrolysis of chylomicrons with milk lipoprotein lipase. These apo-B48-containing chylomicron remnants are deficient in apo-E and reacted very poorly with apo-E receptors on adult dog liver membranes and the low density lipoprotein (apo-B,E) receptors on human fibroblasts. Addition of normal human apo-E3 restored the receptor binding activity of these lipoproteins. Second, beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) from cholesterol-fed dogs were subfractionated into distinct classes containing apo-E along with either apo-B48 or apo-B100. Both classes bound to the apo-B,E and apo-E receptors. Their binding was almost completely mediated by apo-E, as evidenced by the ability of the anti-apo-E to inhibit the receptor interaction. Third, beta-VLDL from type III hyperlipoproteinemic patients were subfractionated by immunoaffinity chromatography into lipoproteins containing apo-E plus either apo-B48 or apo-B100. Both subfractions bound poorly to apo-B,E and apo-E receptors due to the presence of defective apo-E2. However, the residual binding of the apo-B48-containing and apo-B100-containing human beta-VLDL was inhibited by the anti-apo-E. After lipase hydrolysis, apo-B100 became a more prominant determinant responsible for mediating receptor binding to the apo-B,E receptor. By contrast, lipase hydrolysis did not increase the binding activity of the apo-B48-containing beta-VLDL. These results indicate that apo-B48 does not play a direct role in mediating the interaction of lipoproteins with receptors on fibroblasts or liver membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1555267448,"Helix-destabilizing activity associated with mRNA translation was detected in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by assessing the ability of the ribosome to read through mRNA/cDNA duplexes. Hybridization of globin mRNA to cDNA fragments which extend into the 5' nontranslated region fully block the translation of the hybridized message. However, hybridization of the mRNA to cDNA fragments which cover regions 3' to the initiation codon has no adverse effect on its translation. The translation of mRNA hybridized to this second category of cDNA fragments occurs without the total removal of cDNA. These results imply that the ribosomal complex, once fully assembled at the AUG initiation codon, can locally destabilize secondary structures as it moves along the message. This activity may be critical for translational elongation by the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1571343834,"Adrenergic mechanism for phosphorylase activation was gradually converted from an alpha 1- to a beta 2-type during primary culture of rat hepatocytes. beta 2-Receptor-mediated cAMP generation was also much greater in 8-h cultured cells than in fresh cells. Incubation of hepatocyte membranes with [alpha-32P]NAD and the preactivated A-protomer (an active component) of islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, resulted in the ADP-ribosylation of a specific IAP substrate protein (Mr = 41,000). This ADP-ribosylation diminished progressively when the membrane-donor hepatocytes had been cultured. The early diminution was interfered with by the addition of nicotinamide or isonicotinamide, a potent inhibitor of ADP-ribosyltransferase, to the culture medium. The decrease of the IAP substrate was well correlated with the potentiation of beta-adrenergic functions under various conditions of culture. beta-Receptor-mediated activation of GTP-dependent membrane adenylate cyclase was, but glucagon-induced activation was not enhanced by either prior culture of hepatocytes or prior exposure of membranes to the A-protomer of IAP. There was no further enhancement, however, when membranes from cultured cells were exposed to the active toxin. Thus, the IAP-susceptible inhibitory guanine nucleotide-regulatory protein is coupled to beta-adrenergic receptors in such a manner as to reduce the degree of activation of cyclase, and the decrease in this IAP substrate may be responsible, at least partly, for development of beta-receptor functions during culture of hepatocytes. Its possible relation to accompanying inhibition of alpha 1-receptor functions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2079247381,"Electron microscope autoradiography has been used to localize the glycoprotein transported between successive compartments of the Golgi in a cell-free system. Both donor and acceptor Golgi fractions contain stacks of cisternae, which remain as discrete populations even after prolonged incubations together. The glycosylated VSV G protein, having received 3H-GIcNAc residues following its transport in vitro, is entirely within the population of acceptor stacks from the uninfected wild-type Golgi population (those housing GIcNAc transferase I). Quantitation of 3H grains reveals between 6,000 and 12,000 molecules of G protein introduced into each acceptor cisterna as a result of transport in the cell-free system, amounting to approximately 5% of its total membrane protein. This represents about the full complement of transported protein normally contained in a Golgi cisterna in vivo. Transport in the cell-free system is efficient and specific, preserving the integrity of the Golgi stack and its individual cisternae."
https://openalex.org/W1576511416,"Sea urchin sperm motility is activated by a Na+-dependent increase of internal pH. A flagellar preparation was used in the present study to investigate this ionic mechanism. Using 22Na and a pH electrode, the stoichiometry of Na+ uptake to H+ release in the isolated flagella was found to be 1.09 +/- 0.11. Reversing the Na+ gradient induced reacidification of the intraflagellar pH as measured by [14C]methylamine, while reversal of the H+ gradient resulted in a Na+ efflux. Furthermore, a parallel inhibition of both ionic movements was observed with increasing external [K+]. These results indicate that Na+ and H+ are coupled through an exchanger. Measurements of the membrane potential (psi) with [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium showed depolarization by K+, suggesting its inhibitory effect on the exchanger is through changes in psi. This is further supported by the following experiments. (a) Cs+ by itself had little effect on either psi or the Na+/H+ exchange, but in the presence of the ionophore valinomycin it depolarized psi and inhibited the exchange. (b) Tetraphenylphosphonium a highly permeant cation, at 2.5 mM caused depolarization and inhibition of the exchange, and these effects were reversible by repolarization of psi with valinomycin. The inhibitory effect of depolarization was not due to the electrogenicity of the exchange since both directions of the exchange were inhibited. It is proposed that the flagellar exchange is basically a electroneutral process but has a charged regulatory component (a gate or a conformational change) which confers the observed potential sensitivity."

Since nusA protein binds tightly to RNA polymerase, this provides a way of coupling rho to the elongating RNA polymerase complex through protein-protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1491356174,"Kinetoplast DNA, the mitochondrial DNA in trypanosomatids, is a network of thousands of interlocked circles. Most of these circles are minicircles and a few are maxicircles. Minicircles replicate, after decatenation from the network, by a Cairns-type mechanism. The minicircle progeny then reattach to the network (Englund, P. T. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4895-4900). We have now discovered a novel intermediate in Crithidia fasciculata minicircle replication. It is a highly gapped 2.5-kilobase free minicircle with nascent fragments of only 20 to 110 nucleotides. These fragments are nonligasable, and some remain nonligasable even after gap filling with DNA polymerase. Solution hybridization studies show that the nascent fragments are predominantly, if not exclusively, heavy strand."
https://openalex.org/W1997576515,"A unique DNA structural intermediate associated with termination of replication in Bacillus subtilis has been identified. This was achieved by probing for the Bam HI DNA fragment within which the terminus of the chromosome (terC) resides. The intermediate migrates more slowly than the bulk of digested chromosomal DNA upon electrophoresis. It is more readily detected in DNA from a merodiploid strain in which the clockwise fork should be immobilized at terC for longer than usual, and it is destroyed by S1 nuclease. The intermediate may be a forked or related structure. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a specific, sequence-based termination site that blocks or severely impedes the movement of at least the clockwise fork, which is the first to encounter it."
https://openalex.org/W1536689196,"Rat granulosa cells isolated from mature Graafian follicles were incubated with luteinizing hormone under various conditions in order to follow the synthesis and degradation of phospholipids. During acute incubations, luteinizing hormone provoked rapid and concentration-dependent increases in the incorporation of 32PO4 into phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and the polyphosphoinositides. Similarly, luteinizing hormone provoked increases in labeling of phosphatidylinositol and the polyphosphoinositides when granulosa cells were incubated with myo-[2-3H]inositol. When granulosa cells were prelabeled with 32PO4 in order to label phosphatidylinositol to constant specific radioactivity (4 h), luteinizing hormone treatment significantly increased 32P-phosphatidylinositol levels (23%). Comparable increases (27%) in the cellular concentrations of phosphatidylinositol were observed in response to luteinizing hormone. In pulse-chase experiments employing 32PO4 - or [3H]inositol-prelabeled cells, luteinizing hormone did not alter phospholipid degradation. In addition, luteinizing hormone did not stimulate degradation of polyphosphoinositides. These results demonstrate that: (a) luteinizing hormone has selective effects on phospholipid metabolism in rat granulosa cells which involve phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and the polyphosphoinositides, (b) luteinizing hormone increases net levels of phosphatidylinositol and presumably phosphatidic acid and the polyphosphoinositides, and (c) luteinizing hormone does not increase phospholipid degradation. Our findings suggest that luteinizing hormone provokes increases in de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol in rat granulosa cells. These changes in phospholipid metabolism may be important for steroidogenesis and other enzymatic processes during treatment with luteinizing hormone."

This site appears different from the catalytic site of these proteins for ATP hydrolysis: (i) nucleotide binding and ATPase activities exhibited different ionic requirements and kinetic parameters; (ii) different antibodies directed against the polyoma large protein either completely inhibited ATPase activity and not affinity labeling, or vice versa; (iii) a truncated form of polyoma large T, with its carboxyl-terminal third deleted, does not bind oxATP but exhibits normal ATPase activity; (iv) conversely, a super T SV40 protein, resulting from a duplication within the coding region of large T, was efficiently labeled with oxATP, although it lacks detectable ATPase activity. Cyanogen bromide cleavage after affinity labeling mapped the nucleotide binding site of the polyoma and SV40 large proteins within a carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence highly homologous between the two polypeptides. A survey of the phenotypes of the known mutations in these multifunctional proteins suggests that their ATPase and nucleotide-binding activities, although distinct, might both be required to ensure crucial steps in the lytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1584799712,"We have studied a low-molecular-weight (Mr = 27,200) sulfite reductase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough, NCIB 8303) with Mossbauer, EPR, and chemical techniques. This sulfite reductase was found to contain one siroheme and one [4Fe-4S] cluster. As purified, the siroheme is low-spin ferric (S = 1/2) which exhibits characteristic EPR resonances at g = 2.44, 2.36, and 1.77. At 150 K, the observed Mossbauer parameters, delta EQ = 2.49 +/- 0.02 mm/s and delta = 0.31 +/- 0.02 mm/s, for the siroheme are typical for low-spin ferric complexes. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is in the 2+ state. The Mossbauer parameters, delta EQ = 0.95 +/- 0.02 mm/s and delta = 0.38 +/- 0.02 mm/s, for the cluster are almost identical to those observed for the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in the hemoprotein subunit of the sulfite reductase from Escherichia coli. Similar to the hemoprotein subunit of E. coli sulfite reductase, low-temperature Mossbauer spectra of D. vulgaris sulfite reductase recorded with weak and strong applied fields also show evidence for an exchange-coupled siroheme-[4Fe-4S] unit."
https://openalex.org/W1485769438,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase-induced effects on phosphorylase and glycogen synthase activities and glucose production were studied in hepatocytes isolated from fed rats in the presence of the diastereomers of adenosine cyclic 3‘,5‘-phosphorothioate, (Sp)-cAMPS and (Rp)-cAMPS. Incubation of hepatocytes with (Sp)-cAMPS or glucagon, both of which lead to cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity and a decrease in glycogen synthase activity. Incubation of hepatocytes with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, in the absence of an agonist, had no significant effect on phosphorylase or glycogen synthase activities. Incubation of hepatocytes with a half-maximally inhibitory concentration of (Rp)-cAMPS shifted the agonist-induced activation curves for phosphorylase and the agonist-induced inhibition curves for glycogen synthase to 5-fold higher concentrations for both (Sp)-cAMPS and glucagon. Phosphorylase activity was very sensitive to the rapid, concentration-dependent inhibition by (Rp)-cAMPS of agonist-induced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effects on phosphorylase activity were observable in 30 s and were concentration-dependent with half-maximal inhibition at 10 microM, similar to that observed for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, glycogen synthase activity was less sensitive to (Rp)-cAMPS inhibition of agonist-induced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effects on glycogen synthase activity lagged behind those on phosphorylase activity and the concentration dependence did not parallel the cAMP-dependent protein kinase effect, but was shifted to higher concentrations of (Rp)-cAMPS with half-maximal inhibition at 60 microM. Glucose (10 to 40 mM) increased the sensitivity of glycogen synthase to (Rp)-cAMPS inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase over a narrow range of agonist concentration, but had no significant effect throughout most of the agonist-induced activation range. Thus, the diastereomers, (Sp)- and (Rp)-cAMPS, influence glycogen metabolism and the glycogenolytic enzymes through their modulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase levels."
https://openalex.org/W1567251968,"In vitro fatty acylation of the transferrin receptor with [3H]tetradecanoate or [3H]tetradecanoyl-CoA has been demonstrated for isolated sheep reticulocyte plasma membranes. Although less than 5% of the receptor was labeled in vitro, the acylated protein could be readily observed after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The acylated transferrin receptor in the reticulocyte membrane was specifically precipitated with a monoclonal antibody and was absent from mature red cell membranes. Incorporation of fatty acid was dependent on ATP, and fatty acid was 5-10 times less effective as an acyl donor than the acyl-CoA derivative, pointing out the strong potential of this reagent for in vitro acylation of membrane proteins. During in vitro maturation of reticulocytes, the receptor is released in vesicles into the incubation medium. Using reticulocytes labeled with [3H]tetradecanoate, it can be shown that the 3H-labeled receptor is transferred from the cells to the vesicles without loss of acyl groups, suggesting that the vesiculation process does not involve deacylation."
https://openalex.org/W1526827192,"Abstract Specific, saturable, and reversible binding of verapamil has been demonstrated in crude cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. These receptors possess a Kd of approximately 50 nM for verapamil as determined by either equilibrium binding studies, competition binding analysis, or kinetic analysis of on and off rates and display an average density of 1.25 pmol/mg of protein. Specificity of binding is indicated by several criteria. Competition studies with the verapamil analog D-600 indicate that (-)D-600 is 200-fold more potent than the (+)-isomer in displacing bound verapamil. Likewise, several other aryl alkyl amine Ca2+ entry blockers effectively displace bound ligand. In addition, dihydropyridines and diltiazem promote partial (25-35%) displacement of bound verapamil with Ki values similar to the Kd values for their respective receptors. Characterization of nitrendipine binding in this preparation indicates an average density of 0.3 pmol of receptors/mg of protein suggesting that the verapamil:nitrendipine binding site ratio is approximately 4:1. Binding characteristics of verapamil and nitrendipine receptors in highly purified sarcolemmal vesicles are similar to those in the crude preparation except that the ratio of verapamil:nitrendipine sites approaches 1 and nitrendipine and diltiazem promote almost complete displacement of bound verapamil. Fractionation studies of crude sarcolemmal membranes indicate that excess verapamil receptors, insensitive to the action of dihydropyridines or diltiazem, are located in a high-density, nonmitochondrial, non-sarcolemmal membrane fraction. Thus, verapamil receptors exist in two locations in cardiac tissue but only in the sarcolemmal membrane are these receptors coupled to the dihydropyridine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1492374224,"Abstract Epinephrine treatment of the perfused rat heart led to an increase in glucose uptake, detritiation of [5-3H] glucose, glycogenolysis, and the formation of lactate. The change in the rate of formation of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose was slower to develop (commencing at approximately 30 s) than changes in cyclic AMP concentration, hexose-6-P concentration, and the phosphorylase a/(a + b) ratio which were maximal at 24 s. Epinephrine plus propranolol (alpha-adrenergic combination) treatment of the perfused heart also led to increases in glucose uptake, detritiation of [5-3H]glucose, and the formation of lactate, but these occurred without significant changes in cyclic AMP concentration, hexose-6-P concentration, or the phosphorylase a/(a + b) ratio. Half-maximal stimulation of glucose uptake occurred at 0.2 microM epinephrine, 1.5 microM methoxamine, and 1 microM isoproterenol. The increase in glucose uptake mediated by 1 microM epinephrine was blocked by 10 microM prazosin but unaffected by 10 microM propranolol. The increase in glucose uptake mediated by 10 microM epinephrine plus 10 microM propranolol was partly blocked by yohimbine and completely blocked by prazosin. A role for Ca2+ in the adrenergic regulation of glucose uptake was indicated by the sensitivity of the epinephrine dose curve to Ca2+ and the dependence of epinephrine on Ca2+. In addition the increases in glucose uptake mediated by 1 microM epinephrine, 1 microM epinephrine plus 10 microM propranolol, 1 microM isoproterenol, and by 10 mM CaCl2 were each blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM). It is concluded that Ca2+-dependent alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms are present in rat heart for controlling glucose uptake. At submicromolar levels of epinephrine the predominant receptors utilized appear to be alpha 1."
https://openalex.org/W1806182887,"The studies presented herein were designed to assess the effects of Na+ on the affinity of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor. We performed competition binding experiments in buffers containing NaCl or an isosmolar concentration of an appropriate Na+ substitute. The results presented show that Na+ decreases the affinity of LH, but not that of CG, in intact cells and membranes. In detergent-solubilized receptors, however, the affinity of LH is higher than that of CG and is not influenced by Na+. In addition, we show that Na+ does not affect the number of LH/CG receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1504394665,"The addition of ATP with K+ to pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) modified with a sulfhydryl fluorescent reagent N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl]maleimide induced a transient decrease (t 1/2 = 0.01 s) in the fluorescence in the presence of Mg2+ with 0.64 M Na+, followed by a slow increase (t 1/2 = 0.08 s), to give a higher steady level than that observed without K+. The addition induced a transient increase (t 1/2 less than 0.02 s) in the amount of phosphoenzyme, followed by a slow decrease (t 1/2 = 0.08 s), but the addition without K+ induced a monophasic increase (t 1/2 = 0.02 s). The addition of ATP in the presence of 2 M Na+ with Ca2+ induced a monophasic decrease (t 1/2 = 0.1 s) in the fluorescence along with a much slower increase (t 1/2 = 1.2 s) in the amount of phosphoenzyme. No significant burst of acid-labile phosphate was observed. The data showed clearly the accumulation of the enzyme-ATP complex preceding the phosphoenzyme formation. Fluorescence intensity of these enzyme species and the amount of phosphoenzyme permitted the simulation using the reaction mechanism including enzyme-ATP complex, ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme, and K+-bound enzyme. The simulation gave a good fit to the experimental data which showed that ATP is hydrolyzed in sequence through the above intermediates in the presence of both Na+ and K+."
https://openalex.org/W1544568790,"Previous work from our laboratory (Hod, Y., Utter, M. F., and Hanson, R. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13787-13794) has demonstrated that chicken kidney contains both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) and that the two forms are distinct proteins. Using poly(A+) RNA from chicken kidney, a double-stranded cDNA library was constructed. DNA clones containing sequences complementary to the mRNA for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were initially identified by colony hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA transcribed from an RNA fraction enriched for the enzyme mRNA. The identity of plasmids containing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cDNA was confirmed by hybrid-selected translation. Mature mRNA for cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase of the chicken is 2.8 kilobases in length, similar to that previously noted for mRNA coding for the same enzyme in the rat. The cDNA for the chicken enzyme hybridizes with several restriction fragments of the corresponding cDNA for the rat cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, indicating conservation of nucleotide sequences during evolution. Wide spread conservation of sequence homology is also demonstrated by the hybridization of the cDNA for the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase with a 2.8-kilobase RNA from the livers of a variety of vertebrates including amphibian, avian, and primate species. Specific mRNA coding for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was present in chicken kidney but absent from the liver, even in animals starved for 48 h. However, the administration of cAMP to normal fed chickens caused a rapid induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. These findings suggest that the gene for the cytosolic enzyme in chicken liver can be expressed if the proper hormonal stimuli are present."
https://openalex.org/W1552346769,"Abstract A 2.2-kilobase human antithrombin III (ATIII) has been constructed which preserves many of the features of the 16-kilobase parental gene. These include approximately 300 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region containing the TATA-less ATIII promoter, the entire protein-coding sequence including the signal peptide, a single intervening sequence with intact donor and acceptor splice sites, and a polyadenylation signal. Unique PstI termini allow the minigene to be cloned in many commonly used plasmid vectors. The minigene has been reintroduced into heterologous cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. RNA is transcribed with heterogeneous 5'-ends and is processed by splicing either to the normal acceptor site or to an alternate site within the intervening sequence. The alternately spliced mRNA is also found in liver where it accounts for 20-40% of ATIII-specific transcripts. The alternate splicing event introduces a 42-nucleotide segment between codons -19 and -18 of the signal peptide. This segment contains an in-frame ochre termination codon such that the predicted protein product encoded by the alternately spliced mRNA would be only 19 amino acids long. The minigene is transcribed to high levels in mouse fibroblasts when present as an episome in a bovine papilloma virus-derived vector although no protein product is detected."
https://openalex.org/W1936407961,"The two principal high-density lipoprotein apolipoproteins A-I and A-II are both initially synthesized as preproproteins. The prosegment of apo-A-I is unusual: it ends with paired glutamine residues and is removed extracellularly. The apo-A-II prosegment resembles the propeptides of prohormones and proalbumin: it ends with paired basic amino acids. We have studied the processing of proapo-A-II in a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2) which is known to accurately and efficiently remove the prosegment from proalbumin prior to secretion. Pulse-chase experiments were performed in order to determine if the apo-A-II prosegment is removed prior to or after secretion. Apo-A-II was purified from cell lysates and media at various times during the chase and subjected to automated sequential Edman degradation. The results indicate that proteolytic processing of proapo-A-II is largely an extracellular event. These cells secrete the protease responsible for prosegment removal. The converting activity present in media is not blocked by serine protease inhibitors (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and furoyl saccharin) or by a metalloprotease inhibitor (o-phenanthroline). It is inhibited by the thiol protease reagents p-chloromercuribenezene-sulfonic acid and leupeptin. Prosegment removal changes the pI of the dominant apo-A-II isoform from 6.61 to 4.95. The presence of the propeptide does not prevent specific in vitro recombination of apo-A-II with high-density lipoprotein3 particles present in normolipemic serum. Extracellular processing after a single basic amino acid has been described for a variety of precursor proteins. Extracellular cleavage of the apo-A-II propeptide after paired COOH-terminal basic residues represents a novel processing pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1665059736,"Cyclic AMP accumulation in embryonic chick heart cells and binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist 125I-pindolol to intact cells has been examined during the first 30 min of (-)-isoproterenol-induced desensitization. Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors exist in two states which bind agonists with high (KD congruent to 10 nM) and low (KD congruent to 10 microM) affinities. Both activation and desensitization of cyclic AMP accumulation were mediated by (-)-isoproterenol binding to high affinity receptors. (-)-Isoproterenol-induced desensitization of cyclic AMP accumulation occurred with a t1/2 of 3.8 min. Desensitization was accompanied by a decrease in the number of 125I-pindolol binding sites assessed by equilibrium radioligand binding assays conducted at 4 degrees C or short (80 s) binding assays conducted at 37 degrees C. There was an excellent temporal correlation between loss of binding and loss of (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. After (-)-isoproterenol-induced desensitization, most of the remaining receptors assayed at 4 degrees C bound (-)-isoproterenol with high affinity. A rapid (-)-isoproterenol-induced decrease in the number of 125I-pindolol binding sites also occurred in adult canine heart cells and rat adipocytes. The data suggest that agonists do not cause uncoupling of surface receptors. Receptors may be uncoupled as a consequence of rapid sequestration into a hydrophobic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1486988522,"Low temperature (9-15 K) EPR of isolated bovine heart cytochrome oxidase titrated potentiometrically in the presence of azide reveals the formation of two distinct species of low-spin cytochrome a3(III)-azide which differ in redox properties and g values. Both species are formed with characteristic midpoint potentials during the course of oxidative titration and disappear at higher potentials. The signal appearing at lower potential has principal g values 2.88, 2.19, and 1.64; that appearing at higher potential has g values 2.77, 2.18, and 1.74. A good fit to the experimental data (per cent of cytochrome present in a given paramagnetic state versus oxidation potential) was obtained with a model whereby the gz = 2.88 species arises from cytochrome a3(III)-azide with cytochrome a reduced, which is converted to the gz = 2.77 species upon oxidation of cytochrome a. Potentiometric titration of cytochrome oxidase in the presence of cyanide produces two low-spin heme EPR signals attributable to cytochrome a3(III)-cyanide which are incompletely resolved, but are distinguishable nonetheless. The low-potential signal has peak amplitude at gz = 3.63 and a long high-field tail; this resonance has been seen by other workers in the partially reduced enzyme (DerVartanian, D. V., Lee, I. Y., Slater, E. C., and van Gelder, B. F. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 347, 321-327). The high-potential signal is much more symmetric about its peak amplitude, which is at approximately 10 G higher field with gz = 3.61. As with the azide complex, the titration behavior in the presence of 2 mM KCN is adequately simulated by assuming that the appearance of the two species is a function of the oxidation state of cytochrome a. Like the a3-azide signals, the a3-cyanide signals disappear upon further oxidation with some characteristic midpoint potential. If the disappearance of the a3-ligand signals with increasing potential is assumed to be the result of antiferromagnetic (or ferromagnetic) coupling of a3(III) (S = 1/2) to CuB(II) (S = 1/2), then cooperativity between cytochrome a and CuB is implied. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of cytochrome a raises the midpoint potential of CuB by 55 +/- 10 mV."
https://openalex.org/W1553640787,"The gene for cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) from the chicken was isolated from a recombinant library containing the chicken genome in phage lambda Charon 4A. The isolated clone, lambda PCK1cc, contains the complete gene for the enzyme as well as both 5' and 3' flanking sequences. The gene is approximately 8 kilobases in length divided into 8 exons, as demonstrated by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA-RNA heteroduplex analysis. Southern blotting of chicken chromosomal DNA digested with various restriction enzymes shows a pattern predicted from the restriction map of lambda PCK1cc. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene is present as a single copy in the haploid chicken genome. The 5' region of the gene was defined by S1 nuclease mapping and by sequencing. Two mRNA species with discrete 5' ends were observed using S1 nuclease mapping. The ratio between the amounts of these multiple forms of mRNA is the same in chicken kidney and liver and is not affected by induction of the enzyme mRNA by cAMP. Examination of sequence homologies with the gene for rat cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase indicates a putative control region contained in flanking sequences at the 5' end of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2143605814,"The chromatin structure of the developmentally regulated fetal (gamma), preadult (beta C), and adult (beta A) beta-globin genes of the goat has been investigated using a nuclear restriction enzyme accessibility assay. In fetal liver nuclei only the PvuII site immediately proximal to the gamma-globin gene is available for digestion, while the homologous recognition sequences 5' to beta A and beta C are not accessible. Conversely, that site upstream of the beta C transcription unit is exclusively digested in bone marrow nuclei prepared from animals expressing the juvenile form of the protein. In nonerythropoietic tissue none of the PvuII recognition sequences flanking the three genes are digested using identical reaction conditions. These results are particularly striking since the nucleotide sequence extending for hundreds of bases in either direction from this restriction site is remarkably homologous among the three genes. In addition, we have mapped an endogenous nuclease-hypersensitive site approximately 1150 nucleotides 5' to the gamma-globin gene which is evident only in fetal liver tissue."
