https://openalex.org/W2017171309,"The petrology record on the Moon suggests that a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred approximately 700 million years after the planets formed; this event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Planetary formation theories cannot naturally account for an intense period of planetesimal bombardment so late in Solar System history. Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the observational constraints of the outer Solar System."

https://openalex.org/W2768824252,"Errors in spotting key targets soar alarmingly if they appear only infrequently during screening. Visual searches can be vitally important: looking for knives in luggage or tumours in mammograms, for instance. These are visual searches for rare targets, and a study comparing performance on high- and low-prevalence versions of an artificial baggage-screening task shows that we are disturbingly bad at it. If observers looking for ‘tools’ among objects drawn from other categories do not find what they are looking for fairly frequently, they often fail to notice it when it does appear. Our society relies on accurate performance in visual screening tasks — for example, to detect knives in luggage or tumours in mammograms. These are visual searches for rare targets. We show here that target rarity leads to disturbingly inaccurate performance in target detection: if observers do not find what they are looking for fairly frequently, they often fail to notice it when it does appear."

https://openalex.org/W2008529267,"The UK government set up the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) in 2001 to trace individual cattle in the aftermath of the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) crisis. The BCMS was not intended as a disease control system. But it provides a valuable archive that has now proved its worth in a study of the spread of a slow-moving disease, bovine tuberculosis. This is endemic in many parts of Europe. The cattle movement data show pretty conclusively that the movement of infected animals is the dominant factor in introducing tuberculosis into new areas. Limiting the movement of cattle from infected areas to remote locations should therefore be considered as a disease control measure. For 20 years, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) has been spreading in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and is now endemic in the southwest and parts of central England and in southwest Wales, and occurs sporadically elsewhere. Although its transmission pathways remain poorly understood, the disease's distribution was previously modelled statistically by using environmental variables and measures of their seasonality1. Movements of infected animals have long been considered a critical factor in the spread of livestock diseases, as reflected in strict import/export regulations, the extensive movement restrictions imposed during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak2,3, the tracing procedures after a new case of BTB has been confirmed and the Government's recently published strategic framework for the sustainable control on BTB4. Since January 2001 it has been mandatory for stock-keepers in Great Britain to notify the British Cattle Movement Service of all cattle births, movements and deaths5. Here we show that movements as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System data archive, and particularly those from areas where BTB is reported, consistently outperform environmental, topographic and other anthropogenic variables as the main predictor of disease occurrence. Simulation distribution models for 2002 and 2003, incorporating all predictor categories, are presented and used to project distributions for 2004 and 2005."
https://openalex.org/W2087176067,"Neurotransmitter release is triggered by an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), but it is unknown whether the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion is modulated during synaptic plasticity. We investigated whether the potentiation of neurotransmitter release by phorbol esters, which target presynaptic protein kinase C (PKC)/munc-13 signalling cascades, exerts a direct effect on the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Using direct presynaptic Ca2+-manipulation and Ca2+ uncaging at a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, we show that phorbol esters potentiate transmitter release by increasing the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Phorbol esters potentiate Ca2+-evoked release as well as the spontaneous release rate. We explain both effects by an increased fusion 'willingness' in a new allosteric model of Ca2+-activation of vesicle fusion. In agreement with an allosteric mechanism, we observe that the classically high Ca2+ cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion (approximately 4) is gradually reduced below 3 microM [Ca2+]i, reaching a value of <1 at basal [Ca2+]i. Our data indicate that spontaneous transmitter release close to resting [Ca2+]i is a consequence of an intrinsic property of the molecular machinery that mediates synaptic vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2060365508,"CD95 ligand (CD95L) triggers a rapid formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an upstream event of CD95 activation and apoptosis induction in rat hepatocytes. This ROS response was sensitive to inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium, apocynin, and neopterin, suggestive of an involvement of NADPH oxidases. In line with this, hepatocytes expressed mRNAs not only of the phagocyte gp91phox (Nox 2), but also of the homologs Nox 1 and 4 and Duox 1 and 2, as well as the regulatory subunit p47phox. gp91phox (Nox 2) and p47phox were also identified at the protein level in rat hepatocytes. CD95L induced within 1 min ceramide formation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). These inhibitors and p47phox protein knockdown inhibited the early CD95L-induced ROS response, suggesting that ceramide and PKCζ are upstream events of the CD95L-induced Nox/Duox activation. CD95L also induced rapid activation of the Src family kinase Yes, being followed by activation of c-Src, Fyn, and c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK). Only Yes and JNK activation were sensitive to N-acetylcysteine, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, PKCζ, or sphingomyelinase, indicating that the CD95L-induced ROS response is upstream of Yes and JNK but not of Fyn and c-Src activation. Activated Yes rapidly associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which became phosphorylated at Tyr845 and Tyr1173 but not at Tyr1045. Activated EGFR then triggered an AG1478-sensitive CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation, which was a signal for membrane targeting of the EGFR/CD95 complex, subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated death domain and caspase 8, and apoptosis induction. All of these events were significantly blunted by inhibitors of sphingomyelinase, PKCζ, NADPH oxidases, Yes, or EGFR-tyrosine kinase activity and after protein knockdown of either p47phox, Yes, or EGFR. The data suggest that CD95L-induced apoptosis involves a sphingomyelinase- and PKCζ-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase isoforms, which is required for Yes/EGFR/CD95 interactions as upstream events of CD95 activation.

(Apo-1/Fas) belongs to the death receptor family and plays an important role in apoptosis induction in many cell types. In liver, CD95 can be activated after ligation with its natural ligand (CD95L); however, CD95 can also be activated in a ligand-independent way, for example by hydrophobic bile acids or hyperosmotic cell shrinkage (1Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Reinehr R. Graf D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent and -independent CD95 activation in hepatocytes is a complex process, which finally results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of the initiator caspase 8, which then triggers a variety of complexly regulated downstream events, which may finally result in apoptotic cell death. In hepatocytes, proapoptotic stimuli such as CD95L, hydrophobic bile acids, or hyperosmotic cell shrinkage induce a rapid oxidative stress response, which triggers ligand-independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent association of the EGFR with CD95 within 30 min (1Reinehr R.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 839-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following EGFR-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD95, the EGFR·CD95 protein complex is targeted in a microtubule-dependent way to the plasma membrane, where formation of the DISC occurs (3Eberle A. Reinehr R. Becker S. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2005; 41: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying CD95L-triggered EGFR activation are not fully understood; however, EGFR activation in response to other proapoptotic stimuli involves an antioxidant-sensitive activation of Yes as upstream event (4Reinehr R.

Yes, like Fyn and c-Src, are members of the Src kinase family, which are ubiquitously expressed (for a review, see Refs. 6Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In rat hepatocytes, c-Src participates in integrin-dependent osmosignaling (8Häussinger D. Kurz A.K. Wettstein M. Graf D. Vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1476-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas Yes is important for apoptosis induction through the CD95 system by CD95 ligand-independent stimuli (4Reinehr R.

In nonhepatic cell types, hyperosmotic Fyn activation results in an increased phosphorylation of caveolin (9Sanguinetti A.R. Cao H. Corley Mastick C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and cortactin (10Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol.

The mechanisms of how CD95L and other proapoptotic stimuli trigger the oxidative stress response in hepatocytes remained unclear. Like tumor necrosis factor-α, proapoptotic bile acids were suggested to induce oxygen radical formation by mitochondria (11Stadler J. Bentz B.G. Harbrecht B.G. Di Silvio M. Curran R.D. Billiar T.R.

Hepatology. 1994; 19: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); however, this may represent a downstream consequence but not the cause of CD95 activation. In phagocytes, reactive oxygen species are generated by an NADPH oxidase complex with its catalytic moiety gp91phox, which is activated by assembly with regulatory proteins such as p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (15Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 16Nauseef W.M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Pani G.

Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, membrane oxidases similar to the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex were found also in nonphagocytic cell types. These homologs of gp91phox are called Nox and Duox, with the classical phagocytic gp91phox being termed Nox 2. The isoform Nox 3 was found in fetal kidney, Nox 1 is predominantly expressed in the colon, and Nox 5 is predominantly expressed in spleen and fetal tissues (19Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 20Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 7-11Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Duox 1 and 2 reflect high molecular mass gp91phox homologs with an N-terminal peroxidase domain in addition to the C-terminal NADPH oxidase activity. Duox 1 was found primarily in the thyroid gland, whereas Duox 2 is also found in the intestine and the colon. Nox and Duox proteins were suggested to participate in signal transduction (20Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 7-11Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although it is dispensible for NADPH oxidase activity under cell-free conditions, p47phox is critical for normal NADPH oxidase (gp91phox, Nox 2) function, because p47phox acts as an adapter protein, which facilitates stimulus-induced binding of p67phox to the enzyme complex. Patients lacking p47phox suffer from chronic granulomatous disease (21Francke U. Hsieh C.L. Foellmer B.E. Lomax K.J. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 483-492PubMed Google Scholar). In neutrophils, p47phox is activated in response to inflammatory stimuli by multiple phosphorylations, which are thought to trigger intramolecular rearrangements that expose Src homology 3 domains for binding to proline-rich regions of other NADPH oxidase components in order to form the active enzyme complex (22Inanami O.

The present study was undertaken in order to determine the mechanisms of CD95L-induced transactivation of the EGFR and to investigate a potential contribution of NADPH oxidase isoforms for the rapid oxidative stress signal in response to proapoptotic stimuli. The data suggest that CD95L induces oxidative stress by activation of NADPH oxidase isoforms in a sphingomyelinase- and PKCζ-dependent way. CD95L-induced activation of NADPH oxidases leads to Yes activation, which in turn triggers ligand-independent EGFR activation as a crucial step in CD95-mediated cell death.

Immunopharmacol. 1993; 15: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Human monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood samples using BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation Tubes (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Human hepatoma cell line 7 (Huh7) cells (26Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Yamane T. Miyazaki M. Miyano K. Sato J. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1984; 75: 151-158Google Scholar) were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2-atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nut.Mix F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 70% confluence before transient transfection using expression vectors of the CD95-YFP and EGFR-CFP fusion proteins supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 culture medium without antibiotics. About 49 ± 5% (n = 3) of the cells expressed the transfected EGFR-CFP and CD95-YFP constructs. Plasmid Construction—The nucleotide sequence encoding CD95 was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using HepG2 mRNA and ligated into the pTOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). After the introduction of restriction sites and removal of the stop codon by PCR, the fragment was inserted into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to create a fusion protein with YFP linked to the C terminus. The EGFR-CFP-construct was obtained by replacing GFP of F7 erb B1-EGFP (kindly provided by Prof. Arndt-Jovin, Ph.D. (27Brock R. Hamelers I.H. Jovin T.M. Cytometrie. 1999; 35: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) with CFP of pECFP-N1 (Clontech). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured rat hepatocytes (1 and 4 days of culture), HSC (1 and 14 days of culture), Kupffer cells, and fetal rat kidney using the peqGold TriFast kit (peqLab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Purified RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. The first strand cDNA was made from 1 μg of total RNA/25-μl reaction volume with the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The PCR was performed using the 2× PCR Master Mix (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) as well as the following primers: for rat p47phox, sense (5′-GGC CAA AGA TGG CAA GAA TA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGT CAA GGG GCT CCA AAT AG-3′); for rat NOX1, sense (5′-TAC GAA GTG GCT GTA CTG GTT G-3′) and antisense (5′-CTC CCA AAG GAG GTT TTC TGT T-3′); for rat NOX2, sense (5′-TCA AGT GTC CCC AGG TAT CC-3′) and antisense (5′-CTT CAC TGG CTG TAC CAA AGG-3′); for rat NOX3, sense (5′-AAT CAC AGA GTC TGC CTG GAC T-3′) and antisense (5′-ATC CAG ACT TTC ATC CCA GTG T-3′); for rat NOX4, sense (5′-GGA AGT CCA TTT GAG GAG TCA C-3′) and antisense (5′-TGG ATG TTC ACA AAG TCA GGT C-3′); for rat DUOX1, sense (5′-TGT GTA CCT GTT CTC CAT CAG C-3′) and antisense (5′-AAA TGT AGA GGT GGT GGG TCA G-3′); for rat DUOX2, sense (5′-CCA TCC TAG TCA AGA TGG AAA AC-3′) and antisense (5′-ACA CAA TGG CCT GGA TGA AT-3′); for rat β-actin as control, sense (5′-GCC CTA GAC TTC GAG CAA GA-3′) and antisense (5′-CAG TGA GGC CAG GAT AGA GC-3′); for human p47phox, sense (5′-GAG TAC CGC GAC AGA CAT CA-3′) and antisense (5′-TCT TCC GTC TCG TCA GGA CT-3′); for human NOX1, sense (5′-TTA ACA GCA CGC TGA TCC TG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTG GAG AGA ATG GAG GCA AG-3′); for human NOX2, sense (5′-GAA CGT CTT CCT CTT TGT CTG G-3′) and antisense (5′-GTG ATG ACA ACT CCA GTG ATG C-3′); for human NOX3, sense (5′-AGG CCC TGT GGT CTT GTA TG-3′) and antisense (5′-ACA TCT GTC AGG GCA GTT CC-3′); for human NOX4, sense (5′-CCA CAG ACT TGG CTT TGG AT-3′) and antisense (5′-GGC AGA ATT TCG GAG TCT TG-3′); for human NOX5, sense (5′-CAG GAT CTT TGC CTC TGA GC-3′) and antisense (5′-GAA GAA GAC CTG CAC CTT GC-3′); for human DUOX1, sense (5′-GGA CTC ACT TCT CCC ACC ATT A-3′) and antisense (5′-GAA GAG GAG GAG GTA TGG GAG T-3′); for human DUOX2, sense (5′-AGC TGG CTG AGA AGT TCG AC-3′) and antisense (5′-AAG GCA GGA TAC TGG AAG CA-3′); and for human β-actin as control, sense (5′-AGA AAA TCT GGC ACC ACA CC-3′) and antisense (5′-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAC GA-3′). All primer sets (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) were used at a final concentration of 200 nmol/liter, and 5 μl of template cDNA was added per 25-μl reaction volume. PCR was conducted with a thermal cycler using standard protocols. Products of PCR were analyzed with 2% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. Fragment sizes were calculated by application of the DNA ladder MassRuler (low range, Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Obtained PCR products were confirmed by partial sequencing after isolation from agarose gels (Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System, Promega, Madison, WI). p47phox, Yes, and EGFR Protein Knockdown—Antisense oligonucleotides directed to p47phox, the Src kinase family member Yes, or EGFR and the corresponding controls (i.e. nonsense oligonucleotides) were designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). Immediately after hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture plates (diameter, 6 cm; Falcon) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate, either a 4 μmol/liter concentration of the respective oligonucleotides (nonsense, p47phox, or Yes antisense) supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 or 2 μmol/liter nonsense or EGFR antisense oligonucleotides without cationic lipids, respectively, were instituted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Thereafter, cells were kept in culture for up to 4 days. In control experiments, uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled nonsense oligonucleotides (2 μmol/liter) was already visible after 1 h of incubation and lasted for up to 4 days. 4 days after the transfection procedure, the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells was less than 3% in control experiments, as assessed by propidium iodide and TUNEL staining, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—At the end of the incubations, medium was removed, and cells were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately lysed. Samples containing 40 μg of total protein were transferred to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences), as recently described (1Reinehr R.

Blots were blocked for 2 h in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin containing 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the first antibody (antibodies used: anti-phospho-JNK-1/-2, anti-phospho-Src family-Tyr418, anti-Cbl, anti-EGFR-Tyr1045-P (1:1000), anti-Yes, anti-Fyn, anti-phospho-Lck-Tyr505, anti-p47phox (Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-phospho-serine (1:1250), anti-gp91phox (Nox 2), anti-EGFR-Tyr845-P and Tyr1173-P, anti-phospho-Src-Tyr418 and -Tyr529 (1:2500), anti-Oatp 1 (1:3000), anti-EGFR, anti-phospho-Erk-1/-2, anti-Ntcp, anti-Oatp 2 and 4 (1:5000), anti-CD95, anti-FADD, anti-caspase 8, anti-phosphotyrosine (1:10,000)). Following washing with TBS-T and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse, anti-sheep, or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (all diluted 1:10,000) at room temperature for 2 h, respectively, the blots were washed extensively and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were exposed to X-Omat AR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitation—Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (diameter, 10 cm; Falcon) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate. They were harvested in lysis buffer as recently published (1Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Reinehr R. Graf D.

Equal protein amounts (200 μg) of each sample were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CD95, rabbit anti-p47phox, rabbit anti-Yes, or rabbit anti-Fyn antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in order to immunoprecipitate CD95, p47phox, Yes, or Fyn. Then 10 μl of protein A-agarose and 10 μl of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times as published recently (1Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Reinehr R. Graf D.

The expression of several ARE-regulated genes was found to be up-regulated in endothelial cells by laminar shear stress, suggesting that Nrf2 contributes to the anti-atherosclerosis response via the ARE. To gain further insight into the roles that Nrf2 plays in the development of atherosclerosis, we examined how Nrf2 regulates gene expression in response to anti-atherogenic laminar flow (L-flow) or pro-atherogenic oscillatory flow (O-flow). Exposure of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to L-flow, but not to O-flow, induced the expression of cytoprotective genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by 5-fold and heme oxygenase-1 by 8-fold. The critical contribution of Nrf2 to the expression induced by L-flow was ascertained in siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments. Two cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors attenuated Nrf2 nuclear accumulation in the acute phase of L-flow exposure. A downstream product of COX-2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), activated the Nrf2 regulatory pathway in HAECs through binding to the cysteines of Keap1. These results demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 is essential for L-flow to activate Nrf2 and induce anti-atherosclerotic gene expression. Whereas both L-flow and O-flow induced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 to comparable levels, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Nrf2 binding to the NQO1 ARE was significantly diminished in the case of O-flow compared with that of L-flow.

Constantly exposed to both biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, endothelial cells regulate bodily homeostasis in response to events such as inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion (1Aird W.C. Crit.

Therefore, it is believed that O-flow induces a pro-atherogenic response in the endothelium, whereas L-flow provokes anti-atherogenic gene expression. Indeed, VCAM-1, which plays a dominant role in the initiation of atherosclerosis (6Cybulsky M.I. Iiyama K. Li H. Zhu S. Chen M. Iiyama M. Davis V. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Connelly P.W. Milstone D.S. J.

Quite recently, it was reported that genes under the regulatory influence of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) are up-regulated by steady L-flow (13Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y.

The ARE is a cis-acting DNA regulatory element that coordinates the inducible expression of genes that contribute to the pivotal cellular defense mechanisms against the toxicity of electrophiles and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ARE regulates the genes encoding a subset of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GST) and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and a subset of antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the subunits of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS, Ref. 15Primiano T. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 293-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By first heterodimerizing with a small Maf protein, the transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) binds to the ARE to regulate the inducible expression of ARE-regulated genes (16Itoh K.

Under homeostatic conditions, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) binds to Nrf2 and facilitates the degradation of Nrf2 via the proteasome system (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to electrophilic or oxidative stresses, Nrf2 is liberated from Keap1-dependent repression and accumulates in the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 20Kobayashi A. Ohta T. Yamamoto M.

In addition to its roles in the detoxification and antioxidant response, Nrf2 has been shown to play a part in the regulation of inflammation. For instance, we have demonstrated that several ARE-regulated genes are induced in an Nrf2-dependent manner in macrophages during carrageenan-induced inflammation (26Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This induction was mediated by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent generation of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). In endothelial cells, the overexpression of Nrf2 or NQO1 inhibits the TNFα-mediated activation of the VCAM-1 promoter (13Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y. Thomas S. Cook C.K. Wasserman M.A. Medford R.M. Jaiswal A.K. Kunsch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Consistent with these anti-inflammatory functions of Nrf2, the phenotype displayed by nrf2 gene knock-out mice is pro-inflammation in various organs (reviewed in Ref. 27Chen X.L. Kunsch C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). HO-1 is known to exert a protective function against the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo (28Ishikawa K.

In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of the ARE-Nrf2 gene battery in response to blood flow by examining Nrf2 activity in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). We found that exposure of HAECs to steady L-flow, but not to O-flow, induced the expression of a subset of cytoprotective genes such as NQO1 and HO-1. The essential contribution of Nrf2 to the inducible expression of these genes was confirmed by an siRNA experiment. The L-flow-dependent induction of Nrf2 activity was repressed by two COX-2 inhibitors, whereas 15d-PGJ2 was found to activate Nrf2 and induce the expression of Nrf2 target genes in HAECs. Whereas both L-flow and O-flow induced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 to comparable levels in HAECs, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that L-flow, but not O-flow, specifically enhanced Nrf2 binding to the ARE of the NQO1 gene. These results thus demonstrate that the COX-2-dependent generation of 15d-PGJ2 is essential for the inducible expression of Nrf2 target genes in endothelial cells in response to L-flow. Cell Culture—HAECs were purchased from CAMBREX and cultured in supplemented EGM-2 medium (CAMBREX Co.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were used at passage 5 for flow experiments and at passages 5-7 for other experiments. Shear Stress Apparatus—The flow system was obtained from FLEXCELL International Corporation. A Streamer ™ (STR-4000) was used to generate L-flow. An OsciFlow™ module was additionally used to generate O-flow. For flow exposure, HAEC were first cultured on gelatin-coated Culture Slips™ (FLEXCELL, 25 × 75 mm). Upon confluency, cells on six Culture Slips™ were inserted into a parallel-plate flow system equipped with six chambers and exposed to the flow. StreamSoft™ software controls a flow pump, thereby regulating the flow rate into the chamber and the magnitude of fluid-induced shear stress applied to cells. Shear stress value was determined with the following formula: τ = 6 μQ/bh2, where τ is the shear stress in dyne/cm2, μ is the viscosity of the medium (0.01 dyne s/cm2, the same with water at 37 °C), Q is the flow rate in ml/min, b is the width of the flow channel (23.4 mm), and h is the height of the flow channel (0.513 mm). For L-flow exposure, step flow (instantaneously increased from 0 to 10 dyne/cm2 followed by steady flow during experimental period) was applied to the cells. The OsciFlow™ regulates flow direction by closing and opening pinch valves that constrict or release tubing in the valves. For O-flow, flow was regulated in oscillatory manner and shear stress value was ±10 dyne/cm2 at a frequency of 0.5 s forward/0.5 s reverse (1 Hz). The entire flow device except for OsciFlow™ module was placed in an incubator and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 throughout the experiment. Chemicals and Treatment—15d-PGJ2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. The solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas, and the resulting pellet was immediately dissolved in Me2SO before use. Nimesulide and NS-398 (Cayman Chemical) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored as 10-mm stock solutions until required. HAEC cultured on gelatin-coated Culture Slips™ were treated with 10 μm Nimesulide or NS-398 for 2 h and subsequently exposed to flow for 6 or 24 h. Transfection of siRNA—Nrf2 siRNA (50 and 100 μm) was transfected into HAEC by Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to flow exposure. The target sequence for human Nrf2 siRNA was 5′-AAG AGT ATG AGC TGG AAA AAC-3′. Nrf2 siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. RNA Blot Analysis—Following flow exposure, the cells on the culture slips were scraped and collected and total RNA was extracted with ISOGEN (Wako). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for Northern blotting analysis. The RNA samples were electrophoresed and transferred onto Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes that had been reverse-transcribed from HAECs by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Band intensities were measured by NIH imaging software and normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or ribosomal RNA. Immunoblot Analysis—After flow exposure, the cells on the culture slips were scraped and collected, and whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). An anti-human Nrf2 antibody and anti-LaminB antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The band intensities were measured by NIH imaging software and normalized to LaminB. Immunocytochemistry—At the end of the flow exposure, the cells on the culture slips were fixed with 10% formalin and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X. After blocking with 10% normal goat serum, cells were treated with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human Nrf2 and then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Cells were also stained with DAPI and observed by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss). ChIP Analysis—ChIP analysis was performed as previously described (31Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, after flow exposure, the cells on the culture slips were fixed with formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were collected by scraping and then sonicated. Immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out using control rabbit IgG and anti-Nrf2 antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were used as templates for PCR with the following primers: human NQO1 ARE, 5′-AAG TGT GTT GTA TGG GCC CC-3′ and 5′-TCG TCC CAA GAG AGT CCA GG-3′; human NQO1 second exon, 5′-CCT GTA GCT GAA GGT TTG CTG G-3′ and 5′-CCT ACC TGT GAT GTC CTT TCT GG-3′. 10% of the chromatin DNA used for immunoprecipitation was similarly subjected to PCR analysis and indicated as input. Enzyme Immunoassay—After the flow exposure, cells were cultured in fresh medium for 3 h. The prostaglandin concentration in the culture medium was measured by enzyme immunoassay using a PGD2-MOX EIA kit (Cayman) and a 15d-PGJ2 Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Inc.). Plasmid Construction—Mouse Keap1 deletion mutants were generated as previously described (32Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the N terminus. Each Cys to Ala mutant of Keap1 was produced by PCR and standard recombination techniques as previously described (33Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Constructs authenticity were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as previously described (32Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Keap1 mutants were transfected into 293T cells and treated with biotin-conjugated prostaglandin (26Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were rendered to immunoprecipitation analysis with avidin beads and anti-HA or anti-Keap1 antibodies. Statistics—Data were presented as means ± S.D. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance and the Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. L-flow Induces the Expression of Nrf2 Target Genes—To examine whether Nrf2 is activated in response to blood flow, we exposed HAECs to either L-flow or O-flow using the Streamer (STR-4000) system equipped with an OsciFlow module (see “Experimental Procedures”). Exposure of HAECs to steady L-flow for 24 h induced the expression of the genes NQO1, HO-1, and ferritin heavy chain (FTH) (Fig. 1A), all of which are known target genes of Nrf2. This result is in very good agreement with a previous report (13Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y. Thomas S. Cook C.K. Wasserman M.A. Medford R.M. Jaiswal A.K. Kunsch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, exposure of HAECs to O-flow did not induce these Nrf2 target genes (Fig. 1A). Time course studies revealed that inducible expression of the NQO1 gene occurred 12 h after exposure to L-flow (Fig. 1B). We also found that VCAM-1 mRNA was induced 6 h after exposure to O-flow, but not to L-flow (data not shown). In contrast, exposure of HAECs to O-flow for 6, 12, and 24 h did not induce NQO1 gene expression (Fig. 1, A and B). These results demonstrate that L-flow and O-flow regulate cytoprotective gene expression differentially in HAECs and that L-flow transduces signals that specifically activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway. Nrf2 Is Essential for L-flow-dependent Expression of Cytoprotective Genes—We then examined whether Nrf2 actually contributes to the inducible expression of a set of ARE-regulated genes in response to L-flow. To address this issue, we knocked down the expression of endogenous Nrf2 in HAECs using the siRNA method. Transfection of Nrf2-siRNA diminished, albeit not completely, the L-flow-induced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (Fig. 2A) and the gene expressions of both NQO1 and HO-1 (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that Nrf2 activity is indispensable for the inducible expression of ARE-regulated genes in response to L-flow in HAECs. We also found that the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in HAECs is inducible by diethylmaleate (DEM) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating that Nrf2 is regulated by electrophiles and the proteasomal protein degradation system (Fig. 2C). This is in very good agreement with the regulation of Nrf2 activity in other cell types (23Itoh K. Tong K.I. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). COX-2 Inhibitors Attenuate Nrf2 Activation during the Acute Phase of Laminar Shear Stress—It was recently demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 activates the ARE-Nrf2 pathway (26Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 34Gong P. Stewart D. Hu B. Li N. Cook J. Nel A. Alam J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that exposure of endothelial cells to L-flow enhances the generation of 15d-PGJ2 through up-regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, COX-2, and l-PGD synthetase (35Pearce M.J. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Whatley R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Taba Y. Sasaguri T. Miyagi M. Abumiya T. Miwa Y. Ikeda T. Mitsumata M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Inoue H. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Yokota C. Miyagi M. Sasaguri T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that 15d-PGJ2 accumulates in response to L-flow and mediates the activation of Nrf2 in endothelial cells. PGD2 is non-enzymatically dehydrated to generate electrophilic PGs such as 15d-PGJ2 (38Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The electrophilic nature of 15d-PGJ2 seems to accelerate its binding to protein sulfhydryls, including the cysteines of Keap1. We therefore surmise that detecting 15d-PGJ2 in its free form might be difficult, especially at low concentrations. We first measured the concentration of PGD2 in the culture medium of HAECs. Exposure of HAECs to L-flow for 6 and 24 h increased the production of PGD2 (Fig. 3, A and B), agreeing well with the previous report (36Taba Y. Sasaguri T. Miyagi M. Abumiya T. Miwa Y. Ikeda T. Mitsumata M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The accumulation of 15d-PGJ2 was observed after 24 h of exposure to L-flow, but not after only 6 h (Fig. 3C). Exposure of HAECs to O-flow for 6 h increased PGD2 to a level comparable to that observed in the case of L-flow (Fig. 3A), but the level did not persist until the 24-h time point (Fig. 3B). We next examined the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on the L-flow-induced activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Nimesulide and NS-398, two specific COX-2 inhibitors (39Warner T.D. Giuliano F. Vojnovic I. Bukasa A. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), had an influence on the accumulation of PGD2 at 6- and 24-h time points (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, nimesulide and NS-398 reduced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 at the 6-h time point in the course of L-flow exposure. This suggests that an undetectable level of 15d-PGJ2 or other electrophilic PGs might be generated downstream of PGD2 and that these electrophiles might activate Nrf2 in endothelial cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the COX-2 pathway contributes to Nrf2 activation in the acute phase (i.e. 6 h) following exposure to L-flow. On the contrary, nimesulide affected neither Nrf2 accumulation nor NQO1 and HO-1 gene expression at the 24-h time point after exposure to L-flow (Fig. 3, E and F). Whereas we do not have a clear explanation for the lack of inhibitor effect at this time point, one plausible explanation is that an unidentified signaling pathway might compensate for the COX-2 pathway in the activation of Nrf2 in the chronic phase (i.e. 24 h) of L-flow. Cyclopentenone PGs Activate Nrf2 by Binding to Reactive Cysteines in the Keap1 IVR—Because COX-2 inhibitor attenuated the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in the acute phase of L-flow, we examined if 15d-PGJ2, a downstream product of COX-2, activates the Nrf2 pathway in HAECs. The results demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 induced both Nrf2 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 4A), and the expressions of the HO-1, NQO1, and FTH genes (Fig. 4B) in HAECs. The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 coincided with the induction of HO-1 gene expression and preceded induction of the NQO1 and FTH genes. Recently, cyclopentenone PGs (cyPGs), such as 15d-PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2, were shown to bind directly to Keap1 and activate the Nrf2-Keap1 system (26Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 40Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To explore the significance of cyPGs binding to Keap1, we examined the binding of biotin-tagged 15d-PGJ2 to Keap1 using various Keap1 deletion and point mutants (Fig. 4C). A pull-down analysis with avidin beads followed by probing with anti-HA antibody demonstrated that HA-ΔIVR, which lacks the IVR region, binds weakly to biotin-tagged 15d-PGJ2 compared with HA-Keap1, HA-ΔBTB, and HA-ΔDGR (Fig. 4D). When cysteines of the IVR were mutated to alanines, Keap1 bound neither 15d-PGJ2 nor Δ12-PGJ2, but this was not observed with the NTR or CTR cysteine mutants (Fig. 4E). These results thus demonstrate that cysteines in the Keap1 IVR are essential for Keap1 to bind to 15d-PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2 and are consistent with the current hypothesis that oxidative modification of cysteines in the Keap1 IVR is important for the response to electrophiles (33Wakabayashi N.

By screening several detergents, we identified Brij 98 as a detergent in which the EGF receptor is retained in detergent-resistant membrane fractions. To identify the difference in lipid composition between those rafts that harbored the EGF receptor (detergent-free and Brij 98-resistant) and those that did not (Triton X-100-resistant), we used multidimensional electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to perform a lipidomics study on these three raft preparations. Although all three raft preparations were similarly enriched in cholesterol, the EGF receptor-containing rafts contained more ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and less sphingomyelin than did the non-EGF receptor-containing Triton X-100 rafts. As a result, the detergent-free and Brij 98-resistant rafts exhibited a balance of inner and outer leaflet lipids, whereas the Triton X-100 rafts contained a preponderance of outer leaflet lipids. Furthermore, in all raft preparations, the outer leaflet phospholipid species were significantly different from those in the bulk membrane, whereas the inner leaflet lipids were quite similar to those found in the bulk membrane. These findings indicate that the EGF receptor is retained only in rafts that exhibit a lipid distribution compatible with a bilayer structure and that the selection of phospholipids for inclusion into rafts occurs mainly on the outer leaflet lipids.

Lipid rafts are small, low density plasma membrane domains that contain high levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Tight interactions between the sterol and the sphingolipids result in the formation of a domain that is resistant to solubilization in detergents (4Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Transmembrane proteins such as flotillin have also been shown to be enriched in lipid rafts compared with the bulk plasma membrane (13Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Of special interest has been the finding that many molecules involved in cell signaling are enriched in lipid rafts. This includes proteins such as receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, serpentine receptors, and heterotrimeric and low molecular weight G proteins (for review, see Refs. 14Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar and 15Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). As a result of the selective localization of signaling molecules in lipid rafts, these domains are thought to serve as organizational platforms for the process of signal transduction. Recent studies have suggested that lipid rafts represent a heterogeneous collection of domains showing differences in both protein and lipid composition. For example, Madore et al. (16Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) showed that, in lipid raft preparations, the GPI-anchored prion protein can be selectively immunoprecipitated away from a second GPI-anchored protein, Thy-1, suggesting that the two GPI-anchored proteins exist in physically separate domains. Gomez-Mouton et al. (17Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) used immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the raft proteins urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and CD44 and the raft lipids GM1 and GM3 distribute asymmetrically in cells. The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and GM3 localized to the leading edge of migrating T cells, whereas CD44 and GM1 were found at the trailing edge of the cells. Because all four components were isolated in the same lipid raft fraction, these findings suggest that rafts with distinct protein and lipid compositions coexist within cells and show differences in spatial localization. Differential sensitivity of proteins to extraction by various detergents has provided additional evidence for heterogeneity among lipid rafts (18Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 19Slimane T.A. Trugnan G. van Izendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 891-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The classical method for the preparation of lipid rafts involves the extraction of cells in 1% Triton X-100, followed by separation of the low density raft membranes in a sucrose gradient (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). The use of other detergents to extract membranes has demonstrated that, even among a single class of raft proteins, there is variability in their resistance to detergent extraction. For example, GPI-anchored Thy-1 was shown to be associated with low density membrane domains when cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% Brij 96. However, another GPI-anchored protein, NCAM-120, was completely solubilized by both detergents (16Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, these two similarly anchored proteins must exist in domains of different composition that are differentially sensitive to detergent extraction. Schuck et al. (21Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) reported that rafts made using different detergents do indeed contain different complements of proteins and are variably enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids compared with total cell membranes. The EGF receptor, a type I transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity (22Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J.

Localization of the EGF receptor to rafts appears to modulate both its ligand binding and tyrosine kinase activities because the disruption of lipid rafts by acute cholesterol depletion leads to an enhancement of both these activities (24Pike L.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This suggests that the rafts into which the EGF receptor partitions may be different from classical Triton X-100-resistant rafts. In this work, we screened a variety of detergents to determine which supported the retention of the EGF receptor in a low density, detergent-resistant fraction. Among the detergents tested, only Brij 98 produced a distinct EGF receptor-containing raft fraction. Subsequently, multidimensional ESI/MS was used to quantitate the differences in lipid composition of rafts that contained the EGF receptor (Brij 98-resistant membranes and detergent-free raft preparations (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R. G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar)) and those that did not retain the EGF receptor (Triton X-100-resistant membranes). The results of this lipidomics analysis demonstrate that, although all rafts are similarly enriched in cholesterol, the EGF receptor-containing rafts possess a balance of inner and outer leaflet lipids, whereas non-EGF receptor-containing rafts contain principally outer leaflet lipids. In addition, the data demonstrate that phospholipids in the outer leaflet of rafts undergo a significant selection for inclusion into rafts, whereas inner leaflet lipids show relatively little selection compared with the bulk membrane.

All of the solvents used for sample preparation and for MS analyses were obtained from Burdick & Jackson. Cells and Tissue Culture—CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with human wild-type EGF receptor in pcDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen) using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were passaged in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and colonies stably expressing the EGF receptor were selected upon addition of 400 μg/ml G418 to the growth medium. Isolated clones were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus 200 μg/ml G418. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Lipid Rafts—One D150 mm plate of confluent cells was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and drained well. To the plate was added 1 ml of MES-buffered saline (50 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 150 mm NaCl) containing Triton X-100, Brij 98, Brij 96, Tween 20, or octyl glucoside. All detergents were used at a concentration of 1%, except octyl glucoside, which was used at a concentration of 2%. The detergent/protein ratio was 10:1 for the four detergents used at 1% and 20:1 for octyl glucoside. Cells were scraped into the detergent-containing buffer and mechanically disrupted by passage 20 times through a 3-inch 22-gauge needle. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. The material was placed in the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and a 10-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient in MES-buffered saline was poured on top. The gradients were centrifuged for 3 h at 175,000 × g and then fractionated into 12 fractions (1 ml each). Fractions 3–5 of the sucrose gradients were used for MS analysis of lipids. Preparation of Non-detergent Lipid Rafts—The method of Macdonald and Pike (30Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was used for the preparation of non-detergent lipid rafts. Briefly, four D150 mm plates of confluent cells were scraped into base buffer (250 mm sucrose and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)) to which 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 had been added. Cells were pelleted and then lysed in 1 ml of base buffer with calcium and magnesium by passage 20 times through a 3-inch 22-gauge needle, and a post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by low speed centrifugation. The post-nuclear supernatant was made 25% in OptiPrep by addition of an equal volume of 50% OptiPrep in base buffer. Rafts were isolated by centrifugation in a 0–20% OptiPrep gradient in base buffer. Fractions 1 and 2 were pooled for MS lipid analysis. Western Blotting—For analysis, 100 μl of each fraction from a gradient was separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, which was blocked by incubation with 10% nonfat powdered milk. The nitrocellulose strips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody, washed, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence. Preparation of Lipid Extracts and MS Analysis of Lipids—Lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer procedure with modifications as described previously (31Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W.

Briefly, to each lipid raft sample (∼100 μg of protein) were added internal standards, including 14:0-14:0 PS (40 nmol/mg of protein), 15:0-15:0 phosphatidylglycerol (9 nmol/mg of protein), 15:0-15:0 PE (57 nmol/mg of protein), and 14:1-14:1 PC (45.0 nmol/mg of protein). Lipids from each sample were extracted twice against 2 ml of 50 mm LiCl, back-extracted twice against 2 ml of 10 mm LiCl, filtered with a 0.2-μm PFTE syringe filter, and finally stored in 200 μl of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol. Each lipid solution was further diluted ∼20-fold just prior to infusion and lipid analysis. Multidimensional ESI/MS analyses were performed utilizing a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source as described previously (31Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15584-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Typically, a 1-min period of signal averaging in the profile mode was employed for each mass spectrum, and a 1–2-min period of signal averaging was used for each tandem mass spectrum. Identification and quantitation of each individual molecular species were performed in a multidimensional MS array format as described previously (31Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W.

Gross R.W. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2005; 2: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) Protein and Cholesterol Assays—Proteins were determined using the precipitation Lowry method described by Peterson (35Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was determined using a Wako CII cholesterol assay kit. EGF Receptors in Detergent-resistant Membranes—Five different detergents were screened for their ability to generate EGF receptor-containing lipid rafts. These included Triton X-100, Tween 20, Brij 98, Brij 96, and octyl glucoside. The first four detergents were used at 1%, whereas the latter detergent was used at 2%. Solubilization was aided by passage of the detergent lysates through a 22-gauge needle. After cell solubilization and centrifugation through a 5–30% sucrose gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the gradients were fractionated and analyzed by Western blotting for the distribution of a variety of plasma membrane proteins. The distribution of marker proteins in a detergent-free raft preparation was included for comparison. The results are shown in Fig. 1. In the detergent-free raft preparation, the EGF receptor was recovered in the three lightest fractions of the gradient along with other raft proteins such as flotillin and the dually acylated Gq protein. These fractions were distinct from those that contained a plasma membrane marker protein, the transferrin receptor, indicating that rafts had been separated from the bulk plasma membrane. Caveolin was broadly distributed in this gradient possibly because of the interaction of caveolae with cytoskeletal elements. Extraction of cells with 1% Triton X-100 resulted in the complete solubilization of the EGF receptor, the transferrin receptor, and the heterotrimeric Gq protein as evidenced by the recovery of these proteins in the high density portion of the gradient. By contrast, the raft protein flotillin floated into the low density region of the gradient, identifying the location of the lipid raft fraction in this gradient. As in the detergent-free preparation, caveolin was recovered throughout the gradient. Membranes solubilized with 2% octyl glucoside showed a pattern of marker protein distribution similar to that observed for Triton X-100-solubilized membranes in which the EGF receptor was excluded from the low density fraction marked by flotillin. Unexpectedly, solubilization of CHO cells with 1% Brij 96 led to the recovery of almost all proteins, including the raft marker flotillin, in the high density non-raft fractions of the gradient. The lone exception to this rule was caveolin, which was partially recovered in the upper fractions of the gradient. At the other end of the spectrum, treatment of cells with 1% Tween 20 resulted in the recovery of all marker proteins in the middle third of the gradient, with little distinction in the distribution of the different proteins. This indicates that, even at a high concentration and when used with mechanical agitation, Tween 20 does not differentially solubilize raft and non-raft membranes and thus does not permit isolation of a distinct low density raft fraction. Among the detergents tested, only Brij 98 appeared to generate a distinct low density, detergent-resistant fraction that contained the EGF receptor as well as known raft proteins. Approximately one-third to one-half of the EGF receptor was recovered in the low density region of the gradient (fractions 3–5) that also contained flotillin and Gq. The transferrin receptor, a plasma membrane marker, was found in the middle of the gradient at a position distinct from that of the lipid raft proteins. Caveolin again distributed broadly throughout the gradient. Characterization of Brij 98-resistant Membranes—Additional studies were undertaken to determine whether the low density membrane fraction obtained by solubilization of cells in Brij 98 effectively separated plasma membrane raft proteins from proteins present on intracellular membranes. In addition to the distribution of the EGF receptor, flotillin, Gq, the transferrin receptor, and caveolin, Fig. 2 (left) shows the distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase, an intrinsic plasma membrane protein; annexin-2, an extrinsic plasma membrane protein; calnexin, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum; β-COP, a marker for the Golgi; and prohibitin, a mitochondrial membrane protein. All of the intracellular membrane marker proteins were recovered in the high density portion of the gradient, well separated from the raft fractions that contained the EGF receptor, flotillin, and Gq. Thus, solubilization of membranes with Brij 98 resulted in the production of a low density fraction that was devoid of markers for intracellular membranes and non-raft plasma membrane proteins, but that contained the EGF receptor and other known raft proteins. The data shown in Fig. 2 (left) were generated under conditions in which there was no detergent present in the sucrose gradient. However, as also shown in Fig. 2 (right), inclusion of 0.5% Brij 98 in the gradient fractions did not alter the distribution of any of the proteins. These data indicate that the distribution of proteins observed using this procedure was not the result of a “reconstitution” of membrane domains associated with removal of detergent during gradient centrifugation. MS Analysis of Raft Lipid Composition—To begin to identify the differences between raft preparations that retained the EGF receptor (detergent-free preparations and Brij 98-resistant membranes) and those that did not (Triton X-100-resistant membranes), lipid rafts of each type were prepared and subjected to multidimensional ESI/MS analysis. Table I compares the lipid composition by class of each of the three raft preparations as well as membranes from the PNS fraction. The values for the abundance of each individual species are presented in Supplemental Tables 1–3.Table ILipid content of rafts and PNS membranesPNSDetergent-free raftsBrij 98 raftsTriton X-100 raftsAverageS.D.PhospholipidAverageS.D.PhospholipidAverageS.D.PhospholipidAverageS.D.Phospholipidnmol/mg proteinmol %nmol/mg proteinmol %nmol/mg proteinmol %nmol/mg proteinmol %PE127.1745.1149.95384.2436.3341.251394.7099.3841.46700.3059.2828.20PC62.2414.5924.44158.6417.5217.03332.7387.359.89285.3064.6511.50SPM35.174.9613.81257.9944.5627.701057.54143.6931.441142.18202.5646.04Phosphatidylserine14.373.755.6584.3510.539.06428.9056.0912.75272.706.3610.99Phosphatidylinositol11.022.144.3320.052.672.1548.067.531.4342.744.331.72Phosphatidic acid2.411.170.955.731.100.6272.997.172.1728.845.401.16Phosphatidylglycerol2.221.230.8720.523.112.2029.102.890.878.551.060.34Total phospholipid254.6025.30100.00931.5253.60100.003364.02399.80100.002480.61331.90100.00Cholesterol67.802.358847926883202215103Mole % cholesterol21.0348.6944.4147.17 Open table in a new tab All three raft fractions had a substantially higher mole percent of cholesterol and SPM than did the PNS membranes. By contrast, the mole percent PC and phosphatidylinositol in the raft preparations was ∼2-fold lower than that seen in the PNS. As observed previously (36Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.-N. Gross R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), PS was enriched ∼2-fold in the raft preparations compared with the PNS. These findings demonstrate that all three lipid raft preparations had a composition that was distinct from that of the starting membranes and exhibited the enrichment in cholesterol and SPM that is characteristic of these domains. Although many of the general characteristics of the lipid raft fractions were shared among all three preparations, the phospholipid compositions of the two raft preparations that retained EGF receptors were similar to each other, but differed significantly from the lipid composition of the Triton X-100-resistant rafts that excluded EGF receptors (Table I). For example, the detergent-free and Brij 98 raft preparations contained ∼40 mol % PE, whereas the Triton X-100 rafts contained about one-third less of this lipid. Conversely, the detergent-free and Brij 98-resistant membranes contained ∼30 mol % SPM, whereas the Triton X-100-resistant rafts contained ∼46 mol % SPM, a 50% increase compared with the receptor-containing rafts. Thus, the EGF receptor-containing rafts had a phospholipid composition that was distinct from that of the non-EGF receptor-containing Triton X-100 rafts. PE and the acidic phospholipids tend to be found mainly in the inner leaflet of the membrane, whereas PC and SPM are most often found in the outer leaflet of the membrane. The data in Table I indicate that the PNS and EGF receptor-containing lipid raft fractions had slightly more of these inner leaflet-preferring lipids than of the outer leaflet-preferring lipids, whereas the situation was reversed in the non-EGF receptor-containing Triton X-100 rafts. To determine whether there were any additional general differences between inner and outer leaflet lipids in these membrane preparations, the chain length and saturation of the fatty acyl groups were compared in these subsets of lipids. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of inner and outer leaflet phospholipids with respect to the chain length of the fatty acyl groups. For purposes of this analysis, PC and SPM were considered to be outer leaflet lipids, whereas PE and the anionic phospholipids were considered to be inner leaflet lipids. Fig. 3 shows that there appeared to be relatively little selection of inner leaflet lipids based on chain length. The fraction of inner leaflet lipids containing C16, C18, C22, and C24 fatty acyl side chains was similar in the PNS and all three lipid raft preparations. Only for the lipids containing C20 fatty acyl groups were there any differences, with the EGF receptor-containing rafts containing modestly fe"

Transcriptional events underlying adipogenesis continue to emerge, but the link between chromatin remodeling of specific target loci and preadipocyte differentiation remains elusive. We have identified Krüppel-like factor-6 (KLF6), a recently described tumor suppressor gene, as a repressor of the proto-oncogene Delta-like 1 (Dlk1), a gene encoding a transmembrane protein that inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Forced expression of KLF6 strongly inhibits Dlk1 expression in preadipocytes and NIH 3T3 cells in vivo, whereas down-regulation of KLF6 in 3T3-L1 cells by small interfering RNA prevents adipogenesis. Repression of Dlk1 requires HDAC3 deacetylase activity, which is recruited to the endogenous Dlk1 promoter where it interacts with KLF6. Our studies identify the interaction between HDAC3 and KLF6 as a potential mechanism underlying human adipogenesis, and highlight the role of KLF6 as a multifunctional transcriptional regulator capable of mediating adipocyte differentiation through gene repression.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3817-3820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abrupt down-regulation of Dlk1 following hormonal stimulation in preadipocytes is an early and necessary event in the phenotypic conversion to fat cells. Forced expression of Dlk1 prevents adipogenesis, whereas enforced down-regulation enhances adipocyte differentiation. Following the reduction in DLK1, rapid induction of adipogenic transcription factors, including SREBP1, C/EBPβ/γ then C/EBPα, and PPARγ2, leads to terminal differentiation of adipocytes, and expression of adipocyte proteins, including leptin and adipsin (1Rosen E.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) has explored the activity of a transcription factor, KLF6 (also known as Zf9 or CPBP), a ubiquitously expressed 283-amino acid Krüppel-like zinc finger protein and a member of a growing family of related transcriptional regulators. KLF6 contains an 82-amino acid C-terminal DNA-binding domain identical to other Krüppel-like factors, and a 201-amino acid N-terminal activation domain, whose only homology is to KLF7 in its N-terminal 41 amino acids (6Matsumoto N.

KLF6 was originally identified as a rapidly induced mRNA following activation of hepatic stellate cells, a mesenchymal liver cell, during liver injury (7Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, stellate cells harbor many features of adipocytes, including the storage of lipids as vitamin A esters (retinoids), the production of leptin, and phenotypic plasticity in defined biologic contexts (8Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Transcriptional targets of KLF6 include transforming growth factor-β1 and its receptors (9Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol.

Recently, we have established Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) as a novel tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in human prostate and colon cancers (12Narla G. Heath K.E. Reeves H.L. Li D. Giono L.E.

A key mechanism of tumor suppression by KLF6 is the transcriptional up-regulation of p21waf1,cdi a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose induction also accounts for the growth suppressive activity of the tumor suppressor p53 (12Narla G. Heath K.E. Reeves H.L. Li D. Giono L.E. Kimmelman A.C. Glucksman M.J. Narla J. Eng F.J. Chan A.M. Ferrari A.C. Martignetti J.A. Friedman S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 2563-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).Although many studies have described down-regulation of Dlk1 during adipocyte differentiation, the underlying mechanisms regulating this event have not been well characterized. The phenotype resemblance of hepatic stellate cells (the original source of KLF6) to adipocytes led us to explore a potential role of KLF6 in adipogenesis, particularly because stellate cell activation in liver injury is also accompanied by KLF6 induction (7Ratziu V.

In fact, previous studies have documented the induction KLF6 during adipocyte differentiation, but its role in this process has been unclear (14Inuzuka H. Wakao H. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Tojo H.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Dlk1 is a transcriptional target of KLF6 and, if so, to elucidate the mechanism of Dlk1 gene regulation by KLF6. Our data demonstrate that KLF6 promotes adipocyte differentiation by transcriptionally repressing Dlk1 expression, and this repression specifically requires the deacetylase activity of HDAC3.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Plasmids—PCIneo-KLF6 (human) expression plasmid was constructed as described previously (7Ratziu V.

The tetracycline-inducible expression system constructs pTet-splice and pTet-tTAk were purchased from Invitrogen. Expression plasmids pVgRXR and pIND for the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system were purchased and prepared for cloning (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid pVgRXR (Invitrogen) was used to establish 3T3-L1 cells under Zeocin™ selection (600 μg/ml) to produce a stable transcriptional transactivator 3T3-L1 cell line following the manufacturer's procedures (Invitrogen). Insertion of the FLAG-HDAC3 fragment into the pIND expression vector was by digesting pCDNA3-HDAC3-FLAG with EcoRI and NotI. The resulting HDAC3-containing DNA fragment was then ligated into the EcoRI site of pIND. The cDNA insert was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Cell culture and differentiation of preadipocytes.Tissue and Cell Culture—3T3-L1, NIH 3T3, HeLa, 293 and 293T cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3, 293, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. For induction of adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 and Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured in the presence of 4 μm biotin (Sigma) until the day of induction. Cells were re-incubated in medium containing 10% calf serum, 4 μm biotin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), and 1 μm insulin (Sigma). Culture medium was changed every 3 days. For histology, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, rinsed in PBS, and stained with Oil Red O (0.6% in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 25 min).Transfection Assays—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For luciferase assay, 3T3-L1 cells or HeLa cells cultured in 10-cm plates (Corning Glass) were transfected with 10 μg of pCIneo empty vector or pCIneo-KLF6, with or without pCDNA3-HDAC3, as indicated in the text, together with the Dlk1 promoter-luciferase construct. Five ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) were co-transfected in each dish as a control for transfection efficiency. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and cell lysates prepared using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity in 10 μl of lysate was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system and a Dynex luminometer. Transfection efficiency was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity measured in the same lysate.Stable Transfection and Tetracycline-inducible Expression of KLF6 in Cultured Cells—To establish cell lines stably expressing KLF6, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCIneo-KLF6. Ten μg of pCIneo was transfected separately as a control. Two days after transfection, cells were selected with 600 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Individual colonies resistant to the selective medium were transferred to new plates for expansion.A tetracycline-inducible system for regulated expression of KLF6 was established as described (16Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), with modification. Briefly, pTet-KLF6 was constructed by inserting the rat KLF6 cDNA into AccI/EcoRV sites of pTet-splice vector (Invitrogen). A tetracycline-inducible cell line expressing KLF6 was established by co-transfecting pTet-KLF6 and pBpuro into NIH 3T3 cells line that expressed pTet-pTAk, followed by selection with histidine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) containing 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). For induction of KLF6, cells were washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and changed to medium without tetracycline.Stable Transfection and Ponasterone A-inducible Expression of FLAG-tagged HDAC3 in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—Following the insertion of FLAG-tagged HDAC3 into expression vector pIND (see above), stable transfectants of 3T3-L1 cells carrying the pVgRXR transgene under Zeocin™ drug selection were used following transfection of the pIND-FLAG/HDAC3 construct. After 48 h, transfected 3T3-L1 cells were placed under growth selection with 400 μg/ml G418 (geneticin, Invitrogen) and 400 μg/ml Zeocin™ for 2 weeks to select for both transgenes and individual populations of stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells. Individual clones were then selected for the induction of the FLAG-tagged HDAC3 target gene following treatment with ponasterone A (5 μm) (Sigma) and analyzed by immunoblot studies.Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNA from each sample was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). After UV cross-linking, filters were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for Dlk1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. After hybridization, blots were washed three times with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 20 min each wash, followed by exposure to Kodak MS film at -80 °C.Real Time Reverse-Transcription-PCR of Total RNA—3T3-L1 cells were grown on 10-cm plastic plates, induced to differentiate into adipocytes, as described above, and then harvested at 100% confluency. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent® and chloroform extraction. RNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometry. Synthesis of cDNA was performed on 2 μg of total RNA per sample with random primers using reagents contained in the reverse transcription system kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The reverse transcriptase product was diluted 20-fold in nuclease-free H2O, and 5 μl of each sample were loaded into 96-well plates for real time PCR in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). β-Actin was used as a housekeeping gene for normalization, and H2O was used as negative control. Amplifications were performed using oligonucleotide primers for murine KLF6 (upper, 5′-GAGTTCCTCCGTCATTTCCA-3′, and lower, 5′-GTCGCCATTACCCTTGTCAC-3′), murine Dlk1 (upper, 5′-TGTCAATGGAGTCTGCAAGG-3′, and lower, 5′-TCGTACTGGCCTTTCTCCAG-3′), and β-actin (upper, 5′-GATGAGATTGGCATGGCTTT-3′, and lower, 5′-AGAGGTGGGGTGGCTT-3′), platinum Taq polymerase, and SYBR Green as fluorescent DNA-binding dye. Fluorescence signals were analyzed during each of 40 cycles (denaturation, 15 s at 95 °C; annealing, 15 s at 56 °C; and extension, 40 s at 72 °C). Detection of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the homogeneity of the DNA products. Relative quantitation was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method as described in the User Bulletin 2, ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. CT indicates the fractional cycle number at which the amount of amplified target genes reaches a fixed threshold within the linear phase of gene amplification and is inversely related to the abundance of mRNA transcripts in the initial sample. Mean CT of duplicate measurements was used to calculate ΔCT as the difference in CT for target and reference. ΔCT for each sample was compared with the corresponding CT at day 0 and expressed as ΔΔCT. Relative quantitation was expressed as fold change of the gene of interest compared with the starting condition (day 0), according to the formula 2-ΔΔCT.Taqman Quantitative PCR—Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed by the Taqman system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were designed by the PrimerExpress software. CT for the internal control (cyclophilin) and target genes were determined from raw fluorescence. The amount of each gene was derived from its CT and normalized with the amount of cyclophilin. Samples are in duplicate.Sequences of the Taqman primers and probes are as following: cyclophilin-F, 5′-TGTGCCAGGGTGGTGACTT-3′; cyclophilin-R, 5′-TCAAATTTCTCTCCGTAGATGGACTT-3′; cyclophilin probe, 5′-ACACGCCATAATGGCACTGGTGG-3′; aP2-F, 5′-CACCGCAGACGACAGGAAG-3′; aP2-R, 5′-GCACCTGCACCAGGGC-3′; aP2 probe, 5′-CCGCCATCTAGGGTTATGATGCTCTTCA-3′; PPARγ2-F, 5′-CCATTCTGGCCCACCAAC-3′; PPARγ2-R, 5′-AATGCGAGTGGTCTTCCATCA-3′; PPARγ2 probe, 5′-TCGGAATCAGCTCTGTGGACCTCTCC-3′; C/EBPα-F, 5′-TCTGCGAGCACGAGACGTC-3′; C/EBPα-R, 5′-AACTCGTCGTTGAAGGCGG-3′; C/EBPα probe, 5′-AGACATCAGCGCCTACATCGACCCG-3′; SCD-1-F, 5′-GCGCTTTGCAAGGTAATGTG-3′; SCD1-R, 5′-CCTTTCAGCAGCACTGTACCAC-3′; and SCD1 probe, 5′-CCTGCCTGCATGGATCAGCCAAAG-3′.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Gel shift assays were performed using a commercial gel shift assay system (Promega). The oligonucleotide sequences from the Dlk1 promoter were as follows (with putative KLF6-binding site underlined, and mutated position(s) indicated): wild type, sense, 5′-CGCGAGGCGTGGGCGTGGGCGGGGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCCCCCGCCCACGCCCACGCCTCGCG-3′; mutant, sense, 5′-CGCGAAAAATGAAAATGAAAAGGGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCCCCTTTTCATTTTCATTTTTCGCG-3′.Single-stranded oligonucleotides (Genelink) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were created by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Geneka) were used for gel shift. DNA-binding reactions were performed with 10 μg of 3T3-L1 nuclear extract incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1× gel shift binding buffer containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), with or without unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides.A monoclonal antibody was generated for use in supershift assays. To do so, the N terminus of KLF6 (amino acids 1–200) was expressed as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified, and inoculated into BALB/c mice. Hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The monoclonal antibody “2A2” was found to be suitable for KLF6 detection in Western blot and supershift. For supershift, 1.5 μg of monoclonal anti-KLF6 antibody was incubated with the above nuclear extract in the presence of 1× gel shift binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Next, 1 μl (∼20,000 cpm/μl) of radiolabeled probe was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were separated through a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel for 2.5 h at 250 V, at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak MS film for 5 h to overnight at -80 °C with an intensifying screen.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a commercial kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Briefly, 2 × 106 3T3-L1 cells at the 5th day of differentiation were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by cell lysis and sonication fracture of the DNA into 200–1000-bp fragments. Proteins cross-linked to DNA were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-Zf9/KLF6 antibody (R-173) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or two different anti-HDAC3 antibodies (a gift from Dr. Eric Verdin, and anti-HDAC3 antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively) and 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose beads. The protein-A-agarose-antibody-protein complexes were washed extensively and eluted, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cross-link was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and proteins were digested by proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA carrier and used as a template for PCRs. Genomic sequence primers encompassing the promoter region -481 to -283 upstream of transcriptional start site were used to amplify immunoprecipitated DNA: forward, 5′-GTGGTTTTCGTGTGTGCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGTCTCAGGCCGC-3′.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For co-immunoprecipitation assay, 293T cells were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Thirty six hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min using IP lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was precipitated for 30 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 1 h using 4 μg of anti-Zf9/KLF6 antibody (R-173) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 4 μg of anti-HDAC3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with 50 μl of protein-G beads (Pierce) or using 50 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma). The beads were subsequently washed three times with 800 μl of IP wash buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 500 mm NaCl), solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described below. As a negative control, immunoprecipitation was conducted using control rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma). For immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting procedures with the various antibodies against HDAC1–5 and -7, the antibodies were obtained from various sources and described in the Fig. 6 legend.For Western blotting, cell extracts were harvested in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, standard protocol). Protein samples (30 μg/sample) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (1× TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (anti-Zf9/KLF6 (R-173) 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HDAC3 1:250, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG; Amersham Biosciences) was used according to manufacturer's instructions at 1:2,000 dilution, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Biosciences).Bicistronic Bacterial Expression System for Direct Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis—KLF6 containing an N-terminal combination hexahistidine-thioredoxin-TEV protease site tag was co-expressed with HDAC3 in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells by bicistronic expression (17Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Cleared extracts in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (P100 buffer) were prepared from cells induced at 18 °C for 12–15 h, and the hexahistidine-tagged components were purified by Talon cobalt metal affinity chromatography using P100 buffer with 100 mm imidazole to elute. Similar procedures were used for untagged HDAC3 expressed on its own under identical conditions.In Vitro HDAC Assay—Histone deacetylase activity was assayed essentially as described (18Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar) with 50 μl of crude cell extract and then immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-KLF6 antibody for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitates of human KLF6 were washed three times at 4 °C in a low stringency wash containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. Pretreatment of immunoprecipitates with 100 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA) was performed for 30 min at 4 °C before addition of the peptide substrate. The synthetic peptide substrate was purchased (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) and corresponds to the first 24 residues of the N-terminal domain of bovine histone H4. Immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 2.5 mg (60,000 dpm) of acid-soluble peptide for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with acetic acid and HCl. Released [3H]acetic acid was obtained by extraction with ethyl acetate and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Samples were assayed in triplicate (in four separate experiments), and the nonenzymatic release of label was subtracted to obtain the final value.HDAC Pre-absorption Deacetylase Assays—Cultures of 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged KLF6 expression vector in 100-mm2 dishes as described above. Approximately, 5 × 106 cells were harvested 48 h following transfections, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Nuclear extracts were precleared (pre-absorbed) of HDAC3 or HDAC2 protein using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human HDAC3 antiserum or HDAC2 antiserum (and compared with rabbit preimmune serum) followed by precipitation with protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and supernatants were transferred into separate tubes. Nuclear extracts were resuspended in 50 μl of HDAC buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 150,000 cpm of 3H-labeled and -acetylated H4 peptide. Nuclear extracts, pre-absorbed of HDAC3 or HDAC2 protein, were then used in an anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma) immunoprecipitation followed by an HDAC assay as briefly described here. In a separate experiment, nuclear extracts were pre-cleared (pre-absorbed) of pRb110 (C15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Supernatants were then transferred to new tubes and used further in HDAC assays following immunoprecipitation of FLAG epitope-tagged KLF6 with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with gentle mixing. Deacetylation reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of an acid termination mixture (1 n HCl, 0.16 m glacial acetic acid). 500 μl of ethyl ether was added to each reaction tube and vigorously mixed for 30 s with a vortex. Organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. 400 μl of the organic phase containing ethyl acetate was removed and mixed with 1 ml of scintillant (OCS, Amersham Biosciences). Release of [3H]acetic acid from the histone H4 peptide was measured in counts/min using a scintillation counter (model 1216 LKB-Wallac).Inputs of each of the nuclear extracts used in the deacetylase assays were evaluated using immunoblot analysis to determine the presence or absence of specific HDAC protein in the nuclear extracts used in the HDAC assays. Equivalent amounts of nuclear extract were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis. Separated proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with rabbit anti-human HDAC3 and HDAC2 antiserum. Membranes were visualized using ECL by the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).siRNA KLF6 Silencing—pSuperRetro-KLF6 used to down-regulate KLF6 expression was constructed similarly as described using pSuperRetro vector (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1980845667,"Today's magnetic-field sensors are not capable of making measurements with both high spatial resolution and good field sensitivity. For example, magnetic force microscopy allows the investigation of magnetic structures with a spatial resolution in the nanometre range, but with low sensitivity, whereas SQUIDs and atomic magnetometers enable extremely sensitive magnetic-field measurements to be made, but at low resolution. Here we use one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a microscopic field-imaging technique that combines high spatial resolution (within 3 micrometres) with high field sensitivity (300 picotesla)."
https://openalex.org/W2071601995,"Proteins of the CLCA gene family have been proposed to mediate calcium-activated chloride currents. In this study, we used detailed bioinformatics analysis and found that no transmembrane domains are predicted in hCLCA1 or mCLCA3 (Gob-5). Further analysis suggested that they are globular proteins containing domains that are likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions. In support of the bioinformatics analysis, biochemical studies showed that hCLCA1 and mCLCA3, when expressed in HEK293 cells, could be removed from the cell surface and could be detected in the extracellular medium, even after short incubation times. The accumulation in the medium was shown to be brefeldin A-sensitive, demonstrating that hCLCA1 is constitutively secreted. The N-terminal cleavage products of hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from asthmatic subjects and ovalbumin-challenged mice, demonstrating release from cells in a physiological setting. We conclude that hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 are non-integral membrane proteins and therefore cannot be chloride channels in their own right.

We conclude that hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 are non-integral membrane proteins and therefore cannot be chloride channels in their own right. Many cells are known to possess calcium-dependent chloride channel activities. These include epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells (1Atherton H. Mesher J. Poll C.T. Danahay H.

Although we know little about the identity of these channels, members of the CLCA gene family have been suggested to be candidate calcium-sensitive chloride channels (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L.

Although normally expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, up-regulation of the human calcium-activated chloride channel hCLCA1 has been linked to disease states such as asthma and cystic fibrosis (6Hoshino M.

This up-regulation was observed in bronchial epithelial cells and goblet cells. In the mouse, the ortholog of hCLCA1 (mCLCA3) exhibits a similar expression profile to hCLCA1 and, in addition, has been localized to mucin granules (10Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The expression of mCLCA3 is up-regulated in mouse lung in response to ovalbumin challenge or upon challenge with more complex allergens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, systems that are utilized to model aspects of human asthma (11Nakanishi A. Morita S. Iwashita H. Sagiya Y. Ashida Y. Shirafuji H. Fujisawa Y. Nishimura O. Fujino M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5175-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 12Zhou Y.

Evidence for the CLCA family as calcium-sensitive chloride channels comes from heterologous expression of a number of CLCA isoforms in a range of cellular systems, which resulted in generation of membrane currents activated with high Ca2+ concentrations or with ionomycin. These currents were blocked with chloride channel blockers such as niflumic acid and were performed in Cl- selective conditions (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 4Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

Even in light of this evidence, questions still remain as to whether members of the CLCA family are themselves responsible for the chloride channel activity, or whether they are regulating the activity of an as yet unidentified ion channel. Calcium-sensitive chloride channels have been measured in cells in which expression of CLCA isoforms could not be detected (13Papassotiriou J. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CLCA family members have also been linked to functions other than that of ion channels. For example, mCLCA3 has been suggested to control mucus production (10Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and hCLCA2, which is expressed in pulmonary endothelial cells, has been shown to mediate binding of tumor cells via its interaction with β4 integrin (14Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least one CLCA isoform (hCLCA3) has been demonstrated to be a secreted protein (15Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 45: C1261-C1270Crossref Google Scholar). hCLCA3 is a truncated isoform with no predicted transmembrane domains. CLCA family members are proteolytically cleaved proteins, and there is controversy over which region of hCLCA1 is responsible for the proposed channel activity (16Ji H.-L. DuVall M.D. Patton H.K. Satterfield C.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 274: C455-C464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ran S. Fuller C.M. Arrate M.P. Latorre R. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20630-20637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of hCLCA1 has suggested the presence of four transmembrane domains. This observation was supported by studies using epitope-tagged hCLCA1 to identify the intracellular and extracellular domains of the protein (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have confirmed these observations with untagged hCLCA1 or within a physiological setting. Contrary to previous suggestions, we report here that hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 do not contain any transmembrane domains and that hCLCA1 is secreted into the extracellular medium when overexpressed. In support of this finding, we were able to identify hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 1The abbreviations used are: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BFA, brefeldin A; FnIII, fibronectin type III; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; OVA, ovalbumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; VWA, von Willebrand factor, type A. 1The abbreviations used are: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BFA, brefeldin A; FnIII, fibronectin type III; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; OVA, ovalbumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; VWA, von Willebrand factor, type A.of asthmatics and of ovalbumin-challenged mice, respectively. These results suggest that the ion channel activity associated with these proteins is likely to be due to a regulatory function and that hCLCA1 could not possess endogenous, calcium-sensitive chloride channel activity. Bioinformatics Analysis—Transmembrane analysis was carried out using the programs TMHMM (18Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E. L.L. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) and also when searched against the domain data bases Pfam and SMART, using InterProScan. The FnIII domain assignment was confirmed by generating a Hidden Markov Model for this region from a CLCA family protein multiple sequence alignment and searching it against the SCOP Superfamily Hidden Markov Model data base (28Gough J. Karplus K. Hughey R. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) using HHsearch (29Soding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal sequence was predicted using SignalP (30Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5586) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—A48 anti-hCLCA1 antibody is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide sequence ((C)VNAARRRVIPQQS(C)), corresponding to amino acid residues 681-693 in hCLCA1. The A6637 anti-mCLCA3 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide sequence (SGLRTAFTVIKKKYPTDGS), corresponding to amino acid residues 388-406 in mCLCA3 (produced by Invitrogen). Both antibodies were affinity purified. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used to detect the V5 protein tag. Mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 was used to detect the Myc protein tag (Calbiochem; Merck Biosciences Ltd., Nottingham, UK). Secondary antibodies used for Western blots were HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were goat anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor 568, goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor 568, and goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor 488 (all from Molecular Probes). Secondary antibody used for immunogold labeling was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 5 nm of colloidal gold (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK). Plasmid Constructs—Myc-tagged hCLCA1 (Myc-hCLCA1) was generated as described by Gruber et al. (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and was a gift from Dr. Bendicht Pauli. The construct used for these studies had the Myc tag placed between amino acids 366 and 367. hCLCA1-V5-His construct (pcDNA3.1-D-V5-His-TOPO-hCLCA1) was generated using full-length hCLCA1 (PubMed accession number AF127036) with a short Kozak sequence inserted prior to the initiator methionine. The mCLCA3 construct (pcDNA3.1-V5-His-TOPO-mCLCA3) was generated using full-length mCLCA3 (PubMed accession number AB017156). Full-length mCLCA3 was amplified from in-house mouse lung cDNA templates with Pfu turbo hot start and cloned into pcDNA3.1 using TOPO technology (Invitrogen). To construct the pCIN5-hCLCA1 vector, full-length hCLCA1 from pcDNA3.1-D-V5-His-TOPO-hCLCA1 was subcloned using a NotI restriction enzyme site inserted into pcDNA3.1-D-V5-His-TOPO-hCLCA1 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). The GFP construct (pEGFP-N1) was purchased from BD Biosciences, and pcDNA3.1+ and pCIN5_p1 vectors were from Invitrogen. For generation of the HEK293 clone stably expressing hCLCA1, pCIN5-hCLCA1 was transfected into HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Neomycin-resistant colonies of cells were subsequently isolated by ring cloning and expanded under Geneticin (Invitrogen) selection. Cell Lines and Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; 2% penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine; and 1% non-essential amino acids (all from Invitrogen). HEK293 cells stably expressing hCLCA1 (HEK-hCLCA1) were cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with hCLCA1-V5-His, Myc-tagged hCLCA1, mCLCA3, or GFP using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were used 24 h after transfection. Cell Fractionation—HEK-hCLCA1 cells were detached from a T75 flask using Versene (Invitrogen). 1 × 107 cells were transferred to 1 ml of homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP) (Sigma) containing HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce; Perbio, Cramlington, UK). Cells were disrupted by passing them 15 times through a Balch-Rothman ball-bearing homogenizer, (31Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), with a clearance of 11 nm. Cell disruption was confirmed by mixing cells with trypan blue followed by examination on a light microscope. The disrupted cell suspension was spun at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and any intact cells. The post-nuclear supernatant (PNS), in 1.5 ml of homogenizing buffer, was then spun at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc.). The pellet from this spin contained membranes and any intact organelles. The supernatant contained cytosolic proteins. The membrane/organelle pellet was subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation (32Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to separate integral membrane proteins from hydrophilic proteins. Samples of PNS, cytosol, membranes, and Triton X-114 aqueous and detergent phases (10% of total) were taken for Western blotting. Supernatant samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, at 4 °C for 1 h and then spun at 14,000 rpm, in a microfuge at 4 °C for 10 min. The Triton X-114 detergent phase sample was acetone-precipitated, by adding a 10× volume of acetone, at 20 °C for 1 h before centrifugation to collect the precipitate, as described above. All samples were resuspended in sample buffer (Invitrogen). PNS (5 μg) was loaded on the gel, with the equivalent volume of other samples loaded, to enable comparison between lanes. Membrane Stripping—HEK-hCLCA1 cells were detached from a T75 flask (∼1 × 107 cells) with Versene, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and split into three equal volumes. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of either PBS, pH 7.4; pH 2.5 acid wash (0.9% NaCl, adjusted to pH 2.5 with acetic acid); or pH 11 alkaline wash (0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11) (33Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were removed by spinning at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was then spun at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge to ensure removal of all cellular membranes. 150 μl of supernatants were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and resuspended in 150 μl of PBS. 15 μg of protein from the pH11 wash and the equivalent volume of the other washes were loaded per lane on the gel. For the corresponding immunofluorescence, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution, followed by a wash in either PBS or pH 11 alkaline wash for 20 min at 4 °C. For the electron microscopic immunogold labeling, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated, 6-well plates were treated as described above. For both immunocytochemistry procedures, cells were then washed five times with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then immunolabeled as described below. Time Course of hCLCA1 Release and Brefeldin A Treatment—HEK-hCLCA1 cells, grown on 6-well plates, were washed five times with 1 ml of serum-free medium, followed by incubations of 1-4 h in the last wash. Medium was taken, and cells were lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Upstate, Dundee, UK) containing HALT protease inhibitor mixture for Western blot analysis. Medium samples were spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min to remove any cells, supernatants were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS to enable equivalent loading of lanes on the gel. For brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, the protocol was carried out as described above, in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml BFA for 4 h, followed by three washes and a 4-h incubation in the absence of BFA. Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing HALT protease inhibitor mixture. Lung tissue from naïve or ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mice was also lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer after chopping into 0.2-mm cubes on a McIlwain tissue chopper (Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK). Samples were run on NuPage 4-12% polyacrylamide bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween 20 and probed with affinity-purified antibodies. A48 antibody was used at 0.5 μg/ml, 9E10 and A6637 antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml, and anti-V5-HRP was used at the manufacturer's recommended dilution. Following incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, bands were visualized using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For surface labeling, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were incubated in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% sodium azide for 10 min and then incubated with 1 μg/ml primary antibody in the same buffer for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and then incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min, washed three times, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Pioneer Research Chemicals Ltd., Colchester, UK). Coverslips were mounted in Citifluor (Agar Scientific Ltd., Stansted, UK), on glass slides and examined on a Leica TCS-4D confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). For internal labeling, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, quenched in 15 mm glycine, and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with primary antibody, followed by secondary antibody in permeabilization buffer, for 1 h each, with washing between incubations. After extensive washing over a 45-min period, cells were mounted and examined as described above. Electron Microscopy—For surface immunogold electron microscopy, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated, 6-well plates were incubated as described for surface immunofluorescence, except that 5 nm of gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used in place of the Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody. After the final wash, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/1.5% glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific Ltd.), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Agar Scientific Ltd.)/1.5% potassium ferricyanide, and treated with tannic acid (34Simionescu N. Simionescu M. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) before dehydration and embedding as described by Hopkins and Trowbridge, (35Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria), stained with lead citrate, and viewed in a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Human BAL Fluid Samples—BAL fluid was obtained at fiber optic bronchoscopy carried out at Guy's Hospital London according to American Thoracic Society guidelines. Subjects included asthmatics defined according to American Thoracic Society criteria and normal controls. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guy's Hospital. Informed, written consent was obtained from the subjects prior to participation. Collected BAL was filtered through 100-μm filters, and the filtrate was spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min to pellet cells. The supernatant (BAL fluid) was aliquoted and snap-frozen on dry ice. Mouse OVA Challenge Model and BAL Samples—BALB/c mice were either naïve or sensitized to a suspension of 10 μg of OVA adjoined to 2 mg of aluminum hydroxide by intraperitoneal administration on two occasions (days 0 and 14). From day 24, animals were challenged on consecutive days with three daily intranasal instillations of OVA (50 μg) in saline. 24 h later, animals were sacrificed. The lungs were lavaged post-mortem using repeat instillations (5 × 1 ml) of lavage fluid (10 mm EDTA and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), pooled to form the BAL. BAL was spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min to pellet cells, and the supernatant (BAL fluid) was frozen. Bioinformatics Analysis Predicts No Transmembrane Regions for hCLCA1 and mCLCA3—Proteins of the CLCA family have been described as integral membrane proteins with either four or five transmembrane domains (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J.

Genomics. 2000; 1: 201-222Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Pauli B.U. Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Gruber A.D. Archibald H.A. Elble R.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our own analysis, using five different programs, did not predict either hCLCA1 or mCLCA3 to possess any α-helical transmembrane domains. The CLCA family was further analyzed to determine the potential domain structure. A VWA domain is predicted in the central region of the protein. The majority of well-characterized VWA domains are found in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins (38Tuckwell D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions, frequently involving divalent cations. However, more distantly related VWA domains have also been found in intracellular proteins, many being components of multi-protein complexes. Approximately half of all VWA domains contain a MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site) motif (39Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), which contains key residues required for metal-ion binding. These key residues are all conserved in the VWA domains of hCLCA1 and mCLCA3, suggesting metal-ion binding of this motif in these proteins. The second transmembrane domain previously described (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 2000; 27: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) for CLCA is located within the globular VWA domain, which thus supports the results of the transmembrane prediction algorithms that this is in fact not a transmembrane domain. An ∼100-residue region toward the C terminus of the CLCA family was predicted to be an FnIII domain. FnIII domains are found in a variety of proteins, the majority of which are involved in cell surface binding in some manner or are receptor protein tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptors (40Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The remaining regions of the CLCA family do not appear to show obvious similarities to any functionally annotated domains, although the region located between the VWA and FnIII domains, which is predicted to have an all-β secondary structure composition, does show homology to a protein (UniProt:Q8PU63) in an archaebacterium, Methanosarcina mazei. This protein also possesses the VWA and FnIII domains, but N-terminal of the VWA domain is a CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain, which appears to be absent in the CLCA family. This region, situated between the N-terminal signal sequence and the VWA domain, instead contains eight cysteine residues conserved across the CLCA family and is predicted to have an α/β composition (Cys-containing domain). The very C-terminal region of the CLCA family does not appear to be conserved in sequence between family members. This extensive analysis predicts that the CLCA proteins have a globular domain structure, a summary of which is shown in Fig. 1, for hCLCA1 and mCLCA3. hCLCA1 Is Strongly Associated with Cell Membranes but Can Be Removed from the Cell Surface—We examined the nature of the association of hCLCA1 with cell membranes, using biochemical methods and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Following the disruption of HEK-hCLCA1 cells, the nuclei were pelleted. The PNS was found to contain both full-length protein (125 kDa) and the N-terminal cleavage product of hCLCA1. In our studies, the N-terminal cleavage product, previously reported to be 90 kDa (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), appears to migrate at 83 kDa. The PNS was centrifuged to pellet cell membranes, including intact organelles. Full-length and processed hCLCA1 were present in the membrane pellet, whereas no hCLCA1 was detected in the supernatant, representative of the cytosol. The membrane/organelle pellet was subjected to phase separation with Triton X-114 detergent (32Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Full-length hCLCA1 partitioned into the aqueous phase, as did a significant proportion of the N-terminal cleavage product. This observation suggested that hCLCA1 is not an integral membrane protein. The A48 antibody, raised against an epitope corresponding to amino acid residues 681-693, recognizes the N-terminal cleavage product. Several possible cleavage sites have been proposed for hCLCA1 (3Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One of these sites, situated between amino acids 660 and 661, can now be ruled out because the A48 epitope is downstream of that position. Immunofluorescent labeling of hCLCA1 on non-permeabilized HEK-hCLCA1 cells revealed that hCLCA1 was expressed at the"

The fibrils have the same structural, morphological, tinctorial, and biochemical properties as the aggregates observed in the disease conditions. In addition, we found that amyloid formation also occurs in vivo where it is associated with a loss of toxicity of the protein.

Bacteriocins form a vast and diverse group of antibacterial proteins that have been found in most lineages of Eubacteria and Archaebacteria. They kill or inhibit the growth of closely related species by binding to specific cell surface receptors and by forming ion channels in the cytoplasmic membrane, degrading DNA, blocking protein translation, or inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis (1Riley M.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 255-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). They have been proposed to be involved in maintaining bacterial diversity by mediating interactions at the population and community levels (2Riley M.A. Goldstone C.M. Wertz J.E. Gordon D. J. Evol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whereas most known microcins are only produced when exponential growth ceases and the cells enter the stationary phase (8Baquero F. Moreno F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 23: 117-124Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Mcc activity has been reported to be highest during the exponential phase and to suddenly drop to virtually undetectable levels during the stationary phase (3de Lorenzo V. Martinez J.L. Asensio C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 391-400PubMed Google Scholar, 9de Lorenzo V. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Mcc was found to be similarly produced and accumulated both in exponential and stationary phases (10Corsini G. Baeza M. Monasterio O. Lagos R. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), thereby ruling out an arrest of Mcc production and/or degradation as causes of this loss of activity. In addition, mass spectrometry studies revealed no difference in the molecular weight of Mcc purified from either growth phases, indicating that this effect was not related to any post-translational modifications of the protein under our experimental conditions. 2S. Bieler, R. Lagos, and C. Soto, unpublished data. This led us to hypothesize that the sudden disappearance of activity in the stationary phase could be because of a change in Mcc conformation and/or oligomerization state. We report here that purified active Mcc is able to be converted upon in vitro incubation from a soluble to an insoluble state consisting of amyloid-like fibrils. Electron microscopy, structural, biochemical, and kinetics studies indicate that these fibrils have properties identical to those previously described for the amyloid aggregates that are formed in the course of amyloid diseases. We also found that the assembly of Mcc into amyloid fibrils is accompanied by a loss of the antibacterial activity of the protein. Furthermore, amyloid fibrils are also formed in vivo, and this correlates with a sudden drop in Mcc activity in the culture. We therefore propose that amyloid formation modulates the activity of Mcc in vivo and is responsible for the previously reported loss of activity in the stationary phase. These data represent the first demonstration that amyloid formation in prokaryotes controls in vivo the biological activity of a protein and changes the phenotype of the bacteria. Thus far, formation of amyloid has been associated with several human diseases involving the misfolding, aggregation, and tissue deposition of proteins (11Soto C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem.

Our findings suggest that the process of protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is a conserved mechanism that may have an important role not only in triggering tissue damage and disease but also in modulating the biological activity of diverse proteins.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 431-435Google Scholar) that was filtered through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter system (Corning). When specified, the medium was buffered with 100 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 6.5. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. Cultures were started using 1:1000 dilutions of fresh overnight cultures to minimize the amount of amyloid-like Mcc from the inocula. Purification of Mcc—E. coli VCS257pJEM15 was grown at 37 °C with shaking to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.5 in M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, 0.2% sodium citrate, 1 g/liter casamino acids, 1 mg/liter thiamine, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. 200 ml of culture supernatant were passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 3 ml of 65% methanol and 3 ml of 25% acetonitrile. Mcc was eluted with 3 ml of 50% acetonitrile and concentrated by a CentriVap Concentrator (Labconco). Samples were brought to pH 8.0 by adding NaOH and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to ensure full solubilization of aggregates formed during the concentration step. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove any remaining aggregates, and supernatants were stored at –20 °C. Purity was calculated to be >90% by amino acid composition analysis (420/H Amino Acid Analysis System; Applied Biosystems). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed in a Voyager DE STR biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems) revealed one single peak at 7887.5 Da corresponding to the previously reported molecular mass of mature Mcc without post-translational modifications (5Destoumieux-Garzon D.

Electron Microscopy—Samples of purified Mcc or bacterial culture were placed onto 300-square mesh nickel grids (Maxtaform), negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 90 s, and examined in a Philips EM410 electron microscope. Circular Dichroism Analysis—CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV CD spectrometer model 215 with a 0.1-cm path length cell. Five consecutive readings at 1-nm bandwidth, 0.25-s response time, and 1-nm resolution were taken over the wavelength range 190–260 nm at 25 °C, averaged, buffer subtracted, and noise reduced. Mean residue molar ellipticities of Mcc were calculated using 7886.5 as molecular weight and 84 as the number of residues. Samples were sonicated prior to analysis to ensure homogeneity. Congo Red Binding—For spectral analysis, aggregated Mcc was obtained by incubating the protein at 750 μg/ml in aggregation buffer (10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 m NaCl) at 37 °C with agitation for 15 h. Samples were briefly sonicated and incubated with 12.5 μm Congo red (CR) (Aldrich) for 15 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured from 400 to 700 nm with a resolution of 1 nm using a DU 530 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). The spectrum of bound CR was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of Mcc alone from the spectrum of Mcc in the presence of CR. The spectrum of free CR was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer from the spectrum of CR in buffer in the absence of Mcc. To quantitate amyloid formation by CR assay, Mcc samples (200 μg/ml) were incubated with 44 μm CR for 15 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The absorbance of supernatants was recorded at 490 nm using an EL800 Universal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). The percentage of free CR was obtained by comparison with the absorbance of a sample devoid of protein. Thioflavin T Fluorescence—For spectral analysis, aggregated Mcc was briefly sonicated, diluted in the aggregation buffer to a final concentration of 3 μm and added 5 μm thioflavin T (ThT) (Aldrich). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries). The excitation wavelength was set at 430 nm, emission wavelengths ranged from 440 to 700 nm, and slit widths were 6 mm for excitation and emission. To quantitate amyloid formation by ThT assay, fluorescence emission was measured in the presence of ThT at 480 nm. The excitation wavelength was set at 430 nm, and slit widths were 6 mm for excitation and emission. Fluorescence emission is expressed as arbitrary units. Proteinase K Digestion—Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C under agitation with the indicated concentrations of proteinase K (PK) (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples at 102 °C for 5 min in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). To assess the resistance of soluble and aggregated Mcc to increasing concentrations of PK, purified Mcc was diluted at 15 μg/ml in culture medium (LB medium, 100 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5) and either directly digested (soluble) or incubated for 15 h at 37 °C with agitation prior to digestion (aggregated). Turbidity Assay—Mcc was diluted in aggregation buffer at a final concentration of 850 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C with agitation. The aggregation of the protein was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 562 nm using a BioPhotometer 6131 (Eppendorf). Sedimentation Assay and Seeding of Mcc Aggregation—Samples of Mcc at 150 μg/ml in aggregation buffer were incubated at 37 °C with agitation for the indicated times and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Protein concentration in supernatants was measured using a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The amount of aggregated protein was obtained by subtracting this value from the total concentration of Mcc. Aggregated Mcc used to seed aggregation was obtained by incubating the protein at 150 μg/ml in aggregation buffer at 37 °C with agitation for 15 h. Sonicated aggregated Mcc was obtained by submitting the aggregated protein to sonication three times for 3 s at 60% power using a Vibra-Cell ultrasonic processor (Sonics & Materials). Mcc Activity Assay by the Critical Dilution Method—Samples to be tested were serially diluted in 50% methanol. In the case of cultures, cells were previously removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. 4-μl drops of diluted samples were laid onto LB agar plates previously covered with 3 ml of LB top agar containing 2 × 107 Mcc-sensitive E. coli BL21(DE3)p11α2 cells. After 15 h of incubation at 37 °C the activity was determined by the critical dilution method and expressed in arbitrary units/ml (16Mayr-Harting A. Hedges A.J. Berkeley R.C.W. Norris J.R. Ribbons D.N. Methods in Microbiology. 7A. Academic Press, New York1972: 315-422Google Scholar). Mcc Activity Assay by Counting Surviving Cells—90 μl of samples to be tested were added to 10 μl of E. coli BL21(DE3)p11α2 cells grown overnight in LB medium. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C with shaking, surviving cells were counted by plating serial dilutions onto LB agar. The activity was expressed as a percentage, taking as a reference (100%) the killing activity obtained using a Mcc sample that was not incubated. Immunoblotting—Samples were diluted in sample buffer (Invitrogen), boiled at 102 °C for 5 min, and loaded on NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with a rabbit antiserum raised against a C-terminal fragment of Mcc (SGSGYNSATSSSGSGS) (1:3000), washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit donkey antibody (1:5,000; Amersham Biosciences), and developed with ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Soluble Mcc Assembles into Amyloid-like Fibrils in Vitro— Negative stain electron microscopy of samples of soluble purified Mcc incubated in LB medium, 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.5 (culture medium) for 15 h at 37 °C revealed ∼10-nm-wide unbranched amyloid-like fibrils of varying lengths (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas no fibrils could be detected in samples of the purified protein that had not been incubated (Fig. 1C). Fibrils undistinguishable from those obtained in culture medium were observed upon incubation in 100 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1D). Circular dichroism studies indicated that whereas soluble Mcc adopts a random coil conformation in aqueous buffer (Fig. 2A, solid line) or a mainly α-helical one in methanol (Fig. 2B, solid line), aggregated Mcc is rich in β-sheet structures in both solvents (Fig. 2, A and B, dashed lines). These results are consistent with the stable cross-β-sheet structure that has been proposed for amyloid fibrils (17Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar structural conversion from a soluble α-helical/random coil conformation into β-sheet-rich aggregates is the hallmark and likely the triggering event in protein misfolding diseases (11Soto C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). A typical feature of amyloid fibrils that is used to differentiate them from other types of aggregates is the specific binding and staining with dyes such as CR and ThT (19Glenner G.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 20Sipe J.D. Cohen A.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Like previously described amyloids (21Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), aggregated Mcc induced a spectral change in the absorbance of CR with a maximum difference between free CR and Mcc-bound CR at ∼540 nm (Fig. 2C). The addition of aggregated Mcc to a solution of ThT resulted in a fluorescence emission maximum at ∼480 nm (Fig. 2D), which is identical to the fluorescence induced by other amyloid proteins (22LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Another typical feature of amyloid aggregates is their high resistance to proteolytic degradation, which is partly the reason for the difficulty in clearing them from the body in the disease condition (23Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 24Nordstedt C. Naslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although soluble Mcc was totally digested by low concentrations of PK, aggregated Mcc exhibited strong resistance to this enzyme at various concentrations (Fig. 2E). CR binding, ThT fluorescence, and protein sedimentation were employed to monitor amyloid formation by Mcc over time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The curves obtained (Fig. 3, A–C, solid line) are reminiscent of previously described amyloid formation kinetics (25Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Indeed, a lag phase where virtually no amyloid-like structures could be detected was followed by a sudden and fast increase in CR binding, ThT fluorescence, or protein precipitation. Similar kinetics was observed when Mcc aggregation was followed by measuring the increase in turbidity of the solution (data not shown). The time course aggregation data suggest that Mcc, similarly to other amyloid proteins, assembles into fibrils following a typical nucleation-dependent polymerization process. This involves a slow nucleation phase in which the unassembled polypeptides undergo unfavorable association steps to form an ordered oligomeric nucleus that is required to initiate rapid polymerization (25Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Such a model implies that the lag phase could be bypassed by adding preformed nuclei or seeds. To test this hypothesis, soluble Mcc was incubated in the presence of previously aggregated Mcc, and protein aggregation was followed by sedimentation. As expected, the lag phase was significantly shortened (Fig. 3C, dashed line) by comparison with the incubation of the soluble protein alone (Fig. 3C, solid line). Because these seeds consisted of mature fibrils that are presumably not as efficient seeds as small oligomeric nuclei, a similar experiment was performed using sonicated fibrils instead of intact ones. Addition of sonicated fibrils resulted in a complete elimination of the lag phase (Fig. 3C, dotted line), indicating that sonication was efficient in breaking the fibrils and multiplying the number of seeds available for polymerization, as we described previously for the conversion of the prion protein (26Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In addition, this nucleation-dependent amyloid formation model implies that the concentration of soluble Mcc needs to be over a threshold level referred to as critical concentration to initiate polymerization. This critical concentration also corresponds to the concentration of protein that remains in solution when amyloid formation is complete and the system is at equilibrium (25Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows that only ∼110 μg/ml Mcc can be aggregated from a total of 150 μg/ml incubated protein, which means that under these conditions the critical concentration is ∼40 μg/ml or 5 μm. After this critical concentration is reached, a certain lag time is needed for protein-protein interaction to occur, enabling the formation of a nucleus that further sustains protein polymerization. In Vitro Polymerization of Mcc into Amyloid Fibrils Is Accompanied by a Loss of Activity—The relation between Mcc activity and amyloid formation was investigated by following over time the ability of soluble or aggregated Mcc to kill sensitive cells. The activity of Mcc before and after 24 h of incubation was measured by the critical dilution method, which revealed a loss of more than 90% of the activity upon aggregation (Fig. 4A). In addition, the activity was monitored by counting the number of surviving cells after exposure to Mcc aliquots incubated for various times. The results show that the activity was high during a period of 10 h, which was followed by a sudden and fast loss of activity (Fig. 4B). The kinetics of the change in activity mirrored closely the kinetics of amyloid formation as shown in Fig. 3, suggesting that the loss of activity was related to protein aggregation. To rule out the possibility that the loss of cytotoxic activity was because of protein degradation, we compared the amount of protein before and after 24 h of incubation. As shown in Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12, no difference was observed in the total amount of Mcc before and after incubation. The evolution of the PK resistance of Mcc upon incubation was also assessed. Mcc remained fully sensitive to PK for almost 10 h and then became increasingly resistant to this enzyme (Fig. 4C), which correlates with the loss of activity (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 2, formation of amyloid is paralleled by acquisition of protease resistance; therefore, we conclude from these experiments that Mcc loses its toxic activity upon fibrillar aggregation. The Loss of Mcc Activity in Vivo Coincides with Amyloid Formation—A culture of Mcc-producing bacteria (E. coli BL21pJEM15) was monitored by periodically measuring its optical density at 600 nm and the Mcc activity present in the medium (Fig. 5A). The activity was found to accumulate during growth to reach its highest level at the end of the exponential phase of growth (9 h) and then to dramatically drop (10 h) and remain at virtually undetectable levels during the stationary phase. This phenomenon is not restricted to our experimental conditions involving a recombinant E. coli strain. Indeed, an identical pattern of activity was previously reported in the original K. pneumoniae RYC492 strain, where both active and inactive forms of Mcc were observed in the exponential and stationary phases of growth, respectively (3de Lorenzo V. Martinez J.L. Asensio C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 391-400PubMed Google Scholar, 9de Lorenzo V. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, an explanation for this phenomenon had been missing ever since. To determine whether amyloid was related to this sudden loss of Mcc activity, the in vivo formation of amyloid was evaluated by PK digestion (Fig. 5B), sedimentation assay (Fig. 5C), and electron microscopy (Fig. 6). Fig. 5B shows an immunoblot of culture samples treated or not with PK. Although the total amount of Mcc was found to gradually increase during cell growth, almost no PK-resistant Mcc could be detected up to 9 h of culture. Strikingly, a strong PK resistance was observed after 10 h and was maintained in subsequent time points, which coincides with the reported loss of activity. In agreement with our in vitro data showing a negative correlation between Mcc activity and resistance to PK digestion (Fig. 4), these in vivo results suggest that the formation of amyloid also occurs in a bacterial culture and that it profoundly affects the activity of the protein. To further study the relationship between Mcc aggregation and activity, we performed sedimentation assays on culture samples to analyze the amount of soluble and aggregated protein at each time, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results show that although most Mcc appeared to be soluble up to 9 h, virtually no soluble protein could be detected at 10 h and later (Fig. 5C). These results are in agreement with what was observed in vitro, where Mcc was found to become rapidly insoluble after several hours of incubation (Fig. 3C). This finding is again in accordance with the proposition that amyloid formation is responsible for the reported loss of Mcc activity. Finally, to confirm that amyloid-like fibrils were indeed formed in vivo, samples of E. coli BL21pJEM15 culture grown for 15 h were analyzed by electron microscopy. Amyloid-like fibrils resembling those obtained in vitro were observed (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas no such structures could be detected in samples of E. coli BL21np108 (a mutant that does not export Mcc) (27Lagos R. Baeza M. Corsini G. Hetz C. Strahsburger E. Castillo J.A. Vergara C. Monasterio O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) culture grown for 15 h (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, no fibrils could be observed in samples of E. coli BL21pJEM15 culture grown for 8 h only (data not shown), which is consistent with the finding that Mcc is soluble and sensitive to PK digestion at this time point (Fig. 5). The misfolding, aggregation, and tissue accumulation of proteins into fibrillar amyloid deposits is a hallmark process in a variety of neurological and systemic disorders, collectively called protein misfolding diseases (11Soto C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 13Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 18Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence indicates that the formation of β-sheet-rich oligomeric and fibrillar structures is the triggering factor in these diseases, which comprise more than 20 different disorders, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases as well as diabetes type 2. These findings have led to the notion that amyloid formation is an inherently negative process implicated in pathological conditions in complex organisms. Here we have shown that amyloid formation also occurs in prokaryotes and is involved in modulating the biological activity of Mcc. Strikingly, the biochemical, structural, morphological, and tinctorial properties of the Mcc aggregates are identical to those observed in the disease protein accumulations. In addition, the mechanism of amyloid formation following a seeding-nucleation polymerization process and the formation of cytotoxic oligomeric structures are also hallmark properties of protein aggregation in the disease conditions. Therefore, amyloidogenesis cannot be considered as a process associated exclusively with diseases in higher organisms but should rather be viewed as a conserved mechanism to control the biological function of diverse proteins. The mode of action of Mcc has been shown to involve the formation of ion-permeable pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of target bacteria. Indeed, purified Mcc was found to depolarize and permeabilize the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane (5Destoumieux-Garzon D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6de Lorenzo V. Pugsley A.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to form ion channels in phospholipids bilayers in vitro (7Lagos R. Wilkens M. Vergara C. Cecchi X. Monasterio O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mcc is not only active against bacteria but was also found to cause apoptosis and necrosis in some eukaryotic cell lines (29Hetz C. Bono M.R. Barros L.F. Lagos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The finding that Mcc is able to induce cell death and aggregate into amyloid fibrils is particularly intriguing and could offer a good model by which to study the mechanism of cytotoxicity of disease-causing misfolded protein aggregates. Strikingly, the emerging notion in protein misfolding diseases is that the toxic species might be oligomeric pore-like structures that may cause cell damage by altering ionic homeostasis (30Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Indeed, ordered prefibrillar oligomeric pores have been proposed to be responsible for cell death in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (31Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 32Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon has been proposed to be involved in diabetes type 2, as protofibrillar islet amyloid polypeptide was found to permeabilize synthetic vesicles by a pore-like mechanism (33Anguiano M. Nowak R.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11338-11343Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, small annular Aβ and α-synuclein protofibrils were reported to resemble the cytolytic β-barrel pore-forming toxins from bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (32Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 34Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z.F. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11597-11605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that a common structure could be responsible for toxic membrane permeabilization. However, the formation of amyloid-like fibrils made of bacterial toxins had not been reported until now, and this parallel was only based on a shared pore-like structure. The oligomerization states of the soluble secreted Mcc and of the toxic pore structures that are formed in target membranes, as well as their relations with the oligomeric intermediates that are present during the amyloid formation process, are currently under investigation in our laboratory. The finding that Mcc aggregation into amyloid fibrils is associated with a loss of toxicity against target bacteria supports the view that mature amyloid fibrils accumulating in amyloidoses may not be toxic but rather may be considered as inert end products or even as a protective mechanism to sequester the toxic intermediates (30Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Whether Mcc amyloid formation in vivo is a regulated process possibly involving post-translational modifications or interactions with other proteins is an intriguing issue that still needs to be addressed. Mcc activity has been reported to be increased under certain growth conditions by the post-translational covalent linkage to its C terminus of a glucose moiety linked to a trimer of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine (35Thomas X. Destoumieux-Garzon D. Peduzzi J. Afonso C. Blond A. Birlirakis N. Goulard C. Dubost L. Thai R. Tabet J.C. Rebuffat S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28233-28242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which post-translationally modified Mcc is more active than its non-modified counterpart remains unclear, one possibility would be that this modification stabilizes toxic oligomeric structures and/or prevents the formation of harmless mature amyloid fibrils. Indeed, it has been extensively reported that a variety of post-translational modifications could alter the ability of disease-associated amyloid proteins to aggregate into amyloid fibrils (36Atwood C.S. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Perry G. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Specific proteins and other compounds have also been shown to promote or inhibit amyloid formation by various proteins (37Soto C. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, enterochelin, a trilactone siderophore that is naturally produced by Enterobacteriaceae, has been reported to inhibit the activity of Mcc (38Orellana C. Lagos R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 297-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this effect is related or not with amyloid formation remains to be determined. Our findings with Mcc show that protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils might be a generic property of proteins not necessarily associated to a pathological condition. Cytotoxicity may be determined by common features of specific types of aggregates rather than by the primary structure of the proteins involved (39Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J.S. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with amyloidoses where the protein aggregates accumulate in an uncontrolled manner, in the case of Mcc, bacteria use these properties to kill target cells as part of a normal physiological process that confers them competitive advantage. Amyloid formation was previously reported in bacteria when fibers produced by E. coli called curli were shown to consist of amyloid fibrils (40Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). However, unlike Mcc, curli fibers are not involved in cellular toxicity but seem to have structural functions related to the colonization of inert surfaces and biofilm formation. The involvement of amyloid in regulating the biological activity of a bacterial protein suggests that formation of these fibrillar aggregates is an evolutionarily conserved property of proteins that is not only implicated in pathological conditions but also might be used for specific physiological functions.

https://openalex.org/W2081333099,"The molecular hallmark of prion disease is the conversion of normal prion protein (PrPC) to an insoluble, proteinase K-resistant, pathogenic isoform (PrPSc). Once generated, PrPSc propagates by complexing with, and transferring its pathogenic conformation onto, PrPC. Defining the specific nature of this PrPSc-PrPC interaction is critical to understanding prion genesis. To begin to approach this question, we employed a prion-infected neuroblastoma cell line (ScN2a) combined with a heterologous yeast expression system to independently model PrPSc generation and propagation. We additionally applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis to the latter to specifically study PrP-PrP interactions. In this report we focus on an N-terminal hydrophobic palindrome of PrP (112-AGAAAAGA-119) thought to feature intimately in prion generation via an unclear mechanism. We found that, in contrast to wild type (wt) PrP, PrP lacking the palindrome (PrPΔ112-119) neither converted to PrPSc when expressed in ScN2a cells nor generated proteinase K-resistant PrP when expressed in yeast. Furthermore, PrPΔ112-119 was a dominant-negative inhibitor of wtPrP in ScN2a cells. Both wtPrP and PrPΔ112-119 were highly insoluble when expressed in yeast and produced distinct cytosolic aggregates when expressed as fluorescent fusion proteins (PrP::YFP). Although self-aggregation was evident, fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies in live yeast co-expressing PrPSc-like protein and PrPΔ112-119 indicated altered interaction properites. These results suggest that the palindrome is required, not only for the attainment of the PrPSc conformation but also to facilitate the proper association of PrPSc with PrPC to effect prion propagation.

These results suggest that the palindrome is required, not only for the attainment of the PrPSc conformation but also to facilitate the proper association of PrPSc with PrPC to effect prion propagation. The prion diseases, the best known of which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows, result from the generation and propagation of a conformational variant (PrPSc) of the normal prion protein (PrPC), a predominantly brain-derived glycoprotein of unknown function (1Mastrianni J.A. Roos R.P. Semin. Neurol. 2000; 20: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once PrPSc is introduced or spontaneously generated in the brain, it can replicate by complexing with, and templating its conformation onto, additional PrPC (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 3Caughey B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PrPSc is distinguished from PrPC in that it is insoluble in non-ionic detergents, displays a relative resistance to proteinase K (PK), 1The abbreviations used are: PK, proteinase K; aa, amino acids; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. and carries a significantly higher content of β-sheet structure (4Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion and replication of PrPSc are unknown. A greater understanding of the specific regions of PrP that critically participate in the de novo generation and replication of PrPSc is a major goal of prion research, both in terms of understanding the well recognized species barrier to transmission and as a prelude to developing therapeutic interventions. While the C-terminal globular domain of PrPC is dominated by α-helical structure, the N-terminal region of the protein is unstructured by NMR (5Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). However, within the N-terminal half of PrP is the so-called “toxic peptide,” a highly conserved segment comprised of amino acids (aa) 105-125 (mouse sequence numbers). Synthetic peptides corresponding to this segment form fibrils in solution with β-sheet structure and are toxic to cultured mouse hippocampal cells (6Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Lloyd D.H. Gabriel J.M. Holtzman D.M. Cohen F. Fletterick R. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10940-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E.

Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2057-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that this segment may feature in PrPSc-PrPC associations. Within the toxic peptide, extending from aa 112-119 is a palindrome sequence (AGAAAAGA), also known as the “hydrophobic core” (Fig. 1). This segment of PrP was found to be the most fibrilogenic motif within the toxic peptide (6Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Lloyd D.H. Gabriel J.M. Holtzman D.M. Cohen F. Fletterick R. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10940-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and later work showed that altering the sequence could modulate its structure and toxicity (9Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. White A.R. McLean C. Friedhuber A. Maher F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Collins S.J. Cappai R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), spotlighting this minimal segment as an area that may feature intimately in the interaction of PrP molecules and their subsequent conversion to PrPSc. Consistent with this idea, larger peptides (aa 106-141) antagonized the in vitro conversion of PrPC to the protease-resistant state in a cell-free conversion model, and this effect was dependent upon the inclusion of the AGAAAAGA sequence in the peptide (10Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13203-13207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic core appears to undergo a profound conformational change upon conversion to PrPSc, since residues 90-120 are accessible to antibodies in PrPC yet not in PrPSc (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies directed against this region effectively “cured” a neuroblastoma cell line chronically infected with scrapie (12White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Others have shown that deletion of a segment of PrP that overlaps the hydrophobic core produced a PrP that does not convert to PrPSc (13Holscher C. Delius H. Burkle A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15457-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). While the above studies support the palindrome as critical to prion generation, direct mechanistic evidence for this is currently lacking. To provide such evidence and further define the role of the AGAAAAGA palindrome in prion processing, we applied a well documented neuroblastoma cell line chronically infected with prions (ScN2a) to model PrPSc replication and a heterologous yeast expression system (15Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) to model de novo PrPSc generation. We additionally applied live cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to the yeast model to assess the role of the palindrome in the assembly of PrP molecules. Our results suggest that the hydrophobic core is not required for PrP aggregation; however, it is critical, not only for the de novo generation of the specific PrPSc conformation but also for the proper association of PrPSc and PrPC molecules necessary for the conformational transfer. These results not only confirm the palindrome segment as an essential component to prion genesis but also highlight the utility of this approach in resolving the specifics of prion conversion and propagation. Generation of PrP Mutants—The mouse PrP coding sequence was generated by PCR amplification and cloned into the pSP72 cloning vector using standard molecular biological techniques. Deletion mutants were constructed from this template by PCR amplification with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) using forward and reverse primers flanking the sequences to be deleted. The purified linear PCR product was then blunt end-ligated and transformed in XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). All constructs to be expressed in mammalian cells were ligated into the pCB6+ vector under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. For yeast expression, mouse PrP coding sequence from aa 23-230, which excludes the signal sequences for ER targeting and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, was cloned into the yeast expression vectors p425Gal and p426Gal. To limit degradation in the cytoplasmic proteases in the yeast, a serine was added to the N and C termini of yeast-expressed PrP constructs. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Expression System—The p42xGal vectors contain a galactose-inducible expression element that is induced in the presence of galactose as the carbon source and tightly restricted when only glucose is present. In all experiments, we used the yeast strain W303 (MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-12,16 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) with a Pep4 genotype, which has reduced endogenous protease activity (kind gift of Susan Lindquist, MIT). For transformation, yeast colonies were picked from plates and grown overnight at 30 °C to mid log phase, washed, and incubated with the construct of interest plus polyethylene glycol, LiAc, and carrier DNA for 30 min at 30 °C followed by a 20-min heat shock at 42 °C and then spread onto selective plates made from glucose dropout media. Solubility Assay—Yeast expressing the construct of interest were grown to mid-late log phase (A600 ∼0.7), briefly spun down, washed in 10 mm EDTA, and digested with zymolyase 100T for 1-2 h at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in 200 μl of 10% Sarkosyl in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors for 5 min on ice. Insoluble PrP was found to effectively pellet following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, which was used as a measure of insolubility. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with an additional 50 μl of 10% sarkosyl buffer, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 200 μl of 1% sulfobetaine in PBS. In some cases, the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g to ensure that all insoluble PrP was collected after the initial centrifugation and to check for any insoluble fraction of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). For solubility in mammalian cell culture, transiently transfected cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a portion was removed as the total fraction. The remaining lysate was spun at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of PBS with 1% sulfobetaine. Protease Digestion Assay—For yeast lysates, PK digestions were performed on samples from the 16,000 × g pellet fraction of PrP or the supernatant fraction of YFP. Approximately 400 ng of total protein was digested with the indicated concentrations of PK (Fig. 3A) or with 40 μg/ml (all other figures). Protease inhibitors that are not known to interfere with PK digestion (0.5× chymostatin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) were included in reactions for all figures. Control experiments indicated that chymostatin reduced the sensitivity of PrP to PK but did not induce protease resistance in control YFP or non-resistant PrP. 2E. M. Norstrom and J. A. Mastrianni, unpublished observations. FRET—Fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching FRET experiments were performed with an Olympus IX81 microscope using appropriate Chroma filters. A Q-imaging Retiga EXI CCD and Metamorph software were used to capture images. PrP23-230::CFP donor was co-expressed with a candidate acceptor and yeast were scanned for the presence of both cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and YFP signals using a 6% neutral density filter. Photos of yeast-containing aggregates were taken at 1-s intervals with 100 ms exposure times under constant illumination for 45 s. Image series were saved in stacks, and the illumination intensity profile of medium sized aggregates was analyzed across the time (Z) series using ImageJ (NIH) software. The decay of the donor fluorescence signal was fit with a single exponential decay curve, and a tau (τ) was generated using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) software, using the equation Yo = Aexp(-invτ*X). The presence of both CFP and YFP signals for a given sample was confirmed before analysis. To control for differences in lamp intensity across data collection sittings, which can alter the absolute bleach rate of samples, only two donor/acceptor pairs were measured at a time, and direct comparisons were made between these two data sets with relative comparisons made between pairs of data sets. Each pair of data sets is normalized to the set for which the lower τ value was obtained. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PrP constructs carrying the 3F4 epitope were transiently transfected into ScN2a cells grown on chamber-well slides using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), as per the manufacturer's instructions. To detect surface PrP after 36 h of expression, cells were washed three times in cold PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and the 3F4 monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:50. Cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing, cells were blocked with 5% milk, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, then washed and incubated in Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at 1:100 dilution in PBS. Cells were then washed and covered in 80% glycerol in PBS. Cy5 signal was visualized using an Olympus IX70 with a Fluoview confocal module. ScN2a Cell Line Conversion Assay—Transiently transfected cells from 60-mm dishes were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. A total of 400 μl of the cleared lysate was digested with 10 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, precipitated in methanol, resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, and submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described. For dominant-negative inhibition experiments, ScN2a cells were transfected with 4 μg each of plasmid DNA containing wtPrP carrying the 3F4 epitope and wt or mutant constructs without the 3F4 epitope. Lysis and digestion were carried out as described above. Western Blots—Protein samples were precipitated in methanol for greater than 30 min at -20 °C. Following precipitation, samples were spun at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and dried, and the pellets were resuspended in 2× sample buffer and loaded onto 16% (yeast) or 14% (ScN2a lysates) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. These were washed in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) and blocked for 1 h with 5% milk, washed, and incubated in TBST with 1% milk containing primary antibodies at a 1:5000 (R1) or 1:3000 (3F4) dilution for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Following a wash, the membranes were incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and detected using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry—For each Western blot on which densitometry measurements were to be taken, multiple film exposures of increasing length were performed. Densitometry measurements were obtained from the “total” sample for each exposure time, and a curve was generated from the results. For reported experiments, exposure times were used in which data from the total sample were in the linear range of measurements. Films were scanned using an Epson transparency scanner, and densitometry was performed using UN-scan-it (Silk Scientific) software. Expression of recombinant PrP in a prion-infected mouse neuroblastoma cell line (ScN2a) (16Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in its conversion to PrPSc, provided it reaches the same cellular compartment as endogenously synthesized PrPSc and the two molecules interact in a way that supports the conformational transfer. As such, this cell line is useful to study the process of prion replication. To avoid the difficulties of others, such as specifically tracking recombinant mouse PrP in this mouse cell line (13Holscher C. Delius H. Burkle A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and using antibodies for PrP detection that may interfere with the conversion process (14Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15457-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 17Scott M.R. Kohler R. Foster D. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 986-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we engineered the PrP constructs to include the hamster-specific 3F4 monoclonal antibody epitope (Met substitutions at residues 108 and 111), known not to interfere with the conversion process (17Scott M.R. Kohler R. Foster D. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 986-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ScN2a cells were transiently transfected with wt PrP or that lacking the hydrophobic core sequence (PrPΔ112-119) and, after 48 h of expression, the cells were assayed for newly synthesized PK-resistant PrPSc by Western blot. PrP is normally expressed as three molecular weight fractions, representing unglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and diglycosylated forms. PrPΔ112-119 expressed in these cells displayed similar levels and glycosylation profile as wtPrP, suggesting normal transit through the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2A). However, whereas wtPrP was efficiently converted to PK resistant PrP, PrPΔ112-119 was not. In light of evidence that PrPC must traffic to the cell surface before it is made available to complex with, and be converted to, PrPSc (18Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. Robertson M.N. Miyazawa M. Mori S. Evans L.H. Hayes S.F. Chesebro B. Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Caughey W.S. Neary K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on cells expressing PrPΔ112-119, which confirmed its localization to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Thus, in the absence of the palindrome, PrP undergoes normal processing and trafficking yet is not converted to PrPSc. The lack of conversion of PrPΔ112-119 to PrPSc was considered to result either from poor or non-productive interaction with endogenous PrPSc or an inability to attain the PrPSc conformation. To address these possibilities, we first tested the ability of PrPΔ112-119 to inhibit the conversion of wtPrP in a dominant-negative fashion (20Zulianello L. Kaneko K. Scott M. Erpel S. Han D. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such a feature would suggest interaction with PrPSc. ScN2a cells were co-transfected with equal amounts of PrPΔ112-119 PrP and wtPrP constructs, the latter of which carried the 3F4 antibody epitope. After 48 h of expression, PK-digested lysates were analyzed by Western blot, using antibody 3F4, to selectively detect nascent wtPrPSc. When these results are compared with those of lysates co-expressing wtPrP(3F4) and untagged wtPrP, a clear inhibition of wild type conversion by PrPΔ112-119 is evident (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). As a positive control, wtPrP(3F4) was co-expressed with untagged PrP carrying the Q218K mutation, a known dominant-negative inhibitor of wild type prion conversion (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Here again, conversion of wtPrP(3F4) was significantly inhibited in the presence of the mutant protein. We interpret the above results to indicate that PrPΔ112-119 is forming a non-productive association with endogenous PrPSc and in so doing interferes with conversion of wtPrPC. In support of this, we compared the solubility of wtPrP and PrPΔ112-119, following expression in ScN2a cells. Both were detected within the 16,000 × g insoluble fraction of detergent-lysed ScN2a cells, although the fraction of PrPΔ112-119 was 30% lower than that of wtPrP (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, the fraction of insoluble PrP was significantly lower when these were expressed in cells, which do not endogenously express PrP (COS-7) (Fig. 2, D and E). These data support the association of PrPΔ112-119 with PrPSc. We next sought to investigate the de novo generation of PrPSc and more directly explore the alteration in interaction properties of wild type and deletion mutant PrPs, as suggested by the ScN2a cell experiments. To accomplish this, we employed a heterologous yeast expression system that supports the generation of a PrPSc-like protein (15Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), as defined by its insolubility and PK resistance. Mature PrP excluding the ER and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal sequences (PrP23-230) was expressed into the yeast cytosol under the control of the GAL1-inducible promoter for 16 h, at which time cells were detergent-lysed and PrP pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. Since this protein is expressed into the cytosol, ER- and Golgi-related glycosylation does not occur, resulting in a single unglycosylated band of ∼25 kDa. As expected, insoluble wtPrP was resistant to proteolysis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The predominant PK-resistant fraction was ∼20 kDa, which compares well with that detected in the brain of subjects with prion disease and ScN2a cells. To confirm that overexpression of any protein into the cytosol of yeast does not invariably develop PK resistance, we expressed YFP under similar conditions of expression and recovered no protease resistance, despite high levels of expression and challenge with the lowest concentration of PK (Fig. 3A). This demonstrated selectivity suggested that the yeast model would be useful to study the molecular substrates required for PrPSc generation as a complement to the ScN2a model of PrPSc replication. We next applied the yeast expression system to study the role of the palindrome in the de novo generation of PrPSc. PrP23-230, excluding aa 105-125, was initially expressed in the yeast cytosol, since this segment has received considerable attention as the toxic unit of PrP. In contrast to wtPrP (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2), PrPΔ105-125 was highly susceptible to PK (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4), displaying no resistance at the lowest concentration. Reduction of the deleted region to exclude only the AGAAAAGA palindrome (PrPΔ112-119) did not re-establish the PK-resistant phenotype (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). However, when a significantly redacted PrP, containing a large deletion lying N-terminal to both the palindrome segment and the PK-resistant core of PrPSc (PrPΔ1-89), was expressed in the yeast cytosol, the pattern of PK resistance was similar to that of full-length wtPrP (Fig. 3C), supporting a deletion-specific effect and a critical role for the palindrome in the generation of the PrPSc-like conformation. We questioned whether the inability of deletion mutants to generate the PrPSc conformation resulted from their failure to self-assemble. If the hydrophobic core is solely responsible for PrP self-associations, we reasoned that PrPΔ112-119 should be soluble when expressed in the yeast cytosol. We therefore prepared lysates from yeast expressing wtPrP, PrPΔ112-119, PrPΔ1-89, and YFP, using 10% Sarkosyl/TEN buffer, and separated soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The fraction of soluble PrP and YFP was determined by densitometric analysis of the Western blot signal. As expected, wtPrP and PrPΔ1-89 were highly insoluble, with only ∼10% recoverable from the supernatant (Fig. 4). In contrast, 100% of expressed YFP remained in the soluble fraction, even following centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Fig. 4 and data not shown), confirming that insolubility is a specific feature of PrP and not a property of overexpression into the yeast cytosol. PrPΔ112-119 displayed only marginally greater solubility than wtPrP, suggesting that insolubility is not solely dependent on the AGAAAAGA palindrome. We next attempted to visually confirm that wtPrP and/or PrPΔ112-119 aggregate within the yeast cytosol, and if so, were the aggregates distinguishable from each other. To do so, we prepared wt and PrPΔ112-119 constructs on the PrP23-230 backbone with YFP linked to the C-terminal end. These fluorescent fusion proteins were individually expressed into the yeast cytosol for 16 h following transformation, at which time yeast were visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy. In cells expressing only YFP, a diffusely uniform signal was evident throughout the cytosol (Fig. 5A, top), whereas in those expressing the wtPrP::YFP fusion protein, distinct cytosolic aggregates were evident, in addition to a low level of diffuse background signal, presumably representing either soluble PrP not yet aggregated or proto-aggregates that are beyond the limit of resolution of light microscopy (Fig. 5A, middle row). The cytosolic inclusions were visualized as early as 5 h after induction of expression and were maximum by 16 h. As predicted from the solubility data, PrPΔ112-119::YFP produced visible aggregates that were grossly indistinguishable from wtPrP::YFP (Fig. 5A, bottom row). Thus, although the AGAAAAGA palindrome appears to be essential for generation of the PrPSc conformation, it does not appear to be essential for the bulk aggregation/association of PrP molecules. In light of the PK sensitivity of yeast-expressed PrPΔ112-119, its lack of conversion to PrPSc following expression in ScN2a cells, and its dominant-negative inhibition behavior, we questioned whether the intermolecular association of PrPΔ112-119 with PrPSc differs fundamentally from that of wtPrPC. To investigate the interactive properties of PrP in the cytosol of live yeast, we first co-expressed PrP fusion proteins tagged with either CFP or YFP and visualized their behavior using standard fluorescent microscopy. PrP::CFP co-expressed with YFP resulted in aggregated PrP fusion molecules and soluble YFP (Fig. 5B, top). In virtually 100% of cases where both proteins were visible within the same yeast cell, wtPrP::CFP colocalized with wtPrP::YFP, as expected (Fig. 5B, middle row). In addition, when wtPrP::CFP and PrPΔ112-119::YFP were co-expressed, these also appeared to co-localize (Fig. 5B, bottom row). While these results suggest that the two proteins were associating to form heterologous aggregates, it was also considered that homologous molecules were self-associating in an ordered way prior to their bulk coalescence into large disordered heterologous aggregates that were visible at the level of fluorescence microscopy. To better determine the specific nature of PrP associations, we applied the technique of donor photobleaching FRET to the yeast expression system. FRET is a powerful tool for investigating protein interactions that exploits the non-radiative transfer of energy from an excited-state donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore (21Kenworthy A.K.

Mutant mice strains deficient in specific genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes of the GSL pathway including Galgt1 (encoding GM2 synthase) and Siat9 (encoding GM3 synthase) have been established lacking various overlapping subsets of GSLs. Although male Galgt1-/- mice are infertile, male Siat9-/- mice are fertile. Interestingly, GSLs thought to be essential for male spermatogenesis are not synthesized in either of these mice strains. Hence, these GSLs cannot account for the different phenotypes. A novel class of GSLs was observed composed of eight fucosylated molecules present in fertile but not in infertile mutant mice. These GSLs contain polyunsaturated very long chain fatty acid residues in their ceramide moieties. GSLs of this class are expressed differentially in testicular germ cells.

These data implicate polyunsaturated, fucosylated GSLs as essential for spermatogenesis and male mouse fertility. Mammalian spermatogenesis, the transformation of diploid spermatogonial stem cells into haploid spermatozoa, is a complex process starting in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules where spermatogonial stem cells undergo asymmetric division, proliferation, and differentiation into preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes. Next, the spermatocytes must traverse the blood-testis barrier, built up by junctions between Sertoli cells, and migrate into the adluminal compartment to complete meiosis and to develop into haploid round spermatids. All except the earliest spermatogonial division result in a growing “string of beads” composed of interconnected germ cells with a continuous cytosol and plasma membrane caused by incomplete cytokinesis. During the final step of spermatogenesis leading to the release of spermatozoa (spermiation), spermatids undergo cytological transformations including shape change, nuclear condensation, and the development of specialized structures, such as an acrosome, and a flagellum with a mitochondrial sheath. The continuous spermiation is maintained by junctions between Sertoli cells and germ cells. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSLs, glycosphingolipids; ESI, electrospray ionization; FGSLs, fucosylated GSLs; Fuc, fucose; FUT, fucosyltransferase; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Hex B, human β-hexosaminidase B (β/β-isoform); MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; SCDase, sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase; TLC, thin layer chromatography; VLCFAs, very long chain fatty acids; TRITC, tetra-methylrhodamine isothiocyanate. The glycolipid nomenclature is that described by Svennerholm (40Svennerholm L. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: xi-xivCrossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and recommended by the IUPAC (Pure Appl. Chem. (1997) 69, 2475-2487). are amphipathic molecules present on cell membranes of the endocytotic and exocytotic pathway in mammalian cells where they influence membrane function. They also appear to play a role in cytological germ cell transformations because male mice lacking complex gangliosides, i.e. sialic acid-containing GSLs, resulting from Galgt1 deficiency (also known as Galgt1 encoding Gg3Cer/GM2/GD2-synthase (EC 2.4.1.92) are infertile (Fig. 1) (1Takamiya K.

In these mice, spermatogenesis proceeds only until the stage of round spermatids, and then the string of beads composed of spermatids is thought to lose Sertoli cell contact and round up to multinuclear giant cells (1Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Zhao J. Fukumoto S. Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Shin M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The significant drop of serum testosterone observed in these mice was explained by a lack of complex gangliosides such as GT1b, which bind to and thereby possibly transport testosterone from Leydig cells to the seminiferous tubules (1Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Zhao J. Fukumoto S. Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Shin M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The treated mice showed normal serum testosterone but abnormal spermatozoa in their testes (3van der Spoel A.C. Jeyakumar M. Butters T.D. Charlton H.M. Moore H.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Proc. Natl.

Hashiramoto A. Haluzik M. Mizukami H. Beck S. Norton A. Kono M. Tsuji S. Daniotti J.L. Werth N. Sandhoff R. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We searched for gangliosides and other GSLs present in fertile Siat9-/- and wild type testes but missing in infertile Galgt1-deficient mice. In wild type testes we uncovered a far more complex structural GSL pattern than described thus far (1Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Zhao J. Fukumoto S. Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Shin M.

A set of novel neutral fucosylated GSLs (FGSLs) was discovered whose presence strictly correlated with fertility. Gangliosides, structurally related to the neutral FGSLs by the addition of one sialic acid, were also found. The FGSLs are the major glycolipids of wild type mouse testes. They belong to the ganglio series; the four neutral FGSLs were determined to be IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer; IV3-α-Gal,IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer; IV3-α-GalNAc,IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer; and IV3-α-GalNAcβ3Gal,IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer. Interestingly the ceramide moieties of the novel FGSLs are highly unsaturated and contain polyenoic (four to six double bonds) very long chain fatty acid residues with at least 26 carbon atoms and mostly 2-hydroxylation. Mice—Siat9-/- mice were originally generated by Yamashita et al. (4Yamashita T. Hashiramoto A. Haluzik M. Mizukami H. Beck S. Norton A. Kono M. Tsuji S. Daniotti J.L. Werth N. Sandhoff R. Sandhoff K.

Purification of Compounds A and D from Testes Tissue—Neutral and acidic GSLs from 26-g testes, wet weight, from wild type mice were extracted according to Sandhoff et al. (9Sandhoff R. Hepbildikler S.T. Jennemann R. Geyer R. Gieselmann V. Proia R.L. Wiegandt H. Grone H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20386-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From the flow-through of the DEAE A-25 column, the neutral GSLs A and B were purified further by repeated silica gel flash column chromatography with the appropriate mixtures of n-hexane/isopropyl alcohol/water or CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (v/v) as running solvents. The enriched compounds A and D were peracetylated, then separated on quantitative high performance TLC plates with chloroform/acetone (1/1, v/v), scraped off the plates, eluted with methanol, deacetylated with methanol and 25% aqueous NH4OH (1/1, v/v) for 3 h at 50 °C, and dried with a N2 stream. GSL Extraction for TLC and ESI-MS/MS Analysis—GSLs were extracted from testes according to Sandhoff et al. (9Sandhoff R. Hepbildikler S.T. Jennemann R. Geyer R. Gieselmann V. Proia R.L. Wiegandt H. Grone H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20386-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Detection of neutral GSLs by ESI-MS/MS was greatly improved by its peracetylation, separation on Florisil column, and subsequent deacetylation. Therefore the method of Saito and Hakomori (10Saito T. Hakomori S.I. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified as described previously (11Weske B. Dennis R.D. Helling F. Keller M. Nores G.A. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski U. Wiegandt H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Detection of acidic GSLs was greatly improved by extracting the acidic GSL fraction further by the method of Folch et al. (12Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No changes resulting from Folch extraction were detected in the fatty acid patterns of gangliosides. TLC Analysis—TLC analysis was performed according to Sandhoff et al. (9Sandhoff R. Hepbildikler S.T. Jennemann R. Geyer R. Gieselmann V. Proia R.L. Wiegandt H. Grone H.J. J. Biol.

Then GSLs were desalinated on RP-18 columns and freed from detergent using DEAE columns. Carbohydrate Constituent Analysis—Carbohydrate constituents were released by acid hydrolysis, converted into their corresponding alditol acetates, and analyzed by capillary GC/MS as detailed elsewhere (15Geyer R. Geyer H. Kühnhardt S. Mink W. Stirm S. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate Permethylation Analysis—For determination of linkage positions of monosaccharide constituents, glycolipids were perm-ethylated and hydrolyzed (16Parente J.P. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricart G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates obtained after sodium borohydride reduction and peracetylation were analyzed by GC/MS using the instrumentation and microtechniques described previously (17Geyer R. Geyer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 86-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immuno-overlay Technique—Detection of GSLs with anti-blood group A and B antibodies (Seraclone anti-A clone A003 and anti-B clone B005, Biotest AG Dreieich, Germany) was performed using the immuno-overlay technique (18Jennemann R. Rodden A. Bauer B.L. Mennel H.D. Wiegandt H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7444-7449PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingolipid Ceramide N-Deacylase (SCDase) Treatment—Lyso compounds A and C were obtained by treatment of the purified mixture of compounds A and C with SCDase (Takara Shuso, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) according to Kurita et al. (19Kurita T. Izu H. Sano M. Ito M. Kato I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 846-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhydrogenation of GSLs—Dry neutral GSLs corresponding to 100 mg of wild type testes, wet weight, were dissolved under N2 in 500 μl of methanol and 250 μl of tetrahydrofuran. Pd/C was added, and N2 was exchanged by H2. After 24 h of stirring at room temperature the mixture was filtered and dried. Isolation of Detergent-insoluble Complexes—“Rafts,” i.e. detergent-insoluble complexes, were isolated as described by Ottico et al. (20Ottico E. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Giannotta C. Basso L. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2142-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with minor adjustments. Testes from two mice (390 mg, wet weight) were combined, Dounce homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (10 strokes, tight), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 80% sucrose in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). 30% and 5% sucrose solutions were loaded on top. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 h, 4 °C) 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top, fraction 3 marking the border between 5 and 30% sucrose, which was identified as the raft-containing fraction. For lipid determination the fractions were dialyzed and lipids extracted as described, proteins were isolated using trichloroacetic acid precipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Caveolin was detected with a purified polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse caveolin antibody (BD Biosciences) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Histology—Serial semithin Epon sections (0.5-1 μm) were carried out as described previously (21Rodemer C. Thai T.P. Brugger B. Kaercher T. Werner H. Nave K.A. Wieland F. Gorgas K. Just W.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1881-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining of 5-μm cryosections was carried out with the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method (22Porubsky S. Schmid H. Bonrouhi M. Kretzler M. Malle E. Nelson P.J. Grone H.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2175-2187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and with the immunofluorescence technique (23Grone H.J. Cohen C.D. Grone E. Schmidt C. Kretzler M. Schlondorff D. Nelson P.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 957-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SL) was used for documentation of the immunofluorescence results. Immunostaining of 0.6-μm ultracryo semithin sections (Leica Ultracut UCT equipped with Leica EMFCS) was performed using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 35). Testes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde by cardiac perfusion, cryoprotected with 2.3 m sucrose, and frozen in liquid N2. Primary antibodies were anti-Fuc-GA1(IgG), clone LFA-II (24Lin B. Hayashi Y. Saito M. Sakakibara Y. Yanagisawa M. Iwamori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), anti-Fuc-GM1 clone F12 (25Fredman P. Brezicka T. Holmgren J. Lindholm L. Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys.

Monoclonal anti-compound D antibody D7C5 was generated in our laboratory by immunizing Galgt1-/- mice with hydrolyzed Salmonella minnesota, coated with purified neutral glycolipids from mouse testes as adjuvant according to Higgins (26Higgins T.J. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). D7C5 reacted selectively with compound D from GSL extracts of mouse wild type testes (Fig. 2). Secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L), fluorescein isothiocyanate-, TRITC-, and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-guinea pig IgG and were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Identification of novel GSLs in Testes Associated with Fertility—Testicular GSLs of fertile wild type, Siat9-/-, and Siat8a-/- (encoding GD3 synthase), and infertile Galgt1-/- mice were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 3A). Wild type mouse testes contained complex neutral GSLs and complex gangliosides. The quantitatively major neutral GSL components migrated on TLC as two double bands with a slower migration velocity than Gg4Cer. The major gangliosides had TLC migration rates between GM1a and GD1a. Faint ganglioside bands migrated similarly to GM3, GM2, GM1a, and GT1b on the plate, and one band moved even slower than GT1b. The ganglioside profiles of the mutant testes differed from those of wild type mice. Minor changes were observed in Siat8a-/- mice (lacking GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b), whereas the ganglioside profiles of infertile Galgt1-/- and fertile Siat9-/- mice testes differed drastically from those of wild type mice. They lacked all complex wild type gangliosides as well as GM3 and GM2 in Siat9-/- mice. Both GM3 and GD3 accumulated in testes of Galgt1-/- mice, whereas Siat9-/- mice produced mainly the 0-series gangliosides GM1b and GD1a (Fig. 3B). The presence of GD1a was also confirmed by specific fragment m/z 475 as described by Yamashita et al. (4Yamashita T. Hashiramoto A. Haluzik M. Mizukami H. Beck S. Norton A. Kono M. Tsuji S. Daniotti J.L. Werth N. Sandhoff R. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3445-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In contrast to the multiple changes of the ganglioside patterns observed in fertile and infertile mutant mice, only the neutral, testicular GSL pattern of infertile Galgt1-/- mice differed from that of wild type testes: two wild type double bands migrating in TLC below Gg4Cer were missing (Fig. 3A). They represent the major complex GSLs (later described as FGSLs) of wild type testes and are present in the fertile mutant mice. Structural Analysis of Oligosaccharide Moieties of Testicular Complex Neutral GSLs—Because the presence of the complex neutral GSL components (FGSLs) of the mouse testes correlates with fertility, their chemical structures were established. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed the presence of four different complex neutral GSL compounds, each represented mainly by two peaks with a difference of m/z 28, corresponding to a C2H4 unit (Fig. 4A1). The smallest compound (compound A) had protonated molecular masses of 1,548 and 1,576. Compound B followed in a distance of m/z 162 corresponding to an additional Hex residue. Compound C was 203 atomic mass units bigger than compound A corresponding to one HexNAc residue more, and compound D differed from compound A by 365 atomic mass units corresponding to the addition of one Hex and one HexNAc residue. For further characterization, compounds A and D were purified to higher than 90% single component presence. Compound A could be transformed into a GSL migrating like Gg4Cer by treatment with α-fucosidase (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Treatment of this product with β-galactosidase yielded a GSL migrating as Gg3Cer (Fig. 5A, lane 5). The sequential loss of one Fuc and one Gal residue was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). The combination of carbohydrate constituent and glycosidic linkage analysis revealed compound A to contain one 4-substituted Glc, one 4-substituted Gal, and one 2-substituted Gal, a 3-substituted GalNAc, and one terminal Fuc residue (data not shown). Combining these results with its ganglio series origin, compound A was characterized as Fucα2Galβ3-GalNAcβ4Galβ4GlcCer (IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer or Fuc-GA1) containing surprisingly large ceramide moieties with protonated molecular masses of 712 and 740 atomic mass units. This was supported by data from partially hydrolyzed compound A (data not shown). The combination of carbohydrate constituent and glycosidic linkage analysis revealed compound D to contain one 4-substituted Glc, one 4-substituted Gal, one 3-substituted Gal, and one 2,3-disubstituted Gal, a 3-substituted GalNAc, a terminal GalNAc, and one terminal Fuc residue (data not shown). Compound D could be degraded to a GSL with migration identical to compound A by treating it first with Hex B and subsequently with α-galactosidase (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 3). The corresponding sequential loss of one GalNAc and one Gal residue was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). With a ganglio series backbone, these data fit the following structure for compound D: GalNAcβ3Galα3(Fucα2)Galβ3GalNAcβ4Galβ-4GlcCer (IV3-α-GalNAcβ3Gal-compound A). Compound D contained ceramide moieties identical to that of compound A. Compound B was solely susceptible to α-galactosidase, converting it to a GSL migrating like compound A (data not shown). Because compound A is the biosynthetic precursor of compound B, compound B should end with the terminal Galα3(Fucα2)Gal structure (also known as blood group B determinant). However, compound C resisted the combined treatment of α-, β-galactosidase, Hex B, and α-fucosidase (data not shown), suggesting a terminal α-glycosidically linked HexNAc residue as is the case for the blood group A epitope, GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Gal. Indeed compounds B and C could be stained with blood group B- and blood group A-specific antibodies, respectively (Fig. 5C). These blood group antibodies could not detect compounds B and C antigens in ganglio series-deficient Galgt1-/- testes, thus proving their ganglio series backbone (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that compound B with the structure IV3-α-Gal,IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer is the precursor of compound D, and compound C is IV3-α-GalNAc,IV2-α-Fuc-Gg4Cer. The large ceramide moieties of compounds B and C are identical to those of compounds A and D as discussed below. Each blood group antibody stained a different, weaker TLC band from Galgt1-/- testes migrating slightly faster than the corresponding wild type lipids compounds B and C (Fig. 5D). These TLC bands may correspond to two of the three TLC bands still visible in Galgt1-/- mice (Figs. 3 and 5D). The Ceramide Residues of Compounds A to D Contain Polyenoic, Very Long Chain Fatty Acids (VLCFAs)—Incubation of compounds A and C with SCDase resulted in the appearance of a single lyso compound for each of these glycolipids, i.e. lyso compound A, 1,136 atomic mass units and lyso compound C, 1339 atomic mass units. According to the molecular mass the two signals corresponded to d18:1 sphingosine-containing lyso compound A and lyso compound C, respectively (Fig. 4B). The SCDase-induced loss of either 412 or 440 atomic mass units appeared to correspond to a release of fatty acids of 430 or 458 atomic mass units (412 or 440 atomic mass units + 18 atomic mass units from the addition of H2O). Because calculations suggested the presence of polyenoic fatty acids, a perhydrogenation experiment was performed. It resulted in a mass shift of 12 atomic mass units for the main two peaks of all four compounds A, B, C, and D, corresponding to six carbon to carbon double bonds (Fig. 4A2). Compound A, with a ceramide-containing hydroxylated palmitic acid, showed a mass increase by perhydrogenation of 2 atomic mass units (m/z 1,389 to 1,391) because of hydrogenation of the sphingosine double bond (Fig. 4, A2 and C2). Taking this into account, the main fatty acids of compounds A, B, C, and D with 430 and 458 atomic mass units each contained five double bonds. In addition, their molecular mass suggested the presence of one hydroxyl group. The presence of hydroxylated polyenoic VLCFAs with compositions of h28:5 and h30:5 as major constituents was confirmed by GC/MS analysis, as well as the presence of a hydroxyl group in the 2-position by identification of the specific fragments [M-59]+ (loss of the carbomethoxy radical CH3OC=O·) (27Ryhage R. Stenhagen E. McLafferty F.W. Mass Spectrometry of Organic Ions. Academic Press, New York1963: 399-452Crossref Google Scholar) and at m/z 90, resulting from the McLafferty rearrangement and 2,3-bond cleavage using the electron impact ionization mode (data not shown) (28Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Zähringer U. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results revealed that the major fatty acid residues of the neutral FGSLs were 2-hydroxylated, polyenoic VLCFAs: h28:5 and h30:5. Gangliosides—Scanning by ESI-MS/MS for a sialic acid-specific fragment showed the presence in wild type mouse testes of the following gangliosides: GM3, GM2, GM1, GD1, GT1, and GQ1, as well as the acidic FGSLs: monosialocompounds A-D. The presence of monosialocompounds A, B, and C was confirmed by immuno-overlays. In addition to the neutral FGSLs found in testes, significant signals corresponding to gangliosides containing either h28:5 or h30:5 fatty acid were seen for all four acidic FGSLs, but not for other gangliosides (GM3, GM1, GD1, GT1, or GQ1). The latter gangliosides contained predominantly palmitic acid, besides 18:0, 20:0, 22:0, 24:1, and 24:0 fatty acids (data not shown). GM3 and GD3 of Galgt1-deficient Mouse Testes Do Not Contain Significant Amounts of Polyenoic VLCFAs—As revealed by MS/MS, GD3 showed a fatty acid composition analogous to the wild type GD1, i.e. without polyenoic VLCFAs. The fatty acid pattern of GM3 was similar to that of GD3. However, this ganglioside also contained very small amounts of h28:5 and h30:5 fatty acid residues (data not shown). Siat9-/- Mice"

Here we showed for the first time that the PC gene is transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in vitro and in vivo in white and brown adipose tissue. PC mRNA and protein are markedly increased during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and HIB-1B, in parallel with the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha, PPARgamma1, and PPARgamma2. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a cytokine that blocks differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, suppressed PC expression. Co-transfection studies in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or HEK293T cells with a 2.3-kb promoter fragment of mouse PC gene linked to a luciferase reporter construct and with plasmids overexpressing retinoid X receptor alpha/PPARgamma1 or retinoid X receptor alpha/PPARgamma2 showed a 6-8-fold increase above the basal promoter activity. Furthermore, treatment of these transfected cells with the PPARgamma agonist doubled the promoter activity. Mutation of the putative PPAR-response element-(-386/-374) of this 2.3-kb PC promoter fragment abolished the PPARgamma response. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that endogenous PPARgamma binds to this functional PPAR-response element of the PC promoter. Mice with targeted disruption of the PPARgamma2 gene displayed approximately 50-60% reduction of PC mRNA and protein in white adipose tissue. Similarly, in brown adipose tissue of PPARgamma2-deficient mice subjected to cold exposure, PC mRNA was 40% lower than that of wild type mice. Impaired in vitro differentiation of white adipocytes of PPARgamma2 knock-out mice was also associated with a marked reduction of PC mRNA. Our findings identified PC as a PPARgamma-regulated gene and suggested a role for PPARgamma regulating intermediary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1969604517,"Rad51 and its meiotic homolog Dmc1 are key proteins of homologous recombination in eukaryotes. These proteins form nucleoprotein complexes on single-stranded DNA that promote a search for homology and that perform DNA strand exchange, the two essential steps of genetic recombination. Previously, we demonstrated that Ca2+ greatly stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of human (h) Rad51 protein (Bugreev, D. V., and Mazin, A. V. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 9988–9993). Here, we show that the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein is also stimulated by Ca2+. However, the mechanism of stimulation of hDmc1 protein appears to be different from that of hRad51 protein. In the case of hRad51 protein, Ca2+ acts primarily by inhibiting its ATPase activity, thereby preventing self-conversion into an inactive ADP-bound complex. In contrast, we demonstrate that hDmc1 protein does not self-convert into a stable ADP-bound complex. The results indicate that activation of hDmc1 is mediated through conformational changes induced by free Ca2+ ion binding to a protein site that is distinct from the Mg2+·ATP-binding center. These conformational changes are manifested by formation of more stable filamentous hDmc1·single-stranded DNA complexes. Our results demonstrate a universal role of Ca2+ in stimulation of mammalian DNA strand exchange proteins and reveal diversity in the mechanisms of this stimulation.

In most eukaryotic organisms, meiotic recombination is required for generation of genetic diversity and for accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes (1Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations that impair meiotic recombination have been reported to increase non-disjunction in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mice, and humans; malfunction of meiotic recombination is a leading cause of trisomies in humans (4Lynn A.

Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins have significant structural homology, sharing 52% identical amino acid residues, and display similar biochemical properties. However, these proteins may play distinct roles in vivo. Although Rad51 protein is expressed in both mitotic and meiotic cells, Dmc1 is a meiosis-specific protein. In mammals, Rad51 is an essential protein; RAD51–/– knockouts in the mouse cause embryonic lethality. In contrast, DMC1–/– knockouts are viable, but sterile (18Pittman D.L. Cobb J. Schimenti K.J.

Recently, it was found that KCl at elevated concentrations (100–200 mm) strongly stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein and also promotes the formation of hDmc1·ssDNA helical nucleoprotein filaments (17Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Previously, we demonstrated that Ca2+ activates the DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51 protein (22Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and that Ca2+ is required for stimulation of hRad51 protein by hRad54 protein (23Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the effect of Ca2+ on the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1. The results show that the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein is greatly enhanced by Ca2+. Taken together with our previous findings, the results suggest that Ca2+ may play a role in regulation of homologous recombination in vivo. This role of Ca2+ seems especially compelling because (i) Ca2+ is known as a common intracellular regulator (24Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 3507-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at the time when homologous recombination occurs. We also found that the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein differs significantly from that of hRad51 protein, in which inhibition of the ATPase activity plays the primary role. Our present data show that Ca2+-dependent stimulation of hDmc1 protein is possibly mediated by conformational changes in hDmc1 protein, leading to the formation of more stable hDmc1·ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes. Similar to the case with KCl (17Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein by Ca2+ is accompanied by formation of the hDmc1·ssDNA helical nucleoprotein filaments, indicating an essential role of this structure in DNA strand exchange.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins, Chemicals, and DNA—hDmc1 and human replication protein A (RPA) were purified as described previously (32Gupta R.C.

Poly(dT) ssDNA was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In this study, the DNA concentrations are expressed as moles of nucleotide.Joint Molecule (D-loop) Formation—To form nucleoprotein complexes, hDmc1 protein (1.5 μm) was incubated with 32P-labeled ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide; 3 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 2 mm ATP or AMP-PNP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and the indicated divalent ions for 10 min at 37 °C. Joint molecule formation was initiated by addition of supercoiled pUC19 dsDNA (50 μm). The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS to 1% and proteinase K to 880 μg/ml, followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. 0.1 volume of loading buffer (70% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing TAE (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA). The extent of joint molecule formation was determined using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager as described previously (22Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aliquots (7 μl) were withdrawn, deproteinized by adding stop solution (3 μl) containing 4.8% SDS and 7.3 mg/ml proteinase K, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing TAE. A 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was used for DNA migration markers. DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide and quantified using an Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.).DNA Binding Assay—Nucleoprotein complexes were formed by incubating hDmc1 protein (1.5 μm) with 32P-labeled ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide; 6 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, NaCl in indicated concentrations, 1 mm DTT, and either 5 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C.

Gels were processed and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager.hDmc1 ATPase Assay—Reactions were carried out in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 2 mm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ϕX174 ssDNA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2, and 3 μm hDmc1 protein at 37 °C. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was determined by TLC using polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Selecto Scientific) in 0.3 m KH2PO4 (pH 7.5); the products were visualized and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager.Analysis of the Nucleotide Content of hDmc1·ATP/ADP·ssDNA Complexes—ATP hydrolysis was initiated by adding hDmc1 protein (10 μm) to ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide; 30 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 100 μm ATP, 6 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2, and the ATP regeneration system containing 15 mm phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were loaded onto nylon filters (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell) in a Minifold apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) and quickly washed twice (100 μl each) under vacuum with buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0) and either 5 mm MgCl2 or 2mm CaCl2. The hDmc1·ATP/ADP·ssDNA complexes were immediately extracted from the filters by soaking them in buffer (200 μl) containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 50 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS; aliquots (3 μl) were analyzed by TLC as described above.Kinetics of the Displacement of ADP from hDmc1·ADP·ssDNA Complexes—Nucleoprotein filaments were formed by mixing hDmc1 or hRad51 protein (10 μm) with the 90-mer oligonucleotide (30 μm) in the presence of ADP (100 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 0.1 μCi of [14C]ADP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. To initiated ADP displacement, 2 mm ATP was added to the mixtures. At the indicated time points, aliquots (10 μm) were withdrawn, loaded onto Nytran nylon filters in a Minifold apparatus, and quickly washed twice (100 μl each) under vacuum with buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0) and 5 mm MgCl2. Filters were dried, and the amount of protein-bound [14C]ADP was determined using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager.Electron Microscopy—hDmc1·ssDNA complexes were prepared by mixing hDmc1 protein (10 μm) with ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide or poly(dT); 15 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.0), 2 mm ATP, and either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min (or 5 min for unfixed samples). When KCl was used (17Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the nucleoprotein complexes were prepared in buffer containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 2 mm ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. RecA·ssDNA filaments were formed by incubating the protein (10 μm) with ssDNA (15 μm) in buffer containing 25 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATPγS at 37 °C for 30 min. Where indicated, the complexes were fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. Samples were spread and stained following the negative staining procedure for electron microscopy (35Sogo J. Stasiak A. DeBernardin W. Losa R. Koller T. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 61-79Google Scholar).

Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the effect of Ca2+ on the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein, a meiosis-specific homolog of hRad51 protein. First, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ on joint molecule (D-loop) formation promoted by hDmc1 protein between ssDNA and supercoiled pUC19 plasmid dsDNA (Fig. 1A). We found that formation of joint molecules was increased ∼10-fold when Mg2+ was substituted with Ca2+ (Fig. 1, B and C). The yield of joint molecules was highest at 2 mm Ca2+, approximately stoichiometric to ATP (Fig. 1D); in contrast, no comparable stimulation of joint molecules was observed at 0.1–10 mm Mg2+.By varying the order of Ca2+ addition, we found that stimulation of hDmc1 protein occurred only when Ca2+ was present during hDmc1·ssDNA complex assembly; stimulation was diminished when Ca2+ was added at later steps, i.e. following dsDNA substrate addition (Fig. 2). Thus, hDmc1 protein shows similarity to hRad51 protein, which is also responsive to Ca2+ stimulation during formation of presynaptic complexes (22Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Ca2+ stimulates DNA pairing by acting during formation of the hDmc1 presynaptic filament. A, analysis of joint molecule formation on 1% agarose gel. Joint molecule formation was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods,” except that the concentration of MgCl2 (Mg) was 1 mm. Where indicated, 1 mm CaCl (Ca) was added to the reactions. In the reactions shown in lanes 1–3 2, the nucleoprotein filaments were assembled by incubating ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide) with hDmc1 protein under the following conditions: in the absence of CaCl2 for 20 min (ssDNA+ Mg→+ scDNA); in the presence of CaCl2 for 20 min (ssDNA+Mg+Ca→+ scDNA); in the absence of CaCl2 for 10 min, followed by addition of CaCl2 and then by additional incubation for 10 min (ssDNA + Mg→+ Ca→+ scDNA). In these reactions, joint molecule formation was initiated by addition of supercoiled pUC19 dsDNA (scDNA) and carried out for 15 min. In the reaction shown in lane 4 (ssDNA+Mg→+ scDNA →+ Ca), the nucleoprotein filaments were assembled by incubating ssDNA (90-mer oligonucleotide) with hDmc1 protein in the absence of CaCl2 for 20 min, followed by addition of pUC19 dsDNA, incubation for 5 min, addition of CaCl2, and additional incubation for 15 min. B, data from A represented in a bar graph. Experiments were repeated three times, with S.E. values not exceeding 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using oligonucleotide ssDNA and dsDNA substrates, we also found that Ca2+ was better than Mg2+ as a cofactor of hDmc1 protein in DNA strand exchange, although the increase in the extent of the reaction was ∼3–4-fold smaller than in the D-loop assay in Fig. 1C (data not shown).We then investigated the effect of Ca2+ on DNA strand exchange promoted by hDmc1 protein between circular ssDNA and linearized dsDNA of bacteriophage ϕX174 as schematized in Fig. 3A. Ca2+ also stimulated the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein in this assay (Fig. 3, B, lanes 5–12; and C, open circles). In this reaction, similar to hRad51 protein (22Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), hDmc1 protein required both Ca2+ and Mg2+. However, although omission of Ca2+ from the reaction mixture obliterated joint molecule formation completely (Fig. 3, B, lanes 1–4; and C, open squares), omission of Mg2+ in the presence of Ca2+ only decreased the efficiency of the reaction (∼7–10-fold) (data not shown). Formation of joint molecules also required ATP (Fig. 3B, lanes 13–15) and RPA, an ssDNA-binding protein (lanes 16–18).Fig. 3Ca2+ stimulates three-strand exchange promoted by hDmc1 protein. A, the scheme of DNA strand exchange between ϕX174 circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA. B, analysis of joint molecule (JM) formation on 1% agarose gel. The reactions were carried out for the indicated time periods at 2 mm Mg2+ (Mg), 2 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ (Ca+Mg), and 2 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ but without ATP (–ATP) or RPA (–RPA).

Experiments were repeated three times, with S.E. values not exceeding 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, using three different assays, we demonstrated that the DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 protein was strongly stimulated by Ca2+. Taken together with our previous findings that Ca2+ is required for DNA strand exchange promoted by hRad51 and hRad54 proteins (22Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that Ca2+ is an important cofactor of human DNA strand exchange proteins.Free Ca2+ Ion Is Important for hDmc1 Protein Activation—To gain some insight into the mechanism of hDmc1 protein activation, we determined the optimal Ca2+ concentration for DNA pairing. Using the joint molecule (D-loop) assay, we found that, at any ATP concentration tested (0.5, 2, and 5 mm), the optimal Ca2+ concentration was approximately equimolar to ATP (Fig. 4A). Because ATP chelates Ca2+, the concentration of free Ca2+ ion is low at high ATP/Ca2+ ratios. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of this result would be that free Ca2+ ion is required for hDmc1 activity, but its excess is inhibitory for hDmc1. However, because the concentration of the Ca2+·ATP complex also rises with the increase in total Ca2+ concentration, it is possible that binding of Ca2+·ATP is required for hDmc1 protein activation. We argued that the DNA pairing activity of hDmc1 protein should show a dependence on the concentration of that ligand that is critical for its activity, but not on the other. From the experimental data in Fig. 4A, we calculated the concentrations of free Ca2+ ion and the Ca2+·ATP complex using WEBMAXC STANDARD software and then replotted the extent of joint molecule formation as a function of the calculated concentrations of each ligand. We found that the extent of joint molecule formation showed a dependence on the free Ca2+ ion concentration (Fig. 4B). The DNA pairing activity of hDmc1 protein was initiated at ∼5–10 μm free Ca2+ ion (Fig. 4B, inset), reached its maximum at 100–400 μm, and declined at concentrations >700 μm. In contrast, joint molecule formation showed no discernible dependence on the concentration of the Ca2+·ATP complex (Fig. 4C). It should be noted that the apparent independence of hDmc1 protein pairing activity of the Ca2+·ATP concentration does not exclude that hDmc1 binds ATP in the form of the Ca2+·ATP complex; however, it indicates that, at the range of Ca2+ and ATP concentrations tested, binding of free Ca2+ ion represents a critical step in hDmc1 protein activation. Thus, binding of free Ca2+ ion appears to be important for the DNA pairing activity of hDmc1 protein.Fig. 4DNA pairing activity of hDmc1 protein depends on free Ca2+ concentration. The efficiency of joint molecule formation by hDmc1 protein was measured at the indicated concentrations of Ca2+ and ATP (A). The reactions were carried out for 15 min. The extent of joint molecule formation (shown in A) is plotted against the concentration of either free Ca2+ ion (B) or Ca2+·ATP complexes (C). The concentrations of free Ca2+ ion and Ca2+·ATP complexes were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Mg2+ on the DNA Pairing Activity of hDmc1 Protein—Here, we investigated whether Mg2+, another biologically important divalent cation, would interfere with Ca2+-dependent stimulation of Dmc1 protein, e.g. by competing for binding to the protein. Intracellular Mg2+ is present as a free ion and in a complex with ATP, whose concentrations are thought to be in the range of 0.5–1.0 and 4–5 mm, respectively (36Romani A.M. Scarpa A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D720-D734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effects of both these species on the efficiency of D-loop formation by varying the concentrations of either Mg2+ or ATP. The concentration of free Ca2+ ion, which strongly affects the activity of hDmc1, was maintained constant.First, we varied the total Mg2+ concentration while the total ATP concentration was fixed at either 2 or 4 mm. Because Mg2+ displaces Ca2+ from a complex with ATP, to maintain a constant free Ca2+ ion concentration (∼0.275 mm), the total Ca2+ concentration was gradually decreased while the Mg2+ concentration was increased. We found that, at each ATP concentration, Mg2+ became inhibitory for D-loop formation at concentrations greater than that of ATP (Fig. 5A). Using these data, we then replotted the extent of joint molecule formation as a function of free Mg2+ ion concentration that was calculated using WEBMAXC STANDARD software. We found that, independent of ATP concentration, the extent of joint molecule formation decreased steadily with the increase in free Mg2+ ion concentration; half-inhibition was observed at ∼2 mm free Mg2+ ion (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Effect of Mg2+ on Ca2+-dependent stimulation of the DNA pairing activity of hDmc1 protein. A, the effect of Mg2+ concentration on the efficiency of join molecule formation by hDmc1 protein was determined in the presence of a constant free Ca2+ ion concentration (∼0.275 mm). To maintain a constant free Ca2+ ion concentration while increasing the Mg2+ concentration from 0 to 10 mm, the following total Ca2+ concentrations were used: 1.70, 1.60, 1.50, 1.40, 1.10, 1.26, 0.90, 0.76, 0.70, 0.66, and 0.60 mm at 2 mm ATP (open squares) and 3.20, 2.80, 2.50, 1.80, 1.22, 0.80, 0.5"

Recently, the low density receptor-related protein (LRP) has been shown to be cleaved by a γ-secretase-like activity. We postulated that LRP may interact with PS1 and tested its role as a competitive substrate for γ-secretase. In this report we show that LRP colocalizes and interacts with endogenous PS1 using coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. In addition, we found that γ-secretase active site inhibitors do not disrupt the interaction between LRP and PS1, suggesting that the substrate associates with a γ-secretase docking site located in close proximity to PS1. This is analogous to APP-γ-secretase interactions. Finally, we show that LRP competes with APP for γ-secretase activity. Overexpression of a truncated LRP construct consisting of the C terminus, the transmembrane domain, and a short extracellular portion leads to a reduction in the levels of the Aβ40, Aβ42, and p3 peptides without changing the total level of APP expression. In addition, transfection with the β-chain of LRP causes an increase in uncleaved APP C-terminal fragments and a concomitant decrease in the signaling effects of the APP intracellular domain.

LRP is cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi network, generating a 515-kDa α-subunit and a 85 kDa β-subunit that remain non-covalently associated as they are transported to the cell surface (14Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LRP also undergoes proteolytic shedding of the extracellular domain by a metalloproteinase (15Quinn K.A. Pye V.J. Dai Y.P. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the cytoplasmic tail of LRP can be processed intramembranously by a γ-secretase activity that releases its intracellular domain (16May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase complex is a multiprotein complex that is composed of at least four members, namely presenilin 1 (PS1), which is believed to contain the catalytic site, nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph1 (17Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This complex is responsible for cleavage of at least 15 substrates, including APP and the Notch receptor. APP is a type-I transmembrane protein that is cleaved by α- or β-secretase to remove its large extracellular domain. The remaining 83-residue (APPC83) or 99-residue (APPC99) fragments are cleaved intramembraneously by γ-secretase to release the fragment p3 or the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), respectively (18Xia W.

The LC construct contains the β-subunit of LRP with a Myc tag at the N terminus (33Mikhailenko I. Battey F.D. Migliorini M. Ruiz J.F. Argraves K. Moayeri M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39484-39491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mutant LC consists of the β-subunit of LRP with a Myc tag at the N terminus in which asparagines and the tyrosine in both NPXY motifs have been substituted by alanines (34Loukinova E.

The LRP-CT construct, consisting of the last 370 amino acids of the 601-amino acid LRP β-subunit, was subcloned into the pLHCX retroviral expression vector and transferred into the 293 GP packaging cell line (27Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human neuroblastoma (H4) cells, human embryonic kidney cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PS1 (MEF PS1-/-) or MEF PS1-/- stably expressing human wild-type PS1 (35Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Cells were cultured in OPTI-MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator. For Aβ and APP internalization measurements, CHO cells stably expressing APP751 with the LRP C terminus (7WD10-CT) or without the LRP C terminus (7WD10) were used (27Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed using Superfect reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with 1 μm DAPT or 1 μm WPE-III-31C (a generous gift from M. Wolfe, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) or a vehicle control (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for 24 h (36Kornilova A.Y. Das C. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol.

Western Blot and Coimmunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis the cell lysates were adjusted to equal protein concentrations and electrophoresed on 10-20% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine or 10% Bis-Tricine NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). We used the following antibodies: the polyclonal anti-LRP antiserum 1704 (27Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); the monoclonal anti-LRP antibody 11H4; the monoclonal anti-PS1 antibody (PSN2) (38Zhang J. Kang D.E. Xia W. Okochi M. Mori H.

Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the APP C8 antibody (41Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), both of which recognize the cytoplasmic domain of APP. For endogenous PS1-LRP coimmunoprecipitation from the normal rat brain (3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats), we used anti-PS1 antibodies (X81 or 4627) for a pull-down assay and the 11H4 LRP antibody for blotting. The immunoblotting was followed by detection with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Bands on films were scanned and quantitated using Odyssey software (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska). Aβ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Measurements and APP Internalization Assay—Media from 7WD10 and 7WD10-CT were collected after 48 h, debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 20 min), and the supernatants were subjected to Aβ40 and Aβ42 quantification using a standard sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described previously (25Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H. Katzman R. Koo E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To measure internalization of cell surface APP, iodinated 1G7 antibody was added to confluent cultures of 7WD10 and 7WD10-CT cells at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were rapidly chilled on ice, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold binding medium. Cells were washed extensively, and the remaining surface antibody was detached by two acid washes. The cells were then lysed and collected for analysis. Acid-labile and acid-resistant radioactivity represents the surface and internalized pools of APP, respectively. The ratio of acid-resistant to acid-labile counts, therefore, provided a measure of the internalized versus cell surface pools of APP. The experiments were repeated three times. Fe65-dependent APP Luciferase Transactivation Assay—Human embryonic kidney cells were cotransfected with the APP-Gal4 construct (a gift from Dr. Thomas Südhof, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, which was cloned from APP 695 with the Gal4 sequence spliced into the cytoplasmic tail), pG5E1B-Luc (a luciferase reporter plasmid with a Gal4 activation-dependent binding domain), Fe65, and a β-galactosidase plasmid (19Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The generation of Fe65 with a C-terminal Myc tag has been reported elsewhere (42Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Immunocytochemistry and Antibodies—Cells were fixed and immunostained 24 after transfection as described (43Jack C. Berezovska O. Wolfe M.S. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.3), permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum for 1 h. We used an antibody directed against the N terminus of PS1 (X81) and a mouse monoclonal antibody, 11H4, against the LRP C-terminal fragment (a hybridoma secreting 11H4 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). For the fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) assays a FITC-labeled secondary antibody was used as a donor fluorophore, and a Cy3-labeled secondary antibody was used as an acceptor fluorophore. Metabolic Labeling—Confluent cultures of CHO 7WD10 and CHO 7WD10 LRP-CT cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h. Media were collected after 12 h, and total Aβ was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody R3134. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (6% Tris-glycine gels for full-length APP and 4-12% Tris-Tricine gels for APP C-terminal fragments) and exposed to either film or phosphorimaging for quantitation. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Assay—FLIM has been recently described as a novel technique for the analysis of protein proximity (44Berezovska O. Ramdya P. Skoch J. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Opt. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 46Lleo A. Berezovska O. Herl L. Raju S. Deng A. Bacskai B.J. Frosch M.P. Irizarry M. Hyman B.T. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The technique is based on the observation that fluorescence lifetimes of a donor fluorophore shorten in the presence of a FRET acceptor in close proximity (<10 nm). The decrease in lifetime is proportional to the distance between the fluorophores at R6. A mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Fremont, CA) emits a femtosecond pulse every 12 ns to excite the fluorophore. A high-speed Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, NJ) detector and hardware/software (SPC-830 Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany) were used to measure fluorescence lifetimes on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Donor fluorophore (FITC) lifetimes were fitted to two exponential decay curves as described (44Berezovska O. Ramdya P. Skoch J. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Opt. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All samples were compared with a negative control in which the donor fluorophore (FITC) fluorescence lifetime was measured in the absence of the acceptor (no FRET) and was ∼2300 ps. As a positive control, FITC lifetime was measured in the presence of a FRET acceptor (Cy3) in close proximity. In the positive control, FITC lifetime is shortened to <1000 ps. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze differences in lifetime followed by least significant difference post hoc analysis. Levene's test was also performed to determine whether variances were equal. Colocalization, FRET, and Coimmunoprecipitation Show That LRP Interacts with Presenilin 1—Because LRP is cleaved by a γ-secretase activity and PS1 contains the catalytic site of the multi-protein γ-secretase complex (28Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), we first tested whether LRP interacts directly with PS1. We transfected CHO cells with wild-type PS1 and wild-type LRP/LC and double immunostained the cells with antibodies against PS1 and the C terminus of LRP. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that wild-type LRP/LC colocalized with PS1 mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2). However, because colocalization has a spatial resolution of >250 nm, we used FLIM to test whether PS1 and LRP interact more closely. FLIM is based on the observation that the lifetime of a donor fluorophore is shorter in the presence of a FRET acceptor in close proximity. We transfected CHO cells with wild-type PS1 and wild-type LC and immunostained the cells with a FITC-labeled antibody against the N terminus of PS1 and a Cy3-labeled antibody against the C terminus of LRP. In the absence of an acceptor, FITC lifetime was ∼2300 ps. However, immunostaining of LRP with a Cy3-labeled antibody shortened the FITC lifetime markedly, indicating that the fluorophores are in close proximity (Table I). This shortening in FITC lifetime was specific, because immunostaining Bip, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein that colocalizes with PS1, with a Cy3-labeled antibody did not alter FITC lifetime. In cells transfected with PS1 and LRP/LC we observed that the strongest interactions occur close to the cell membrane (Fig. 3) in the same type of spatial patterns that we have observed previously for two other γ-secretase substrates, APP and Notch (44Berezovska O. Ramdya P. Skoch J. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ramdya P. Skoch J. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. Berezovska O. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As expected, the lifetime pattern in cells stained for Bip did not differ from that of the negative control. Next, we examined whether the NPXY domains of LRP are necessary for the interaction of LRP with PS1, which might be the case if the interaction was mediated by an adaptor protein. We transfected cells with wild-type PS1 and a mutant LRP/LC construct in which both NPXY domains have been mutated and immunostained the cells for PS1 and LRP. Cells transfected with mutant LC showed similar patterns of expression and colocalization with PS1 as wild-type LC (Fig. 2), and FLIM analysis detected significant FRET between PS1 and mutant LC (Table I). The main interacting molecules were localized close to the cell membrane, similar to what was observed in wild-type LC-expressing cells (Fig. 3). These data suggest that both wild-type LC and mutant LC interact with PS1 and that the NPXY domains of LRP are not essential for PS1-LRP interactions. The observed interaction between LRP and PS1 in transfected cells was also confirmed at the endogenous level in primary cultured neurons, as reflected by a significant shortening in donor lifetime when cells were double immunostained for LRP and PS1.Table ILRP/wild-type LC and LRP/mutant L interact with presenilin 1ConditionNo.aNumber of cells analyzed.FRET acceptorbCy3-labeled.FITC lifetimecMean ± S.E.ProbabilitydCompared to FITC without acceptor.psNo acceptor6None2274 ± 39LRP/LC6LRP C terminus1934 ± 81p < 0.001LRP/mutLC6LRP C terminus1966 ± 116p < 0.001Bip10Bip2409 ± 115NSeNot significant.a Number of cells analyzed.b Cy3-labeled.c Mean ± S.E.d Compared to FITC without acceptor.e Not significant. Open table in a new tab Fig. 3LRP/wild-type LC and LRP/mutant LC interact with presenilin 1 as assessed by FLIM. CHO cells were transfected with wild-type LC or mutant LC (Mut-myc-LC) and PS1. Twenty-four hours later cells were immunostained for PS1 and LRP with a FITC-labeled antibody and a Cy3-labeled antibody, respectively. We measured FITC lifetime in the absence or presence of a FRET acceptor, and the results were fitted to two exponential curves. The values can also be represented in a pseudo-colored image, which ranges from blue (no FRET) to red (FRET). In the absence of an acceptor, FITC lifetime was ∼2300 ps and appears pseudo-colored blue. In the presence of LC or mutant LC, FITC lifetime was markedly shortened, and pixels with short lifetimes appear pseudo-colored red. Immunostaining of Bip, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, did not change FITC lifetime, indicating that the shortening was specific for LRP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm this interaction, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an LRP-specific antibody (1704) for immunoprecipitation of an endogenous LRP and the N-terminal PS1 antibody (PSN2) for the subsequent Western blotting. These experiments were performed in mouse embryonic fibroblast PS1-/- cells expressing wild-type human PS1 and as control in PS1-/- cells. In cells expressing PS1, but not in PS1-/- cells, complexes of N-terminal fragments of PS1 can be recovered by immunoprecipitation with an LRP antibody (Fig. 4). Importantly, we did not detect any interaction of full-length PS1 with LRP (Fig. 4), suggesting that LRP interacts primarily with the active heterodimeric form of PS1. We then performed a reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiment using PS1 N-terminal (X81) or PS1 C-terminal (4627) antibodies for immunoprecipitation of the endogenous PS1 from a normal rat brain and the LRP-CT antibody (11H4) for Western blotting. We found two LRP-positive bands representing LRP full-length β-chain and a C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4b) in a PS1-immunoprecipitated (right lane) sample, but not in a no-antibody immunoprecipitated (left lane) sample. We interpret this as an indication of a direct interaction between PS1 and LRP in mammalian cells. γ-Secretase Inhibitors Do Not Disrupt the Interaction between LRP/LC and Presenilin—Next, we asked whether the relative proximity between LRP/LC and PS1 can be modified by conventional γ-secretase inhibitors. H4 cells were transfected with LRP/LC and wild-type PS1 and treated with 1 μm DAPT, 1 μm WPE-III-31C, or a vehicle control. After 24 h, cells were immunostained with a FITC-labeled antibody against the C terminus of LRP and a Cy3-labeled antibody against the N terminus of PS1 for FLIM analysis. As expected, in cells treated with a vehicle control the FITC lifetime was shortened, indicating that both fluorophores are in close proximity (Table II). Treatment with either DAPT or WPE-III-31C did not significantly change FITC lifetime as compared with a vehicle treatment, suggesting that the availability of the active site is not critical for the LRP-PS1 interactions observed. This result is analogous to observations with APP-PS1 in which a stable docking site interaction can be detected when the active site is occupied (44Berezovska O. Ramdya P. Skoch J. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIγ-Secretase inhibitors do not disrupt the"
https://openalex.org/W1979218208,"We have recently identified a novel gene, hepaCAM, in liver that encodes a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In this study, we examined the characteristics of hepaCAM protein and the relationship between its structure and function, in particular its adhesive properties. The wild-type and the cytoplasmic domain-truncated mutants of hepaCAM were transfected into the human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells, and the physiological and biological properties were assessed. Biochemical analyses revealed that hepaCAM is an N-linked glycoprotein phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic domain and that it forms homodimers through cis-interaction on the cell surface. The subcellular localization of hepaCAM appears density-dependent; in well spread cells, hepaCAM is distributed to cell protrusions, whereas in confluent cells, hepaCAM is predominantly accumulated at the sites of cell-cell contacts on the cell membrane. In polarized cells, hepaCAM is recruited to the lateral and basal membranes, and lacking physical interaction, hepaCAM is shown to co-localize with E-cadherin at the lateral membrane. Cell adhesion and motility assays demonstrated that hepaCAM increased cell spreading on the matrices fibronectin and matrigel, delayed cell detachment, and enhanced wound healing. Furthermore, when the cytoplasmic domain was deleted, hepaCAM mutants did not affect cell surface localization and dimer formation. Cell-matrix adhesion, however, was less significantly increased, and cell motility was almost unchanged when compared with the effect of the wild-type hepaCAM. Taken together, the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM is essential to its function on cell-matrix interaction and cell motility.

Taken together, the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM is essential to its function on cell-matrix interaction and cell motility. Cell adhesion is a dynamic process essential for the normal development and maintenance of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are mediated by a large and complex number of cell adhesion molecules expressed on the cell surface that interact with each other in a spatially and temporally regulated manner. According to their structural and functional features, cell adhesion molecules are generally classified into at least four major families: the cadherins, integrins, selectins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (1Edelman G.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 81-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apart from linking cells to each other or to components of the extracellular matrix, an exciting concept that has emerged from recent cell biological research is that cell adhesion molecules function also as receptors critical in modulating signal transduction (6Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions are vital for the regulation of cellular adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation. We have recently reported the identification of a novel gene in liver, designated as hepaCAM (GenBank™ AY047587), which was differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Located on human chromosome 11q24 and spanning 7 exons, hepaCAM encodes a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The predicted protein of 416 amino acids displays a typical structure of Ig-like adhesion molecules, including two extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. In addition, when exogenously expressed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, hepaCAM accelerates cell spreading and increases cell motility (7Moh M.C. Lee L.H. Shen S. J. Hepatol. 2005; 42: 833-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanism of hepaCAM in mediating cell-matrix interaction is unknown. However, transfection studies with mutant and chimeric constructs of other adhesion molecules have suggested that the structural features of adhesion molecules play important roles in mediating their physiological and biological roles. Structure and function study of E-cadherin reveals that the formation of cis-dimer is fundamental for cell adhesion, and inhibition of cis-dimer formation is correlated with the lack of cell-cell interaction (8Takeda H. Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Hirohashi S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For CEACAM1, it has been proposed that both the first extracellular Ig domain and cytoplasmic domain are required for its adhesion function (9Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millirons P. Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, defining the molecular organization of hepaCAM may help to elucidate the functional roles of hepaCAM. In this study, we aimed to characterize the physiological and biological properties of hepaCAM and to investigate the importance of the cytoplasmic domain on hepaCAM functions in the hepaCAM-deficient MCF7 cells. We showed that hepaCAM is a phosphorylated glycoprotein that forms cis-homodimers on the cell surface and mediates cell-matrix interaction. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain is required for cell-matrix modulation but dispensable in subcellular localization and surface dimerization. Plasmid Construction—The complete coding sequence of hepaCAM and its mutants with truncated cytoplasmic domain were generated by PCR amplification. The cDNAs of hepaCAM residues 1-416 (wild-type), residues 1-320, or residues 1-263 were cloned into pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or pcDNA6/V5-His vector (Invitrogen), at the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites. For polyclonal antibody generation, hepaCAM (residues 260-416) was cloned into the BglII/SalI restriction sites of the pQE40 vector (Qiagen). The sequences of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—The MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was maintained in the recommended conditions. Transfections of MCF7 cells were carried out using the reagent Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected for 4 weeks, either in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 or 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and cloned. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer to extract the total cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubating the precleared cell lysate with the appropriate mouse monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-rec-protein G (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto membrane, and detected by either rabbit anti-hepaCAM polyclonal antiserum, mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or mouse anti-E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Cell lysate was incubated in dephosphorylation buffer for 10 min at 30 °C. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) was added and incubated for a further 15 min prior to Western analysis. N-Linked Glycosylation Analysis—For inhibiting N-linked glycosylation, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with hepaCAM-GFP and subsequently exposed to tunicamycin (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 24 h before lysis. For enzymatic digestion of N-linked oligosaccharides, the cell lysate of MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 was treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were then subjected to Western analysis. Chemical Cross-linking—A monolayer or a single suspension of cells was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm BS3 1The abbreviations used are: BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; DTSSP, 3,3′-dithiobis (sulphosuccinimidyl propionate); GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. (Pierce) or DTSSP (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min. Single cell suspension was assured by microscopic observation before and after chemical cross-linking reaction. DTSSP-cross-linked proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer without 50 mm dithiothreitol, unless indicated. Cell lysate was prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetamide (10Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol.

Immunocytochemistry—Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Nonspecific sites were blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein expression of V5-tagged hepaCAM was detected using mouse anti-V5 antibody, biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and subsequently streptavidin-fluorescein. For co-localization experiments, cells were grown to confluence on 0.4-μm Transwell filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Protein expression of E-cadherin was detected using mouse anti-E-cadherin antibody, biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and subsequently avidin-TRITC conjugate (Sigma). Fluorescence was visualized by fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) or confocal microscope LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss) with sectioning performed at 0.5 μm. Cell Spreading—Cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with 40 μg of matrigel basement membrane matrix (Clontech) or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated under standard culture conditions. Cell morphology was observed by microscopy. Unspread cells were defined as round cells, whereas spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes (11Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells demonstrating spread morphology was quantified in 10 randomly selected fields. Cell Detachment—A confluent monolayer of cells was detached in 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. Cell detachment was evaluated under the inverted microscope at 5 and 15 min of incubation. Concurrently, the dissociated cells were harvested and counted in 10 randomly selected fields. Wound-healing Assay—A confluent monolayer of cells was wounded with a sterile plastic 200-μl micropipette tip. The wound was observed microscopically at 24 and 48 h. The percentage of wound filling was calculated by measuring the remaining gap space on the pictures. Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis—The protein sequence of hepaCAM was analyzed using the NetPhos version 2.0 and Prosite programs. Nonparametric analysis of variance was performed to compare the difference among more than two means. Software InStat version 3.0 (GraphPad) was employed, and p < 0.01 was considered significant. Wild-type and COOH-terminal Mutants of hepaCAM—The wild-type hepaCAM encodes a transmembrane Ig-like adhesion molecule of 416 amino acids. To assess the importance of hepaCAM cytoplasmic domain in its physiological and biological functions, we constructed two deletion mutants of hepaCAM. hCAM_mt1, lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail, was constructed by truncating residues 264-416 of hepaCAM. hCAM_mt2 was constructed by deleting residues 321-416 of hepaCAM to obtain a partial cleavage of the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). Wild-type hepaCAM, hCAM_mt1, and hCAM_mt2 were fused in-frame at the NH2-terminal of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene of the expression vector pEGFP-N2, and the resulting plasmids were named hepaCAM-GFP, hCAM_mt1-GFP, and hCAM_mt2-GFP, respectively. In addition, wild-type hepaCAM and hCAM_mt1 were inserted at the NH2-terminal of the V5 tag of the pcDNA6/V5-His vector and designated hepaCAM-V5 and hCAM_mt1-V5, respectively. The constructs, as well as the empty vectors, were transfected into MCF7 cells, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-V5 antibodies accordingly (Fig. 1, B and C). Subsequently, MCF7 cells stably expressing pEGFP-N2 vector (MCF7/pEGFPN2), hepaCAM-GFP (MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP), hCAM_mt1-GFP (MCF7/hCAM_mt1-GFP), hCAM_mt2-GFP (MCF7/hCAM_mt2-GFP), pcDNA6 vector (MCF7/pcDNA6), hepaCAM-V5 (MCF7/hepaCAM-V5) and hCAM_mt1-V5 (MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5) were generated and cloned. Phosphorylation of the hepaCAM Cytoplasmic Domain—We generated a polyclonal antiserum that recognizes the hepaCAM cytoplasmic domain but in its dephosphorylated form. The recombinant His bacterial fusion protein used for immunization contained residues 260-416 of hepaCAM. Western analysis showed that the resulting antiserum could specifically detect the bacterial fusion protein, otherwise undetectable by the pre-immune serum. However, when the antiserum was tested on the cell lysate of MCF7/hepaCAM-V5, no specific band was observed (data not shown). We suspected that the antiserum was unable to recognize the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM because of the presence of post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation. Evaluation of the region selected for antibody generation by the NetPhos version 2.0 server predicted 28 potential serine-, threonine-, or tyrosine-phosphorylated residues scattered along the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM protein, with 20 of them giving a potential phosphorylation >0.5 (Fig. 2A). To verify that the hepaCAM cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated, we dephosphorylated cell lysates of C3A cells expressing endogenous hepaCAM and MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells expressing exogenous hepaCAM with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The untreated cell lysates were included as controls. Indeed, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated endogenous and exogenous hepaCAM were detected by the rabbit antiserum (Fig. 2B), confirming that the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM is phosphorylated. N-Linked Glycosylation of hepaCAM—Sequence analysis of hepaCAM predicted six N-linked glycosylation sites on its extracellular domain (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether hepaCAM was glycosylated, the MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cell lysate was enzymatically digested with peptide N-glycosidase F to release putative N-linked oligosaccharides. An untreated sample was included as the control. The molecular mass of hepaCAM-GFP, shown by Western analysis to be ∼100 kDa, was shifted to ∼75 kDa after deglycosylation. Consistently, when MCF7 cells transfected with hepaCAM-GFP were treated with tunicamycin (an antibiotic that inhibits N-linked glycosylation) at different doses for 24 h, a band at ∼75 kDa was also observed (Fig. 3B). The results verified that hepaCAM is a glycoprotein. By subtracting the molecular mass of GFP, i.e. 27 kDa, the deglycosylated form of hepaCAM is ∼48 kDa. Dimerization of hepaCAM and Mutant on Plasma Membrane—We evaluated the pre-existing forms of hepaCAM on cell membrane by incubating a monolayer of MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cells with BS3, a noncleavable membrane-impermeable cross-linker. The cell lysate was prepared in the presence of iodoacetamide to inhibit the formation of nonspecific disulfide bonds (10Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An untreated sample was included as the control. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP. In the presence of BS3, a band of ∼200 kDa appeared, which seemed to represent the dimerized form of hepaCAM-GFP, accompanied with the disappearance of the hepaCAM monomers. Similarly, treatment of MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells with BS3 resulted in a decrease of the ∼75-kDa monomeric form of hepaCAM and an accumulation of the higher molecular weight species at ∼150 kDa, although no distinct band was noted (Fig. 4A). It is possible that the anti-V5 antibody did not recognize the higher molecular weight species as efficiently as monomers. To examine whether hepaCAM forms a homodimer on the cell surface, MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cells were treated with DTSSP, a reducible membrane-impermeable cross-linker. In the absence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, a significant increase in the 200-kDa species was observed. However, when dithiothreitol was added into the sample buffer, the higher molecular mass was reduced to the monomeric form to a level closely comparable with that of the untreated cells (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we co-expressed hepaCAM-GFP and hepaCAM-V5 in MCF7 cells, immunoprecipitated the cell lysate with anti-GFP antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-V5 or anti-GFP. The result revealed co-immunoprecipitation of hepaCAM-GFP with hepaCAM-V5 (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that hepaCAM molecules dimerized through homophilic interaction. To examine whether tailless hepaCAM proteins form dimers, MCF7/hCAM_mt1-GFP cells were treated with BS3 and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4D). The monomeric form of hCAM_mt1-GFP was diminished and replaced with its dimeric form at ∼125 kDa in the BS3-treated sample. Interestingly, in the untreated sample of hepaCAM-GFP and hCAM_mt1-GFP, protein species that seemed to represent the dimeric form of the proteins were observed. This phenomenon could be due to covalent bonding between the dimers of hepaCAM-GFP or hCAM_mt1-GFP. To determine whether hepaCAM-GFP forms cis- or trans-dimers on the cell surface, both adherent monolayer and single cell suspension of MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cells were treated with BS3 (Fig. 4E). The extent of dimerization was comparable in both adherent and suspension cells, indicating that hepaCAM homodimerization occurs predominantly through cis-interactions rather than trans-interactions within the plane of the membrane of individual cells. Subcellular Localization of hepaCAM and Mutants in MCF7 Cells—We explored the subcellular distribution of wild-type hepaCAM in MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cells at low and at high cell densities by fluorescence and inverted microscopy (Fig. 5A). When cells were well spread, hepaCAM protein was localized to punctuate structures in the perinuclear membrane, cytoplasm, and at the tip of the cell surface protrusions, which were about to make contact with adjacent cell surfaces, forming zipper-like structures. Once the cells became confluent, the protein was localized at a lesser extent in the perinuclear membrane and cytoplasm and predominantly on the plasma membrane, particularly in the areas of cell-cell contacts. The results suggest that the subcellular localization of hepaCAM is cell density-dependent. We also examined the effect of hepaCAM cytoplasmic domain in its plasma membrane localization. hCAM_mt1-GFP and hCAM_mt2-GFP were both recruited to the plasma membrane of MCF7 cells (Fig. 5B). Similarly, MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 and MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells immunostained with anti-V5 showed that hepaCAM and its mutant were predominantly expressed on cell membranes (Fig. 5C). The results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain is dispensable for membrane localization. Co-localization of hepaCAM with E-cadherin—The distribution of hepaCAM was further examined in confluent polarized MCF7/hepaCAM-GFP cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 6A). The cells were also stained for E-cadherin, which localizes in the lateral cell surface, to compare its localization with that of hepaCAM. In the X-Y sections, hepaCAM-GFP was distributed to honeycomb-like structures at cell-cell boundaries, which significantly co-localized with E-cadherin. In the X-Z vertical cross-section, the distribution of E-cadherin along the entire lateral cell surface coincided with hepaCAM-GFP. Moreover, hepaCAM was detected at the basal membrane that was in contact with the Transwell membrane. Because hepaCAM and E-cadherin appeared to co-localize, we investigated whether there were any physical interactions between them by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6B). Cell lysate prepared from MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 was precipitated with the anti-V5 antibody and subjected to Western blotting using the anti-E-cadherin or anti-V5 antibodies. MCF7/pcDNA6 cell lysate was included in the experiment as the control. No co-immunoprecipitation was observed, suggesting that E-cadherin and hepaCAM do not physically interact. Cell-Matrix Interaction by hepaCAM and Mutant—We evaluated the adhesive properties of V5-tagged hepaCAM and mutant constructs on the MCF7 cells through cell aggregation, cell adhesion, and detachment assays. No clear change in cell aggregation was observed among MCF7/pcDNA6, MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5, and MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells (data not shown), but hepaCAM was capable of modulating cell-matrix adhesion significantly. Fig. 7 shows that ∼60 and 79% of the MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells exhibited spread morphology on fibronectin at 30 min and 2 h of incubation, respectively, in contrast to 40.8 and 58.2% of the MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells and 7.3 and 18% of MCF7/pcDNA6 cells (p < 0.001). Similarly on matrigel, MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells showed the fastest spreading, followed by MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells, and then MCF7/pcDNA6 cells (p < 0.001). In the cell detachment assay (Fig. 8), MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells detached 18.9 and 21.6 times slower than MCF7/pcDNA6 cells at 5 and 15 min, respectively. MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells, on the other hand, detached ∼4 and 2.2 times slower than MCF7/pcDNA6 cells at time points 5 min and 15 min (p < 0.001). The results showed that, in addition to its extracellular and transmembrane domains, hepaCAM needs its cytoplasmic domain to mediate strong cell-matrix adhesion.Fig. 8Cell detachment assay. MCF7/pcDNA6 (left panels), MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 (middle panels), and MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 (right panels) cells were detached in 1 mm EDTA for 5 min or 15 min. The microscopic photos were taken under ×200 and ×400 magnifications. At 5 min or 15 min after incubation, the total number of detached cells was counted in ten randomly selected fields, and the percentage of cell detachment was then computed. The data represent means ± S.D. (n = 6), **, p < 0.001 as assessed by analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell Motility by hepaCAM and Mutant—Cell motility of hepaCAM and mutant was assessed by matrigel invasion and wound-healing assays. Barely any MCF7 cells expressing pcDNA6, hCAM_mt1, and hepaCAM migrated through the 8-μm Transwell membrane (data not shown). This observation could be explained by the poorly invasive nature of MCF7 cells. Moreover, MCF7/hepaCAM cells were enlarged, therefore retarding migration. However, in the wound-healing assay (Fig. 9), we demonstrated that, after 24 h of incubation, MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells filled 59.3% of the scratched area (p < 0.01), compared with 36.3% by MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells (p > 0.05) and 33.1% by MCF7/pcDNA6 cells. After 48 h, MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells closed 83.7% of the wound (p < 0.01), compared with 55.2% by MCF7/hCAM_mt1-V5 cells (p > 0.05) and 49.5% by MCF7/pcDNA6 cells. Hence, the cytoplasmic domain is important for cell motility modulated by hepaCAM. In our previous work, we identified a novel Ig-like molecule, hepaCAM, which exhibits typical structural characteristics of adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (7Moh M.C. Lee L.H. Shen S. J. Hepatol. 2005; 42: 833-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated physiological and biological characteristics of hepaCAM and the relationship between its structure and function, particularly with respect to the cytoplasmic domain. Sequence analysis revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of hepaCAM contains a proline-rich region that provides putative binding sites for SH3 domains and potential phosphorylation sites of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Experimentally, we showed that the cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated, suggesting an important role of the hepaCAM cytoplasmic domain in signaling cascades controlling cellular adhesion, motility, morphology, and all processes depending on the cytoskeleton. To evaluate the significance of the cytoplasmic domain, we transfected wild-type and cytoplasmic domain-truncated constructs of hepaCAM into MCF7 cells and analyzed their effects on hepaCAM functions. Biochemical analysis revealed that hepaCAM is a glycosylated protein and forms a cis-homodimer on the cell surface. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not interfere with dimer formation, suggesting that dimerization may be stabilized by the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains but not the cytoplasmic domain. Notably, chemical cross-linking of hepaCAM or its mutated protein both showed the presence of high molecular weight proteins, indicating that hepaCAM may form large complexes with other endogenously expressed cellular proteins through its extracellular and/or transmembrane domains. Alternatively, it may represent higher order homo-oliomers of hepaCAM or its mutant. It is interesting to observe the seemingly dimeric form of hepaCAM and its mutant in their respective un-cross-linked samples. Although the mechanism resulting in such interaction is unknown to us, Hunter et al. (5Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Obrink B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and others (12Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) have observed a similar phenomenon in C-CAM and raise the possibility that C-CAM dimers become covalently linked, perhaps through the action of transglutaminase, an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamyl-ϵ-lysine bonds in a restricted number of cellular proteins. Subcellular localization of hepaCAM in nonpolarized MCF7 cells showed that hepaCAM molecules were recruited to the cytoplasmic membranes at sites of cell-cell attachment. In polarized cells, hepaCAM was preferentially expressed in the lateral and basal membranes. Co-localization analysis demonstrated that hepaCAM co-localized laterally with E-cadherin, but no physical interaction between the two molecules was detected. We also showed that partial truncation and complete deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not alter the plasma membrane localization. It has been reported that the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain regulates its lateral localization. Differing in their cytoplasmic domains, isoform CEACAM1-S distribution is exclusively apical, whereas isoform CEACAM1-L occurs both in apical and lateral cell surfaces (13Sundberg U. Beauchemin N. Obrink B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1091-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, whether the loss of cytoplasmic domain affects the lateral and basal localization of hepaCAM remains to be determined. Functionally, hepaCAM is capable of modulating cell-matrix interaction. Cell adhesion to the substratum plays a crucial role in cell migration, which is a key aspect of many normal and abnormal biological processes, including embryonic development, immunity, wound healing, and metastasis of tumor cells (14Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of hepaCAM on the basal membrane of cells, in addition to the spread morphology of MCF7/hepaCAM-V5 cells, hinted at possible trans-interaction between hepaCAM and the substrate. Evidently, cell spreading, cell detachment, and wound-healing assays revealed increased cell-substrate affinity and cell motility mediated by hepaCAM. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain reduced, but did not completely abrogate, cell-matrix adhesion mediated by the wild-type hepaCAM, implicating that, to a considerable extent, the extracellular and transmembrane domains are able to initiate adhesion. However, the rate of wound healing of cells expressing mutant hepaCAM was close to the level of the control cells, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain is essential for mediating wound recovery. The data implies that cell-matrix adhesion and cell motility are controlled separately, and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain may play a pivotal role in the regulation. Indeed, phosphorylation of CD44 was shown to regulate melanoma cell and fibroblast migration on, but not attachment to, a hyaluronan substratum (16Peck D. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 884-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been proposed for the cadherins (8Takeda H. Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Hirohashi S. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that cis-dimerization will lead to strengthened cell adhesion, and cis-homodimer formation of ICAM-1 enhances its binding to a leukocyte β2-integrin (20Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of hepaCAM post-translational modification and dimerization in regulating cell-matrix interaction is still under investigation. In conclusion, we have shown that hepaCAM is a phosphorylated glycoprotein, forms cis-homodimers on the cell surface, and modulates cell-matrix interaction. The cytoplasmic domain, although unessential for cell surface localization and dimerization, is required to maintain a complete functional form of hepaCAM as a modulator of cell-matrix interaction.

The product of the COX reaction is the endoperoxide, PGH2, which is then further metabolized to the terminal PGs through the action of various synthase enzymes. Two isoforms of COX have been identified and characterized (5Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). The isoforms differ considerably with regard to transcriptional regulation in that COX-1 is usually expressed constitutively, whereas COX-2 is induced in response to a variety of inflammatory and proliferative stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. As a consequence of these varied expression patterns, COX-1 is believed to be primarily responsible for “housekeeping” functions such as gastric cytoprotection and regulation of platelet aggregation. In contrast, COX-2 is thought to be involved in the inflammatory response, pyrexia, and in the regulation of cellular proliferation (6Xie W.L. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L.

However, subtle differences in the active sites have allowed the development of selective inhibitors for each isoform (18Chen W. Pawelek T.R. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

These same differences allow COX-2 to use neutral ester and amide derivatives of AA as substrates more effectively compared with COX-1 (23Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9041-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among the neutral derivatives of AA that can serve as selective COX-2 substrates are the endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and arachidonylethanolamide (anandamide), and the lipoamino acid, N-arachidonylglycine (23Yu M.

PGH2 glyceryl ester and PGH2 ethanolamide can be further metabolized by all of the terminal synthases except thromboxane synthase (27Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Morrow J.D. Wang L.H. Ma Y.H. Weinander R.

Thus, a wide variety of potential PG glyceryl esters (PG-Gs) and ethanolamides (PG-EAs) are biochemically possible. A number of reports have demonstrated biological activities for PGE2-G, PGE2-EA, and PGF2α-EA (28Nirodi C.S. Crews B.C. Kozak K.R. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 757-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the in vivo production of PG-EAs in mice injected with anandamide; however, no PG-EAs were detected in animals in the absence of exogenous substrate. Because 2-AG is usually present at higher concentrations than anandamide in vivo, it is anticipated that PG-Gs should be more abundant that PG-EAs. However, detecting PG-Gs, especially in rodent models, will likely be challenging because of rapid hydrolysis by plasma esterases (32Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Ray J.L. Tai H.H. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36993-36998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consequently, attention has been focused on production by intact cells in culture. Thus, RAW264.7 cells have been shown to produce PG-Gs in response to exogenous 2-AG or from endogenous 2-AG in response to an ionomycin stimulus (24Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, there has been no demonstration of PG-G or PG-EA production by primary cells using endogenous substrate in response to a physiological stimulus. Therefore, to develop a better understanding of the potential biological role of PG-Gs, we have undertaken a study of PG-G formation by murine primary resident peritoneal macrophages (RPMs) in response to the phagocytosis of zymosan. Our results demonstrate that phagocytizing RPMs produce both PGE2-G and PGI2-G concomitantly with the analogous PGs. Although the levels of PG-Gs produced were low relative to those of PGs, the absence of significant PG-G hydrolytic activity allowed PGE2-G to accumulate in RPM culture medium to levels shown to induce Ca2+ mobilization in RAW264.7 cells in culture (28Nirodi C.S.

RPM Cultures—Female CD-1 mice (25–30 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The mice were killed with carbon dioxide, and the peritoneal cavities were lavaged with a total of 3 ml of ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (33Cohn Z.A. Benson B. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Peritoneal cells were collected by centrifugation of lavage fluid and resuspended at a concentration of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Summit Biotechnologies, Fort Collins, CO) plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) (α-MEM/FCS). The cell suspension was plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes at 2 ml/dish or onto 60-mm dishes at 6 ml/dish and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plates four times with PBS, and the cultures were then incubated overnight in fresh α-MEM/FCS. The mean protein content of RPM cultures (35-mm dish) was 100 ± 10 μg/dish ((8.2 ± 0.8) × 105 cells/dish). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Zymosan Treatment of RPM Cultures—Cultures of RPMs were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C and then overlaid with 2 ml of fresh α-MEM/FCS with or without the desired concentration of LPS (E. coli 011:B4; Calbiochem). Cells were incubated for the desired time periods, washed twice again with PBS, and overlaid with 2 ml of serum-free α-MEM. Unopsonized zymosan A (Sigma) was prepared as described by Bonney et al. (34Bonney R.J. Wightman P.D. Davies P. Sadowski S.J. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Humes J.L. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and suspended at 2–24 mg/ml in PBS. Aliquots (10 μl) were added directly to the macrophage culture medium as desired, and cells were incubated as indicated for individual experiments. For some experiments, cells were incubated with or without LPS, washed twice with PBS, and overlaid with α-MEM containing 0, 50, 100, or 200 nm SC236 (Calbiochem) or 0, 40, 80, or 120 μm RHC80267 (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). After a 30-min incubation, zymosan was added as described above. SC236 and RHC80267 were prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide diluted as appropriate and added to the culture medium to give a constant concentration of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide in all samples. Metabolism of Exogenous AA, 2-AG, and PGE2-G by RPM Cultures— RPM cultures were prepared and incubated in the presence or absence of LPS as described above. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and overlaid with 1 ml of serum-free α-MEM containing 0, 50, 100, or 200 nm SC236. Following a 30-min incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of α-MEM containing the same concentration of SC236 and 1 μm either AA or 2-AG (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were incubated for 30 min. For addition to the culture medium, AA and 2-AG were prepared as 1 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the medium so that the total dimethyl sulfoxide concentration contributed by addition of lipids and SC236 was 0.2% for all samples. Alternatively, cells preincubated with or without LPS were washed with PBS and overlaid with 1 ml of serum-free α-MEM containing 50 nm or 1 μm PGE2-G (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.) added as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (total final concentration of 0.1%). In some cases, zymosan (160 μg/dish) was also added at the time of PGE2-G addition. Cells were incubated for the desired time periods. Analysis of PGs and PG-Gs in RPM Culture Medium—Following incubation with the desired stimuli or substrates, the medium was removed from RPM cultures, placed on ice, and combined with 20 μl of methanol containing 5 pmol each of PGE2-G-d5 and 6-keto-PGF1α-G-d5 (synthesized as described (24Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar)) plus 50 pmol each of PGE2-d4 and 6-keto-PGF1α-d4 (both from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.), which served as internal standards. Samples were stored at –20 °C prior to solid-phase extraction and analysis by selected reaction monitoring of the ammoniated ions by liquid chromatography-positive ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described (35Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Cellular AA and Total AG—For the measurement of free AA and total AG (1(3)-AG and 2-AG), the medium was removed from the cell cultures, and the cells were scraped twice into a total volume of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. The resulting cell lysate was combined with 1 ml of ice-cold acetonitrile containing 10 ng of 2-AG-d8 and 100 ng of AA-d8 (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.) and stored at –20 °C for analysis. Samples were extracted with 12 ml of a solution of ethyl acetate/hexane (90:10), and the organic extracts were evaporated to dryness under a stream of argon. The dried organic extracts were reconstituted in 1 ml of ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid (94.9:5:0.1, v/v/v), and each was applied to a dry silica solid-phase extraction column (Sep-Pak Vac, 100 mg; Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The columns were eluted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid (94.9:5:0.1, v/v/v). 4 ml of eluate was collected, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 100 μl of acetonitrile, and analyzed for total AG and AA by silver ion coordination LC-MS/MS as described (36Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In typical samples, both 2-AG and 1(3)-AG were detected. In most cases, 2-AG was the predominant isomer, and the relative ratio of 2-AG to 1(3)-AG was similar to that in the internal standard, which was added as 100% 2-AG-d8 to the samples. Because nonspecific acyl migration of 2-AG to a mixture of 2-AG and 1(3)-AG occurred during sample workup, it was not possible to determine exactly how much of each isomer was present in the cells originally, so the two isomers were quantified together, and data are reported as total AG. Immunoblotting for COX-2 Protein Expression—For the determination of COX-2 expression, RPM cultures were incubated with the desired stimuli; the medium was removed; and the cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell monolayers were scraped into 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl-)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (all components from Sigma)). Cell lysates were allowed to stand for 30 min on ice with occasional Vortex mixing, and particulate material was then removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Samples were stored at –80 °C until analyses could be completed. The protein concentrations of 20-μl aliquots of macrophage cell lysates were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Macrophage lysate samples containing 15 μg of protein were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described (12Rouzer C.A. Kingsley P.J. Wang H. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34256-34268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with the exception that the rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against murine COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.) was used at a dilution of 1:5,000 instead of 1:30,000. Metabolism of 2-AG and PGE2-G by RPM Cell Lysates—RPMs were isolated and plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Following washing and overnight incubations, cells were treated for 6 h with or without 100 ng/ml LPS as described above, washed twice with PBS, and scraped into 100 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) (total volume of 3 ml/dish). The resulting cell suspensions from four dishes were combined and homogenized by sonication using a VirSonic cell disrupter (VirTis, Gardiner, NY) equipped with a microtip at power setting 35 for four 15-s bursts. The cell lysates were warmed for 5 min at 37 °C, and 2-AG was added as a stock solution of 1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide to give a final concentration of 1 μm. The lysates were incubated for the desired time periods, and 0.5-ml aliquots were removed and combined with either 1 ml of acetonitrile containing 10 ng of 2-AG-d8 and 100 ng of AA-d8 or 1 ml of ethanol containing 5 pmol each of PGE2-G-d5 and 6-keto-PGF1α-G-d5 plus 50 pmol each of PGE2-d4 and 6-keto-PGF1α-d4. Following addition of 0.5 ml of PBS, the samples were acidified with 10 μl of acetic acid and extracted twice with 1 ml of chloroform. The extracts were evaporated to dryness, and the residues were subjected to direct LC-MS/MS analysis for PG and PG-G content or purified by silica solid-phase extraction, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis for total AG and AA content as described above. Alternatively, lysates were warmed to 37 °C, and PGE2-G was added as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide to give a final concentration of either 50 nm or 1 μm PGE2-G and 0.1% Me2SO. The lysates were incubated as described above, and aliquots of 0.5 ml (for samples containing 50 nm PGE2-G) or 0.2 ml (for samples containing 1 μm PGE2-G) were removed and combined with 1 ml of ethanol containing 5 pmol of PGE2-G-d5 and 50 pmol of PGE2-d4. PBS was added to each sample to bring the aqueous volume to 1 ml, and the samples were then acidified with acetic acid and extracted with chloroform as described above for analysis by LC-MS/MS for PGE2-G and PGE2 content. Data Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, with the minimal criterion for significance being p < 0.05. Synthesis of PG-Gs from Endogenous Substrate by RPMs during Zymosan Phagocytosis—2-AG is a selective COX-2 substrate in vitro, so it was reasonable to expect that PG-G synthesis might occur during the response to stimuli such as LPS that induce de novo COX-2 expression. We first analyzed medium from RPMs incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS for periods of up to 24 h in the presence or absence of serum. Trace amounts of PG-Gs were detected in the medium of LPS-treated cells, but they were too low to be reliably quantified. Prior studies had demonstrated PG-G synthesis by RAW264.7 cells treated with ionomycin (24Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for an intracellular Ca2+ signal. Therefore, we chose unopsonized zymosan as a potential stimulus because it evokes a sharp increase in intracellular Ca2+ and a robust PG synthesizing response in RPMs (34Bonney R.J. Wightman P.D.

Based on the assumption that high levels of COX-2 expression should favor PG-G formation, we pretreated RPMs with LPS for 6 h to induce maximal COX-2 protein levels (12Rouzer C.A. Kingsley P.J. Wang H. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34256-34268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and then challenged them with zymosan. We used 160 μg of zymosan/35-mm culture dish and a 2-h incubation period because these conditions were previously shown to maximize PG synthesis by RPM cultures of the size and cellular density used here (37Scott W.A. Zrike J.M. Hamill A.L. Kempe J. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS analysis of the culture medium from LPS-pretreated RPMs that were incubated for 2 h in the absence of zymosan showed no evidence of PG-G formation (Fig. 1A). However, the medium from zymosan-stimulated cells clearly contained detectable quantities of PGE2-G and 6-keto-PGF1α-G (the stable hydrolysis product of PGI2-G) (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that zymosan induced PG-G as well as PG synthesis. PG-Gs were not detected in RPM cell lysates, suggesting that, like PGs, PG-Gs are primarily secreted from the cell. No PG-EAs were detected in RPM culture medium or cells. However, this finding was not surprising because intracellular anandamide levels are so much lower than 2-AG levels that the quantities of PG-EAs likely to be produced would be below the detection limit of our assay. To determine optimal conditions for PG-G formation, RPM cultures were preincubated for varying time periods with LPS (100 ng/ml) and then challenged for 2 h with zymosan. PG-G levels in the culture medium were quantified by LC-MS/MS using synthetic deuterated internal standards. As shown in Fig. 2A, maximal levels of PG-G formation were reached after 4–6 h of LPS pretreatment. The relative proportion of PGE2-G also increased from 45 to 90% during 0–24 h of incubation with LPS (data not shown). The maximal synthesis of PG-G production correlated with maximal COX-2 protein expression as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2, B and C). The increase in the relative proportion of PGE2-G correlated with the induction of microsomal PGE synthase-1 by LPS (12Rouzer C.A. Kingsley P.J. Wang H. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34256-34268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). LPS concentrations from 20 to 500 ng/ml effected the same qualitative and quantitative results, indicating that RPMs respond to very low LPS concentrations with COX-2 and microsomal PGE synthase-1 expression. When RPMs were pretreated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS and then challenged with varying quantities of zymosan (20–240 μg/dish), maximal PG-G synthesis occurred with zymosan at ≥80 μg/dish. Collectively, these results confirmed that maximal PG-G formation resulted from pretreatment of RPMs for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS, followed by stimulation with zymosan at 160 μg/dish. These conditions were used for further experiments. RPMs not pretreated with LPS also produced significant quantities of PG-Gs (0-h sample in Fig. 2). These cells contained levels of COX-2 protein that were much higher than those observed in RPMs that had not been exposed to LPS or zymosan (in which COX-2 was nearly undetectable). These results suggest that zymosan induced COX-2 expression, consistent with prior reports (41Barbieri S.S. Cavalca V. Eligini S. Brambilla M. Caiani A. Tremoli E. Colli S. Free Radic. Biol.

Time Course of PG-G Formation in Zymosan-stimulated RPMs—To better characterize PG-G formation by zymosan-stimulated RPMs, the time course of the process was monitored concomitantly with that of PG formation. RPMs were preincubated for 6 h in the absence (control RPMs) or presence (LPS-pretreated RPMs) of LPS and then exposed to zymosan for varying periods of time. The culture medium was analyzed for PG-G and PG formation, and the cells were analyzed for substrate levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, zymosan phagocytosis caused an increase in cell-associated total AG (2-AG plus 1(3)AG) that was detectable as early as 5 min and statistically significant (p < 0.05) at 20 min. Levels reached a maximum at 60 min and then remained rea"

https://openalex.org/W2093598708,"Engagement of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Toll-like receptors triggers mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and activation of transcription factors such as NFκB and AP-1. Recent studies have identified members of the Pellino protein family as novel mediators in mediating activation of these pathways. However, no evidence has been presented to date to suggest a role for the Pellino proteins in activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. We demonstrate herein that Pellino3 is a strong activator of p38 MAPK. RNA interference was used to reveal a physiological role for Pellino3 in the IL-1 pathway leading to activation of p38 MAPK. A series of N-terminal truncation and point mutants of Pellino3 were generated and tested for their ability to activate p38 MAPK in an effort to map sites of protein interaction important for p38 MAPK activation. In this way we show that the binding of Pellino3 to IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 coincides with its ability to promote p38 MAPK activation. TRAF-6 and transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1 are shown to act as downstream mediators of the activation of p38 MAPK by Pellino3. Finally we confirm the functional consequences of the activation of p38 MAPK by Pellino3 by demonstrating that Pellino3 promotes translocation of the p38 substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase2, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and activates the transcription factor CREB in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Our study not only identifies Pellino3 as a novel upstream regulator of the p38 MAPK pathway but also probes the mechanistic basis underlying the ability of Pellino3 to promote activation of this pathway.

However, no evidence has been presented to date to suggest a role for the Pellino proteins in activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. We demonstrate herein that Pellino3 is a strong activator of p38 MAPK. RNA interference was used to reveal a physiological role for Pellino3 in the IL-1 pathway leading to activation of p38 MAPK. A series of N-terminal truncation and point mutants of Pellino3 were generated and tested for their ability to activate p38 MAPK in an effort to map sites of protein interaction important for p38 MAPK activation. In this way we show that the binding of Pellino3 to IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 coincides with its ability to promote p38 MAPK activation. TRAF-6 and transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1 are shown to act as downstream mediators of the activation of p38 MAPK by Pellino3. Finally we confirm the functional consequences of the activation of p38 MAPK by Pellino3 by demonstrating that Pellino3 promotes translocation of the p38 substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase2, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and activates the transcription factor CREB in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Our study not only identifies Pellino3 as a novel upstream regulator of the p38 MAPK pathway but also probes the mechanistic basis underlying the ability of Pellino3 to promote activation of this pathway.

The IRAK-Myd88 association triggers hyperphosphorylation of IRAK leading to its dissociation from Myd88 and its interaction with the downstream adaptor tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) (21Burns K.

This results in activation of transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1 (TAK-1) leading to stimulation of IκB kinases and ultimately activation of NFκB (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In addition to NFκB activation, IL-1R1 and TLRs can also initiate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades and activate multiple transcription factors. Thus IL-1 and LPS induce phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK (23Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 24Rouse J. Cohen P.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which the MAPKs are activated by IL-1R1 and TLRs are incompletely understood, several upstream regulators have been identified, including those that mediate activation of NFκB. More specifically, TAK-1/TAB1 can activate the MAPK kinases MKK3/6 and MKK4, which in turn activate p38 and JNK, respectively (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Members of the novel Pellino protein family have recently emerged as mediators in transducing signals in the IL-1R/TLR pathways. Pellino was first identified in Drosophila by virtue of its association with Pelle, the Drosophila homologue of IRAK (28Grosshans J. Schnorrer F. Nusslein-Volhard C. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Three mammalian homologues have since been identified (29Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J.

Mammalian Pellino1 interacts with IRAK, IRAK4, TRAF-6, and TAK-1 and is required for activation of NFκB (30Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10952-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but is not involved in activation of the MAPK pathways (34Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mammalian Pellino2 also interacts with these same proteins (29Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4075-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Strelow A. Kollewe C. Wesche H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and although there are contrasting reports on its involvement in activation of NFκB (29Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4075-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Strelow A. Kollewe C. Wesche H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it has recently been shown to promote activation of ERK1/2 and JNK (34Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human Pellino3, both full-length and its alternative splice variant, interacts with IRAK, TRAF-6, and TAK-1, but interestingly fails to activate NFκB demonstrating that members of the Pellino family are not functionally redundant (31Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1500-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, like Pellino2, Pellino3 activates ERK1/2 and JNK. Although the latter MAPK pathways are activated by these Pellino proteins, no evidence has been presented to date implying a role for members of the Pellino family in activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Indeed a role for Pellino1 and -2 in this pathway has already been excluded (31Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1500-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because members of the Pellino family are not functionally redundant we explored the potential of Pellino3 to regulate the p38 MAPK pathway. We show that Pellino3 is a novel activator of this pathway and further demonstrate that Pellino3 activates CREB in a p38-dependent manner. By generating a series of truncation mutants of Pellino3 we map regions that positively influence p38 MAPK activity and identify a crucial amino acid residue in Pellino3 for IRAK1-Pellino3 association. Biological Reagents and Cell Culture—Anti-TRAF-6, anti-IRAK, and anti-TAK-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-myc antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Constructs encoding TRAF-6, TRAF-6 DN-(289-522), and IRAK-1 were from Tularik (San Francisco, CA). TAK-1 was a gift from Dr. H. Sakurai (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Osaka, Japan). Dominant negative TAK-1 (K66W) was a gift from Dr. Kunihiro Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Japan). The plasmids encoding wild-type and dominant negative p38 MAPK were gifts from Prof. R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical Center) and have been described previously (36Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Parental HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR4 (gift from Douglas T. Golenbock) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). G418 (Geneticin, 0.5 mg/ml) was used as the selective agent for the stably transfected 293TLR4. Cloning and Expression Vectors—Full-length and the alternative spliced variant of Pellino3 (designated Pellino3L and Pellino3S, respectively, in this report) were cloned from HEK293 cDNA. Pellino1 was cloned from human placental cDNA. Pellino2 was cloned from HEK293 cDNA. All cloning used the GC-RICH PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and primers for Pellino1, Pellino2, Pellino3L, and Pellino3S were based on sequences deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AF300987, NM_021255, AF487456, and AF487457, respectively). The genes were tagged at the C terminus with the c-myc epitope tag and subsequently cloned into the T/A cloning vector pTARGET (Promega Biosciences, San Luis Obispo, CA) and a BamHI-XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. Truncation mutants of Pellino3L were generated by PCR using the GC-RICH PCR system and cloned into the pTARGET and pcDNA3.1/Zeo mammalian expression plasmids. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutants were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of all generated clones was confirmed by sequencing. The MAPK-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2 (accession no. BC036060) was amplified by the GC-RICH PCR system, using HEK293 cDNA as template and cloned into a modified pIRES-DsRed expression plasmid (BD Biosciences, Clontech). The IRES was removed by a two-step process of first site-directed mutagenesis followed by the release of a restriction fragment containing the IRES thus allowing for the expression of a MAPKAP kinase 2-DsRed fusion protein. Pellino constructs were additionally subcloned into the EcoRI-digested pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech) vector for confocal analysis. CHOP Reporter System—The PathDetect CHOP trans-Reporting System (Stratagene) was used, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, to measure activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Briefly, HEK293 TLR4 cells (2.6 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were then transfected, using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI), with firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (60 ng), the trans-activator plasmid pFA-CHOP (activation domain of CHOP fused with the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain, 1 ng), constitutively expressed Renilla-luciferase reporter construct (phRL-TK, 20 ng, Promega Biosciences), varying amounts of expression constructs. Total DNA was kept constant (230 ng/well) using the appropriate empty vector. The activation of CREB was assessed by performing equivalent transfections using CREB-regulated luciferase (60 ng, BD Biosciences, Clontech), phRL-TK plasmid (20 ng), and varying amounts of expression constructs. Cell extracts were generated 24 h later using the Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Biosciences), and extracts were assayed for firefly luciferase and Renilla-luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega Biosciences) and coelenterazine (1 μg/ml, Insight Biotechnology Ltd.), respectively. Western Blot Analysis of p38 MAPK Phosphorylation—HEK293 cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded into 12-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were transfected, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), with various amounts of plasmids encoding Pellino3L (0.5, 1, and 1.6 μg), Pellino1 (1.6 μg), Pellino3L Y44A (1.6 μg), and MEK3 (1.6 μg). The pTARGET empty vector was used as a negative control. Cells were harvested in SDS sample buffer the following day, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for levels of phosphorylated and total p38 using the PhosphoPlus p38 MAP Kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibody kit as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Analysis of p38 MAPK Activity by in Vitro Kinase Assay—HEK293 cells (5 × 105/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were co-transfected, using Lipofectamine 2000, with a plasmid encoding wild-type p38 MAPK (1 μg) and Pellino3L, Pellino3L Y44A, Pellino1, MEK3, or pTARGET empty vector (3 μg). At 24-h post-transfection cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor)). Lysates were then assayed for p38 MAPK activity using a non-radioactive p38α (SAPK2a kinase) activity assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Chemicon International). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer with GST-ATF-2 and then subjected to Western immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ATF-2 monoclonal antibody. Suppression of Endogenous Expression of Pellino3—Pre-designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Pellino3 was purchased from Ambion Inc. (target sequence, GAG GAC AGA CTG TTA ACA AAT), and a corresponding scrambled siRNA was designed and constructed using the Silencer in Vitro transcription siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc.). HEK293TLR4 cells were seeded into 12-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and transfected 24 h later, using Lipofectamine 2000, with various concentrations of siRNAs (0-15 nm). Cells were treated 30 h following transfection with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 20 min and then harvested in SDS sample buffer. Samples were probed for levels of phosphorylated and total p38 MAPK as described above. To confirm suppression of endogenous expression of Pellino3, RNA was extracted from cells, using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion Inc.) and subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNA using AMV-reverse transcriptase (Promega Biosciences). PCR was then performed on the cDNAs using GAPDH-specific primers (GAPDH-for, 5′-CCA TGC CAT CAC TGC CAC CCA GAA-3′; GAPDH-rev, 5′-GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA GCCG) and Pellino3-specific primers (Pellino3-for, 5′-GGC TTC GAT GCC TCT AGC AAC-3′; Pellino3-rev, 5′-CAG GCG GCA TGG AAA GCA TG-3′). PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—HEK293 cells (5 × 105/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were transfected, using Polyfect (Qiagen), with the relevant Pellino construct (1.5 μg) in the presence or absence of expression plasmids encoding IRAK, TRAF-6, or TAK-1 (0.5 μg). At 24 h post-transfection cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (as above). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot (50 μl) of lysate was retained for Western blot analysis. Pre-cleared cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-myc antibody that had been pre-coupled with Protein A/G-Sepharose beads. Following incubation, the beads were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C followed by five wash steps with 700 μl of lysis buffer lacking the protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells (1.6 × 105/well) were seeded into 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc A/S, DK-4000, Denmark) and grown for 24 h. Cells were then transfected, using GeneJuice (Novagen), with MAPKAP kinase 2-DsRed (400 ng) in the presence or absence of Pellino3-pEGFP or Pellino3(Y44A)-pEGFP (400 ng). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with Slowfade antifade reagent (DAPI-containing medium, (1.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Inc.). Confocal images were captured using the ×63 objective (oil immersion) on the UV Zeiss 510 Meta System laser scanning microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets and analyzed using the LSM 5 browser imaging software. Pellino3 Activates the p38 MAPK Pathway—To address the ability of Pellino3 to activate the p38 MAPK pathway, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of expression plasmid encoding myc-tagged Pellino3L or Pellino3S and components of the PathDetect CHOP trans-Reporting System. The latter includes the GAL4-inducible promoter, pFR-Luc, and the trans-activating fusion protein GAL4-CHOP. Because CHOP is a substrate for p38 MAPK, and this leads to activation of its trans-activation capacity (37Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), the expression of luciferase from pFR-luc is an index of p38 MAPK activity. The overexpression of both Pellino3L and Pellino3S caused a dose-dependent induction of pFR-luciferase (Fig. 1A). Both forms exhibited comparable levels of activation with maximum stimulation of 6- to 7-fold. This represents a strong level of activation, because the maximum -fold induction affected by the positive MEK3 driver is 10- to 12-fold (data not shown). In contrast, the overexpression of Pellino1 failed to induce expression of luciferase (Fig. 1A) confirming its previously published inability to activate the p38 MAPK pathway (34Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This differential ability of Pellino3 versus Pellino1 to activate the p38 MAPK pathway is not due to lack of expression of the latter, because Western immunoblotting of lysates confirmed expression of both constructs (Fig. 1A, inset). Two additional independent assay systems were further employed to validate the CHOP reporter system and confirm that Pellino3 activates p38 MAPK. MEK3 was used as a positive driver in both assays. Firstly, cells were transfected with increasing amounts of an expression vector encoding Pellino3L, and cell extracts were assayed for levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK using an antibody that detects doubly phosphorylated threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 of p38 MAPK. Cells showed some basal phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. However Pellino3L caused a dose-dependent increase in the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, whereas Pellino1 was ineffective (Fig. 1B). As control for the assay, all samples showed equivalent levels of total p38 MAPK as judged by Western immunoblotting analysis using control antibodies that recognize p38 irrespective of its phosphorylation status. An in vitro kinase assay for p38 MAPK was also used to further confirm its activation by Pellino3. Thus cells were transfected with Pellino3L, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were assayed for their ability to catalyze the in vitro phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK substrate ATF-2. Immunoprecipitates from Pellino3L-transfected cells showed increased activity with respect to phosphorylation of ATF-2 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Pellino1-transfected cells demonstrated comparable activity with cells transfected with empty vector. This assay, in conjunction with the other two systems, strongly confirms Pellino3 as a robust activator of p38 MAPK. Pellino3 Mediates IL-1 Activation of p38 MAPK—To address the physiological role of Pellino3 in the p38 MAPK pathway, siRNA that specifically targets Pellino3 was assessed for its effects on the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of endogenous p38 MAPK in HEK293 cells. Pellino3-specific siRNA caused a considerable reduction in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by IL-1, relative to a control Pellino3-scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2A). Neither siRNA had any effect on the levels of total p38 MAPK. To validate selective suppression of endogenous Pellino3 expression by the Pellino3-specific siRNA, RNA samples from siRNA-transfected cells were assayed for levels of Pellino3 and GAPDH mRNAs by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 2B). The scrambled siRNA sequence had no effect on the mRNA levels of Pellino3 relative to cells that had been transfected in the absence of any siRNAs. In contrast the Pellino3-specific siRNA caused a strong suppression of Pellino3 mRNA expression and left barely detectable levels. Neither siRNA affected the levels of the housekeeping GAPDH mRNA. Deletion Analysis of Pellino3 Reveals Sites Important for p38 MAPK Activation—We next attempted to identify the structural basis underlying the unique ability of Pellino3, as the only member of the Pellino family, to activate the p38 MAPK pathway. The alignment of the protein sequences encoded by the mammalian Pellino genes demonstrates that greatest sequence divergence occurs at their N termini (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both forms of Pellino3 are longer at their N termini by 27 amino acids. Using Pellino3L as a reference, a series of truncation mutants were generated in an effort to identify key regions of importance to activating p38 MAPK. Emphasis was placed on regions that show greatest sequence divergence between Pellino3 and the other Pellino members. All mutants were assessed for their ability to activate p38 MAPK using the CHOP trans-Reporting System. The truncation of the first 27 amino acids failed to affect the ability of Pellino3 to activate p38 MAPK, because both full-length Pellino3 and mutant 28-469 showed comparable patterns of dose-dependent activation in the assay (with both demonstrating maximum induction of 6-fold) (Fig. 3B). The next 9 and 15 amino acids were additionally truncated, because these regions show sequence divergence between Pellino3 and the other members of the family. These truncation mutants, 37-469 and 43-469, indeed showed reduced efficacy in activating p38 (5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, compared with 6-fold with wild-type construct) indicating that sites important for augmenting p38 MAPK activity lie within this stretch of 15 amino acids (Fig. 3B). However, the removal of the next 5 amino acids obliterated the ability of Pellino3 to activate p38 MAPK as evidenced by the complete ineffectiveness of mutants 48-469 and 135-469 in the assay (Fig. 3B). The inability of these mutants to activate p38 MAPK is not due to lack of expression (see below in Fig. 5).Fig. 5Mapping regions in Pellino3 that facilitate interaction with TRAF-6, TAK-1, and IRAK. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the designated myc-tagged Pellino constructs or the pTARGET empty vector (EV) and TRAF-6 (A) or TAK-1 (B) or IRAK (C) expression construct. Control cells were mock transfected (Mock) in the presence of pTARGET alone. Cell lysates were generated and immunoprecipitated with an immobilized anti-myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western immunoblotting using the appropriate antibody against TRAF-6 (A) or TAK-1 (B) or I"
https://openalex.org/W2039422884,"Dendritic cells (DC) arise from a diverse group of hematopoietic progenitors and have marked phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. The signal transduction pathways that regulate the ability of progenitors to undergo DC differentiation, as well as the specific characteristics of the resulting DC, are only beginning to be characterized. We have found previously that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by cytokines or phorbol esters drives normal human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid leukemic blasts (KG1, K562 cell lines, and primary patient blasts) to differentiate into DC. We now report that PKC activation is also required for cytokine-driven DC differentiation from monocytes. Of the cPKC isoforms, only PKC-βII was consistently activated by DC differentiation-inducing stimuli in normal and leukemic progenitors. Transfection of PKC-βII into the differentiation-resistant KG1a subline restored the ability to undergo DC differentiation in a signal strength-dependent fashion as follows: 1) by development of characteristic morphology; 2) the up-regulation of DC surface markers; 3) the induction of expression of the NFκB family member Rel B; and 4) the potent ability to stimulate allo-T cells. Most unexpectedly, the restoration of PKC-βII signaling in KG1a was not directly due to overexpression of the transfected classical PKC (α, βII, or γ) but rather through induction of endogenous PKC-β gene expression by the transfected classical PKC. The mechanism of this positive autoregulation involves up-regulation of PKC-β promoter activity by constitutive PKC signaling. These findings indicate that the regulation of PKC-βII expression and signaling play critical roles in mediating progenitor to DC differentiation."

Ironically, Richard Dawkins' recent book, a trip back in time in search of our ancestors, echoes the ‘chain of being’ popular in religions. This saw the Universe as a progress from the inanimate, through plants and animals to humans. Sean Nee takes a contrarian view, mapping the journey to the microbial world of today.

The enzyme is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues, and some of this phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase A. In this work we examined the hypothesis that choline kinase is also phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Using choline kinase as a substrate, protein kinase C activity was dose- and time-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of choline kinase (Km = 27 μg/ml) and ATP (Km = 15 μm). This phosphorylation, which occurred on a serine residue, was accompanied by a 1.6-fold stimulation of choline kinase activity. The synthetic peptide SRSSSQRRHS (V5max/Km = 17.5 mm–1 μmol min–1 mg–1) that contains the protein kinase C motif for Ser25 was a substrate for protein kinase C. A Ser25 to Ala (S25A) mutation in choline kinase resulted in a 60% decrease in protein kinase C phosphorylation of the enzyme. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of the S25A mutant enzyme confirmed that Ser25 was a protein kinase C target site. In vivo the S25A mutation correlated with a decrease (55%) in phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway, whereas an S25D phosphorylation site mimic correlated with an increase (44%) in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Although the S25A (protein kinase C site) mutation did not affect the phosphorylation of choline kinase by protein kinase A, the S30A (protein kinase A site) mutation caused a 46% reduction in enzyme phosphorylation by protein kinase C. A choline kinase synthetic peptide (SQRRHSLTRQ) containing Ser30 was a substrate (Vmax/Km = 3.0 mm–1 μmol min–1 mg–1) for protein kinase C.

In the Kennedy pathway PC is derived from choline via phosphocholine and CDP-choline, whereas in the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway, PC is derived from CDP-diacylglycerol via the major phospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine (1Vance D.E.

The rationale for this hypothesis was based on the presence of potential protein kinase C target sites in the choline kinase enzyme (Fig. 1). We showed here that protein kinase C phosphorylated and stimulated choline kinase and identified Ser25 and Ser30 as major sites of phosphorylation. We also showed a S25A mutation in choline kinase correlated with a decrease in PC synthesis by the Kennedy pathway. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

The CKI1S25A,S37A and CKI1S25A,S30A mutant alleles were constructed with the primers for the S37A and S30A mutations using plasmid pCK25A as the template, respectively.

The cell disruption buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. The protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm NaF, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. The CKI1-encoded choline kinase was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography with Con A, Affi-Gel Blue, and Mono Q (28Kim K.-H.

Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. Cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein) were incubated for 1 h with 10 μg of anti-choline kinase antibodies in a total volume of 0.5 ml followed by incubation with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (10% slurry, w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 s and washed 3 times with phosphorylation reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.375 mm EDTA, 0.375 mm EGTA, and 1.7 mm CaCl2). After the washing steps the buffer was removed by aspiration, and the choline kinase attached to the protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was used as the substrate for protein kinase C phosphorylation. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-choline kinase antibodies (0.6 μg/ml) as described previously (63Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The choline kinase protein was detected on immunoblots using the ECF Western blotting chemifluorescence detection kit as described by the manufacturer. Fluorescent signals on the immunoblots were acquired by fluorescence imaging analysis. The relative densities of the proteins were analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Phosphorylation Reactions—Pure choline kinase, immunoprecipitated choline kinase, and choline kinase synthetic peptides were phosphorylated with rat brain protein kinase C. This enzyme preparation contains a mixture of the α, β, and γ isoforms of the enzyme. We used the rat brain protein kinase C in our studies because the S. cerevisiae protein kinase C (64Ogita K.

In addition, the rat brain enzyme has been shown to phosphorylate other yeast proteins with the same efficiency as a partially purified preparation of yeast protein kinase C (67Yang W.-L. Carman G.M.

G., McLaurin, C., and Kasinath, B. S. (2003) Kidney Int. 64, 468–479). We examined the role of Erk1/2 MAP kinase in protein synthesis induced by VEGF. VEGF stimulated Erk phosphorylation that was required for induction of protein synthesis. VEGF-induced Erk activation was not dependent on phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activation but required sequential phosphorylation of type 2 VEGF receptor, PLCγ and c-Src, as demonstrated by inhibitors SU1498, U73122, and PP1, respectively. c-Src phosphorylation was inhibited by U73122, indicating it was downstream of phospholipase (PL)Cγ. Studies with PP1/2 showed that phosphorylation of c-Src was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, an upstream regulator of Erk. VEGF also stimulated phosphorylation of Pyk-2; VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2, c-Src and Raf-1 could be abolished by BAPTA/AM, demonstrating requirement for induction of intracellular calcium currents. We examined the downstream events following the phosphorylation of Erk. VEGF stimulated phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E and induced Mnk1 to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon phosphorylation. VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E required phosphorylation of PLCγ, c-Src, and Erk. Expression of dominant negative Mnk1 abrogated eIF4E phosphorylation and protein synthesis induced by VEGF. VEGF-stimulated protein synthesis could be blocked by inhibition of PLCγ by a chemical inhibitor or expression of a dominant negative construct. Our data demonstrate that VEGF-stimulated protein synthesis is Erk-dependent and requires the activation of VEGF receptor 2, PLCγ, c-Src, Raf, and Erk pathway. VEGF also stimulates Erk-dependent phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E, crucial events in the initiation phase of protein translation.

VEGF also stimulates Erk-dependent phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E, crucial events in the initiation phase of protein translation. The response of a cell to injurious stimuli includes increase in cell protein synthesis (hypertrophy), cell division (hyperplasia) or apoptosis. Of these processes, the mechanisms underlying cell hypertrophy have not been well understood. Regulation of cellular protein synthesis occurs at the initiation phase of protein translation (1.Miron M. Sonenberg N. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2988-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the main events in initiation phase is phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; Erk, extracellular signal-related kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLC-γ, phospholipase C-γ; SH, Src homology; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, VEGF receptor 2; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); MCT, murine proximal tubular epithelial; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MEK, MAP kinase/Erk kinase; PP1, 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1c-naphthyl)pyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)7(tert-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4,d]pyrimidine. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; Erk, extracellular signal-related kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLC-γ, phospholipase C-γ; SH, Src homology; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, VEGF receptor 2; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); MCT, murine proximal tubular epithelial; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MEK, MAP kinase/Erk kinase; PP1, 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1c-naphthyl)pyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)7(tert-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4,d]pyrimidine.-binding protein (4E-BP1, 15–20 kDa) (2.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this repressor protein results in dissolution of eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex, releasing the eIF4E to bind to the mRNA cap and promote translation initiation (3.Thornton S. Anand N. Purcell D. Lee J. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An increase in eIF4E phosphorylation is commonly seen during the initiation phase and has been attributed to Erk1/2-type MAP kinase (4.Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, Erk is not the direct kinase for eIF4E; it activates Mnk1/2 kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates Ser-209 on eIF4E (5.Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 6.Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Agonists that induce Mnk1 phosphorylation have not been well studied. We examined whether VEGF regulates this important kinase. Functional effects of VEGF as an angiogenic agent and as a key regulator of endothelial cell functions have been well documented. Our recent observations have shown that VEGF increases protein synthesis and induces hypertrophy in renal proximal tubular epithelial (MCT) cells, suggesting a role for VEGF in non-angiogenic processes in non-endothelial cells (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previously, we have also shown that VEGF stimulation of protein synthesis and hypertrophy in MCT cells recruit PI 3-kinase-Akt axis to induce phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In that study, the role of Erk in VEGF-induced protein synthesis was not examined. Increase in Erk phosphorylation in the renal cortex of mice with type 2 diabetes occurs simultaneously with the onset of kidney hypertrophy that mostly involves renal tubular epithelial cells (8.Feliers D. Duraisamy S. Faulkner J.L. Duch J. Lee A.V. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Coinciding with Erk phosphorylation and kidney hypertrophy, VEGF expression in the kidney is increased (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and anti-VEGF antibody reverses kidney enlargement (9.Flyvbjerg A. Dagnaes-Hansen F. De Vriese A.S. Schrijvers B.F. Tilton R.G. Rasch R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3090-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, whether VEGF recruits Erk pathway in regulation of protein synthesis and renal cell hypertrophy is not known. Also unknown is the identity of upstream kinases that regulate Erk activity in response to VEGF in MCT cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PLCγ, an important kinase that binds to type 2 VEGF receptor (VEGFR2), plays a regulatory role in VEGF-induced Erk activation and protein synthesis. Downstream of Erk, we also studied whether VEGF regulated Mnk1 phosphorylation and its target, eIF4E. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. VEGF-165 recombinant protein and anti-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate, Inc. (Charlottesville, Virginia). Antibody against Mnk1 and anti v-Src antibody were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA), respectively. All other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). 35S-Labeled methionine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ECL chemiluminescent substrate reagent was from Pierce Biotechnology. Inc. PP1 and PP2 analog, SU1498, LY294002, and BAPTA/AM were purchased from Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences. As PP1 is no longer available we employed PP2 as an inhibitor of c-Src. U73122 was from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and U0126 was purchased from Promega. Cell Culture—SV-40-immortalized murine proximal tubular epithelial (MCT) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Eric Neilson, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 5 mmol/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). MCT cells express in vivo properties of proximal tubular epithelial cells (10.Haverty T.P. Kelly C.J. Hines W.H. Amenta P.S. Watanabe M. Harper R.A. Kefalides N.A. Neilson E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 90% confluence and then growth-arrested for 18 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before experiments. Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of protein from control and VEGF-treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After transfer overnight at 4 °C, the membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h. The membrane was then washed and probed with primary antibody for 3 h. After extensive washing in TBST, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent. The images of the bands were scanned by reflectance scanning densitometry, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using NIH Image software. Protein Synthesis Measurement—Serum-starved cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml of VEGF-165 in the presence of 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2 h with or without the respective inhibitors (11.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Sonenberg N. Kasinath B.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1226-F1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. An equal amount of protein (20 μg) was spotted onto the 3-mm filter paper (Whatman). Filters were washed three times by boiling for 1 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1 g/liter methionine before determining radioactivity. Erk1/2 MAP kinase (Erk) activity assay—Equal amounts of cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with Erk1/2 antibody (12.Bhandari B.K. Feliers D. Duraisamy S. Stewart J.L. Gingras A.C. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Sonenberg N. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 866-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed, and the Erk kinase assay was performed in kinase assay buffer in the presence of 50 μmol of cold ATP, 1 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP, and 5 μg of myelin basic protein at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was arrested by the addition of an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. Phosphorylated bands were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In some experiments, immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Erk antibody was done to assess Erk phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides. Semiconfluent cells were serum-starved for 18 h and treated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for different time periods. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-Mnk1 antibody followed by staining with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Phospho-Mnk1 was visualized with a confocal laser microscopy system (Olympus Fluoview 500). The confocal images were analyzed using Fluoview software to determine the localization of phospho-Mnk. For quantification of phospho-Mnk1 nuclear localization, cells were grown in chamber slides, with individual chambers representing one time point. Cells were viewed under uniform magnification (40×). For each time point, the number of cells showing nuclear localization of phospho-Mnk1/total number of cells in a field of fixed area containing a minimum of 150 cells was counted and converted to percentage. Finally, these values were compared with that of value at time 0 (control). The experiment was performed three times, and composite data were converted into graphic form and analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Transfection Studies—Plasmid constructs containing dominant negative mutants of Src and PLCγ (PLCz) were employed for transient transfection in MCT cells using Lipofectamine and lipo-plus reagent (Invitrogen), as described earlier (13.Senthil D. Faulkner J.L. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Kasinath B.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PCR 295 expression vector containing dominant negative c-Src was kindly provided by Dr. T. Yoneda, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. The kinase inactivation mutation in c-Src consisted of Lys295–Met295. PLCz is a dominant negative fragment of PLCγ gene which encodes the Z region (PCI region, PLC inhibitor region) containing the SH2 and SH3 domains (amino acids 517–901) of this enzyme (14.Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pXf/PLCz expression was driven by SV40 early promoter. pEBG-3X eukaryotic expression vector containing dominant-interfering Mnk1 mutant (pEBG-T2A2 containing T197A/T202A mutants (5.Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar)) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Statistics—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. obtained from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA for comparison between multiple groups; p values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. VEGF-induced Protein Synthesis Is Erk-dependent in MCT Cells—We investigated whether VEGF induced Erk phosphorylation and whether VEGF-induced protein synthesis was Erk-dependent because Erk occupies a central position in transducing signals from the extracellular milieu to the nucleus. VEGF promoted Erk phosphorylation within 2 min that lasted nearly 15 min with peak phosphorylation at 10 min (Fig. 1A). VEGF significantly stimulated protein synthesis in MCT cells that was abrogated by preincubation of cells with U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, the direct upstream kinase of Erk (Fig. 1B). VEGF induction of protein synthesis is, thus, dependent on the stimulation of Erk. We initiated the search for upstream regulators of VEGF-induced Erk activation. We started with PI 3-kinase as insulin- and insulin-like growth factor 1-induced Erk activation in MCT cells is PI 3-kinase-dependent (12.Bhandari B.K. Feliers D. Duraisamy S. Stewart J.L.

Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Kasinath B.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that VEGF induces PI 3-kinase activity in these cells (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Preincubation with LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, did not affect VEGF-induced Erk activity, although it was abolished by U0126 (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that VEGF-induced Erk activation is independent of PI 3-kinase but dependent on MEK activation. Having excluded PI 3-kinase, we sought to identify other kinases that could act as upstream effectors of Erk activation by VEGF. We selected phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and c-Src as potential regulators as they are membrane-associated and interact with VEGF receptors (15.Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 16.Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Brock T.A. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). VEGFR2 Stimulates PLCγ and c-Src to Regulate Erk Phosphorylation—Immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody following VEGF incubation for 10 min showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including those of approximate sizes 220, 180, 150, 110, 90, 60, and 30 kDa. The 180-, 150-, and 60-kDa bands may represent VEGFR2, PLCγ, and c-Src, respectively. Preincubation with SU1498, a selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, abolished or markedly inhibited most of these changes implying VEGFR2 phosphorylation was required for these tyrosine phosphorylation events (Fig. 2A). VEGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and c-Src rapidly, within 5 min (Fig. 2, B and C). VEGFR2 is believed to mediate most of the biological effects of VEGF. Pretreatment of cells with SU1498 abolished VEGF-induced PLCγ and c-Src phosphorylation (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting involvement of VEGFR2. Next, we examined the sequence of phosphorylation of PLCγ and c-Src by VEGF. U73122, a PLC inhibitor, blocked phosphorylation of c-Src, demonstrating that the latter is downstream of PLCγ in VEGFR2 signaling events in MCT cells (Fig. 2F). We investigated whether PLCγ plays a role in regulating VEGF-induced Erk activation. VEGF-stimulated Erk activation was inhibited by U-73122, the PLC inhibitor (Fig. 3A). This was further confirmed by expressing dominant negative constructs of PLCγ (PLCz). VEGF-stimulated Erk activation was abolished in cells transfected with PLCz but not in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3B). Although it appears as though expression of PLCz reduced Erk activity only upon addition of VEGF, densitometric analysis of bands from three experiments did not reveal a significant difference in band intensity between VEGF+PLCz and untreated control groups (Fig. 3B, bars 1 versus 4). We next examined the role of c-Src in VEGF induction of Erk. PP1, a c-Src inhibitor, abolished VEGF-induced Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Further confirmation was obtained by employing a kinase-inactive dominant negative construct of c-Src (Fig. 4B). Raf is an upstream kinase in Erk pathway (17.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar, 18.von Gise A. Lorenz P. Wellbrock C. Hemmings B. Berberich-Siebelt F. Rapp U.R. Troppmair J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2324-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulated Raf phosphorylation at Tyr340 and Tyr341 within 5 min that lasted for nearly 15 min (Fig. 4C). This was completely inhibited by PP2, a c-Src inhibitor (Fig. 4D), indicating Tyr340/Tyr341 phosphorylation of Raf was c-Src dependent. The Src inhibitor, at this concentration, did not affect VEGF-induced PLCγ phosphorylation, which is VEGFR2-dependent (See supplemental Fig. S1). VEGF Induces Phosphorylation of Pyk2, c-Src, and Erk in a Calcium-dependent Manner—VEGF increases intracellular calcium transients through VEGFR2 (19.Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Bjercke R. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C176-C181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that correlate with phosphorylation of PLCγ (20.McLaughlin A.P. De Vries G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1448-C1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PLCγ has been linked to the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to increased intracellular calcium mobilization and PKC activation, respectively. A read-out of calcium signaling is the phosphorylation of Pyk2, a proline-rich, Ca2+-dependent non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Pyk2 phosphorylation was studied using a phosphospecific antibody that detects phosphorylation on Tyr402. Incubation with VEGF rapidly induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 that lasted for nearly 30 min (Fig. 5A). We next examined the role of Ca2+ in Erk activation induced by VEGF. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA/AM abolished VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2, Src, and Erk (Fig. 5, B–D), confirming that Ca2+ transients are required for VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk and its upstream regulators. The data described above established the upstream regulators of VEGF-induced Erk activation along the lines of VEGFR2, PLCγ, Pyk2/c-Src, Raf, Erk. We next sought to gain insight into the possible mechanism downstream of Erk activation related to events of regulatory importance in protein synthesis. VEGF Induces Phosphorylation of Mnk1—As discussed before, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E from the dimeric complex. 4E-BP-1 phosphorylation is required for VEGF-induced protein synthesis and hypertrophy in MCT cells; this process is PI 3-kinase- and Akt-dependent (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Following dissolution of eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex, free eIF4E binds to a scaffolding protein eIF4G and is phosphorylated by MAP kinase-integrating kinases (Mnk1/2) that also bind eIF4G at the C terminus (21.Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Mnk1, a 52-kDa protein, is activated by phosphorylation at Thr197 by Erk. As Erk regulation of protein synthesis could involve Mnk and eIF4E, we examined whether VEGF regulates their phosphorylation. VEGF rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of Mnk1 within 5 min and the effect lasted for nearly 30 min (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that VEGF activates a downstream target of Erk. Mnk1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (22.Parra-Palau J.L. Scheper G.C. Wilson M.L. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44197-44204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, agonists that stimulate nuclear shift of Mnk1 have not been extensively identified. Therefore, we examined whether VEGF regulates the shift of Mnk1 into the nucleus. As seen in Fig. 6B, we observed increased immunofluorescence corresponding to Mnk1 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm within 2 min with perinuclear localization at 5 min. Nuclear translocation was observed at 15 min, coinciding with maximum phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6B also shows the scoring for nuclear localization of phospho-Mnk1. There was a progressive increase in nuclear immunofluorescence that peaked at 15 min following treatment of the cells with VEGF (p < 0.01 at 5 and 15 min). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of VEGF regulation of Mnk1 phosphorylation and its localization in the cell. We examined the upstream regulators of VEGF-induced Mnk1 phosphorylation. U73122, the PLC inhibitor, PP2, the c-Src inhibitor, and U0126, the MEK inhibitor, all abolished VEGF-stimulated Mnk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7), identifying PLC, c-Src, and MEK (immediately upstream of Erk) as kinases that control Mnk1 phosphorylation.Fig. 7VEGF-induced Mnk1 phosphorylation is dependent on PLCγ, c-Src, and Erk. Cells were serum-starved overnight and subjected to pretreatment with or without U73122 (5 μm), a PLC inhibitor (A), PP2 (10 μm), a Src inhibitor (B), and U0126 (25 μm), a MEK inhibitor (C), prior to incubation with or without VEGF 20 ng/ml for 10 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a phosphospecific antibody for Mnk1. The lower panels of A, B, and C show the blots probed with antibody against Mnk1 to assess loading. Representative blots from three experiments with each kinase inhibitor are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) VEGF Induces Phosphorylation of eIF4E—Our next aim was to test whether VEGF induced phosphorylation of eIF4E, the Mnk1 substrate. VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of eIF4E robustly within 5 min, and the effect lasted for about 30 min (Fig. 8A). U73122, PP2, and U0126 completely inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 8, B–D). Thus, VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E is regulated via the PLCγ, c-Src, and Erk axis. Dominant Negative Mnk1 Expression Inhibits eIF4E Phosphorylation and Protein Synthesis Induced by VEGF—We next investigated the involvement of Mnk1 in VEGF-stimulated protein synthesis by expressing dominant negative Mnk1 in which the Thr197 and Thr202 are mutated to Ala. Both VEGF-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and protein synthesis were abrogated by expression of mutant Mnk1 (Fig. 9). These data demonstrate that VEGF-induced protein synthesis requires Mnk1 phosphorylation. PLCγ Activation Is Required for VEGF-induced Enhanced Protein Synthesis—We have established the role of PLCγ in activation of Erk to increase phosphorylation of eIF4E, a regulator of protein synthesis initiation. We directly examined whether PLCγ activation, the proximal event in Erk activation, is required for VEGF induction of protein synthesis. VEGF-induced protein synthesis in MCT cells was completely abrogated when the cells were pretreated with U73122 (Fig. 10A). Further confirmation was obtained employing cells transfected to express PLCz, the dominant negative construct of PLCγ (Fig. 10B). Fig. 11 summarizes the proposed sequence of signaling events induced by VEGF leading to protein synthesis in MCT cells.Fig. 11Erk1/2 MAP kinase mediated signaling mechanism involved in VEGF-induced protein synthesis. DN, dominant negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this report we demonstrated that VEGF augments protein synthesis in an Erk phosphorylation-dependent manner. Our data show that VEGF-induced Erk phosphorylation is regulated by sequential phosphorylation of VEGFR2, PLCγ, and c-Src. We reported for the first time that VEGF stimulation of Erk phosphorylation, in turn, results in phosphorylation of Mnk1 and its substrate eIF4E. The phosphorylation of Mnk1 is associated with its shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Our results provide new evidence for a role for PLCγ in VEGF-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and protein synthesis. VEGF stimulation of protein synthesis in MCT cells is mediated via activation of VEGFR2 (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pathways regulating phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E seem to diverge downstream of VEGFR2, the former being dependent on PI 3-kinase-Akt activation (7.Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) whereas, as reported here, eIF4E phosphorylation requires Erk phosphorylation. As Erk phosphorylation was independent of PI 3-kinase, our observations suggest distinct roles for PI 3-kinase and Erk pathways in the regulation of crucial events that control initiation phase of protein translation. PLCγ phosphorylation by VEGFR2 is the most proximal event identified in eIF4E phosphorylation in this study. PLCγ binds to Tyr1175 in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2 (23.Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Its role in the regulation of protein translation has not been studied in depth. U73122, an inhibitor of PLC, has been shown to abolish cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by norepinephrine (24.Singal T. Dhalla N.S. Tappia P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although it appears to be not required in angiotensin II induction of protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts (25.Hou M. Pantev E. Moller S. Erlinge D. Edvinsson L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 168: 301-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of PLCγ in protein synthesis appears to be cell- and agonist-specific. In several previous studies, the involvement of PLCγ was not directly studied but suspected by the use of its inhibitor, and changes in eIF4E were not addressed. Our study demonstrates for the first time, a link between PLCγ phosphorylation and eIF4E phosphorylation for inducing protein synthesis in cells stimulated with VEGF. Phosphorylation of PLCγ is followed by generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are known to stimulate the mobilization of intracellular calcium and protein kinase C, respectively. Ca2+ transients appear to be important for VEGF induction of Erk phosphorylation as BAPTA/AM abolished this effect. In MCT cells, VEGF stimulation of c-Src requires activation of PLCγ. c-Src has been identified as a mediator of angiotensin II stimulation of protein synthesis in smooth muscle cells grown from resistance arteries from hypertensive patients (26.Touyz R.M. He G. Wu X.H. Park J.B. Mabrouk M.E. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, c-Src is involved in phosphorylation of RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-K that regulates translation of select mRNAs (27.Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Cans C. Neubauer G. Bomsztyk K. Superti-Furga G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4535-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our observations identify c-Src as one of the upstream regulators of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E. Pyk2, a proline-rich non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated in a Ca2+-dependent manner, resulting in its interaction with activated c-Src (28.Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr402 of Pyk2 leads to binding and activation of c-Src in PC12 cells (29.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Pyk2 phosphorylation is required for angiotensin II-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and protein synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (30.Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Rocic P. Jo H. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1437-C1444Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Pyk2 may serve as a bridge between the PLCγ-c-Src axis and the canonical Raf-MEK-Erk pathway (29.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Activated Raf is phosphorylated on Ser338 (32.Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, for full activation of Raf-1, c-Src mediated phosphorylation of Tyr340/Tyr341 is necessary (33.Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 34.Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that VEGF stimulation of Erk pathway involves Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Src. It is well known that Raf-1 directly phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase MEK. eIF4E regulates the initiation phase of protein synthesis that is regarded as the rate-limiting step (35.Sonenberg N. Dever T.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In general, translation of most capped mRNAs in eukaryotes is facilitated by eIF4E, the cap-binding protein (36.von der Haar T. Gross J.D. Wagner G. McCarthy J.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In response to signals that promote protein synthesis, 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated, which results in the dissolution of its heterodimeric complex with eIF4E (37.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Once freed from 4E-BP1, eIF4E associates with eIF4G and eIF4A to form the eIF4F complex and binds to the m7 cap of the mRNA. Erk has been implicated in eIF4E phosphorylation on Ser209, the physiologically important site (38.Flynn A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21684-21688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although it is not the direct kinase as eIF4E lacks the proline residues around Ser209 involved in Erk recognition. It is now established that Erk phosphorylates Mnk1, which serves as the kinase for eIF4E (5.Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 6.Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Binding studies have shown that Mnk1 associates with C terminus of eIF4G, the scaffolding protein, which has binding sites for eIF4E and eIF4A, and forms the anchor for eIF4F complex. The bulk of phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1 occurs following their binding to eIF4G (21.Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Mnk1 carries a basic amino acid-rich nuclear import signal in its N terminus that determines its shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (22.Parra-Palau J.L. Scheper G.C. Wilson M.L. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44197-44204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our observations show that although phosphorylation of Mnk1 following VEGF incubation starts while the protein is in the cytoplasm, the peak in phosphorylation appears to occur when the protein has shifted to the nucleus. The relevance of the Mnk1 nuclear shift to cellular protein synthesis needs to be elucidated. The functional significance of eIF4E phosphorylation is also unclear. Initially, in vitro studies showed that phosphorylation of eIF4E augmented the avidity of the molecule for the mRNA cap and promoted the efficiency of its translation (39.Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the expression of an eIF4E phosphorylation mutant resulted in stunted development, suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF4E facilitated cell protein synthesis (40.Lachance P.E. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, opposing views have recently been expressed. The phosphorylation of eIF4E is thought to cause electrostatic repulsion from phosphate groups on the mRNA cap and inhibit its cap binding (41.Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 42.Zuberek J. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Niedzwiecka A. Dadlez M. Stepinski J. Augustyniak W. Gingras A.C. Zhang Z. Burley S.K. Sonenberg N. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The precise timing of eIF4E phosphorylation relative to mRNA cap binding is not known. If phosphorylation of eIF4E were to occur after the binding of the factor to the mRNA cap, anionic repulsion could serve to disengage eIF4E from the mRNA. The association and dissociation reactions between eIF4E and mRNA are known to be rapid (43.Scheper G.C. van Kollenburg B. Hu J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and could be facilitated by eIF4E phosphorylation. Although present in cytoplasm, a significant fraction of cellular eIF4E is present in the nucleus and may participate in nuclear protein translation (44.Iborra F.J. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and export of select mRNAs, e.g. cyclin D1, from the nucleus (45.Cohen N. Sharma M. Kentsis A. Perez J.M. Strudwick S. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4547-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 46.Topisirovic I. Culjkovic B. Cohen N. Perez J.M. Skrabanek L. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Role of eIF4E phosphorylation in these processes is not yet known. The stimulation of protein synthesis in renal epithelial (MCT) cells by VEGF has implications for kidney hypertrophy, which may occur physiologically, after removal of one kidney (9.Flyvbjerg A.

These data implicate VEGF in the pathogenesis of kidney hypertrophy in diabetes that mostly involves renal epithelial cells (49.Schrijvers B.F. Flyvbjerg A. De Vriese A.S. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 2003-2017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). VEGF could have constructive effects on the kidney in a different setting. In thrombotic glomerular disease, VEGF administration helps restore renal architecture (50.Kim Y.G. Suga S.I. Kang D.H. Jefferson J.A. Mazzali M. Gordon K.L. Matsui K. Breiteneder-Geleff S.

Like other prokaryotic homologs, the primase domain of the gene 4 helicase-primase of bacteriophage T7 contains a zinc motif and a catalytic core. Upon recognition of the sequence, 5′-GTC-3′ by the zinc motif, the catalytic site condenses the cognate nucleotides to produce a primer. The TOPRIM domain in the catalytic site contains several charged residues presumably involved in catalysis. Each of eight acidic residues in this region was replaced with alanine, and the properties of the altered primases were examined. Six of the eight residues (Glu-157, Glu-159, Asp-161, Asp-207, Asp-209, and Asp-237) are essential in that altered gene 4 proteins containing these mutations cannot complement T7 phage lacking gene 4 for T7 growth. These six altered gene 4 proteins can neither synthesize primers de novo nor extend an oligoribonucleotide. Despite the inability to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, the altered proteins recognize the sequence 5′-GTC-3′ in the template and deliver preformed primer to T7 DNA polymerase. The alterations in the TOPRIM domain result in the loss of binding affinity for ATP as measured by surface plasmon resonance assay together with ATP-agarose affinity chromatography.

In the bacteriophage T7 replication system, the DNA primase is encoded by gene 4 of the phage (2Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The multifunctional gene 4 protein contains both a helicase and a primase domain located in the carboxyl- and amino-terminal halves, respectively, of the polypeptide (3Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The gene 4 helicase-primase, together with the gene 5 DNA polymerase, the processivity factor Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and the gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol.-binding protein, constitutes the T7 replisome (2Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These four proteins mediate coordinated DNA synthesis in which leading and lagging strand DNA syntheses are coupled; both the leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases remain associated with the replisomes, and a replication loop containing a nascent Okazaki fragment is formed (4Lee J. Chastain II, P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The primase domain of gene 4 protein catalyzes the synthesis of tetraribonucleotides in a template-mediated reaction (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The T7 DNA primase initiates synthesis from a trinucleotide recognition site, 5′-GTC-3′. The first nucleoside, cytidine, is essential for recognition but is not copied into the product (6Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting dinucleotide, pppAC, is then extended to yield the functional tetraribonucleotide primers, pppACCC, pppACAC, and pppACCA (7Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A comparative study of prokaryotic DNA primases identified six conserved motifs designated I–VI in Fig. 1A (8Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A Cys4 zinc-binding motif (motif I) located at the amino terminus plays a critical role in the recognition of the trinucleotide recognition site (9Kusakabe T. Hine A.V. Hyberts S.G. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in the transfer of this site to the catalytic core (10Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which consists of motifs II–VI. The entire primase domain is covalently attached to the carboxyl-terminal helicase domain via a linker region that is also important in the assembly of the gene 4 protein into the functional hexamer through which the DNA passes (11Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences encoding the helicase and primase domains have each been cloned, and the resulting helicase and primase fragments have full helicase and primase activity, respectively (12Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the covalent association of helicase with primase bestows specific properties on the primase; the primase relies upon the helicase to increase its binding to ssDNA and to transport it along DNA in search of primase recognition sites that are extruded behind the helicase in close proximity to the amino-terminal primase domain.A crystal structure of the T7 DNA primase domain reveals a distinct physical separation of the amino-terminal zinc motif from the catalytic core in that the two are linked via an extended 11-residue polypeptide (10Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Such a flexible alignment of these two motifs could modulate primase activity and provide a mechanism by which primers are transferred to the lagging strand DNA polymerase. The flexibility of the linker is illustrated by the observation that the zinc motif of one gene 4 protein subunit within a hexamer can functionally interact with the catalytic core of an adjacent subunit (14Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12703-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase core can be further divided into two substructures. One subdomain that encompasses motifs II and III consists of an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet. The other subdomain (motifs IV–VI) contains a TOPRIM fold also found in topoisomerases (15Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A shallow cleft separates the amino-terminal subdomain of the RNA polymerase core from the TOPRIM fold. E. coli DnaG primase also has a cleft between these two subdomains (16Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Podobnik M. McInerney P. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and both clefts contain a number of basic residues. It has been proposed that the basic residues within this cleft electrostatically bind the single-strand DNA and that the polymerization of ribonucleotides occurs at a neighboring metal-binding center within the TOPRIM subdomain. We have described previously two lysines (Lys-122 and Lys-128) located in the basic cleft near motif III that are critical for the catalytic activity of T7 DNA primase (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The TOPRIM folds found in prokaryotic DNA primases (motifs IV–VI) of both E. coli DnaG primase and T7 DNA primase are quite similar, both structurally and with regard to conserved residues (10Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Both have a number of acidic residues that cluster on the TOPRIM side of the cleft formed by the amino-terminal portion of RNA polymerase core (motifs II and III) and the TOPRIM subdomain. In the T7 DNA primase structure, five acidic residues create the acidic patch and bind two metal ions, presumably Mg2+ (8Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). One of the metal-binding sites consists of a conserved triad of acidic residues (Glu-157, Asp-207, and Asp-209) similar to that found in DnaG primase as well as in the active site of RNA polymerases (19Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 20Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The second metal-binding site contains Asp-237 that coordinates another Mg2+. E. coli DnaG primase also contains two metal-binding sites along with the same conserved amino acids.In the present study we have investigated eight conserved acidic residues located in the TOPRIM fold based on sequence homology (8Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of T7 DNA primase, four of these residues appear to be involved in the coordination of metal in the active site (10Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to determine the role of these residues in primase function, we used in vitro mutagenesis to change each residue to alanine. Genetic and biochemical studies of the altered proteins show that six of these residues are indeed involved in the binding of nucleoside triphosphate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Biopolymer Laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Restriction endonucleases, alkaline phosphatase, and Deep Vent® polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, radiolabeled nucleotides, and high molecular weight protein markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Agarose and β,γ-methylene-dTTP were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plates were from J. T. Baker. NTP-agarose resins and biotin were purchased from Sigma. T7 DNA polymerase (T7 gene 5 protein-E. coli thioredoxin complex) and M13mp18 ssDNA were kindly provided by Donald Johnson (Harvard Medical School). Biotinylated NTP analogs were from Enzo Life Sciences Inc (Farmingdale, NY).Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Overproduction, and Purification—Plasmids containing nucleotide changes that result in a single amino acid substitution were constructed as described previously (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The entire gene 4 coding region was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. After transformation of the plasmid into E. coli HMS 174(DE3), gene 4 proteins were overproduced by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Gene 4 proteins were purified as described previously (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Phage Complementation Assay—E. coli DH 5α containing a plasmid that expresses T7 gene 4 under a T7 promoter (pET24-gp4) was grown to an A600 of 1. Serially diluted T7 phage stocks were mixed with an aliquot of the E. coli culture in 0.7% soft agar and poured onto LB plates. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the number of plaques that appeared on the plate were determined.Biochemical Assays of Gene 4 Protein—Most of the assays used in this study have been described previously (11Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All assays (template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis, template-directed oligoribonucleotide extension, template-independent diribonucleotide synthesis, and RNA-primed DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase) used a reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate plus the additional components described in each assay. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C for the indicated time.Template-directed Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis—The ability of gene 4 protein to catalyze de novo synthesis of oligoribonucleotides was determined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]CMP into oligoribonucleotides using a synthetic DNA template containing a primase recognition site. The reaction (10 μl) included 10 μm template DNA 5′-GGGTCAAA-3′, 0.1 mm each of ATP and [α-32P]CTP (0.1 μCi), and the indicated amount of gene 4 protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye and loaded onto a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 m urea. Electrophoresis was carried out at 1800 V for 3 h, and the gel was dried for autoradiography. Radioactive oligoribonucleotide products were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer.Template-directed Oligoribonucleotide Extension—T7 gene 4 primase can also catalyze the extension of the diribonucleotide AC to the tri- and tetraribonucleotide provided it is annealed at a primase recognition site 5′-GTC-3′ (21Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12446-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction was as described above for a template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay except that various amounts (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mm) of diribonucleotide AC were substituted for ATP. Gene 4 protein was present at 160 nm.Template-independent Diribonucleotide Synthesis—Gene 4 primase can catalyze the synthesis of random diribonucleotide, albeit at a low rate, in the absence of DNA (22Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gene 4 protein (300 nm) was incubated with 0.1 mm [α-32P]CTP (0.1 μCi) in the absence of template for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction buffer contained Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. Reaction products were dephosphorylated for 20 min at 37 °C and separated on a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel.RNA-primed DNA Synthesis by T7 DNA Polymerase—The oligoribonucleotide synthesized by gene 4 protein at primase recognition sites on ssDNA can be transferred to DNA polymerase by the gene 4 protein to serve as primers for DNA synthesis. Such RNA-primed DNA synthesis was measured in an assay containing 20 nm M13 ssDNA, 0.3 mm each of dGTP, dCTP, dATP, and [α-32P]dTTP (0.1 μCi), 100 nm gene 4 protein, 20 nm T7 DNA polymerase, and either 0.1 mm each of ATP and CTP or 20 μm preformed tetraribonucleotide ACCA. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The reaction products were spotted onto a DE81 membrane (Whatman), and the membrane was washed three times with 10 ml of 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, to remove unincorporated radioactive nucleotide. The amount of radioactively synthesized DNA was determined by measuring the radioactive products retained on the membrane.Assays for Activities of Helicase Domain—The oligomerization of gene 4 protein, the binding of gene 4 protein to ssDNA, ssDNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis, and the unwinding of duplex DNA were measured as described previously (11Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Determination of Binding Ability of Gene 4 Protein to Nucleotide Resin—A small volume (0.4 ml) of pre-swollen nucleotide-coupled agarose resin was packed into a column and washed with buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). A protein pool containing gene 4 protein was prepared from phosphocellulose column chromatography as described previously (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After loading of the protein pool by gravity, the column was washed with 2 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2. Gene 4 protein was eluted using 2 ml of buffer E (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). Each aliquot from the initial protein pool, flow-through, wash, and elution fraction was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The binding of proteins to NTPs was examined using surface plasmon resonance on the Biacore instrument. Bio-17-ATP and Bio-11-CTP are analogs of ATP and CTP, respectively, which have a biotin attached to the base of the NTP through the indicated number of atoms. The biotinylated NTPs were immobilized on the surface of Sensor Chip SA through a streptavidinbiotin interaction by manually injecting 10 μl of 10 μm in a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) at the flow rate of 20 μl/min. Proteins in a flow buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, and 1% glycerol) were injected for 1.25 min at the flow rate of 20 μl/min, and the binding signal was collected. After binding of protein, the chip was regenerated by repeatedly injecting 1 m NaCl for 1 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min until the signal was restored to the level before injection of proteins. A control lane contained biotin immobilized on the streptavidin chip. The signal obtained when the proteins were flowed over the control lane was subtracted from the signal measured when proteins were flowed over the biotinylated NTP lane.RESULTSA sequence alignment of bacterial and bacteriophage DNA primases revealed six conserved motifs in the DnaG family of primases (Fig. 1A) (8Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Motifs IV and V have homologies to motifs found in proteins that bind nucleotides such as ATPases, DNA, and RNA polymerases. An iterative profile search combined with structural modeling proposed that motifs IV–VI form a unique fold, the TOPRIM fold, also found in topoisomerases (15Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Within these motifs, a number of acidic residues were considered candidates for metal-mediated binding of NTP and for catalysis (23Aravind L. Mazumder R. Vasudevan S. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of T7 DNA primase and E. coli DnaG primase confirmed that motifs IV and V are indeed involved in Mg2+-mediated NTP binding, and several acidic residues were found to coordinate metal or to be in a position to do so (10Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have substituted alanine for each of the eight acidic residues in motifs IV–VI (Fig. 1A) and then examined the biochemical properties of each of the purified proteins.Complementation of Phage Growth by Recombinant Gene 4The ability of each of the genetically altered gene 4 proteins to support T7 phage growth was examined by using a complementation assay. In this assay, growth of phage T7Δ4 lacking gene 4 is dependent on gene 4 protein exogenously expressed from a plasmid harbored in the T7-infected E. coli. Defects in the function of gene 4 protein do not allow the phage to propagate, and no plaques are formed. Substitution at all 8 positions except for Glu-210 and Glu-240 resulted in loss of the ability of the protein to support growth of phage T7Δ4 (Table I). These results suggest that the six residues, Glu-157, Glu-159, Asp-161, Asp-207, Asp-209, and Asp-237, are each essential for gene 4 protein function. When the cells expressing each of the altered gene 4 proteins were infected with wild-type T7 phage, no significant difference between wild-type and altered gene 4 proteins was found. Thus, none of the altered proteins have a dominant negative effect on the function of the wild-type protein expressed by the phage.Table IAbility of altered gene 4 proteins to complement growth of T7 phage Gene 4 proteins containing the indicated amino acid substitution were expressed in E. coli DH5α. After infection with either T7Δ4 or wild-type (WT) T7 phage, the number of plaques were counted and normalized to the value obtained with wild-type gene 4 protein. Data were obtained from at least duplicated experiments.Alteration in gene 4 proteinT7 phageΔ4WTaWT, wild typeWT1.0bRelative efficiency of plating1.0E157A<10-50.67E159A<10-51.7D161A<10-51.7D207A<10-51.0D209A<10-53.3E210A2.92.7D237A<10-50.83E240A2.02.7a WT, wild typeb Relative efficiency of plating Open table in a new tab Overproduction and Purification of Altered Gene 4 ProteinsIn order to examine the biochemical properties of the altered gene 4 proteins, the proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. The altered gene 4 proteins are designated gp4-E157A, E159A, D161A, D207A, D209A, E210A, D237A, and E240A. Although gp4-E210A and gp4-E240A could replace wild-type gene 4 protein in vivo, both of these altered proteins were also purified and characterized.Initially we attempted to purify all of the gene 4 proteins by a standard purification procedure that utilizes both adsorption to and elution from a phosphocellulose and an ATP-agarose resin (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas gp4-E210A and gp4-E240A demonstrated similar affinity for both resins, the other altered proteins displayed reduced affinity for both resins. For example, only 50% of gp4-D209A and gp4-D237A adsorbed to the phosphocellulose resin and less than 10% of gp4-E159A and gp4-D161A adsorbed. Gp4-E157A and gp4-D207A behaved similar to the wild-type protein on phosphocellulose column chromatography. More interestingly, all of these altered proteins except for gp4-E210A and gp4-E240A showed greatly reduced affinity for the ATP-agarose resin. As shown in Fig. 2, the majority of gp4-E157A and gp4-D207A applied to the column (lane 1) did not bind to the resin (lane 2), and consequently only a small percentage of the protein applied to the resin could be recovered (lane 3). This behavior is precisely opposite that observed with wild-type gene 4 protein irrespective of whether the proteins are monitored by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A) or by a Western blot (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the altered proteins are defective in their ability to bind nucleoside triphosphate, a property that we address below.Fig. 2Binding of gene 4 proteins to ATP-agarose. Two representatives of the altered gene 4 proteins, gp4-E157A and gp4-D207A, were compared with wild-type (WT) protein for their ability to bind to ATP-agarose. The phosphocellulose fraction containing gene 4 protein (lane 1) was applied to an ATP-agarose affinity column, and the flow-through fraction (lane 2) and elution fraction (lane 3) were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a marker of gene 4 protein (M). Elution from the ATP-agarose column was accomplished by the addition of a buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. Proteins on gels were visualized by either Coomassie staining (A) or Western blot by using polyclonal antibody against gene 4 protein (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of the altered behavior of these proteins on phosphocellulose and ATP-agarose, it was necessary to design an alternative purification procedure. Basically, chromatography on ATP-agarose resins was replaced by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, a purification step that has been used previously (18Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with the ability of gp4-E210A and gp4-E240A to support T7Δ4 growth, these two proteins behaved identically to wild-type gene 4 protein on both phosphocellulose and ATP-agarose, and hence these two proteins were purified following the normal procedure for wild-type protein. The purity of all of the gene 4 proteins, regardless of the purification procedure, was greater than 90% as measured by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue.Biochemical AssaysCatalytic Activity of Primase—The single amino acid substitution introduced into the TOPRIM region of primase domain could potentially affect its catalytic function. In the template-directed de novo synthesis of primers, a zinc motif in T7 primase first recognizes a specific sequence (5′-GTC-3′) on the ssDNA template. Subsequently, the catalytic RNA polymerase domain polymerizes nucleotide cognate to the template. T7 primase is also able to extend a preformed ribonucleotide annealed to the primase recognition sequence in a template-dependent manner. In addition to template-directed synthesis, the catalytic center can also catalyze the synthesis of random diribonucleotides in the absence of template. We have examined these three catalytic activities of the altered gene 4 proteins and compared them to the activities of the wild-type gene 4 protein.In the first assay shown in Fig. 3A, a short ssDNA template (5′-GGGTCAAA-3′) containing the primase recognition site was incubated with various amounts of gene 4 protein in the presence of ATP and [α-32P]CTP. Reaction products were analyzed on a sequencing gel, and the amount of oligoribonucleotides synthesized was determined by measuring radioactivity incorporated into the major product, pppACCC. The results showed that both gp4-E210A and gp4-E240A catalyzed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides as efficiently as the wild-type gene 4 protein, whereas none of the other altered proteins were able to catalyze the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides.Fig. 3Catalytic activity of gene 4 primase. A, template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis. Increasing amounts (40, 80, 160, and 320 nm) of wild-type (WT) and altered gene 4 proteins were incubated with ATP and [α-32P]CTP in the presence of template DNA 5′-GGGTCAAA-3′ for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were analyzed on 25% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The major product, 5′-pppACCC-3′, is indicated to the left of the gel. B, template-directed oligoribonucleotide extension. Reactions similar to the one described in A were carried out except that the diribonucleotide 5′-AC-3′ replaced ATP. The concentration of 5′-AC-3′ was varied from 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 to 0.8 mm. The reaction products, 5′-ACC-3′ and 5′-ACCC-3′, are shown to the left of the gel. C, template-independent diribonucleotide synthesis. Gene 4 proteins were incubated with [α-32P]CTP in the absence of template for 1 h at 37 °C, and the resulting products were dephosphorylated and separated on 25% denaturing polyacrylamide. The reaction product, 5′-CC-3′, is shown to the left of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

The technology is based on the ability of small membrane-active alcohols to dissociate the highly stable homotetrameric potassium channel KcsA. It is shown via a proteomics approach, using diagonal electrophoresis and nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, that a large number of both integral and peripheral Escherichia coli inner membrane proteins are part of stable oligomeric complexes that can be dissociated by small alcohols.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). This abundance signifies the importance of membrane proteins for cellular function. For several classes of these proteins it is known that they function as oligomeric complexes. Examples are solute channels (2.Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and protein translocators (3.Driessen A.J. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although extensive networks have been established of interaction partners of water-soluble proteins in for example Escherichia coli (4.Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J. Emili A. Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) and yeast (5.Gavin A. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J. Michon A. Cruciat C. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rud I.T.

Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar), very little is known about the interaction partners of membrane proteins or of the stability of the complexes that are formed in membranes. This lack of insight is largely the result of the difficulties in handling membrane proteins and the lack of suitable tools to study them. The bacterial potassium channel protein KcsA is a well studied example of a protein that functions as a stable oligomeric complex. It is a small homotetrameric protein of known structure (6.Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar) that is representative of many related channel proteins (2.Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7.Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 8.Miller C. Genome Biol. 2000. 2000; Google Scholar, 9.Koprowski P. Kubalski A. BioEssays. 2001; 12: 1148-1158Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When KcsA-containing membranes are treated with SDS, the protein retains its tetrameric form, even at elevated temperatures (2.Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Very recently it was discovered that small alcohols like trifluoroethanol (TFE) 1The abbreviations used are: TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; HFIP, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol; LC, nano-flow liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PTS, phosphotransferase system. can dissociate the KcsA tetramer into monomers in a manner that is dependent on both the concentration and the type of alcohol (10.van den Brink-van der Laan E. Chupin V. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5937-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11.van den Brink-van der Laan E. Chupin V. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4240-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that small alcohols may be used as a generic tool to detect and characterize stable oligomeric membrane protein complexes. Here we explored this possibility for proteins in E. coli inner membranes. For this we developed a new proteomics approach using diagonal SDS-based electrophoresis. In this approach non-heated protein samples are first separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in gel exposure to the alcohol and subsequent electrophoresis in a second dimension. All proteins or protein complexes that are not affected by the alcohol are expected to migrate on the diagonal of the gel, whereas protein complexes that are stable in room temperature SDS but are dissociated by the alcohol will migrate off the diagonal. Off-diagonal spots are then digested by trypsin and identified by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using this method we observed many off-diagonal spots that contained membrane proteins, either integral with one or more transmembrane segments or peripheral with a membrane-interactive domain. We thus readily identified a subproteome consisting of membrane proteins that are part of very stable homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes. The method is expected to be applicable to a variety of membrane preparations of different cells or organelles because it does not require labeling of the proteins with specific tags, as used in other studies to detect interaction partners of proteins (4.Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J. Emili A. Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The method is complementary to traditional two-dimensional electrophoresis methods of blue-native PAGE in combination with SDS-PAGE (12.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar), which allows detection of protein complexes that are not stable in SDS. Materials—Electrophoresis setups and electrophoresis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Other sources of materials were: Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen Benelux N.V.), N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace Inc.), TFE (Merck), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (Acros Organics), Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), Bocillin FL (Invitrogen), enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and bovine trypsin, sequencing grade (Roche Diagnostics). SecA antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. Hans de Cock. The pHK2414 plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Martine Nguyen-Distèche. Isolation of Membrane Vesicles and Purification of KcsA—Crude E. coli BL21(DE3) membrane vesicles from cells overexpressing KcsA were prepared as described previously (13.van Dalen A. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Membranes of HMS174 cells overexpressing penicillin-binding protein 1B from the pHK2414 plasmid were obtained similarly. Vesicles were either resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for use in the two-dimensional gel-system or used for KcsA purification according to Ref. 14.van Dalen A. Hegger S. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. Resuspended membrane vesicles were stored at -20 °C. Purified KcsA was stored at 4 °C in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Purified inner membrane vesicles from late-exponential BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were prepared as described previously (15.De Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and lysed in a French press. Inner and outer membrane vesicles were separated via sucrose density centrifugation. The purified inner membrane vesicles were stored at -80 °C. Fluorescence Detection of Penicillin-binding Protein 1b—A crude preparation of membrane vesicles from HMS174 cells expressing PBP-1b was labeled with 10 μm Bocillin FL for 30 min at 35 °C. Vesicles were subsequently dissolved in SDS gel-loading buffer (12 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 14 mm dithiothreitol and 0.02% bromphenol blue) and kept at room temperature, heated in sample buffer for 5 min, or incubated with 20% TFE for 1 h. The samples were then run on regular one-dimensional 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis the gels were rinsed with water. The labeled proteins were visualized by scanning the gels on a Typhoon 9400 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 526 nm. Immunodetection of SecA—Preparations of inner membrane vesicles were solubilized in SDS gel-loading buffer and kept at room temperature, heated in sample buffer for 5 min, or incubated with 25% TFE for 1 h. These samples were run on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. SecA was detected by a specific antibody and by the use of the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. SDS-PAGE in the First Dimension—The membranes were solubilized at room temperature in SDS gel-loading buffer, and the samples were run in electrophoresis buffer in two different setups. A Bio-Rad mini-Protean II setup was used for gels for either purified KcsA or a crude E. coli inner membrane preparation. These samples were run on a lane of a regular 0.75-mm thick 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 7.2 × 8.2 cm at a voltage of 180 V. Purified E. coli inverted inner membrane vesicles were run on a Bio-Rad Protean II setup on a 0.75-mm thick 11% gel of 16 × 18 cm at a current of 30 mA. In Gel TFE Exposure and SDS-PAGE in the Second Dimension—Lanes of either 5.5 × 1 cm or 15 × 2 cm were excised from the first dimension gels and run on a Bio-Rad mini-Protean III or -Protean II setup, respectively. To dissociate membrane protein complexes the excised gel strips were incubated for 1 h in electrophoresis buffer containing the indicated percentage (v/v) of TFE or HFIP at room temperature. After incubation the gel strips were washed twice for 5 min with water and twice with electrophoresis buffer to reduce the amount of TFE, which interferes with electrophoresis. The gels for the second dimension consisted of a 5 × 8.2-cm separating gel with a 0.8 × 8.2-cm stacking gel on top for use in the Bio-Rad mini-Protean III setup or a 15 × 18-cm separating gel with a 1.2 × 18-cm stacking gel on top for the Bio-Rad Protean II system. Room was left on top of the gels to fit in the TFE-treated gel strips. An overlay of isopropanol was used during polymerization of the stacking gel, as this gave a smoother surface than a watery overlay. After polymerization the isopropanol was decanted, and the surface of the stacking gel was rinsed with water to remove traces of isopropanol. The gel strips were placed on top of the second dimension gels. Empty regions between the excised gel strips and the glass plates were filled with 0.3% agarose in electrophoresis buffer. The gels were run at the same voltage or current as the first dimension gels. Gels were stained using either Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 or silver staining. In Gel Tryptic Digestion of Off-diagonal Spots—Off-diagonal protein spots were excised and in gel digested with trypsin with a protocol slightly modified from the one described by Wilm et al. (16.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel pieces were destained using 50% (v/v) methanol followed by reduction (6.5 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) and alkylation (54 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). Subsequently, the gel pieces were washed and dehydrated using 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, respectively. Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C by adding trypsin at a concentration of 10 ng/μl. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of acetic acid. LC-MS/MS—LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by coupling an Agilent 1100 Series LC system (vacuum degasser, auto sampler, and one high-pressure mixing binary pump without static mixer) to a LCQ™ Classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) basically as described by Meiring et al. (17.Meiring H.D. van der Heeft E. ten Hove G.J. de Jong A. P. J.M. J. Sep. Sci. 2002; 25: 557-568Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptide mixtures were delivered to a trap column (Aqua™ C18RP (Phenomenex); 15 mm × 100 μm, packed in-house) at 5 μl/min 100% eluent A (0.1 m acetic acid). After reducing the flow to ∼150 nl/min by using a splitter, the peptides were transferred to the analytical column (PepMap C18 (LC Packings); 15 cm × 75 μm, packed in-house) with a linear gradient from 0 to 50% eluent B (0.1 m acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile) for 60 min. The column eluent was sprayed directly into the electrospray ionization source of the mass spectrometer via a butt-connected nano-electrospray ionization emitter (New Objectives). The LCQ operated in positive ion mode, and peptides were fragmented in data-dependent mode. One mass spectrometry survey scan was followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans. Identification of MS/MS Spectra by Data Base Searches—The SEQUEST algorithm (18.Eng J.K. Mccormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar) was used to interpret the obtained MS/MS spectra. The SEQUEST algorithm was run against the complete non-redundant proteome data base in the FASTA format of E. coli from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The algorithm was set to use trypsin as enzyme, allowing at maximum for two missed cleavages and assuming carbamidomethyl as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine as a variable modification. The program DTAselect (19.Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) was used to select the peptide identifications and to assemble the peptides into proteins. The following selection criteria were used to filter the peptide identifications: the minimum Xcorr was set at 1.9, 2.2, and 3.75 for 1+, 2+, and 3+ peptides, respectively, and the ΔCn was 0.1 or higher for each peptide. The principle of the proteomics approach presented is shown in Fig. 1 for purified KcsA. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) confirms that KcsA migrates as a stable tetramer (2.Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which is dissociated into monomers by incubation with 25% TFE (v/v). In the absence of TFE only a minor band of the monomer is observed. When the sample is run on a two-dimensional gel under identical conditions in both dimensions and in the absence of TFE, the major spot of the tetramer and the minor spot of the monomer are expected to lie on the diagonal of the gel, as is indeed observed (Fig. 1B). However, when after running the gel in the first dimension, the gel strip is exposed for 1 h to 25% TFE, the tetramer dissociates and migrates off-diagonally on the monomer position in the second dimension (Fig. 1C). The same behavior of KcsA is observed for a crude E. coli membrane preparation obtained from cells overexpressing KcsA (Fig. 2). A prominent KcsA spot that runs off-diagonal at its monomer position shows up in addition to a heavily stained diagonal corresponding to E. coli proteins that are not affected by TFE. Interestingly, some other spots at higher molecular weight also run off-diagonally, indicating that besides KcsA several other E. coli proteins also form stable complexes in SDS that are dissociated by the alcohol. To better visualize these off-diagonal proteins, purified inner membrane vesicles obtained from wild-type E. coli cells were applied to larger gels. A representative gel, stained with Coomassie, is shown in Fig. 3A. An intensely stained diagonal is observed as well as a number of off-diagonal spots. The stain above the diagonal is most likely the result of smearing. This interpretation is supported by the observation that analysis of such an off-diagonal spot that corresponded to an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa was found to contain protein with molecular masses ranging from 20 to 55 kDa (not shown). Furthermore, when such a gel was silver-stained the smearing was even more obvious (Fig. 3B). The spots under the diagonal were excised and in gel digested with trypsin, after which the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In this way 58 proteins could be identified (Table I). The large majority (39 proteins) consisted of proteins that are known to be present in or are associated with the inner membrane. Five outer membrane proteins were found that most likely originate from the remnants of outer membranes known to be present in these preparations (15.De Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The remaining proteins were four ribosomal proteins, possibly originating from ribosomes that are attached to the membrane, and 10 proteins of unknown location.Fig. 2TFE-induced dissociation of protein complexes in a crude E. coli inner membrane preparation of cells overexpressing KcsA, as shown on SDS-PAGE. The directions of migration in the first and second dimension are indicated.

Open table in a new tab From an analysis of the monomeric molecular weights of the proteins that we identified and from the apparent molecular weight of the corresponding protein complex on the diagonal, several homo-oligomeric protein complexes could be identified. For instance, the penicillin-binding protein 1b that is encoded by the mrcB gene (Fig. 3A, spot 1) undergoes an apparent molecular mass shift from ∼200 to 100 kDa, suggesting that in room temperature SDS the protein is at least partially present as a dimer that becomes dissociated by TFE. This is indeed the case as shown by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis of E. coli inner membranes obtained from cells overexpressing PBP-1b that are solubilized in cold SDS and stained with a fluorescent penicillin analogue (Fig. 4). Clearly, two bands are visible with molecular weights corresponding to the dimer and monomer (Fig. 4, lane 2). In the absence of the plasmid carrying the PBP-1b gene no staining is observed (Fig. 4, lane 1). When the SDS-solubilized sample is either heated (Fig. 4, lane 3) or treated with 20% (v/v) TFE (Fig. 4, lane 4) the dimer band vanishes, and only a monomeric band remains. Next to homo-oligomeric integral membrane proteins we identified homo-oligomers of proteins that do not contain transmembrane helices but that are more peripherally bound to the membrane. For instance, we identified the SecA protein in an off-diagonal spot (Fig. 3, spot 2). The off-diagonal position of SecA on the two-dimensional gel corresponds to a TFE-induced dimer-monomer transition. We verified this using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, identifying the SecA protein with a SecA antibody (Fig. 5). In wild-type E. coli inner membranes dissolved in cold SDS, two spots are visible in Fig. 5, lane 1, one corresponding to the monomer (molecular mass of 100 kDa) and one to the dimer (molecular mass of 200 kDa). The band at 200 kDa ran at exactly the same position as a chemically linked dimer (data not shown). Either heating the solution (Fig. 5, lane 2) or incubation of the sample with 25% TFE (Fig. 5, lane 3), results in disappearance of the dimeric band fully consistent with an interpretation for the two-dimensional experiment that some SecA protein is present as a dimer that becomes dissociated by TFE. The implication from the one-dimensional gel experiment on SecA in Fig. 5 is that in the two-dimensional gel experiment of Fig. 2 next to the off-diagonal SecA spot, SecA should be present as monomer on the diagonal. We could confirm this with immunoblotting (data not shown). In this study we concentrated only on protein spots that were visible after staining with Coomassie. However, some gel pieces outside the Coomassie-stained regions were found to contain additional membrane proteins (data not shown). Moreover, most spots were found to contain several different proteins. How can we explain this? The most likely interpretation is that only a selected number of proteins are detected by Coomassie blue staining, whereas a much larger number of proteins can be detected by mass spectrometry. This would imply that the proteins that we detect in the spots are a significant underestimation of the total number of proteins that are stable in SDS but become dissociated by TFE. In four cases (CydA, GlpD, SucB, and TolC) the protein was detected in two spots that were well separated in the first dimension, suggesting that these proteins were present in a larger complex that was dissociated by SDS in different hetero- or homo-oligomeric complexes. Finally, it should be noted that some proteins were also detected in neighboring spots, suggesting some smearing as is clearly visible on the silver stained gel (Fig. 3B). This smearing occurred mostly in the second dimension as we also observed for KcsA (e.g. Fig. 2). This would imply that the molecular weights of some of the proteins, as determined from this second dimension, may be somewhat overestimated. It should be noted that all off-diagonal spots we identified are caused by the treatment with TFE. In a control experiment in which the gel strip that was excised after electrophoresis in the first dimension was incubated in alcohol-free buffer, no Coomassie-stained spots below the diagonal spot were observed. Moreover, when five spots that corresponded in position to those of the Coomassie-stained spots in Fig. 3 were analyzed by LC-MS/MS none of them was found to contain a protein. By varying the concentration of the alcohol, it was possible to gain insight into the stability of membrane protein complexes by analyzing their resistance against alcohol-induced dissociation. Thus, differences in stability were investigated by monitoring the off-diagonal appearance as a function of the alcohol concentration of selected proteins for which it was established they were solely or dominantly present in particular spots. As shown in Fig. 6, dissociation of KcsA occurs at 15% TFE. Less TFE is needed to dissociate the complex containing ManX, a non-membrane-spanning inner membrane protein of the PTS family, and more TFE is needed to dissociate the complex containing YibN, a single membrane-spanning protein of unknown function. Fig. 6 also shows that dissociation of E. coli inner membrane proteins is not a specific effect of TFE but that it can also be induced by the alcohol HFIP with similar protein specificity but with much higher efficiency. Although the search for protein interaction partners has received much attention recently and although extensive interaction networks have been established for water-soluble proteins (4.Butland G.

https://openalex.org/W2154862332,"The DMC1 protein, a eukaryotic homologue of RecA that shares significant amino acid identity with RAD51, exhibits two oligomeric DNA binding forms, an octameric ring and a helical filament. In the crystal structure of the octameric ring form, the DMC1 N-terminal domain (1–81 amino acid residues) was highly flexible, with multiple conformations. On the other hand, the N-terminal domain of Rad51 makes specific interactions with the neighboring ATPase domain in the helical filament structure. To gain insights into the functional role of the N-terminal domain of DMC1, we prepared a deletion mutant, DMC1-(82–340), that lacks the N-terminal 81 amino acid residues from the human DMC1 protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that, whereas full-length DMC1 forms a octamer, DMC1-(82–340) is a heptamer. Furthermore, DNA binding experiments showed that DMC1-(82–340) was completely defective in both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA binding activities. Therefore, the N-terminal domain of DMC1 is required for the formation of the octamer, which may support the proper DNA binding activity of the DMC1 protein.

Recombination is the exchange or transfer of information between DNA molecules, and it occurs in all organisms. During meiosis, homologous recombination takes place as part of the normal meiotic process in order to generate genetic diversity. Through homologous recombination in meiosis, the genes from each parent recombine at frequencies 100- to 1000-fold higher than those of vegetative cells, leading to different genomic signatures (1.Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8167-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2.Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In meiotic homologous recombination, double-stranded breaks are introduced by the Spo11 protein, and 3′-single-stranded tails are produced at the double-stranded break sites (3.Keeney S. Giroux C.N.

Then, the homologous pairing proteins, such as Rad51 and Dmc1, and their activators are recruited to the single-stranded tails. The Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins are eukaryotic homologues of the bacterial RecA protein that promotes homologous pairing between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Dmc1 is a meiosis-specific factor, whereas Rad51 is required for both meiotic and mitotic homologous recombination (6.Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N.

Despite these similarities, Rad51 and Dmc1 require different factors to promote homologous pairing efficiently. Factors such as Rad52, Rad54, and BRCA2 mediate the homologous pairing and strand exchange reaction promoted by Rad51 (17.Sung P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a Dmc1-specific mediator, the Sae3-Mei5 complex, has been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and may promote the assembly of Dmc1 on the double-stranded break site (21.Tsubouchi S.

The S. cerevisiae and human RAD51 proteins bind DNA as helical nucleoprotein filaments (24.Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H.

In contrast, the human DMC1 protein assumes an octameric ring structure, which forms a complex composed of stacked rings on DNA (26.Masson J.Y. Davies A.A. Hajibagheri N. Van Dyck E. Benson F.E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Masson J.Y. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Recently, electron micrographs of the human DMC1 protein showed that DMC1 forms a helical filament on ssDNA (15.Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike RAD51, DMC1 exhibits two oligomeric DNA binding forms: an octameric ring and a helical filament. The crystal structures of the RecA superfamily members, such as bacterial RecA, archaeal RadA, and eukaryotic Rad51 and Dmc1, revealed that whereas their monomeric topologies are highly conserved, their oligomeric states differ from protein to protein. The Escherichia coli RecA (28.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae Rad51 (29.Conway A.B. Lynch T.W. Zhang Y. Fortin G.S. Fung C.W. Symington L.S. Rice P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and Methanococcus voltae RadA (30.Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) proteins all formed helical filaments with six monomers/turn in their crystal structures, but their helical pitches were different. The Pyrococcus furiosus Rad51 protein, which functions as a helical filament, formed a heptameric ring (31.Shin D.S. Pellegrini L. Daniels D.S. Yelent B. Craig L. Bates D. Yu D.S. Shivji M.K. Hitomi C. Arvai A.S. Volkmann N. Tsuruta H. Blundell T.L. Venkitaraman A.R. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4566-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the DMC1 protein revealed a highly symmetrical octameric ring (14.Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka T. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These structures suggest a dynamic oligomeric property of the RecA superfamily in which these proteins interconvert between rings and helical filaments. Rad51 and Dmc1 are composed of two domains: the highly conserved ATPase domain, which makes up the core oligomeric structure, and the N-terminal domain, which is not conserved in the bacterial RecA protein. The ATPase domain is important for DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis and hence is also a core catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain of the human RAD51 protein physically contacts both ssDNA and dsDNA, as determined in previous NMR titration experiments and mutational analyses (32.Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 290: 495-504Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of Rad51 specifically interacts with the neighboring ATPase domain in the helical filament structure (29.Conway A.B. Lynch T.W. Zhang Y. Fortin G.S. Fung C.W. Symington L.S. Rice P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30.Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By contrast, the N-terminal domain of DMC1 did not stably associate with the ATPase domain of the neighboring subunit in the octameric ring, and its functional role is unknown. In the present study, a DMC1 mutant that lacks the N-terminal domain, DMC1-(82–340), was purified. Biochemical analyses revealed that the N-terminal domain of DMC1 is important for the DMC1 octamer formation and DNA binding. On the basis of these results, the functional role of the N-terminal domain of DMC1 is discussed. Protein Purification—The full-length DMC1 protein was purified as described previously (14.Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka T. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The DMC1-(82–340) gene was inserted into the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen), and the protein was overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon Plus (Stratagene) as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein. DMC1-(82–340) was purified from a 10-liter Luria-Bertani culture incubated at 30 °C. When the A600 of the culture was 0.4–0.6, the protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested after an overnight incubation and were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science)) on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was gently mixed by the batch method with 4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h. The protein-bound beads were packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 30 column volumes of buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The DMC1-(82–340) protein was eluted in a 20-column volume linear gradient of 5–300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The peak fractions, which predominantly contained DMC1-(82–340), were collected, and thrombin protease (5 units/mg of DMC1-(82–340); Amersham Biosciences) was added to cleave off the His tag. The thrombin-containing fractions were immediately dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). The protein, which now lacked the His tag, was subjected to chromatography on a 4-ml Heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient of 0.2-1.2 m KCl in buffer B. The DMC1-(82–340) protein was eluted in a sharp peak at ∼0.5 m KCl. The protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. Crystallization of DMC1-(82–340)—DMC1-(82–340) crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 20 °C. The hanging drop was formed by adding 1 μl of DMC1-(82–340) (concentrated to 8 mg/ml) to 1 μl of the reservoir solution (1.4 m sodium formate). Crystals typically appeared after 3 days and reached the maximum size (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm) after 1 week. For data collection, the DMC1-(82–340) crystals were harvested in a reservoir solution containing 5 m sodium formate and were flash frozen in a stream of N2 gas (100 K). The data set of the crystal was collected at the SPring-8 BL44B2 beamline (Harima, Japan). Assay for DNA Binding—All reaction mixtures contained final buffer concentrations of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 μm creatine phosphokinase. The indicated amounts of DMC1 were incubated with 1 μm SAT-1 ssDNA (5′-ATTTCATGCTAGACAGAAGAATTCTCAGTAACTTCTTTGTGCTGTGTGTGTA-3′) for 6 min at 37 °C. The DMC1-ssDNA complexes were then fixed with 0.04% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. The complexes were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2.5 h and were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Products and reactants were visualized using a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. For the dsDNA binding assay, 10 μm ΦX174 DNA, linearized with PstI, was incubated with the indicated amounts of DMC1 for 5 min at 37 °C. The complexes were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2.5 h and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. Assay for D-loop Formation—The reactions were started by incubating the indicated amounts of DMC1 with 1 μm SAT-1 ssDNA for 5 min. Afterward, the supercoiled pGsat4 (3,218 bp) DNA (final concentration of 30 μm) was added along with MgCl2 (final concentration of 10 mm). After the reaction mixtures were further incubated for 10 min, 1 μl of 5% SDS followed by 1 μl of 6 mg/ml proteinase K was added, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min. The products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2.5 h and were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-I centrifuge. Full-length DMC1 and DMC1-(82–340) (both 0.5 mg/ml) were spun in a Beckman An-60Ti rotor with a 6-sector centerpiece. The protein was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Equilibrium distributions were analyzed after 18 h of centrifugation at 9,000 rpm and 20 °C. For the molecular weight analysis, a partial specific volume of 0.675 cm3/g and a solution density of 1.05 g/cm3 were used. CD Measurement—CD spectra of the DMC1-(82–340) protein at a 4-μm concentration were recorded on a JASCO J-820 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd). All CD experiments were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) and 50 mm KCl. Flexible Nature of the DMC1 N-terminal Domain—The DMC1 protein consists of two distinct domains, the N-terminal and ATPase domains (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the electron density map calculated in our previous x-ray structural analysis of the full-length DMC1 protein (14.Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka T. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in this figure, the electron density of the ATPase domain of Dmc1 (amino acid residues 83–340) was clearly observed. In contrast, the electron density of the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1–82) was not detected. The absence of the electron density was not the result of protein degradation, as confirmed by the SDS-PAGE analysis of the dissolved DMC1 crystal (Fig. 1C). Therefore, these observations suggest that the N-terminal domain of DMC1 exhibits high flexibility or multiple conformations. Construction and Purification of DMC1-(82–340)—To gain insights into the functional role of the N-terminal domain of DMC1, we constructed a deletion mutant, DMC1-(82–340), which lacks the N-terminal 81 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). The DMC1-(82–340) mutant was overexpressed in E. coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein and was purified by chromatography on a Ni-chelated-agarose column. The hexahistidine tag was removed with thrombin protease and was further purified by Heparin-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 2A). Initial crystallization screens of DMC1-(82–340) yielded cubic-shaped microcrystals of ∼20 μm in length (Fig. 2B). These DMC1-(82–340) crystals were single crystals, and their x-ray diffraction limit was ∼8 Å at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility. Further attempts to extend the diffraction limit by improving the size and quality of the crystals and by testing different cryoprotectants were unsuccessful. However, the fact that DMC1-(82–340) crystallized suggests that DMC1-(82–340) could be structurally stable and uniform. DMC1-(82–340) Forms a Heptamer in Solution—To determine the oligomerization state of DMC1-(82–340) in solution, we performed an analytical ultracentrifugation experiment. As we previously reported, full-length DMC1 formed octamers (molecular mass of 304,411 daltons) in solution (14.Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka T. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the molecular mass of DMC1-(82–340) was 199,678 daltons, which corresponds exactly to a heptamer and not an octamer (Fig. 3B). The P. furiosus Rad51 protein formed a heptameric ring structure in its crystal (31.Shin D.S. Pellegrini L. Daniels D.S. Yelent B. Craig L. Bates D. Yu D.S. Shivji M.K. Hitomi C. Arvai A.S. Volkmann N. Tsuruta H. Blundell T.L. Venkitaraman A.R. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4566-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and a heptameric ring structure of human DMC1 was observed by electron microscopy (27.Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Masson J.Y. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10684-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the heptamers of Dmc1-(82–340) may be a ring structure identical or similar to those observed previously. We then tested the thermal stability of DMC1-(82–340) to further characterize the heptameric oligomerization. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the mutant were monitored in the range of 20 to 95 °C. As shown in Fig. 3C, the ellipticities of DMC1-(82–340) and the full-length protein were unchanged up to 70 °C and increased thereafter. This result shows that the thermal stability of the DMC1-(82–340) heptamer is similar to that of the full-length DMC1 octamer. DMC1-(82–340) Is Defective in DNA Binding and Homologous Pairing—We tested whether the N-terminal domain of DMC1 has a role in DNA binding, because the RAD51 N-terminal domain is known to directly bind to DNA (32.Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 290: 495-504Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To do so, we performed a gel mobility shift assay with DMC1-(82–340). A 50-mer ssDNA and linearized ϕX174 phage dsDNA were used as substrates in the DNA binding assays. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, full-length DMC1 efficiently bound to both ssDNA and dsDNA. However, DMC1-(82–340) was completely defective in both ssDNA and dsDNA binding (Fig. 4, A and B). The DMC1-(82–340) mutant was also defective in homologous pairing between a 50-mer ssDNA and a homologous superhelical dsDNA, probably because of its defective DNA binding (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the N-terminal domain of DMC1 plays an essential role in DNA binding as well as in octamer formation. Recent structural studies of Dmc1 and Rad51 have begun to uncover the dynamic oligomeric properties of these proteins. Rad51 binds to DNA as helical filaments. The crystal structures of the S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein and the M. voltae RadA protein, an archaeal Rad51, revealed that the N-terminal domain of Rad51 specifically interacts with the ATPase domain of the neighboring subunit in the helical filament (29.Conway A.B. Lynch T.W. Zhang Y. Fortin G.S. Fung C.W. Symington L.S. Rice P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30.Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These structural studies suggested that the N-terminal domain of Rad51 plays an important role in the filament formation. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of the DMC1 octameric ring was not visible in the crystal structure, suggesting that it is flexible or has multiple conformations in the octameric ring structure (14.Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka T. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, this study). In the present study, however, we found that DMC1-(82–340) formed a heptamer, and not an octamer, indicating that the N-terminal domain is still essential for the DMC1 octameric ring formation, despite its flexible nature. Therefore, the N-terminal domain may have essential roles in the quaternary structure formation by the Rad51 and DMC1 proteins. Interestingly, it has been reported that DMC1 forms helical nucleoprotein filaments in addition to the stacked octameric rings on ssDNA (15.Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Masson J.Y. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10684-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the human RAD51 and DMC1 N-terminal domains are highly conserved. Therefore, an interaction similar to that observed between the N-terminal domain and the ATPase domain in the Rad51 filament may take place between the corresponding domains in the DMC1 helical filaments. We hypothesize that the N-terminal domain of DMC1 functions in the conversion from ring to filament and propose a model, as shown in Fig. 5. In the model, the conversion may be caused by ATP binding. In the DMC1 octameric ring structure, the ATP-binding site is located at the monomer-monomer interface, and the subsequent binding of ATP is likely to induce conformational changes at the interface. An ATP-driven change in the quaternary structure has been observed in several proteins, including RecA (33.VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Galkin V.E. Huang H. Rajan S.S. Anderson W.F. Stohl E.A. Seifert H.S. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2003; 11: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), T7 gene 4 protein (34.Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and SV40 T antigen (35.Li D. Zhao R. Lllyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This change may facilitate the formation of a DMC1 helical filament. Consequently, the N-terminal domain of DMC1 may actively interact with the ATPase domain of another DMC1 molecule and stabilize the helical filament form. This conversion from ring to filament may take place on DNA, because both oligomeric states of DMC1 have been observed to bind DNA. If the DMC1 helical filament is an active form for its strand-exchange activity (15.Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), then the DMC1 octameric ring may be a resting DNA binding form that is waiting for the initiation signal for homologous recombination on the double-stranded break site. Interestingly, a comparison between the crystal structures of the human DMC1 protein and the S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein suggests that the Tyr-194 residue of DMC1 is located at the monomer-monomer interface in both the octameric ring form and the helical-filament model. In the crystal structure of the DMC1 octameric ring, the Tyr-194 residue in the ATPase domain forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu-258 residue in the neighboring ATPase domain. On the other hand, in the crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae Rad51 filament, Tyr-253 (corresponding to the Tyr-194 residue of DMC1) in the ATPase domain hydrophobically interacts with the Tyr-112 residue in the neighboring N-terminal domain (29.Conway A.B. Lynch T.W. Zhang Y. Fortin G.S. Fung C.W. Symington L.S. Rice P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the DMC1 helical filament, the Tyr-194 residue is a potential candidate that directly interacts with the neighboring N-terminal domain, like the Tyr-253 residue of the S. cerevisiae Rad51 filament. In the present study, we also found that DMC1-(82–340) was completely defective in both ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities. A possible explanation for these observations is that the N-terminal domain plays a direct role in DNA binding, like RAD51 (32.Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 290: 495-504Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the heptameric form caused by the truncation of the N-terminal domain of DMC1 is inactive in DNA binding. In the octameric ring, the amino acid residues essential for DNA binding were located near the central channel, which is large enough to accommodate a duplex DNA (Fig. 6A). By contrast, the heptamer model (Fig. 6B) suggests that the central channel is too narrow to accommodate a duplex DNA. Dmc1 and Rad51 are known to co-exist in meiotic cells, and the disruption of either gene leads to defects in meiotic recombination (6.Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 7.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Hence, Dmc1 and Rad51 are likely to have distinct roles. We speculate that the Dmc1-specific functions are dependent on the octameric ring form of Dmc1, because this form is only found with Dmc1. The octameric ring form may play a role in Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing. The octameric ring form may also be essential for the recognition by Dmc1-interacting factors, such as the Mei5-Sae3 complex and the Tid1/Rdh54 protein, which were shown to specifically interact with Dmc1, but not with Rad51 (15.Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Tsubouchi S. Roeder G.S.

Cell. 2004; 119: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the functional role of the octameric ring form are required to clarify the function of Dmc1 in meiotic recombination. We thank R. Enomoto and A.
