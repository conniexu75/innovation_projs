https://openalex.org/W2027682935,"One of the earliest studies of the relationship between race and culture which comprehensively presents known facts rather than implications of superiority and inferiority. The first edition of the book appeared in 1911, and went through several printings before Boas revised it, as he said, to take into account of the findings of research carried on since the book was initially written. His conclusions, were that ...there is no fundamental difference in the ways of thinking of primitive and civilized man. A close connection between race and personality has never been established. The concept of racial type as commonly used even in scientific literature is misleading and requires a logical as well as biological definition."

Sediments deposited in the backwaters of large floods may accumulate thick sequences in tributary mouths. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic studies of these sequences combined with radiocarbon dating have established a 10,000-year paleoflood record for the lower Pecos and Devils rivers in southwestern Texas. This technique is rapid and relatively inexpensive and can be used where historical records are short or entirely absent."

By controlling for variables that are potentially correlated with both reproductive success and unit size, this experiment establishes that helpers-contribute significantly to their indirect fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2033562154,Sediments held at constant temperature evolve heat at rates that can be measured by direct calorimetry. The heat production rates decrease with depth from the surface layer. Total heat flux is an indication of the rate of degradation of potential chemical energy originally fixed by photosynthesis and represents benthic energy flow.

https://openalex.org/W1999560607,"Dismantling of the 24-year-old Shippingport atomic power station over the next two years will test whether the nuclear industry can safely dispose of high-level radioactive facilities. Recent findings that some components will remain radioactive longer than anticipated may require dismantling instead of the permanent entombment the industry was planning. The five-year dismantlement will cost $40 million and generate 11,700 cubic meters of radioactive waste. Larger reactors will be even more costly. Current regulations require utilities to choose between dismantlement, safe storage, or entombment of contaminated materials. Each has its problems, but the industry objects to an evolving policy for dismantling and an accompanying requirement for a segregated decommissioning fund that would be set aside before a reactor begins operating or during plant lifetime. The latter would require an adequate insurance mechanism to cover premature shutdown. (DCK)"

https://openalex.org/W2058418420,"Photography of the nucleus of comet Halley is the goal of several planned space missions. The nucleus of a comet is surrounded by a cloud of dust particles. If this cloud is optically thick, it will prevent observation of the nuclear surface. Broadband photometry of nine comets has been analyzed to determine the visibility of their nuclei. Only in the case of comet West near perihelion was the dust dense enough to interfere with imaging. Comparison of the visual brightness of the well-observed comets with that of Halley in 1910 leads to the conclusion that the nucleus of Halley can be imaged without significant obscuration by the dust."
