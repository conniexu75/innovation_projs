https://openalex.org/W2017445070,"Morphologically normal plants were regenerated from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia cells transformed with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain containing a tumor-inducing plasmid with a chimeric gene for kanamycin resistance. The presence of the chimeric gene in regenerated plants was demonstrated by Southern hybridization analysis, and its expression in plant tissues was confirmed by the ability of leaf segments to form callus on media containing kanamycin at concentrations that were normally inhibitory. Progeny derived from several transformed plants inherited the foreign gene in a Mendelian manner."
https://openalex.org/W2046486608,"Lignin-derived phenols dominate the cupric oxide oxidation products of dissolved humic substances from river and lake waters. The relative distributions of these phenols suggest the presence of intact, though oxidized, lignin, which is indicative of the locally dominant vascular plant vegetation. Recognizable lignin is present mostly in humic acid as opposed to fulvic acid fractions. This lignin component represents a source-specific and process-dependent tracer that can uniquely characterize dissolved organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W1982328362,"An important question in developmental neurobiology is how a neuron finds its way over long distances to its correct target during embryogenesis. Peripheral pioneer neurons in insect embryos have been used for study because of the relative simplicity of the early embryonic appendages, and the accessibility of the identified neurons whose growth cones traverse this terrain. The data presented suggest an adhesive hierarchy of both epithelial and neuronal surfaces that guides the first growth cones from the appendages of the grasshopper embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2081689196,"Seismometer operation for 21 days at Tranquillity Base revealed, among strong signals produced by the Apollo 11 lunar module descent stage, a small proportion of probable natural seismic signals. The latter are long-duration, emergent oscillations which lack the discrete phases and coherence of earthquake signals. From similarity with the impact signal of the Apollo 12 ascent stage, they are thought to be produced by meteoroid impacts or shallow moonquakes. This signal character may imply transmission with high Q and intense wave scattering, conditions which are mutually exclusive on earth. Natural background noise is very much smaller than on earth, and lunar tectonism may be very low."
https://openalex.org/W2083971473,"The (87)Rb-(87)Sr internal isochrons for five rocks yield an age of 3.65 +/-0.05 x 10(9) years which presumably dates the formation of the Sea of Tranquillity. Potassium-argon ages are consistent with this result. The soil has a model age of 4.5 x10(9) years, which is best regarded as the time of initial differentiation of the lunar crust. A peculiar rock fragment from the soil gave a model age of 4.44 x 10(9) years. Relative abundances of alkalis do not suggest differential volatilization. The irradiation history of lunar rocks is inferred from isotopic measurements of gadolinium, vanadium, and cosmogenic rare gases. Spallation xenon spectra exhibit a high and variable (131)Xe/(126)Xe ratio. No evidence for (129)I was found. The isotopic composition of solar-wind xenon is distinct from that of the atmosphere and of the average for carbonaceous chondrites, but the krypton composition appears similar to average carbonaceous chondrite krypton."
https://openalex.org/W2080709739,"Lunar soil and type C breccias are enriched 3-to 100-fold in Ir, Au, Zn, Cd, Ag, Br, Bi, and Tl, relative to type A, B rocks. Smaller enrichments were found for Co, Cu, Ga, Pd, Rb, and Cs. The solar wind at present intensity can account for only 3 percent of this enrichment; an upper limit to the average proton flux during the last 4.5 x 109 years thus is 8 x 10(9) cm(-2) yr(-1). The remaining enrichment seems to be due to a 1.5 to 2 percent admixture of carbonaceous-chondritelike material, corresponding to an average influx rate of meteoritic and cometary matter of 2.9 x 10(-9) g cm(-2) yr(-1) at Tranquility Base. This is about one-quarter the terrestrial rate. Type A, B rocks are depleted 10-to 100-fold in Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, In, Tl, and Bi, relative to terrestrial basalts. This suggests loss by high-temperature volatilization, before or after accretion of the moon. Positron activities due mainly to (22)Na and (26)Al range from 90 to 220 beta(+) min(-1) kg(-1) in five small rocks or fragments (9 to 29 g). The higher activities presumably indicate surface locations. Th and U contents generally agree with those found by the preliminary examination team."
https://openalex.org/W2074007642,"Seven crystalline rock samples returned by Apollo 11 have been analyzed in detail by means of the (40)Ar-(-39)Ar dating technique. The extent of radiogenic argon loss in these samples ranges from 7 percent to >/= 48 percent. Potassium-argon ages, corrected for the effects of this loss, cluster relatively closely around the value of 3.7 x 10(9) years. Most of the vulcanism associated with the formation of the Mare Tranquillitatis presumably occurred around 3.7 x 10(9) years ago. A major cause of the escape of gas from lunar rock is probably the impact event which ejected the rock from its place of origin to its place of discovery. Upper limits for the times at which these impact events occurred have been estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2091872975,"The delta (18)O of minerals from lunar gabbros and basalts are: plgioclases +6.06 to +6.33), pyroxenes (+5.70 to +5.95), and ilmenites (+3.85 to +4.12). The uniformity of these results indicates isotopic equilibrium in the mineral assemblages. Estimated plagioclase-ilmenite temperautres range from 1150 degrees C to 1340 degrees C. The bulk (18)/ (16)O and (30)Si/ (28)Si ratios of these lunar rocks are identical with ratios of terrestrial basalts, but the lunar glass, breccia, and dust are slightly enriched in the heavier isotopes. The lunar hydrogen (formed from solar wind) has a delta D/H of less than-873 per mil and the value may be even lower, as it is probably contaminated with terrestrial hydrogen. The delta (13)C of lunar dust and breccia is unusually high relative to reduced carbon in meteorites or on earth."
https://openalex.org/W2042456679,"The regolith at Tranquillity Base is a layer of fragmental debris that ranges in thickness from about 3 to 6 meters. The thickness of the regolith and the exposure histories of its constituent fragments can be related, by means of a relatively simple model, to the observed crater distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2040923176,"Concentrations of U, Th, and Pb in Apollo 11 samples studied are low (U. 0.16 to 0.87; Th, 0.53 to 3.4; Pb, 0.29 to 1.7, in ppm) but the extremely radiogenic lead in samples allows radiometric dating. The fine dust and the breccia have a concordant age of 4.66 billion years on the basis of (207)Pb/(206)Pb, (206)Pb/(238)U, (207)Pb/(235U), and(208)Pb/(232)Th ratios. This age is comparable with the age of meteorites and with the age generally accepted for the earth. Six crystalline and vesicular samples are distinctly younger than the dust and breccia. The (238)U/(235)U ratio is the same as that in earth rocks, and (234)U is in radioactive equilibrium with parent (238)U."
https://openalex.org/W2025611910,The variation in trace element abundance patterns indicates that lunar igneous rocks are the product of extensive igneous fractionation. Variations in the Sr(87)/ Sr(86) ratio indicate that these rocks crystallized 3.5+/-0.3 x 10(9) years ago.

Non-CO(2) carbon is 22 to 100 ppm, delta(13)C = -6.4 to -23.2 per mil. Lunar dust is 810 ppm H(2)O (D = 80 ppm) and 188 ppm total carbon(delta(13)C = -17.6 per mil). The (18)O analyses of whole rocks range from 5.8 to 6.2 per mil.

https://openalex.org/W2041194719,"Results for multielement analysis of lunar soil and of seven rocks returned by Apollo 11 are presented. Sixty-six elements were determined with spark source mass spectrography and neutron activation. U. S. Geological Survey standard W-1 was used as a comparative standard. Results indicate an apparent uniformity of composition among the samples. Comparison with solar, meteoritic, and terrestrial abundances reveals depletion of volatile elements and enrichment of the rare earths titanium, zirconium, yttrium, and hafnium. Although there is an overall similarity of the lunar material to basaltic achondrites and basalts, the differences suggest detailed geochemical processes special to the history of this material."

https://openalex.org/W2058908746,"Concentrations of potassium, rubidium, strontium, barium, and rareearth elements have been determined by mass spectrometric isotope dilution for eight Apollo 11 lunar samples and for some separated phases. Potassiumn and ritbidium are at chondritic levels, strontium at 15 times, and barium and rare earths at 30 to 100 times chondritic levels. There are trace element similarities between the lunar samples and basaltic achondrites, terrestrial dredge basalts and the bulk earth. The trace element data appear to be consistent with these lunar samples being the result of limited partial fusion of some material similar to the brecciated eucrite meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W1969492161,"After successful acquisition in August of reflected ruby laser pulses from the Apollo 11 laser ranging retro-reflector (LRRR) with the telescopes at the Lick and McDonald observatories, repeated measurements of the round-trip travel time of light have been made from the McDonald Observatory in September with an equivalent range precision of +/-2.5 meters. These acquisition period observations demonstrated the performance of the LRRR through lunar night and during sunlit conditions on the moon. Instrumentation activated at the McDonald Observatory in October has yielded a precision of +/-0.3 meter, and improvement to +/-0.15 meter is expected shortly. Continued monitoring of the changes in the earth-moon distance as measured by the round-trip travel time of light from suitably distributed earth stations is expected to contribute to our knowledge of the earth-moon system."
https://openalex.org/W2067378998,"Samples of igneous ""gabbro,"" ""basalt,"" and lunar regolith have compositions fundamentally different from all meteorites and terrestrial basalts. The lunar rocks are anhydrous and without ferric iron. Amounts of titanium as high as 7 weight percent suggest either extreme fractionation of lunar rocks or an unexpected solar abundance of titanium. The differences in compositions of the known, more ""primitive"" rocks in the planetary system indicate the complexities inherent in defining the solar abundances of elements and the initial compositions of the earth and moon."

The delta(18)O values are: plagioclase, 6.20; clinopyroxene, 5.75; ilmenite, 4.45 (parts per thousand relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water). The isotopic distribution corresponds to equilibrium at 1120 degrees C. The isotopic composition of lunar pyroxenes falls within the range for pyroxenes of terrestrial mafic and ultramafic rocks, ordinary chondrites, enstatite chondrites, and enstatite achondrites, but above the range for basaltic achondrites, hypersthene achondrites, and mesosiderites.

https://openalex.org/W1995184410,"The lead isotopic compositions and uranium, thorium, and lead concentrations have been measured on six samples of material from the Sea of Tranquillity. The leads are moderately to very radiogenic; the initial lead concentrations are very low; the uranium and thorium levels are 0.26 to 0.88 and 0.87 to 3.35 parts per million, respectively. The Th/U ratios cluster about a 3.6 value. Apparent ages calculated for four rocks are 4.1 to 4.2 x 10(9) years. Dust and breccia yield apparent ages of 4.60 to 4.63 x 10(9) years. The uranium-lead ages are concordant, or nearly so, in all cases. The lunar surface is an ancient region with an extended record of events in the early history of the solar system. discrepancy between the rock ages and dust ages poses a fundamental qusestion about rock genesis on the moon."

Concentrations of 0.6 to 13 parts mercury, 0.2 to 0.8 part uranium, 1 to 17 parts lithium, and 1 to 800 parts osmium per million and 0.5 to 1 percent chromium oxide by weight have been measured. In contrast to meteorites and terrestrial rocks a large mercury release below 110°C is observed. Some implications of these results are presented. Fluorapatite, quartz, tridymite, fayalite, and iron-rich, manganese-poor pyroxmangite, previously unreported, have been identified. The small amount of fluorapatite found does not account for the fluorine contents."
https://openalex.org/W1998464213,"Analytical data for 42 major and trace elements were mostly obtained by a combination of instrumental and radiochemical neutron activation analyses using both thermal and 14-million-electronvolt neutrons. Excesses of nitrogen and chlorine in the fines, compared with the rocks, are attributed to the solar wind. A striking similarity for contents of seven elements in lunar metal and metal from the calcium-rich achondrite Juvinas was noted. Fractional dissolution was used to separate five radionuclides produced by cosmic-ray bombardment in the fines and rock 57-40. Results for argon-39 from the reaction potassium-39 (n,p), and for argon-37, from the reaction calcium-40 (n,a), seem to require a neutron spectrum conitaining more neutrons below 2 million electronvolts than the evaporation spectrum or that given by Arnold, Honda, and Lal (1) or a strong time dependence for the neutron flux."
