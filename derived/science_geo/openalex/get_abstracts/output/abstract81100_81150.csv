https://openalex.org/W1970780458,"Fab fragments of rabbit anti-embryonal carcinoma cells IgG dramatically perturb cell-cell interactions between embryonal carcinoma cells and between early mouse embryo blastomeres. These antibodies prevent compaction of preimplantation embryos (or trigger their decompaction) and have similar effects on embryonal carcinoma cells. They probably act through the masking of specific molecules (Fab targets) involved in the mechanisms of recognition between cells during compaction. Fab target molecules have been extracted from embryonal carcinoma cell membranes and purified using their property to inhibit the effects mediated by anti-embryonal carcinoma Fab. The solubilization of the Fab targets could be achieved using both detergent extraction and trypsin treatment of membranes. In the latter case, a glycoprotein of 84,000 daltons could be purified which has all the properties expected from the Fab target and accounts for most of the Fab-inhibiting activity of embryonal carcinoma cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2037491928,"Transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is caused by a single viral gene, src, which encodes a phosphoprotein, pp60src, with the enzymatic activity of a protein kinase. The relative abundance of a 36,000 molecular weight (36K) phosphorylated polypeptide which can be detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis of 32P-labeled phosphoproteins is greatly increased in RSV-transformed fibroblasts. We have reported previously that phosphorylation of the 36K polypeptide is an early event in the process of transformation and that protein synthesis is not required for its appearance. Here we identify a nonphosphorylated 36K polypeptide, present in both uninfected and transformed cells, which is homologous to the 36K phosphoprotein as judged by limited proteolysis and by tryptic peptide mapping. We conclude that the 36K phosphoprotein is generated by phosphorylation of this 36K polypeptide. It has recently been shown that pp60src phosphorylates tyrosine residues in vitro: phosphotyrosine and also phosphoserine are present in the 36K phosphoprotein isolated from RSV-transformed cells. On the basis of these results we propose that the 36K polypeptide present in chicken fibroblasts is a substrate for the protein kinase activity of pp60src. Phosphorylation of this polypeptide may be important in cellular transformation by Rous sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W2004408045,"Culture conditions can be manipulated to vary the rate at which keratinocytes (stratified squamous epithelial cells) become committed to differentiate terminally. When deprived of anchorage in semisolid medium, normal human keratinocytes irreversibly lose the ability to reinitiate growth in surface culture with a t1/2 of 3 hr and then proceed to form cornified envelopes. We examined six established lines from human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) for defects in this function. One SCC line which grew progressively in semi-solid medium could not be induced to form cornified envelopes. The other five lines, which grew abortively, at best, in semisolid medium, formed envelopes under this condition but at subnormal rates. During anchorage deprivation the SCC lines became committed to differentiate much more slowly than normal, with t1/2's of 24--144 hr. SCC cells therefore possess at least a partial defect in the triggering of terminal differentiation. In vivo, such an alteration may permit malignant behavior by evading an important tissue-specific mechanism for limiting growth. In culture, the phenotype of increased survival in semi-solid medium may be used to detect and select malignantly transformed keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1563928419,"A procedure for the preparation of monospecific antibody directed against rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-45-a is described. This antibody, together with monospecific antibodies to cytochromes P-450b and P-450c, has been used to show that these three forms of cytochrome P-450 are distinct and share no common antigenic determinants. These antibodies (a) give single immunoprecipitin bands with detergent-solubilized microsomes; (b) do not cross-react with the purified heterologous antigens in Ouchterlony double diffusion analyses; (c) have no effect on catalytic activity of the heterologous antigens but completely inhibit the enzymatic activity of the homologous antigens; and (d) remove only the homologous antigen from detergent-solubilized microsomes when covalently bound to a solid support. With radial immunodiffusion assay, we have quantitated these three forms of cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes after treatment of rats with seven different inducers of cytochrome P-450. The levels of these cytochrome P-450 isozymes vary independently and are also regulated by the age and sex of the animal. The antibodies have also been used to assess the contribution of cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c in the metabolism of xenobiotics by rat liver microsomes. A large proportion of benzo(a)pyrene metabolism and testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylation in microsomes from untreated rats is not catalyzed by cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c. Epoxide hydrolase, another microsomal enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, was also quantitated by radial immunodiffusion after prior treatment of rats with microsomal enzyme inducers. The inductions of epoxide hydrolase varies independently of the induction of cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c."

https://openalex.org/W1518444464,"Ferrous bleomycin is known to break DNA efficiently in vitro in the presence of O2, giving rise to ologonucleotides, bases, and compounds resembling malondialdehyde in their chromogenic reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid. Chromatography of radiolabeled DNA reaction mixtures resolves three kinds of malondialdehyde-like products, related by sequential conversions. The first chromogenic product is linked to DNA, and its formation does not entail the release of a base. It decomposes readily to the second product, a compound containing the base and deoxyribose carons 1'-3'. Hydrolysis of either product yields the third, which is indistinguishable from authentic malondialdehyde. These findings suggest that the oxygen-dependent cleavage of DNA by Fe(II) x bleomycin can begin with the rupture of the deoxyribose 3'-4'-carbon bond. The initiation of these events is concurrent with the initiation of another mode of DNA degradation, involving the release of free base alone, in a yield similar to that of chromogen."

https://openalex.org/W1985508726,"Cytochemical staining of demyelinated peripheral axons revealed two types of axon membrane organization, one of which suggests that the demyelinated axolemma acquires a high density of sodium channels. Ferric ion-ferrocyanide stain was confined to a restricted region of axon membrane at the beginning of a demyelinated segment or was distributed throughout the demyelinated segment of axon. The latter pattern represents one possible morphological correlate of continuous conduction through a demyelinated segment and suggests a reorganization of the axolemma after demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1479954783,"A general method for the detection and characterization of an mRNA using an oligodeoxynucleotide probe is described. The results presented indicate that a G-dT or a dG-U base pair within a short DNA-RNA hybrid does not significantly reduce the stability of the hybrid. On this basis, we propose that 11 amino acids, including Trp and Met, can be used in selecting a peptide sequence suitable for use in designing an oligodeoxynucleotide probe complementary to a given mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we have synthesized an oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo II) complementary to the region of gastrin mRNA coding for Trp-Met-Asp-Phe and have compared its effectiveness as a hybridization probe and as a primer for the synthesis of gastrin-specific cDNA with another oligonucleotide (oligo I) complementary to the region of gastrin mRNA coding for Trp-Met-Glu-Glu. Unlike oligo I, oligo II functions as a primer in specific cDNA synthesis only when the mRNA is denatured prior to initiation of synthesis. Similarly, oligo II can be used as a specific hybridization probe for gastrin mRNA only when the RNA is denatured and partially cleaved with NaOH before hybridization. A simple procedure for denaturing gastrin mRNA to ensure efficient interaction with oligodeoxynucleotide probes is described. This procedure should be useful in studies with other oligonucleotides and mRNAs as well."

https://openalex.org/W1508861647,"A general method for the selective retrieval of surface labeled plasma membrane components had been devised. The basis of the technique is the covalent attachment of compounds containing 2-iminobiotin, the cyclic guanidino analog of biotin, onto the cell surface proteins and the use of immobilized avidin to recover the labeled components uncontaminated by other cytosolic and membrane components. The pH-dependent interaction of 2-iminobiotin with avidin makes recovery possible. At high pH the free base form of 2-iminobiotin retains the high affinity specific binding to avidin characteristic of biotin, whereas at acidic pH values, the salt form of the analog interacts poorly with avidin. Model studies on the interaction of 2-iminobiotinylated proteins with avidin-Sepharose 4B show that for tight binding to the affinity matrix, the pH of the column must be 9.5 or higher, that a single 2-iminobiotin group is sufficient for binding, and that proteins with different extents of labeling behave similarly when the low pH buffer is applied. When intact human erythrocytes were sequentially labeled with periodate and 2-iminobiotin hydrazide and the Triton X-100-solubilized plasma membrane proteins were subjected to affinity isolation, the major sialoglycoproteins, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) 1, PAS 2, and PAS 3, plus two proteins with apparent molecular weights higher than band 3 were retrieved. The recovery of these proteins is not due to a nonspecific adsorption to the affinity matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2103026185,We have determined the nucleotide sequence of two short introns (respectively 215 and 90 nucleotides) in the chick alpha 2-collagen (type I) gene as well as parts of the adjacent exons. For one of these introns we find that the 5' end of U1 RNA is complementary not only to the two ends of the intron but also to one end of the intron and sequences inside this intron. These complementarities predict three potential internal splicing sites. By S1 mapping experiments we find three discrete RNA precursors in which different portions of this intron have been deleted. The sizes of the deleted segments are in good agreement with the location of the predicted splicing points inside the intron. The DNA sequence indicates that removal of one portion of the intron should still allow the subsequent elimination of the rest of the intron and the correct splicing of the coding segments located at each end of the intron. The new introns created by the first splicing events contain sequences at each end which are also complementary to U1 RNA. Our data indicate that in the intron which we have examined the sequences at the 3' end of the intron are removed before those at the 5' end.

https://openalex.org/W1600512748,"Liver poly(A) RNA, isolated from adrenalectomized rats after insulin treatment, was translated in a nuclease-treated lysate of rabbit reticulocytes and quantitated for both total activity and the capacity to synthesize the insulin-inducible enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase. Analysis of the translated products from poly(A) RNA isolated 1 h after insulin treatment showed a 2.7-fold increase in activity of tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA. During the same interval, the capacity of poly(A) RNA to direct the synthesis of total protein in lysates also changed, showing a 30 to 40% increase in translational activity/unit of RNA. Increased translatability was apparent in all fractions of poly(A) RNA separated by centrifugation on sucrose gradients. Insulin thus appears to mediate a generalized change in mRNAs leading to increased capacity for translation; induction of tyrosine aminotransferase may reflect sensitivity to effect of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1705130164,"The mechanism of isoproterenol and N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) induction of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) was investigated in the C6 rat glioma cell line. [3H]Leucine-labeled lactate dehydrogenase in noninduced and induced cells was quantitatively immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat lactate dehydrogenase-5 antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for 3H-labeled lactate dehydrogenase by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and isoelectrofocusing. Using this technique, it was shown that isoproterenol + 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dibutyryl cAMP cause an increase of the [3H]leucine incorporation into glioma cell lactate dehydrogenase. Analysis of the kinetics of induction and deinduction revealed no change in the rate of degradation of lactate dehydrogenase in the presence and absence of inducing agent, indicating that the induction was due to an increase in the rate of synthesis of the enzyme. The increased rate of synthesis was prevented by actinomycin D. Isoproterenol + 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine increased only the specific rate of synthesis of lactate dehydrogenase-5 isozyme and of the M subunit. The mechanism was further studied by assaying the level of functional mRNA coding for lactate dehydrogenase in a reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesizing system using glioma cell poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from either isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP-induced cells. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated translation product by isoelectrofocusing revealed that isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP produced an approximately 8-fold stimulation of the poly(A) + RNA-directed synthesis of the lactate dehydrogenase M subunit. These data demonstrate that isoproterenol and dibutyryl cAMP control the level of functionally active lactate dehydrogenase mRNA in glioma cells which, in turn, determines the extent of synthesis of the lactate dehydrogenase M subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2032272882,"The observation of thick chromatin fibers in interbands of Dipteran polytene chromosomes suggests that there should be 5 to 10 times more mass and DNA in interbands than is commonly thought to be present. To resolve this paradox, the chromatin content of interbands was estimated, using whole-mounted polytene chromosomes from Drosophila melanogaster. Densitometry of high voltage electron microscopic negatives provides an estimate of less than 4:1 for the average ratio of cross-sectional dry mass (or mass per unit chromosome length) of bands relative to interbands. This ratio, combined with an estimate of the length of chromosome composed of interbands, indicates that at least 26% of chromosome mass is contributed by interband chromatin. Since DNA comprises a similar proportion of chromatin mass in bands and interbands (Laird et al., 1980b), these data imply that DNA sequences in interbands represent at least 26% of the euchromatic genome of D. melanogaster. This result calls for reinterpretation of some of the genetic and molecular data from Diptera. The discrepancy between this higher estimate of interband mass and DNA, and previous estimates of 3–5%, is discussed. One possibility is that previous measurements were made on prominent interbands, which are proposed here to be in regions that are delayed in DNA replication. Such interbands would be reduced in polyteny and DNA content compared with the average interband region. The concept of local variations in polyteny is also used here to explain major differences in the cross-sectional mass of bands. This leads to a revised model of polytene chromosomes in which at least three levels of polyteny, rather than one or two levels, can be present within one euchromatic region."

ATPase activity of membranes prepared from the induced lambda-unc lysogen was 6-fold greater than the activity of membranes prepared from strains lacking the unc-transducing phage, confirming the report of Kanazawa et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 1126-1130). The F1F0-ATPase complex was purified in comparable yield from either enriched membranes or control membranes using a modification of the procedure reported by Foster and Fillingame ((1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8230-8236). EAch of the eight subunits that had been reported as components of the F1F0 complex from wild type E. coli was overproduced in the lambda-unc lysogen. All eight subunits co-purified in the same stoichiometric proportion as in the complex purified from wild type E. coli. We conclude that all eight subunits are likely coded by the small segment of chromosomal DNA carried by the lambda-transducing phage. These experiments provide the first evidence that all eight polypeptides are authentic subunits of the ATPase complex rather than contaminants that fortuitously co-purify."
https://openalex.org/W1565733046,"The distance between the two protease binding sites in human plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin has been estimated using singlet-singlet energy transfer experiments. alpha-Chymotrypsin was labeled covalently with donor (dansyl chloride) or acceptor (fluorescein isothiocyanate) groups, and the efficiency of transfer between these dyes was measured within the alpha 2-macroglobulin . (alpha-chymotrypsin)2 complex. The distance between the surface exterior of the protease molecules was calculated to be 4 to 11 A, depending on the assumption made about the equivalence of the binding sites. A catalytically active dimer of alpha-chymotrypsin was prepared using the heterobifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. In contrast with the alpha-chymotrypsin monomer, it binds to alpha 2-macroglobulin with a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the 1:1 alpha 2-macroglobulin . dimeric alpha-chymotrypsin complex is still able to bind 1 mol of the alpha-chymotrypsin monomer. Energy transfer experiments performed with this ternary complex showed that the distance between the alpha 2-macroglobulin-bound alpha-chymotrypsin molecules is not higher than 4 A, i.e. the two protease binding sites in alpha 2-macroglobulin should be about 44 A apart (center to center) if the anhydrous radius of alpha-chymotrypsin is 20 A."

Antibodies from the several clones tested were found to produce linear Scatchard plots, as predicted for homogeneous antibodies, and to possess high affinities for the immunogen (KA congruent to 10(9) M-1). None of the monoclonal antibodies tested reacted with either fragment (1-55) or fragment (132-153) of sperm whale myoglobin. Competitive binding assays using human and horse myoglobins suggested that several of these monoclonal antibodies, which can readily distinguish these myoglobins, recognize different antigenic determinants on the myoglobin molecule. Studies using additional myoglobin sequence variants as competitors should be able to more closely define these antigenic determinants."

https://openalex.org/W1565731712,"Transcription of DNA from the RNA genome of retroviruses by reverse transcriptase involves an unusual translocation of the growing chain from the 5' end to the 3' end of the RNA template. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which this translocation occurs, we have used chain termination to analyze nascent viral DNA synthesized in vitro by avian sarcoma virus, and we have determined the nucleotide sequence of appropriate regions of viral DNA isolated from infected cells and cloned into prokaryotic vectors. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a previously proposed model in which a short terminal redundancy in viral RNA, and a DNA copy of the redundant sequence, are used to allow the growing DNA chain to move from the 5' to the 3' end of the template. Transcription of avian sarcoma virus RNA with purified reverse transcriptase also generates an anomalous product, a hairpin DNA that arises when the initial DNA transcript folds back on itself to continue synthesis. The foldback is mediated by an inverted repeat of 5 nucleotides in the sequence of nascent DNA. Anomalous hairpin DNA is not produced by detergent-activated virions. Thus, constituents of the virions or the configuration of encapsidated viral RNA must facilitate correct transcription."

Results obtained with monovalent fragments indicate that the monoclonal antibody inhibits activity by interfering with the direct interaction between beta-NGF and the cell membrane receptor rather than by precipitating the dimeric form of beta-NGF. This monoclonal antibody binds to an antigenic determinant common to mouse beta-NGF, snake venom (Naja naja) beta-NGF, and human beta-NGF.

https://openalex.org/W1584368229,"Polyadenylated RNA prepared from neonatal rat muscle was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. Two sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, the Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and calsequestrin, were isolated from the translation mixture by immunoprecipitation, followed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The [35S]methionine-labeled translation products were characterized by molecular weight, peptide mapping, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The ATPase synthesized in the cell-free system was found to have the same molecular weight (Mr = 100,000) and [35S]-methionine-labeled peptide map as the mature ATPase. The methionine residue present at the NH2 terminus of the mature ATPase was donated by initiator methionyl-tRNArMet and it became acetylated during translation. These results suggest that the ATPase was synthesized without an NH2-terminal signal sequence. Calsequestrin (Mr - 63,000) was synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor (Mr = 66,000) that contained an additional [35S]methionine-labeled peptide when compared to mature calsequestrin. The NH2-terminal sequence of the precursor was different from the mature protein. The precursor was processed to a polypeptide with a molecular weight identical with mature calsequestrin when microsomal membranes prepared from canine pancreas were included during translation. These results show that calsequestrin is synthesized with an NH2-terminal signal sequence that is removed during translation. These data add to the evidence that the ATPase and calsequestrin follow distinctly different biosynthetic pathways, even though, ultimately, they are both located in the same membrane."

The antigen was extracted with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 from cells metabolically labeled with L-[3H]fucose or D-[3H]glucosamine. A double antibody affinity column was used to purify the membrane glycoprotein. Goat anti-mouse IgM was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. The absorption of the monoclonal antibody contained in ascites fluid completed the affinity column. Appropriate controls of similar material from other cell types and another monoclonal antibody demonstrated the specificity of the affinity column. Glycopeptides from the surface of human neuroblastoma cells, IMR-5 and CHP-134, had antigenic activity, as radioactive pronase-digested material bound to the affinity column and inhibited complement-mediated cytolysis. Glycolipids extracted from the cells had no antigenic activity. It was concluded that the carbohydrate residues of the glycoprotein conferred the antigenic specificity. Three methods were devised to aid in detection and purification of the antigen. These were: 1) an assay for the detection of complement-mediated cytolysis by measuring the enzyme creatine phosphokinase in the nonlysed target cells; 2) precipitation of the antigen . antibody complex with 4% polyethylene glycol; and 3) removal of the antibody by a wheat germ agglutinin-agarose column."

https://openalex.org/W2090130798,"When mRNA for avian retroviral envolope glycoprotein (env) was injected into cells transformed by env-deficient Bryan Rous sarcoma virus, the env deficiency of the injected cells was complemented to allow the release of transforming virus for up to 40 hr. When virus spread within the injected culture was allowed to occur, a second phase of transforming virus production by the injected culture began approximately 2 days following injection, continued for many days and often increased to titers well above those seen soon after injection. The requirement for virus spread, along with the genetic properties of virus released long after injection, supported the hypothesis that the second phase of virus production resulted when injected env mRNA was packaged into virus released by injected cells. When this virus infected other cells within the culture the env mRNA was reverse-transcribed to form a subgenomic, proviral-like molecule able to direct the synthesis of env mRNA. Accordingly, it was shown tht neither DNA nor full genomic viral RNA contaminating injected mRNA preparations could account for the results. Evidence that an mRNA can be reverse-transcribed into an active, proviral-like molecule may be of importance in the relationship between retroviruses and their hosts."

https://openalex.org/W1528399183,"the ability of the core isolated from Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to interact with specificity-determining subunits isolated from Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase has been determined by measuring the transcription of and genes of phage SP82. Two specificity-determining subunits were tested: the sigma subunit and a 28,000 dalton (28 K) peptide isolated from a modified polymerase produced at approximately 8 min after infection of B. subtilis with SP82. Earlier experiments (Spiegelman, G. B. and Whiteley, H. R. (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 81, 1058-1065) demonstrated that sigma and the 28K peptide are required for the recognition of early and middle gene promoters, respectively, by the B. subtilis core assembly. The present investigation showed that E. coli core interacted more efficiently with the B. subtilis sigma than with the 28K peptide, as judged by the rate of RNA synthesis. Early RNA was produced by the E. coli and B. subtilis holoenzymes and by E. coli core supplenented with B. subtilis sigma and only minor differences were found in comparisons of transcripts by hybridization and by electrophoretic analysis. Measurements of template specificity, the formation of stable enzyme . DNA complexes, and the hybridization of transcripts to fragments of SP82 DNA produced by digestion with restriction endonuclease Hha indicated that E. coli core supplemented with the 28K-supplemented E. coli core with those synthesized by the modified polymerase extracted from B. subtilis 8 min after infection with SP82 suggest that both preparations recognized the same initiation and termination sequences."

The cloned 6.2-kilobase pair (kbp) Eco RI fragment contains the adult beta-globin gene and a portion of the embryonic epsilon-globin gene. The technique of contact hybridization allows the rapid determination of DNA reiteration frequency or RNA abundance in a single experiment. The DNA sequence analysis reveals repeated sequence spanning about 1.5 kbp, located about 1 kbp to the 3'-side of the adult gene and immediately 5' of the embryonic gene. Examination of the in vivo RNA transcript by these methods reveals the presence of RNA homologous to both the adult beta-globin gene and to the repeated sequence region. In reticulocyte cytoplasm, these RNAs were of about equal abundance; in reticulocyte nuclei, adult globin RNA was found but the repeated sequence RNA was not detected. In erythrocyte cytoplasm, the abundance of the repeated sequence RNA was much greater than that of the globin RNA."

This unique phenomenon was due neither to the transformed status of this cell line nor to the characteristic nature of adipose tissue fibroblasts of C3H mice. When RNA of L-cells was translated in a nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate system, actin synthesized in vitro also appeared as only one species, beta-actin. Therefore, the genetic information for gamma-actin is absent at the level of translatable mRNA in L-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1534602239,"The mRNA for the androgen-dependent hepatic protein, alpha 2u-globulin is normally present in the liver of mature male rats to the extent of about 1% of the total mRNA population. alpha 2u mRNA which was found to migrate as a 14 S band was purified about 18-fold through preparative urea-agarose gel electrophoresis. 32P-Labeled cDNA synthesized with this partially purified alpha 2u mRNA was used as substrate for two restriction endonucleases Hha I and Hae III. Digestion of the cDNA with Hha I failed to reduce its electrophoretic heterogeneity. However, Hae III digestion of the cDNA preparation greatly reduced the molecular complexity and produced several distinct cDNA bands. One of these Hae III fragments (Band A) containing 410 nucleotide residues was extracted from polyacrylamide gel and found to be complementary to alpha 2u mRNA. The identity of this cDNA fragment was established by its ability to inhibit selectively the translation of alpha 2u mRNA in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system and by its hybridization kinetics with poly(A)+ hepatic RNA from animals with different rates of alpha 2u synthesis. The relative R0t 1/2 values showed a direct correlation between mRNA sequences complementary to the cDNA fragment (A) and to both translatable alpha 2u mRNA and hepatic level of alpha 2u-globulin in adult male, female, and maturing male rats. Thus, the cDNA fragment containing 410 nucleotide residues generated by the restriction cleavage with Hae III can be used as a convenient probe for identification and quantitation of alpha 2u mRNA under different physiological and experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1538035658,"An oligosaccharide-P-P-lipid has been isolated from porcine liver by extraction with organic solvents and purified by chromatography on silica gel and DEAE-cellulose. The purified oligosaccharide-lipid was shown to contain mannose and N-acetylglucosamine in an approximate ratio of 1:1 and our results suggest that the major oligosaccharide component in the preparation was a tetrasaccharide with the composition (Man)2 (GlcNAc)2. When the oligosaccharide-lipid was incubated with GDP-[14C]mannose and a solubilized enzyme preparation from rabbit liver in the presence of MgCl2, three radioactive products could be isolated. The oligosaccharides in the products could be identified as a penta-, a hexa-, and a heptasaccharide. These products were formed by the stepwise addition of mannose to the growing oligosaccharide chain and GDP-mannose was indicated as the glycosyl donor in each reaction."
https://openalex.org/W44180599,"Initiation of transcription of favored templates by Q beta replicase requires a much lower GTP concentration than does transcription of templates that are selected against. Although the enzyme requires a high GTP concentration to initiate transcription of Q beta RNA, the presence of the host factor substantially reduces the GTP concentration requirement. In addition, the Q beta replicase preparation must contain ribosomal protein S1 for initiation to occur at low GTP. Mn2+ ions, which can substitute for host factor in Q beta RNA replication in vitro, and which reduce the template specificity of Q beta replicase, also reduce the GTP requirement for initiation. But while Mn2+ ions produce this effect with all templates, host factor is specific for Q beta RNA. When both host factor and Mn2+ are present, transcription of Q beta RNA occurs at a much lower GTP concentration. Thus, host factor and Mn2+ appear to reduce the GTP concentration requirement by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1568367544,"The antineoplastic action of bleomycin is thought to involve the aerobic degradation of DNA by the Fe2+ . bleomycin complex. Different parts of the bleomycin molecule have been implicated in metal binding and DNA binding. To probe the structure of a metal-containing bleomycin, we studied the effects of the high spin Mn2+ ion in the Mn2+ . bleomycin complex on the longitudinal nuclear relaxation rates of various protons in the molecule. Complexation of Mn2+ to bleomycin was also studied by EPR, and a Scatchard plot of the EPR data revealed a single tight divalent cation-binding site per molecule. From the magnitudes of the paramagnetic effects of Mn2+ on the nuclear relaxation rates of several assigned resonances, we calculate the relative distances of the corresponding protons from the metal. Using a pyrimidine methyl to metal distance of 6.5 A, consistent with the metal coordination of this aromatic group of bleomycin established on the basis of other studies, we find from our data that the bithiazole and COOH-terminal portions of the molecule are located spatially very close to the metal. These groups have previously been implicated in DNA binding. Our metal to bithiazole proton distances (approximately 5.4 A) are consistent with bithiazole as a metal ligand, although possible involvement of interactions other than direct coordination in maintaining close proximity cannot be excluded. Our distance data also argue against the imidazole ring of beta-hydroxyhistidine as a ligand. The short distance between the metal- and DNA-binding sites indicated by our studies would help ensure that the reactive reduced oxygen radicals produced at the metal site during Fe2+ oxidation in the aerobic Fe2+ . bleomycin complex reach the substrate DNA before the destruction of these radicals can occur in other ways."
https://openalex.org/W1485526623,"Rat brain extracts contain two heat-stable, nondialyzable inhibitors of tubulinyl-tyrosine carboxypeptidase. One of the inhibitors was sensitive to ribonuclease and insensitive to trypsin and pronase, indicating that the inhibitor is RNA. This is supported by the observation that purified RNA from rat brain inhibited the enzyme activity to the same extent as similar amounts of the endogenous RNA. Similar results were obtained with calf liver RNA. The other inhibitor was purified by chromatography on a DEAE-Sephadex and identified as proteoglycan. The elimination of the protein moiety of the proteoglycan resulted in a small increase of its inhibitory activity. Glycosaminoglycan was released from the proteoglycan by beta elimination, indicating that the linkage between glycosaminoglycan and the protein moiety is through an O-glycosidic bond. The glycosaminoglycan contains uronic acid, hexosamine and sulfate in a molar ratio of 1:1.01:0.99, respectively. Treatment of the glycosaminoglycan with chondroitinase ABC completely abolished its inhibitory activity. Chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate B, chondroitin sulfate C, and the brain glycosaminoglycan inhibited tubulinyl-tyrosine carboxypeptidase to the same extent when used in comparable amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1563464765,"Megacin Cx is a bacteriocidal protein, previously described by Durner and Mach (Durner, K. (1970) Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 10, 93-102; Durner, K. (1970) Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 10, 373-382; Durner, K., and Mach, F. (1966) Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Parasitenkd. Infektionskr. Hyg. Abt. I Orig. 2, 120, 565-575), which is released into the medium during growth by Bacillus megaterium strain 337. We have optimized the culturing conditions to achieve reproducibly high yields of this protein; under these conditions, megacin Cx represents about one-half of the protein secreted into the medium. We have developed improved methods of purifying the protein to homogeneity. The active form of megacin Cx is a monomeric protein, a single polypeptide of Mr = 210,000, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Like many other proteins secreted by Gram-positive organisms, megacin Cx contains remarkably little methionine and cysteine. The purified protein blocks protein synthesis in sensitive cells, but has little immediate effect upon nucleic acid synthesis. Our purification procedure separates megacin Cx from another activity in the culture medium which blocks the synthesis of RNA and DNA, as well as synthesis of protein, in sensitive cells."
